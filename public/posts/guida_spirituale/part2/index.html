But the seed is not yet the flower. In essence it has the capacity of millions of flowers, but not in reality. Those flowers have to be actualized. The essential is that which you are born with, which is your very being.\nThat’s exactly the purpose, or should be the purpose, of education: to help you to seek and search your essential, to help you to grow it. The word “education” means to draw out; that which is in has to be brought out, just as you draw water from a well. But something has gone basically wrong: the whole educational system is doing just the opposite of it. Rather than drawing anything out of you it forces, imposes things upon you.\nThat which is imposed upon you is non-essential; it creates your personality. The essential is your individuality; the non-essential is your personality. In other words, the essential is your very soul, your being; the non-essential is your ego. All that helps the ego is non-essential; all that helps you\nto become egoless is essential. Ambition is non-essential, greed is non-essential; desire, any kind of desire, is non-essential.\nMeditativeness is essential. To be silent, to be still, just to be alert, aware: that is the first step, the door into the essential. And once you have found in deep, profound since what you are meant to be, you have found your destiny. And then life has a sense of direction not imposed by others but discovered by yourself.\nThe function of the Master is educative – not informative but educative, educative in the original sense of the word. He is not to give you a certain character because that will be imposed upon you. He is not to make you a Christian or Hindu or a Buddhist. Hc has to help you to know what you can be, because that which you can be you already are essence, in the potential.\nYou can be a Christ, you can be a Buddha, you can be a Krishna, but you cannot be a Christian. Christianity is something imposed from the outside. You cannot be a Hindu. Nobody is born a Hindu; it is nobody’s destiny to be a Hindu. It is the effort of others to lead you astray from your destiny. Nobody is born to be a communist or a fascist, but everybody is born with a certain direction in which hc will find fulfillment.\nMaybe you are a painter, but you are functioning in the society as a doctor. You will remain unfulfilled your whole life, because you listened to the parents and the society and the greed and the ambition. Everybody was saying, “be a doctor. It is a good profession, respectable, and you will be able to earn more money than if you become a painter. Who knows? A painter may not be able to earn money at all, because painting is not something which has any utilitarian purpose. And by being a painter you may remain a beggar. You may never become famous, because painters never become famous – only once in a while.”\nIf you are a musician, a poet, you cannot fulfill the ambitions of your parents, of your society, of all the well-wishers. But one thing is certain: you will be tremendously happy whether you are known or unknown, whether you are poor or rich. YOU will have a tremendous contentment because you are fulfilling something very fundamental at the deepest core of your being. Unless you start moving in the direction of your essential you remain miserable.\nBliss is a consequence, a by-product. Whenever the river starts moving towards the ocean there is bliss. And one never knows what is hidden in you. No astrologer can help you, no palmist can help you. Except with deep meditation you will never be able to feel what is possible for you.\nAs I see it, almost everybody is in the wrong place. The person who would have been a tremendously happy doctor is a painter and the person who would have been a tremendously happy painter is a doctor. Nobody seems to be in his right place; that’s why this whole society is in such a mess. The person is directed by others; he is not directed by his own intuition.\nMeditation helps you to grow your own intuitive faculty. It becomes very clear what is going to fulfill you, what is going to help you flower. And whatsoever it is – and it is going to be different for each individual... That is the meaning of the word “individual”: everybody is unique. And to seek and search your uniqueness is a great thrill, a great adventure.\nSamadhi, your question is significant in many more ways too, because it is not only a question of finding the essential in the individual. In life also we are burdened with the unessential, in religion too, in every dimension.\nThe religious person goes on doing certain rituals which are taught by others to him. He never finds his own religiousness, a quality which can not be imposed on you, a quality which can only be helped to grow in you. It is not like a plastic flower that can be given to you from the outside, by the priest. It is a real roseflower, and for that you have to be very alert, very aware.\nThe Christian goes to the church every Sunday. It is a formality; it does not make him religious, but it gives him a false sense of religiousness. The Hindu goes on chanting the Gita. It does not make him religious at all; on the contrary it prevents, because by reciting the Gita he becomes very knowledgeable. He becomes a parrot or a computer. He can recite the whole Gita, but he understands nothing because he has not experienced anything. He knows words; he has not encountered the meaning of those words. People go on being imitative.\nFor example, Mahavira lived naked; that was his individuality. Nobody else is supposed or expected to live naked, unless one finds it an inner, intuitive vision, unless one finds that that is the only way he can be true to his self. Then it is another matter. But the Jaina muni, the Jaina monk, practices nudity – just an imitation, a carbon copy. And remember. imitation is always ugly because it creates a false person; it never gives you authenticity.\nMahavira was naked not because anybody had told him to be naked. He felt the immense urge to be just like a child and he followed his urge, and he suffered for his urge. He was chased from one village to another, mad dogs were put after him, he was stoned, because people thought he was destroying their morality, that he was a dangerous man.\nIn an orthodox country like the India of twenty-five centuries ago, a man walking naked would have been certainly a nuisance to people, to their conventional way of living, to their traditional style of thinking. Krishna has not lived naked, Rama has not lived naked, no Hindu avatara has lived naked. This man is destroying the whole tradition, culture, religion. Of course he has to be punished.\nBut Mahavira was immensely blissful. The Jaina muni does not seem to be blissful at all because he is simply an imitation. He is really torturing himself, forcing himself to be naked, because in his mind now the greed has arisen: unless he looks like Mahavira he is not going to attain the ultimate liberation.\nNow nakedness has become an essential thing, which it is not. Nakedness is not an essential thing. Buddha attained without being naked, Jesus attained without being naked, you can attain. And I am not saying that Mahavira did not attain by being naked. He attained, but these are individual things.\nBuddhist monks go on following the Buddha. They sit the same way, they talk the same way, they behave the same way. That is not going to help at all. That is not going to make you religious. That is not going to make you another Buddha. You are being simply stupid. And the more stupid you are the better you can imitate, because imitation needs no intelligence. In fact, only a mediocre mind can be imitative. The more intelligent you are, the more you want to be simply yourself, whatsoever it is. Now the whole thing goes non-essential. For Buddha it was essential to sit that way; that was his intuitive feeling.\nWhen Buddha dropped the ideas imposed on him by others, his followers left him. He had five followers – before he became very famous he had only five followers; that is before he became enlightened. Those five followers were very devoted to him for the simple reason that he was going just like any other Hindu ascetic, only with great stubbornness, doing all kinds of austerities, following all kinds of rules and regulations given in the scriptures. He was so particular about everything that these five followers thought that he was the greatest Master.\nThen one day he understood the whole stupidity of it: he is not following his own intelligence, he is simply following others who may be right, may not be right. One thing is certain: that they were a different kind of people and he is not of that kind. He was suffering, but he was thinking that it is necessary to suffer this; this pain is necessary to grow.\nThe day he realized it he dropped all ascetic practices; he relaxed. That was the first time he ate in the night and he ate food offered by an untouchable woman. All five followers immediately left him, thinking that he had gone astray. First, eating in the night is not right; secondly, the food offered by an untouchable, a poor woman, is not acceptable to a holy man. He is no more holy.\nAnd that very night Buddha became enlightened. Those five fools missed his enlightenment. That very night he became enlightened. And he became enlightened for the simple reason that for the first time he relaxed into his being and simply followed his essential core.\nAll religions are destroyed by the non-essential. Your whole life is destroyed by the non-essential. But nobody else can decide for you what is essential and what is non-essential.\nRemember that, Samadhi. I cannot say exactly, “This is essential and this is non-essential.” Each individual has to discover it. Each individual has to be a light unto himself or herself.\nAll that I can suggest is: be silent so that you can hear the still small voice of your heart. And it is always speaking, but you are so noisy you go on missing its message.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO,\nTHE SHANKARACHARYA OF SHARDAPEETH, DWARKA, IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THAT YOUR IDEAS ABOUT SPIRITUALITY DO NOT CONFORM WITH THE SANATAN DHARMA WHICH GIVES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO SELF-CONTROL AND PRESCRIBES RULES OF CONDUCT GIVEN IN THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES. THE SHANKARACHARYA ALSO REMARKED THAT WHEREVER YOU AND YOUR ASHRAM WILL MOVE, IT WOULD SPOIL THE SPIRITUAL ENVIRONMENT OF THAT PLACE.\nOSHO, THIS IS PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SHANKARACHARYA HAS OPENLY CRITICISED YOU AND THE ASHRAM. WOULD YOU KINDLY SAY SOMETHING?\nSatya Vedant,\nTHE SHANKARACHARYA is right in a way: I do not conform with his ideas about spirituality. Why should I conform to anybody else’s ideas of spirituality at all? Spirituality is not an ideology, in fact. It has nothing to do with ideas. It is a state of no-mind. How it can be an ideology? The Shankaracharya has no experience of meditation at all, otherwise he would not have spoken this way.\nSpirituality simply means that you have gone beyond the mind, and in that transcendence all ideas are transcended – Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, communist – all ideas. Ideas as such are transcended. There is only silence, and two silences can never be different. They are like two zeros. What difference can there be?\nBuddha in his deep meditation is not different from Mahavira. Mahavira in his deep meditation is not different from Zarathustra. Zarathustra in his deep silence is not different from Lao Tzu. And I call THIS the Sanatan Dharma.\nThe word SANATAN means eternal, and DHARMA means Tao – the law, the ultimate law. Ais DHAMMO SANANTANO, Buddha repeats again and again: This is the eternal law of life. But by Sanatan Dharma the Shankaracharya means Hindu religion. Hindus think that their religion is the eternal religion; that is sheer nonsense.\nReligiousness is eternal, but no religion is eternal. Every religion is born and dies in its own time. No religion is beginningless and no religion is endless. Everything that is born in time is bound to die sooner or later, and it is good that it dies because it creates space for something new to arise. Sanatan Dharma – eternal religion – cannot be identified with any religion in particular.\nJainas believe that their religion is far older than the religion of the Hindus, and it may be far older because their first TEERTHANKARA, Adinath, is remembered in the Rig Veda, the first Hindu scripture, with great respect. That shows two things: that Adinath must have been already an established, accepted spiritual leader; he must have preceded the Rig Veda, and the Rig Veda is the ancientmost scripture of the Hindus. Jainas say their religion is far older, but older does not mean eternal.\nThousands of religions have existed on the earth and have died, and when they were alive they had millions of followers, but now they have completely disappeared. The followers have disappeared, the priests have disappeared, their gods have disappeared. When they were alive they also used to think they were eternal. But whatsoever happens in time always dies; nothing can be eternal in time.\nMy meaning of Sanatan Dharma, eternal religion, is: religiousness is eternal. For example, LIFE IS eternal... people come and go. We were not here a few years before and after a few years we will not be here, but PEOPLE were here and people will be here. Life will continue. The forms will go on disappearing and appearing, but that which appears and disappears, that which becomes sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest, is eternal. It is religiousness.\nJesus becomes Christ through that religiousness. Buddha becomes Buddha – enlightened – through that religiousness. It cannot be identified with Hinduism.\nThe Shankaracharya is right: if Sanatan Dharma means Hinduism, then I cannot conform with its ideas. But if Sanatan Dharma means eternal religiousness then there is no question of conforming – I am living it, I AM it. And my whole effort here is to help you to BE religious – neither Hindus nor Christians nor Mohammedans nor Jainas.\nNow this may be the only place in the whole world where all religions are meeting and merging into a new kind of religiousness, a totally different quality. Nobody bothers here whether you are a Christian or a Parsi, whether you are a Taoist or a Buddhist, because we have found the source. And once you know the source it does not matter from what shore you drink, in what kind of bucket you draw the water from the source. The bucket is non-essential; the water is essential. We have found the eternal religion: it can only be a religiousness, a quality, a fragrance.\nMy meaning of Sanatan Dharma is totally different from the Shankaracharya’s meaning. The Shankaracharya of Shardapeeth, Dwarka, simply represents a tradition, a convention which is already dead. All traditions are dead!\nWhat I represent is a living experience.\nThe Shankaracharya is only an imitator of the Adi Shankaracharya, the original Shankaracharya. One thousand years have passed. The original Shankaracharya had experienced; now this Shankaracharya is only a priest. These people are the people who destroy spirituality, but they will condemn me, they will criticize me, because I don’t conform to their stupid ideas about spirituality. As far as I see, their spirituality is nothing but hypocrisy. They go on saying one thing and they go on doing just the opposite.\nThe original Shankaracharya has said: The world is illusory, it is maya. If the world is illusory, if it is maya, if it does not exist at all, then why do these priests go on preaching to people to renounce it? That is their whole life work: to tell people to renounce the world – the world which does not exist in the first place! It is like telling people to renounce their shadows. If you are right, there is no world to renounce; if there is a world to renounce, then you are not right.\nBecause of such stupid ideas people become hypocrites. They go on condemning the world on the one hand, and on the other hand they go on grabbing the same world.\nYou will not find more greedy people anywhere in the world than you will find in India, and the Indian goes on condemning the whole world as materialist.\nOne of our sannyasins, Kamal Bharti, had gone to America and traveled all over the world. He wrote a letter to me saying, “It is strange, Osho, that I traveled all over the world without any money, just sannyasins and friends were supporting me, and I never ran out of money. I never was in any difficulty anywhere in the whole world. But the moment I landed at the Bombay airport my money and my things were all stolen!” This is a religious land! People are spiritual!\nKamal Bharti, that shows that somebody who thinks the world is maya has taken your things. What does it matter? Why allow you to carry such illusory things? He has helped you to unburden!\nThese people have created such a hypocrisy by telling people to do something anti-life. The Shankaracharyas, the priests of the Hindus, go on condemning life and go on also praising God\nfor creating the world. And they don’t see the illogicality of it, the ridiculousness of it. They are blind people! They cannot understand me because what they think is spirituality is nothing but hypocrisy.\nThe Pope lay dying. His doctor called the cardinals together and announced: “We can only save his life with a heart transplant.”\n“We must tell the people,” said one of the cardinals. “Perhaps a donor will volunteer to give his heart for the Pontiff.\nThe announcement was made and thousands gathered beneath the Pop’s balcony, shouting, “Take- a my heart! Take-a my heart!”\nThe cardinals now had to decide on the person who would donate his heart to the Holy Father. “We will drop a feather from His Holiness’ hat,” said the head cardinal. “Whoever it lands upon will be the lucky person.”\nThe feather floated down from the balcony. From the multitude below came: “Take-a my heart! Phoo, phoo! Take-a my heart! Phoo, phoo!”\nThey were doing both things: “Take-a my heart!” and blowing the feather as far away as possible! That’s what these people call spirituality.\n“The world is illusory.” And these temples of Shankaracharya accumulate as much money as possible. And “Money is dirt”... and they collect gold. And gold is nothing, it is dust. These people are against everything, and yet from the back door they go on doing the same as anybody else.\nMy spirituality is not hypocrisy; it is authentic living. I don’t tell you to be life-negative. I tell you to be life-loving, life-affirmative, because God is nothing but life. The aliveness of existence is what God is all about.\nThese people are afraid that I may destroy the spiritual atmosphere – as if the spiritual atmosphere exists! I have traveled all over India – there exists no spiritual atmosphere. Spiritual atmosphere exists only around a Buddha. It is like light: if there is a flame, there is light around it. Once the flame is gone, the light disappears.\nWhen Gautam the Buddha was alive there was a spiritual atmosphere that surrounded him. Wherever he went that spiritual atmosphere went with him; it was his light. There was light when Krishna was alive, when Christ was alive, but now Christianity is only talking about light.\nMaybe they have paintings about light, of light, but those paintings will not give light in darkness.\nThe Mother Superior of the convent awoke in a happy mood, dressed and set off to visit her flock. “Good morning, Sister Augusta, God bless you! Are you happy at your work?\n“Yes, Reverend Mother, but I am sorry to see you got out of bed on the wrong side this morning.\nThe Mother Superior ignored the remark and passed on to another nun. “Good morning, Sister Georgina, you look pleased with yourself!”\n“I am, Reverend Mother, but it is a pity you got out of bed on the wrong side today.”\nThe Mother Superior, greatly puzzled, moved on to a young novice. “Tell me, little Sister, do you also feel I got out of bed on the wrong side?”\n“I am afraid so,” said the nun.\n“But why? Am I not as happy as a song-bird and pleasant to you all?” “Yes, Mother, but you are wearing Father Vincenzo’s house slippers!”\nThese are the people who go on talking about spirituality, celibacy, renunciation! And if you look deep down into the world that surrounds you and these spiritual – so-called spiritual – people, you will be very much puzzled they live a double kind of life.\nYes, I will destroy this double kind of life wherever I go! He is right in that way. Whatsoever he calls “spiritual environment” exists nowhere. Whatsoever exists is hypocrisy, and I am going to destroy it, certainly, because that is the only way to create a spiritual atmosphere. Something that is destroying people’s very life has to be ruthlessly uprooted. All the weeds have to be uprooted so we can grow roses.\nHe says that Sanatan Dharma – by which he means Hindu Dharma, Hindu religion – gives Great importance to self-control. I don’t give any importance to self-control, because all control is ugly, because all control is repressive. Life should be spontaneous, not controlled. Yes, your inner world should be so clear and transparent that you can see what is right and what is wrong, and you should live according to it, not by any dictates in any scriptures.\nHe says: Hindu Dharma lives according to prescribed rules. All prescribed rules create slavery.\nI don’t prescribe any rules for my sannyasins. I don’t give you a character from the outside, but I give you something far more valuable: I give you meditativeness, out of which a character arises which is your own, out of which you start living a life full of insight. Then you know what is right and what is wrong and you live accordingly, but not according to Krishna or Manu or Rama. They may have been right – that was THEIR intuition – but to live according to any prescribed rule is to live the life of a slave. And I am against slavery.\nI teach people rebellion. In that way the Shankaracharya of Shardapeeth is right: that wherever I go I will destroy their so-called spiritual atmosphere. He has not really criticized me, he has praised me – unknowingly of course, unconsciously of course, because these people have no consciousness.\nA man of consciousness cannot be a priest. He cannot be part of any tradition or convention. He is bound to be free from all conventions and all traditions. He lives a life of freedom, spontaneity, love, joy.\nThe third question Question 3\nIT SEEMS, WHEN THE HITS COME THROUGH OUR WORK, IT IS NOT A HAMMERING ON THE ROCK BUT A SIMPLE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.\nWOULD YOU COMMENT?\nYoga Amrita,\nIT’S TRUE. The Master only knocks on your door, but if you are too much identified with your sleep the knock on the door hurts you. It feels as if you are knocked by a hammer on the head. When you want to sleep and somebody tries to wake you up, he looks like an enemy.\nOtherwise, the function of the Master is to wake you up. It depends on your sleep how many and how loud the knocks you will need. Sometimes he even has to knock exactly on your head because you don’t listen to the knocks on the door. He has to throw a bucket of cold water on you!\nMulla Nasruddin was saying to his wife, “What makes you think, dear, that I am a loafer?” The wife said, “Because when opportunity knocks you complain about the noise!”\nThe Master knocks because there is an opportunity. He knocks only when there is an opportunity. When he sees that the opportunity is waiting at the door and you are fast asleep he knocks.\nUnless you love the Master deeply you will not be able to understand his knocks; they will look inimical. They are out of his compassion, out of his love.\nAmrita, you have understood well: it is a knock on the door. Wake up and open the door! because the sun has risen, the birds are singing. It is not time to sleep any more. Come out of your slumber of many many lives! And then you will be grateful to the Master who knocked on the door, because the sun will not knock on the door, the flowers will not knock on the door. They will go on flowering, the sun will go on shining, the moon will come, the stars will come, but nobody will knock on your door. God goes on without knocking on your door.\nKabir has a beautiful poem in which he says:\nGURU GOVIND DOI KHARE, KAKE LAAGUN PAE BALIHARI GURU AAPAKI, GOVIND DIYO BATAE\nKabir says: The Master and God both are standing in front of me, and I am in a confusion: whose feet to touch first? The Master’s feet or God’s feet? – because it is the Master who has shown me God; he should be respected first. But when God is standing there, how can you respect the Master first? You have to bow down to God.\nAnd Kabir says: But my Master was so great that he immediately looked at me and showed me the feet of God. “Touch the feet of God, forget all about me.”\nBuddha says: If you meet me on the way, kill me imme-diately. Don’t let me stand between you and the ultimate.\nThe Master knocks on the door and goes on knocking. The moment you will open the door, the Master will disappear; he will not stand in the way. That is the differ-ence between the true Master and the pseudo Master. The pseudo Master will stand between you and God. The true Master will disappear. The moment you are awake you will find God, and the Master is not standing there any-where. But because the Master disappears he creates more respect and more love in you.\nI have always wondered about this small statement of Kabir: Whose feet to touch first? And great is my Master who has shown immediately the feet of God to me.\nBut I have wondered whose feet Kabir really DID touch first. As far as I can see, he must have touched the feet of the Master, because he says: Great is the Master who has shown me the feet of God. Now how can you help not touching the feet of the Master first?\nBuddha says: Kill me if I come in the way. And the disciples who became enlightened continued to touch Buddha’s feet. Buddha said, “Now there is no need. You are as much enlightened as I am, because in enlightenment there are no degrees. You have come home, you are a Buddha yourself – no need to touch my feet.” But they continued, out of deep gratitude.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO,\nI AM GOING TO ITALY AND THE SITUATION THERE IS VERY BAD.\nPEOPLE ARE KILLING EACH OTHER IN THE STREETS AND A BOMB DESTROYED NINETY PEOPLE IN A STATION ONE WEEK AGO.\nNOW, MASTER, U LOVE ITALIANS. WILL YOU PLEASE SAY A FEW WORDS SO THAT THEY BECOME A LITTLE AWARE OF THEIR INSANITY?\nPrem Francesco,\nTHE WHOLE OF HUMANITY is in the same situation. We have worked for thousands of years to make the earth a big madhouse, and we have succeeded, unfortunately. It is not only in Italy, it is everywhere the same: people are killing each other. There is violence everywhere for the simple reason that we have, in subtle ways, not allowed people’s energies to be creative, and whenever creative energies are prevented they become destructive.\nViolence is not the real problem. The real problem is how to help people to be creative. A creative person cannot be violent because his energies are moving in the direction of God. We call God the creator. Whenever you are creating something you participate in God’s being. You cannot be violent, you cannot be destructive; it is impossible.\nBut for thousands of years we have destroyed every possible door to creativity. Instead of helping people to be creative we train them to be destructive. The warrior, the soldier, we have respected too\nmuch. In fact, the warrior is someone who should be condemned not respected – he is destructive. The soldier should not be respected.\nWe need sannyasins, not soldiers. We need lovers, not fighters. But love is condemned and violence is praised. What is great in Alexander the Great? – nothing but violence. He is great because he was the greatest violent person in those days. He killed over almost all the known world of his day – he killed millions – and still we go on calling him Alexander the Great. What is great in your kings and emperors and their history? Why do you go on praising them? They should be completely forgotten. Nadir Shah, Genghis Khan, Tamurlaine, why should they be remembered? Why should small children be told all the stupidities that man has done to man? – because we still want people to fight.\nThe politician LIVES on violence, the nations LIVE on violence. If the violence disappears there will be no Italy, no India, no Japan. There will be only one humanity. Why these boundaries? But without these boundaries the politician disappears, and he does not want to disappear, obviously. He has a great vested interest in the boundaries and the boundaries have to be defended. And the only way to defend is to kill, and whosoever is the bigger killer is the winner.\nAnd the same is true on a smaller scale in people’s lives. People are taught to be violent because unless you are violent you are not going to succeed in life. YOU have to be very violent, only then you can fulfill your ambitions. A gentle person cannot succeed, he is bound to fail, because he cannot be competitive. He cannot push and pull people; he cannot step over people’s heads.\nAll the politicians are criminals for the simple reason that crime pays. YOU only have to be cunning enough not to be caught. The most fundamental rule of this violent life is: all means are good if they fulfill the end. And of course, rather than arguing – because argumentation is a long thing and it may never come to any conclusion – it is better to pull the sword; it decides things immediately. It is easier to fight with a person and decide who is right. “Might is right.” That rule still remains – the rule of the jungle.\nWe call man civilized? He has yet to be civilized. Civilization is only an idea which has not yet been realized. Man is just superficially civilized, not even skin-deep. Just scratch a little and you will find the animal coming out – a ferocious animal, far more ferocious than any wild animals because wild animals, howsoever wild they are, don’t carry bombs – atom bombs, hydrogen bombs. Compared to man and his violence all animals are left far behind.\nAnd in the past this has been the rule. The Buddhas are exceptions. Of course, they are the only civilized human beings The remaining crowd of people, the mob, is very uncivilized.\nIt is not, Francesco, only in Italy; it is the same here in this country – a great spiritual country, a long long heritage of religion, and still people are killing. It makes no difference to people.\nJust now all over the country there are riots. And strange: in Moradabad where the riots started, the Mohammedans had gathered to pray. It was their religious festival, Id, and they had gathered to pray. And after the prayer meeting the violence erupted. It means the people who had come to pray had brought weapons with them. Immediately one hundred thirty people were killed. What kind of hypocrisy? What kind of insanity? People who have come to pray are hiding knives, swords, bottles\nfull of acid. They have come ready, prepared. Everything seems to be pre-planned. And they have been there to pray. What kind of prayer can be possible in such a situation?\nThe word “Islam” means peace – and Islam has created more violence in the world than any other religion – and the word means peace.\nChristianity says “God is love” and Christianity has killed millions of people, burned people alive. And God is love!\nIt is a very unconscious state of affairs. People are living unconsciously, not knowing what they are doing, why they are doing, not even pondering over it.\nManetti, the mechanic, woke up one morning with a black eye. “What happened?” he asked his wife.\n“While you were sleeping,” she explained, “you reached over and felt my arms and said, ‘What a smooth finish!’ Then you reached over further and said, ‘What perfect headlights!’ Then you reached down further and said, ‘Who left the garage door open?’ And that is when I let you have it!”\nPeople are almost asleep. Even when you think they are awake they are not awake.\nRigamonte was visiting a small town in the Italian Alps. After a few lonely nights he began feeling the need for a woman. He asked the local barkeep how to find the ladies of the town.\n“We ain’t gotta no prostitutes. The church would never allow it. But the thing-a you want-a is kept-a out of sight-a.”\n“What I gotta do?” asked Rigamonte.\nThe bartender explained that up in the mountains were caves. “Go up there at dusk-a and shout-a Yoo-hoo!’ And if the lady yoo-hoos back-a you work out-a the price. If she’s-a busy you no get-a an answer.”\nThat evening Rigamonte yoo-hoos his way from cave to cave, but without luck. He finally decided to go back and get drunk, but at the foot of the mountain he found a fresh cave. “Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!” he shouted.\n“Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!” came back so clearly... he rushed into the cave and was killed by a train.\nFrancesco, people have to be helped to be a little more aware, a little more alert. They need a little more clarity to see what they are doing. But there is no clarity, and the vested interests don’t want any clarity. They want more confusion. The more confusion there is, the politicians have more power. The more confusion there is, the priests have more power. They don’t want man to become aware; they want him to live as unconsciously as possible.\nRinaldo returned to Italy to see his relatives. One day he tried to ride his uncle’s horse. “Giddy up! Giddy up!” he said to the animal, but it did not move. “Hey,” he said to his relatives, “why this thing-a no move-a?”\n“You no say giddy-up,” said his uncle. “You gotta say ‘Mamma mia’ to make-a him go and ‘Mangiare’ to make him-a stop.”\n“Mamma mia!” he yelled and the horse galloped off into a clearing. Ahead was a steep cliff and Rinaldo noticed it almost too late. He pulled back on the reins and screamed “Mangiare!” The horse came to a screeching halt at the edge of the cliff. Looking down and then up at the sky, Rinaldo whispered, “Mamma mia!”\nAnd this is not so only with the people, this is so with everybody else – the so-called intellectuals, the intelligentsia, the politicians, the religious. It is applicable to all except a very few people, and those few people cannot be of much help.\nThat’s why my effort is to create a great Buddhafield, to release as much energy as is released in an atomic explosion. Sannyas is an effort to collect all those people who are ready to be aware, to be intelligent. And we have to spread the color all over the world. This is the color of spring.\nMan needs a new life, a new birth. And all that has been told and taught up to now has failed. It was bound to fail because it was not meant to create a better humanity; it was meant to keep man as much enslaved as he is.\nA Polack was badly injured in an automobile crash and had to have a brain transplant. A team of surgeons put him under anaesthesia, removed his brain, and went into the next room to get the new one. When they returned to the operating room the Polack was gone. The police searched everywhere for him but to no avail – he had vanished. The doctors contacted Interpol and they checked throughout the world trying to find this poor Pole who had left the hospital without his brain.\nFinally, five years later, he was found. The Polack was now the Pope!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6378","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/guida_spirituale/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/guida_spirituale/>Guida Spirituale</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Going Essential</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6378 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Guida_Spirituale/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

But
the seed is not yet the flower. In essence it has the capacity of
millions of flowers, but not in reality. Those flowers have to be
actualized. The essential is that which you are born with, which is your
very being.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly the purpose, or should be the purpose, of education:
to help you to seek and search your essential, to help you to grow it.
The word “education” means to draw out; that which is in has to be
brought out, just as you draw water from a well. But something has gone
basically wrong: the whole educational system is doing just the opposite
of it. Rather than drawing anything out of you it forces, imposes things
upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>That which is imposed upon you is non-essential; it creates your
personality. The essential is your individuality; the non-essential is
your personality. In other words, the essential is your very soul, your
being; the non-essential is your ego. All that helps the ego is
non-essential; all that helps you</p><p>to become egoless is essential. Ambition is non-essential, greed is
non-essential; desire, any kind of desire, is non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditativeness is essential. To be silent, to be still, just to be
alert, aware: that is the first step, the door into the essential. And
once you have found in deep, profound since what you are meant to be,
you have found your destiny. And then life has a sense of direction not
imposed by others but discovered by yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the Master is educative – not informative but
educative, educative in the original sense of the word. He is not to
give you a certain character because that will be imposed upon you. He
is not to make you a Christian or Hindu or a Buddhist. Hc has to help
you to know what you can be, because that which you can be you already
are essence, in the potential.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be a Christ, you can be a Buddha, you can be a Krishna, but
you cannot be a Christian. Christianity is something imposed from the
outside. You cannot be a Hindu. Nobody is born a Hindu; it is nobody’s
destiny to be a Hindu. It is the effort of others to lead you astray
from your destiny. Nobody is born to be a communist or a fascist, but
everybody is born with a certain direction in which hc will find
fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe you are a painter, but you are functioning in the society as a
doctor. You will remain unfulfilled your whole life, because you
listened to the parents and the society and the greed and the ambition.
Everybody was saying, “be a doctor. It is a good profession,
respectable, and you will be able to earn more money than if you become
a painter. Who knows? A painter may not be able to earn money at all,
because painting is not something which has any utilitarian purpose. And
by being a painter you may remain a beggar. You may never become famous,
because painters never become famous – only once in a while.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are a musician, a poet, you cannot fulfill the ambitions of
your parents, of your society, of all the well-wishers. But one thing is
certain: you will be tremendously happy whether you are known or
unknown, whether you are poor or rich. YOU will have a tremendous
contentment because you are fulfilling something very fundamental at the
deepest core of your being. Unless you start moving in the direction of
your essential you remain miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is a consequence, a by-product. Whenever the river starts
moving towards the ocean there is bliss. And one never knows what is
hidden in you. No astrologer can help you, no palmist can help you.
Except with deep meditation you will never be able to feel what is
possible for you.</p><p><br></p><p>As I see it, almost everybody is in the wrong place. The person who
would have been a tremendously happy doctor is a painter and the person
who would have been a tremendously happy painter is a doctor. Nobody
seems to be in his right place; that’s why this whole society is in such
a mess. The person is directed by others; he is not directed by his own
intuition.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation helps you to grow your own intuitive faculty. It becomes
very clear what is going to fulfill you, what is going to help you
flower. And whatsoever it is – and it is going to be different for each
individual... That is the meaning of the word “individual”: everybody is
unique. And to seek and search your uniqueness is a great thrill, a
great adventure.</p><p>Samadhi, your question is significant in many more ways too, because
it is not only a question of finding the essential in the individual. In
life also we are burdened with the unessential, in religion too, in
every dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>The religious person goes on doing certain rituals which are taught
by others to him. He never finds his own religiousness, a quality which
can not be imposed on you, a quality which can only be helped to grow in
you. It is not like a plastic flower that can be given to you from the
outside, by the priest. It is a real roseflower, and for that you have
to be very alert, very aware.</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian goes to the church every Sunday. It is a formality; it
does not make him religious, but it gives him a false sense of
religiousness. The Hindu goes on chanting the Gita. It does not make him
religious at all; on the contrary it prevents, because by reciting the
Gita he becomes very knowledgeable. He becomes a parrot or a computer.
He can recite the whole Gita, but he understands nothing because he has
not experienced anything. He knows words; he has not encountered the
meaning of those words. People go on being imitative.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Mahavira lived naked; that was his individuality. Nobody
else is supposed or expected to live naked, unless one finds it an
inner, intuitive vision, unless one finds that that is the only way he
can be true to his self. Then it is another matter. But the Jaina muni,
the Jaina monk, practices nudity – just an imitation, a carbon copy. And
remember. imitation is always ugly because it creates a false person; it
never gives you authenticity.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira was naked not because anybody had told him to be naked. He
felt the immense urge to be just like a child and he followed his urge,
and he suffered for his urge. He was chased from one village to another,
mad dogs were put after him, he was stoned, because people thought he
was destroying their morality, that he was a dangerous man.</p><p><br></p><p>In an orthodox country like the India of twenty-five centuries ago, a
man walking naked would have been certainly a nuisance to people, to
their conventional way of living, to their traditional style of
thinking. Krishna has not lived naked, Rama has not lived naked, no
Hindu avatara has lived naked. This man is destroying the whole
tradition, culture, religion. Of course he has to be punished.</p><p><br></p><p>But Mahavira was immensely blissful. The Jaina muni does not seem to
be blissful at all because he is simply an imitation. He is really
torturing himself, forcing himself to be naked, because in his mind now
the greed has arisen: unless he looks like Mahavira he is not going to
attain the ultimate liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>Now nakedness has become an essential thing, which it is not.
Nakedness is not an essential thing. Buddha attained without being
naked, Jesus attained without being naked, you can attain. And I am not
saying that Mahavira did not attain by being naked. He attained, but
these are individual things.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhist monks go on following the Buddha. They sit the same way,
they talk the same way, they behave the same way. That is not going to
help at all. That is not going to make you religious. That is not going
to make you another Buddha. You are being simply stupid. And the more
stupid you are the better you can imitate, because imitation needs no
intelligence. In fact, only a mediocre mind can be imitative. The more
intelligent you are, the more you want to be simply yourself, whatsoever
it is. Now the whole thing goes non-essential. For Buddha it was
essential to sit that way; that was his intuitive feeling.</p><p>When Buddha dropped the ideas imposed on him by others, his followers
left him. He had five followers – before he became very famous he had
only five followers; that is before he became enlightened. Those five
followers were very devoted to him for the simple reason that he was
going just like any other Hindu ascetic, only with great stubbornness,
doing all kinds of austerities, following all kinds of rules and
regulations given in the scriptures. He was so particular about
everything that these five followers thought that he was the greatest
Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day he understood the whole stupidity of it: he is not
following his own intelligence, he is simply following others who may be
right, may not be right. One thing is certain: that they were a
different kind of people and he is not of that kind. He was suffering,
but he was thinking that it is necessary to suffer this; this pain is
necessary to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>The day he realized it he dropped all ascetic practices; he relaxed.
That was the first time he ate in the night and he ate food offered by
an untouchable woman. All five followers immediately left him, thinking
that he had gone astray. First, eating in the night is not right;
secondly, the food offered by an untouchable, a poor woman, is not
acceptable to a holy man. He is no more holy.</p><p><br></p><p>And that very night Buddha became enlightened. Those five fools
missed his enlightenment. That very night he became enlightened. And he
became enlightened for the simple reason that for the first time he
relaxed into his being and simply followed his essential core.</p><p><br></p><p>All religions are destroyed by the non-essential. Your whole life is
destroyed by the non-essential. But nobody else can decide for you what
is essential and what is non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that, Samadhi. I cannot say exactly, “This is essential and
this is non-essential.” Each individual has to discover it. Each
individual has to be a light unto himself or herself.</p><p><br></p><p>All that I can suggest is: be silent so that you can hear the still
small voice of your heart. And it is always speaking, but you are so
noisy you go on missing its message.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE SHANKARACHARYA OF SHARDAPEETH, DWARKA, IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID
THAT YOUR IDEAS ABOUT SPIRITUALITY DO NOT CONFORM WITH THE SANATAN
DHARMA WHICH GIVES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO SELF-CONTROL AND PRESCRIBES RULES
OF CONDUCT GIVEN IN THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES. THE SHANKARACHARYA ALSO
REMARKED THAT WHEREVER YOU AND YOUR ASHRAM WILL MOVE, IT WOULD SPOIL THE
SPIRITUAL ENVIRONMENT OF THAT PLACE.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, THIS IS PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SHANKARACHARYA HAS
OPENLY CRITICISED YOU AND THE ASHRAM. WOULD YOU KINDLY SAY
SOMETHING?</p><p><br></p><p>Satya Vedant,</p><p>THE SHANKARACHARYA is right in a way: I do not conform with his ideas
about spirituality. Why should I conform to anybody else’s ideas of
spirituality at all? Spirituality is not an ideology, in fact. It has
nothing to do with ideas. It is a state of no-mind. How it can be an
ideology? The Shankaracharya has no experience of meditation at all,
otherwise he would not have spoken this way.</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality simply means that you have gone beyond the mind, and in
that transcendence all ideas are transcended – Hindu, Mohammedan,
Christian, communist – all ideas. Ideas as such are transcended. There
is only silence, and two silences can never be different. They are like
two zeros. What difference can there be?</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha in his deep meditation is not different from Mahavira.
Mahavira in his deep meditation is not different from Zarathustra.
Zarathustra in his deep silence is not different from Lao Tzu. And I
call THIS the Sanatan Dharma.</p><p><br></p><p>The word SANATAN means eternal, and DHARMA means Tao – the law, the
ultimate law. Ais DHAMMO SANANTANO, Buddha repeats again and again: This
is the eternal law of life. But by Sanatan Dharma the Shankaracharya
means Hindu religion. Hindus think that their religion is the eternal
religion; that is sheer nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>Religiousness is eternal, but no religion is eternal. Every religion
is born and dies in its own time. No religion is beginningless and no
religion is endless. Everything that is born in time is bound to die
sooner or later, and it is good that it dies because it creates space
for something new to arise. Sanatan Dharma – eternal religion – cannot
be identified with any religion in particular.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainas believe that their religion is far older than the religion of
the Hindus, and it may be far older because their first TEERTHANKARA,
Adinath, is remembered in the Rig Veda, the first Hindu scripture, with
great respect. That shows two things: that Adinath must have been
already an established, accepted spiritual leader; he must have preceded
the Rig Veda, and the Rig Veda is the ancientmost scripture of the
Hindus. Jainas say their religion is far older, but older does not mean
eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of religions have existed on the earth and have died, and
when they were alive they had millions of followers, but now they have
completely disappeared. The followers have disappeared, the priests have
disappeared, their gods have disappeared. When they were alive they also
used to think they were eternal. But whatsoever happens in time always
dies; nothing can be eternal in time.</p><p><br></p><p>My meaning of Sanatan Dharma, eternal religion, is: religiousness is
eternal. For example, LIFE IS eternal... people come and go. We were not
here a few years before and after a few years we will not be here, but
PEOPLE were here and people will be here. Life will continue. The forms
will go on disappearing and appearing, but that which appears and
disappears, that which becomes sometimes manifest and sometimes
unmanifest, is eternal. It is religiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus becomes Christ through that religiousness. Buddha becomes
Buddha – enlightened – through that religiousness. It cannot be
identified with Hinduism.</p><p>The Shankaracharya is right: if Sanatan Dharma means Hinduism, then I
cannot conform with its ideas. But if Sanatan Dharma means eternal
religiousness then there is no question of conforming – I am living it,
I AM it. And my whole effort here is to help you to BE religious –
neither Hindus nor Christians nor Mohammedans nor Jainas.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this may be the only place in the whole world where all religions
are meeting and merging into a new kind of religiousness, a totally
different quality. Nobody bothers here whether you are a Christian or a
Parsi, whether you are a Taoist or a Buddhist, because we have found the
source. And once you know the source it does not matter from what shore
you drink, in what kind of bucket you draw the water from the source.
The bucket is non-essential; the water is essential. We have found the
eternal religion: it can only be a religiousness, a quality, a
fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>My meaning of Sanatan Dharma is totally different from the
Shankaracharya’s meaning. The Shankaracharya of Shardapeeth, Dwarka,
simply represents a tradition, a convention which is already dead. All
traditions are dead!</p><p><br></p><p>What I represent is a living experience.</p><p><br></p><p>The Shankaracharya is only an imitator of the Adi Shankaracharya, the
original Shankaracharya. One thousand years have passed. The original
Shankaracharya had experienced; now this Shankaracharya is only a
priest. These people are the people who destroy spirituality, but they
will condemn me, they will criticize me, because I don’t conform to
their stupid ideas about spirituality. As far as I see, their
spirituality is nothing but hypocrisy. They go on saying one thing and
they go on doing just the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>The original Shankaracharya has said: The world is illusory, it is
maya. If the world is illusory, if it is maya, if it does not exist at
all, then why do these priests go on preaching to people to renounce it?
That is their whole life work: to tell people to renounce the world –
the world which does not exist in the first place! It is like telling
people to renounce their shadows. If you are right, there is no world to
renounce; if there is a world to renounce, then you are not right.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of such stupid ideas people become hypocrites. They go on
condemning the world on the one hand, and on the other hand they go on
grabbing the same world.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not find more greedy people anywhere in the world than you
will find in India, and the Indian goes on condemning the whole world as
materialist.</p><p><br></p><p>One of our sannyasins, Kamal Bharti, had gone to America and traveled
all over the world. He wrote a letter to me saying, “It is strange,
Osho, that I traveled all over the world without any money, just
sannyasins and friends were supporting me, and I never ran out of money.
I never was in any difficulty anywhere in the whole world. But the
moment I landed at the Bombay airport my money and my things were all
stolen!” This is a religious land! People are spiritual!</p><p><br></p><p>Kamal Bharti, that shows that somebody who thinks the world is maya
has taken your things. What does it matter? Why allow you to carry such
illusory things? He has helped you to unburden!</p><p><br></p><p>These people have created such a hypocrisy by telling people to do
something anti-life. The Shankaracharyas, the priests of the Hindus, go
on condemning life and go on also praising God</p><p>for creating the world. And they don’t see the illogicality of it,
the ridiculousness of it. They are blind people! They cannot understand
me because what they think is spirituality is nothing but hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>The Pope lay dying. His doctor called the cardinals together and
announced: “We can only save his life with a heart transplant.”</p><p><br></p><p>“We must tell the people,” said one of the cardinals. “Perhaps a
donor will volunteer to give his heart for the Pontiff.</p><p><br></p><p>The announcement was made and thousands gathered beneath the Pop’s
balcony, shouting, “Take- a my heart! Take-a my heart!”</p><p><br></p><p>The cardinals now had to decide on the person who would donate his
heart to the Holy Father. “We will drop a feather from His Holiness’
hat,” said the head cardinal. “Whoever it lands upon will be the lucky
person.”</p><p><br></p><p>The feather floated down from the balcony. From the multitude below
came: “Take-a my heart! Phoo, phoo! Take-a my heart! Phoo, phoo!”</p><p><br></p><p>They were doing both things: “Take-a my heart!” and blowing the
feather as far away as possible! That’s what these people call
spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>“The world is illusory.” And these temples of Shankaracharya
accumulate as much money as possible. And “Money is dirt”... and they
collect gold. And gold is nothing, it is dust. These people are against
everything, and yet from the back door they go on doing the same as
anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>My spirituality is not hypocrisy; it is authentic living. I don’t
tell you to be life-negative. I tell you to be life-loving,
life-affirmative, because God is nothing but life. The aliveness of
existence is what God is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>These people are afraid that I may destroy the spiritual atmosphere –
as if the spiritual atmosphere exists! I have traveled all over India –
there exists no spiritual atmosphere. Spiritual atmosphere exists only
around a Buddha. It is like light: if there is a flame, there is light
around it. Once the flame is gone, the light disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>When Gautam the Buddha was alive there was a spiritual atmosphere
that surrounded him. Wherever he went that spiritual atmosphere went
with him; it was his light. There was light when Krishna was alive, when
Christ was alive, but now Christianity is only talking about light.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe they have paintings about light, of light, but those paintings
will not give light in darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother Superior of the convent awoke in a happy mood, dressed and
set off to visit her flock. “Good morning, Sister Augusta, God bless
you! Are you happy at your work?</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Reverend Mother, but I am sorry to see you got out of bed on
the wrong side this morning.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother Superior ignored the remark and passed on to another nun.
“Good morning, Sister Georgina, you look pleased with yourself!”</p><p>“I am, Reverend Mother, but it is a pity you got out of bed on the
wrong side today.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother Superior, greatly puzzled, moved on to a young novice.
“Tell me, little Sister, do you also feel I got out of bed on the wrong
side?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid so,” said the nun.</p><p><br></p><p>“But why? Am I not as happy as a song-bird and pleasant to you all?”
“Yes, Mother, but you are wearing Father Vincenzo’s house slippers!”</p><p>These are the people who go on talking about spirituality, celibacy,
renunciation! And if you look deep down into the world that surrounds
you and these spiritual – so-called spiritual – people, you will be very
much puzzled they live a double kind of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I will destroy this double kind of life wherever I go! He is
right in that way. Whatsoever he calls “spiritual environment” exists
nowhere. Whatsoever exists is hypocrisy, and I am going to destroy it,
certainly, because that is the only way to create a spiritual
atmosphere. Something that is destroying people’s very life has to be
ruthlessly uprooted. All the weeds have to be uprooted so we can grow
roses.</p><p><br></p><p>He says that Sanatan Dharma – by which he means Hindu Dharma, Hindu
religion – gives Great importance to self-control. I don’t give any
importance to self-control, because all control is ugly, because all
control is repressive. Life should be spontaneous, not controlled. Yes,
your inner world should be so clear and transparent that you can see
what is right and what is wrong, and you should live according to it,
not by any dictates in any scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>He says: Hindu Dharma lives according to prescribed rules. All
prescribed rules create slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t prescribe any rules for my sannyasins. I don’t give you a
character from the outside, but I give you something far more valuable:
I give you meditativeness, out of which a character arises which is your
own, out of which you start living a life full of insight. Then you know
what is right and what is wrong and you live accordingly, but not
according to Krishna or Manu or Rama. They may have been right – that
was THEIR intuition – but to live according to any prescribed rule is to
live the life of a slave. And I am against slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach people rebellion. In that way the Shankaracharya of
Shardapeeth is right: that wherever I go I will destroy their so-called
spiritual atmosphere. He has not really criticized me, he has praised me
– unknowingly of course, unconsciously of course, because these people
have no consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of consciousness cannot be a priest. He cannot be part of any
tradition or convention. He is bound to be free from all conventions and
all traditions. He lives a life of freedom, spontaneity, love, joy.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>IT SEEMS, WHEN THE HITS COME THROUGH OUR WORK, IT IS NOT A HAMMERING
ON THE ROCK BUT A SIMPLE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga Amrita,</p><p><br></p><p>IT’S TRUE. The Master only knocks on your door, but if you are too
much identified with your sleep the knock on the door hurts you. It
feels as if you are knocked by a hammer on the head. When you want to
sleep and somebody tries to wake you up, he looks like an enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, the function of the Master is to wake you up. It depends
on your sleep how many and how loud the knocks you will need. Sometimes
he even has to knock exactly on your head because you don’t listen to
the knocks on the door. He has to throw a bucket of cold water on
you!</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was saying to his wife, “What makes you think, dear,
that I am a loafer?” The wife said, “Because when opportunity knocks you
complain about the noise!”</p><p>The Master knocks because there is an opportunity. He knocks only
when there is an opportunity. When he sees that the opportunity is
waiting at the door and you are fast asleep he knocks.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you love the Master deeply you will not be able to understand
his knocks; they will look inimical. They are out of his compassion, out
of his love.</p><p><br></p><p>Amrita, you have understood well: it is a knock on the door. Wake up
and open the door! because the sun has risen, the birds are singing. It
is not time to sleep any more. Come out of your slumber of many many
lives! And then you will be grateful to the Master who knocked on the
door, because the sun will not knock on the door, the flowers will not
knock on the door. They will go on flowering, the sun will go on
shining, the moon will come, the stars will come, but nobody will knock
on your door. God goes on without knocking on your door.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir has a beautiful poem in which he says:</p><p><br></p><p>GURU GOVIND DOI KHARE, KAKE LAAGUN PAE BALIHARI GURU AAPAKI, GOVIND
DIYO BATAE</p><p>Kabir says: The Master and God both are standing in front of me, and
I am in a confusion: whose feet to touch first? The Master’s feet or
God’s feet? – because it is the Master who has shown me God; he should
be respected first. But when God is standing there, how can you respect
the Master first? You have to bow down to God.</p><p><br></p><p>And Kabir says: But my Master was so great that he immediately looked
at me and showed me the feet of God. “Touch the feet of God, forget all
about me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: If you meet me on the way, kill me imme-diately. Don’t
let me stand between you and the ultimate.</p><p>The Master knocks on the door and goes on knocking. The moment you
will open the door, the Master will disappear; he will not stand in the
way. That is the differ-ence between the true Master and the pseudo
Master. The pseudo Master will stand between you and God. The true
Master will disappear. The moment you are awake you will find God, and
the Master is not standing there any-where. But because the Master
disappears he creates more respect and more love in you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always wondered about this small statement of Kabir: Whose
feet to touch first? And great is my Master who has shown immediately
the feet of God to me.</p><p><br></p><p>But I have wondered whose feet Kabir really DID touch first. As far
as I can see, he must have touched the feet of the Master, because he
says: Great is the Master who has shown me the feet of God. Now how can
you help not touching the feet of the Master first?</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: Kill me if I come in the way. And the disciples who
became enlightened continued to touch Buddha’s feet. Buddha said, “Now
there is no need. You are as much enlightened as I am, because in
enlightenment there are no degrees. You have come home, you are a Buddha
yourself – no need to touch my feet.” But they continued, out of deep
gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I AM GOING TO ITALY AND THE SITUATION THERE IS VERY BAD.</p><p><br></p><p>PEOPLE ARE KILLING EACH OTHER IN THE STREETS AND A BOMB DESTROYED
NINETY PEOPLE IN A STATION ONE WEEK AGO.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW, MASTER, U LOVE ITALIANS. WILL YOU PLEASE SAY A FEW WORDS SO THAT
THEY BECOME A LITTLE AWARE OF THEIR INSANITY?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Francesco,</p><p><br></p><p>THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY is in the same situation. We have worked for
thousands of years to make the earth a big madhouse, and we have
succeeded, unfortunately. It is not only in Italy, it is everywhere the
same: people are killing each other. There is violence everywhere for
the simple reason that we have, in subtle ways, not allowed people’s
energies to be creative, and whenever creative energies are prevented
they become destructive.</p><p><br></p><p>Violence is not the real problem. The real problem is how to help
people to be creative. A creative person cannot be violent because his
energies are moving in the direction of God. We call God the creator.
Whenever you are creating something you participate in God’s being. You
cannot be violent, you cannot be destructive; it is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>But for thousands of years we have destroyed every possible door to
creativity. Instead of helping people to be creative we train them to be
destructive. The warrior, the soldier, we have respected too</p><p>much. In fact, the warrior is someone who should be condemned not
respected – he is destructive. The soldier should not be respected.</p><p><br></p><p>We need sannyasins, not soldiers. We need lovers, not fighters. But
love is condemned and violence is praised. What is great in Alexander
the Great? – nothing but violence. He is great because he was the
greatest violent person in those days. He killed over almost all the
known world of his day – he killed millions – and still we go on calling
him Alexander the Great. What is great in your kings and emperors and
their history? Why do you go on praising them? They should be completely
forgotten. Nadir Shah, Genghis Khan, Tamurlaine, why should they be
remembered? Why should small children be told all the stupidities that
man has done to man? – because we still want people to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>The politician LIVES on violence, the nations LIVE on violence. If
the violence disappears there will be no Italy, no India, no Japan.
There will be only one humanity. Why these boundaries? But without these
boundaries the politician disappears, and he does not want to disappear,
obviously. He has a great vested interest in the boundaries and the
boundaries have to be defended. And the only way to defend is to kill,
and whosoever is the bigger killer is the winner.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same is true on a smaller scale in people’s lives. People are
taught to be violent because unless you are violent you are not going to
succeed in life. YOU have to be very violent, only then you can fulfill
your ambitions. A gentle person cannot succeed, he is bound to fail,
because he cannot be competitive. He cannot push and pull people; he
cannot step over people’s heads.</p><p><br></p><p>All the politicians are criminals for the simple reason that crime
pays. YOU only have to be cunning enough not to be caught. The most
fundamental rule of this violent life is: all means are good if they
fulfill the end. And of course, rather than arguing – because
argumentation is a long thing and it may never come to any conclusion –
it is better to pull the sword; it decides things immediately. It is
easier to fight with a person and decide who is right. “Might is right.”
That rule still remains – the rule of the jungle.</p><p><br></p><p>We call man civilized? He has yet to be civilized. Civilization is
only an idea which has not yet been realized. Man is just superficially
civilized, not even skin-deep. Just scratch a little and you will find
the animal coming out – a ferocious animal, far more ferocious than any
wild animals because wild animals, howsoever wild they are, don’t carry
bombs – atom bombs, hydrogen bombs. Compared to man and his violence all
animals are left far behind.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the past this has been the rule. The Buddhas are exceptions.
Of course, they are the only civilized human beings The remaining crowd
of people, the mob, is very uncivilized.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not, Francesco, only in Italy; it is the same here in this
country – a great spiritual country, a long long heritage of religion,
and still people are killing. It makes no difference to people.</p><p><br></p><p>Just now all over the country there are riots. And strange: in
Moradabad where the riots started, the Mohammedans had gathered to pray.
It was their religious festival, Id, and they had gathered to pray. And
after the prayer meeting the violence erupted. It means the people who
had come to pray had brought weapons with them. Immediately one hundred
thirty people were killed. What kind of hypocrisy? What kind of
insanity? People who have come to pray are hiding knives, swords,
bottles</p><p>full of acid. They have come ready, prepared. Everything seems to be
pre-planned. And they have been there to pray. What kind of prayer can
be possible in such a situation?</p><p><br></p><p>The word “Islam” means peace – and Islam has created more violence in
the world than any other religion – and the word means peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity says “God is love” and Christianity has killed millions
of people, burned people alive. And God is love!</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very unconscious state of affairs. People are living
unconsciously, not knowing what they are doing, why they are doing, not
even pondering over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Manetti, the mechanic, woke up one morning with a black eye. “What
happened?” he asked his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>“While you were sleeping,” she explained, “you reached over and felt
my arms and said, ‘What a smooth finish!’ Then you reached over further
and said, ‘What perfect headlights!’ Then you reached down further and
said, ‘Who left the garage door open?’ And that is when I let you have
it!”</p><p><br></p><p>People are almost asleep. Even when you think they are awake they are
not awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Rigamonte was visiting a small town in the Italian Alps. After a few
lonely nights he began feeling the need for a woman. He asked the local
barkeep how to find the ladies of the town.</p><p><br></p><p>“We ain’t gotta no prostitutes. The church would never allow it. But
the thing-a you want-a is kept-a out of sight-a.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What I gotta do?” asked Rigamonte.</p><p><br></p><p>The bartender explained that up in the mountains were caves. “Go up
there at dusk-a and shout-a Yoo-hoo!’ And if the lady yoo-hoos back-a
you work out-a the price. If she’s-a busy you no get-a an answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>That evening Rigamonte yoo-hoos his way from cave to cave, but
without luck. He finally decided to go back and get drunk, but at the
foot of the mountain he found a fresh cave. “Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!” he
shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!” came back so clearly... he rushed into the cave
and was killed by a train.</p><p><br></p><p>Francesco, people have to be helped to be a little more aware, a
little more alert. They need a little more clarity to see what they are
doing. But there is no clarity, and the vested interests don’t want any
clarity. They want more confusion. The more confusion there is, the
politicians have more power. The more confusion there is, the priests
have more power. They don’t want man to become aware; they want him to
live as unconsciously as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Rinaldo returned to Italy to see his relatives. One day he tried to
ride his uncle’s horse. “Giddy up! Giddy up!” he said to the animal, but
it did not move. “Hey,” he said to his relatives, “why this thing-a no
move-a?”</p><p>“You no say giddy-up,” said his uncle. “You gotta say ‘Mamma mia’ to
make-a him go and ‘Mangiare’ to make him-a stop.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mamma mia!” he yelled and the horse galloped off into a clearing.
Ahead was a steep cliff and Rinaldo noticed it almost too late. He
pulled back on the reins and screamed “Mangiare!” The horse came to a
screeching halt at the edge of the cliff. Looking down and then up at
the sky, Rinaldo whispered, “Mamma mia!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not so only with the people, this is so with everybody
else – the so-called intellectuals, the intelligentsia, the politicians,
the religious. It is applicable to all except a very few people, and
those few people cannot be of much help.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why my effort is to create a great Buddhafield, to release as
much energy as is released in an atomic explosion. Sannyas is an effort
to collect all those people who are ready to be aware, to be
intelligent. And we have to spread the color all over the world. This is
the color of spring.</p><p><br></p><p>Man needs a new life, a new birth. And all that has been told and
taught up to now has failed. It was bound to fail because it was not
meant to create a better humanity; it was meant to keep man as much
enslaved as he is.</p><p><br></p><p>A Polack was badly injured in an automobile crash and had to have a
brain transplant. A team of surgeons put him under anaesthesia, removed
his brain, and went into the next room to get the new one. When they
returned to the operating room the Polack was gone. The police searched
everywhere for him but to no avail – he had vanished. The doctors
contacted Interpol and they checked throughout the world trying to find
this poor Pole who had left the hospital without his brain.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, five years later, he was found. The Polack was now the
Pope!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

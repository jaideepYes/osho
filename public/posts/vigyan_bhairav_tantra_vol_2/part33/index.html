THE FORMER HAS ONE GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.\nBELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.\nMany people seem to be interested in meditation, but that interest cannot be very deep because so very few are transformed through it. If the interest is really deep, it becomes a fire by itself. It transforms you. Just through intense interest you start becoming different. A new center of being arises. So many people seem to be interested but nothing new arises in them, no new center is born, no new crystallization is achieved. They remain the same.\nThat means they are deceiving themselves. The deception is very subtle but it is bound to be there. If you go on taking medicine, having treatments, and the illness remains the same – rather on the contrary, it goes on increasing – then your medicine, your treatment, is bound to be false. Maybe deep down you don’t want to be transformed. That fear is very real – the fear of transformation. So on the surface you go on thinking that you are deeply interested, but deep down you go on deceiving.\nThe fear of transformation is just like the fear of death. It is a death, because the old will have to go and the new will come into being. You will be there no more, something totally unknown to you will be born out of you. Unless you are ready to die, your interest in meditation is false, because only those who are ready to die will be reborn. The new cannot become a continuity with the old. The old must be discontinued. The old must go. Only then can the new come into being. The new is not\nan outgrowth of the old, the new is not continuous with it – the new is totally new. And it comes only when the old dies. There is a gap between the old and the new – that gap gives you the fear. You are afraid. You want to be transformed but simultaneously you want to remain the old. This is the deception. You want to grow, but you want to remain you. Then growth is impossible; then you can only deceive; then you can go on thinking and dreaming that something is happening, but nothing will happen because the basic point has been missed.\nSo there are many people all over the world who are very interested in meditation, moksha, nirvana, and nothing is happening. There is so much noise about it but nothing real is happening. What is the matter?\nSometimes the mind is so cunning that because you don’t want to be transformed, the mind will create a superficial interest so that you can say to yourself, “You are interest, you are doing whatsoever can be done.” And you remain the same. And if nothing happens, you think that the technique you are using is wrong, the guru you are following is wrong, the scripture, the principle, the method, is wrong. You never think that even with a wrong method transformation is possible if the real interest is there; even with a wrong method you will be transformed. If you are really interested in transformation, you will become different even if following a wrong guru. If your soul and your heart is in your effort, no one can mislead you except yourself. And nothing is a barrier to your progress except your own deceptions.\nWhen I say that even a wrong master, a wrong method, a wrong principle, can lead you to the real, I mean that the real transformation happens when you are intensely involved in it, not through any method. The method is just a device, the method is just a help, the method is secondary – your being involved in it is the fundamental thing. But you go on doing something – not even doing, you go on talking about doing. And words create an illusion: because you think so much about it, you read so much about it, you listen so much about it, that you start feeling you are doing something. So-called religious persons have developed many deception devices.\nI have heard that a motorist, driving along a road, saw the school building on fire. The teacher of the small school of that small village was Mulla Nasruddin. He was sitting under a tree. The motorist called to him, “What are you doing there? The school building is on fire!” Mulla Nasruddin said, “I know about it.” The motorist was much excited. He said, “Then why are you not doing something?” Mulla Nasruddin said, “Ever since it started I have been praying for rain. I am doing something.”\nPrayer is a trick to avoid meditation, and the so-called religious mind has developed many types of prayer. Prayer can also become a meditation – when it is not only a prayer, it is a deep effort, a deep involvement. Prayer can also become meditation, but ordinarily prayer is just an escape. To avoid meditation, people go on praying. To avoid doing anything they pray. Prayer means that God must do something. Someone else must do. Prayer means that we are passive – something must be done to us. Meditation is not prayer in that sense: meditation is something you do to yourself. And when you are transformed, the whole universe behaves differently to you, because the universe is nothing but a response to you, whatsoever you are. If you are silent, the whole universe responds to your silence in thousands and thousands of ways. It reflects you. Your silence is multiplied infinitely. If you are blissful, the whole universe rejects your bliss. If you are in misery, the same happens. The mathematics remains the same, the law remains the same: the universe goes on multiplying your misery. Prayer won’t do. Only meditation can help because meditation is something to be done authentically by you, it is a doing on your part.\nSo the first thing I would like to say to you is be constantly alert that you are not deceiving yourself. You may be doing something and still deceiving yourself.\nI have heard that Mulla Nasruddin once came running into a post office, grasping the postmaster by the lapel, shook him, and said, “I have gone crazy. My wife has disappeared!” The postmaster felt sorry and he said, “Really, she has disappeared? Unfortunately this is a postal department – you have to go to the police department to report this disappearance.” Mulla Nasruddin shook his head negatively and said, “I am not going to be caught again. In the past my wife also disappeared and when I reported it to the police department, they found her. I am not going to be caught again. If you can take the report, take it, otherwise I am going.”\nHe wants to report to feel good, to feel that he has done whatsoever can be done. But he doesn’t want to report to the police department because he is afraid.\nYou go on doing things just to feel good, just to feel that you are doing something. But really you are not ready to be transformed. So all that you do just passes as useless activity – not only useless, harmful also, because it is a wastage of time, energy, and opportunity. These techniques of Shiva are only for those who are ready to do. You can ponder over them philosophically – that means nothing. But if you are actually ready to do, then something will start happening to you. They are alive methods, not dead doctrines. Your intellect is not needed; your totality of being is required. And any method will do. If you are ready to give it a chance, any method will do. You will become a new man.\nMethods are devices, I will repeat again. If you are ready, then any method can do. They are just tricks to help you to take the jump, they are just like jumping boards. From any jumping board you can jump into the ocean. The jumping boards are insignificant: what color they are, what wood they are made of is irrelevant. They are simply jumping boards and you can take a jump from them. All these methods are jumping boards. Whatsoever method takes your fancy, don’t go on thinking about it, do it!\nDifficulties will arise when you start doing something – if you don’t do anything there will be no difficulty. Thinking is very easy doing because you are not really traveling, but when you start doing something, difficulties arise. So if you see that difficulties have arisen, you can feel that you are on the right track – something is happening to you. Then old barriers will break, old habits will go, there will be change, there will be disturbance and chaos. All creativity comes out of chaos. You will be created anew only if all that you are becomes chaotic. So these methods will destroy you first, then only will a new being be created. If there are difficulties, feel fortunate – that shows growth. No growth is smooth... and spiritual growth cannot be smooth, that is not its nature. Because spiritual growth means growing upwards, spiritual growth means reaching into the unknown, reaching into the uncharted. Difficulties will be there. But remember that with each difficulty that is passed you are crystalized. You become more solid. You become more real. For the first time you will feel something centering within you, something becoming solid.\nAs you are now you are just a liquid phenomenon, changing every moment, nothing stable. Really you cannot claim any ‘I’ – you don’t have one. You are many ‘I’s’ just in a flow, a river-like flow. You are a crowd, not an individual yet. But meditation can make you an individual.\nThis word ‘individual’ is beautiful: it means indivisible. Right now as you are, you are divided. You are only many fragments clinging together anyhow without any center being there, without any master in the house, with only servants. And for a moment any servant can become the master.\nEvery moment you are different because you are not – and unless you are, the Divine cannot happen to you. To whom can it happen? You are not there. People come to me and they say, “We would like to see God.” I ask them, “Who will see? You are not there. God is always there, but you are not there to see. It is just a passing thought that you want to see God.” The next moment they are not interested; the next moment they have forgotten all about it. A persistent, intense effort and longing is needed. Then any method will do.\nNow, we should enter the methods. The first method:\nTHE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME FOR AN ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.\nThere is a very beautiful method. You can start it as you are; no other prerequisite is needed. The method is simple: you are surrounded by persons, things, phenomena – every moment something is around you. Things are there, events are there, persons are there – but because you are not alert, you are not there. Everything is there but you are fast asleep. Things move around you, persons move around you, events move around you, but you are not there. Or, you are asleep.\nSo whatsoever happens in your surroundings becomes a master, becomes a force over you; you are dragged by it. You are not only impressed, conditioned by it, you are dragged by it.\nAnything can catch you, and you will follow it. Somebody passes – you look, the face is beautiful – and you are carried away. The dress is beautiful, the color, the material is beautiful – you are carried away. The car passes – you are carried away. Whatsoever happens around you, catches you. You are not powerful. Everything else is more powerful than you. Anything changes you. Your mood, your being, your mind, depend on other things. Objects influence you.\nThis sutra says that enlightened persons and unenlightened persons live in the same world. A Buddha and you both live and move in the same world – the world remains the same. The difference is not in the world, the difference happens in the Buddha: he moves in a different way. He moves among the same objects but he moves in a different way. He is his own master. His subjectivity remains aloof and untouched. That is the secret. Nothing can impress him; nothing from the outside can condition him; nothing can overpower him. He remains detached; he remains himself. If he wants to go somewhere, he will go, but he will remain the master. If he wants to pursue a shadow, he will pursue it, but it is his own decision.\nThis distinction must be understood. By ‘detachment’ I don’t mean a person who has renounced the world – then there is no sense and no meaning in detachment. A detached person is a person who is living in the same world as you – the difference is not in the world. A person who renounces the world is changing the situation, not himself. And you will insist on changing the situation if you\ncannot change yourself. That is the indication of a weak personality. A strong person, alert and aware, will start to change himself... not the situation in which he is. Because really the situation cannot be changed – even if you can change the situation, there will be other situations. Every moment situations go on changing so every moment the problem will be there.\nThis is the difference between the religious and the non-religious attitude. The non-religious attitude is to change the situation, the surrounding. It doesn’t believe in you, it believes in situations: when the situation is okay, you will be okay. You are dependent on the situation: if the situation is not okay, you will not be okay. So you are not an independent entity. For communists, Marxists, socialists, and all those who believe in changing the situation, you are not important; really, you don’t exist. Only the situation exists and you are just a mirror which reflects the situation. The religious attitude says that as you are you may be a mirror, but this is not your destiny – you can become something more, someone who is not dependent.\nThere are three steps of growth. Firstly, the situation is the master, you are just dragged by it. You believe that ‘you are’, but you are not. Secondly, ‘you are’, and the situation cannot drag you, the situation cannot influence you because you have become a will, you are integrated and crystalized. Thirdly, you start influencing the situation: just by your being there, the situation changes.\nThe first state is that of the unenlightened; the second state is of the person who is constantly aware but as yet unenlightened – he has to be alert, he has to do something to be alert. The alertness has not become natural yet so he has to fight. If he loses consciousness or alertness for a single moment, he will be in the influence of the thing. So he has to stand on his toes continuously. He is the seeker, the SADHAK, the one who is practising something. The third state is that of the SIDDHA, the enlightened one. He is not trying to be alert, he simply is alert – there is no effort to it. Alertness is just like breathing: it goes on, he does not have to maintain it. When alertness becomes a phenomenon like breathing, natural, SAHAJ, spontaneous, then this type of person, this type of centered being, automatically influences situations. Situations change around him – not that he wishes them to change, but he is powerful.\nPower is the thing to be remembered. You are powerless so anything can overpower you. And power comes through alertness, awareness: the more alert, the more powerful; the less alert, the less powerful. Look... while you are asleep even a dream becomes powerful because you are fast asleep, you have lost all consciousness. Even a dream is powerful, and you are so weak that you cannot even doubt it. Even in an absurd dream you cannot be skeptical, you will have to believe it. And while it lasts, it looks real. You may see just absurd things in the dream, but while you are dreaming, you cannot doubt. You cannot say this is not real; you cannot say this is a dream; you cannot say this is impossible. You simply cannot say it because you are so fast asleep. When consciousness is not there even a dream affects you. While awake, you will laugh and you will say, “It was absurd, impossible, this cannot happen. This dream was just illusory.” But you have not noticed that while it was there you were influenced by it, you were totally taken over by it. Why was a dream so powerful? The dream was not powerful – you were powerless. Remember this: when you are powerless even a dream becomes powerful.\nWhile you are awake, a dream cannot influence you, but reality, the so-called reality around, does. An awakened person, an enlightened person, has become so alert that your reality also cannot influence him. If a woman passes, a beautiful woman, you are suddenly carried away. Desire has\narisen, the desire to possess. If you are alert, the woman will pass by, but the desire will not arise – you have not been influenced, you have not been taken over. When this happens for the first time, when things move around you and you are not influenced, you will feel a subtle joy of being. For the first time really you feel that you are; nothing can drag you out of you. If you want to follow, that is another thing. That is your decision. But don’t deceive yourself. You can deceive. You can say, “Yes. The woman is not powerful, but I want to follow her, I want to possess her.” You can deceive. Many people go on deceiving. But you are deceiving nobody except yourself – then it is futile. Just take a close look: you will know the desire is there. The desire comes first, and then you start rationalizing it.\nFor an enlightened person, things are there and he is there but there is no bridge between him and the thing. The bridge has broken. He moves alone. He lives alone. He follows himself. Nothing else can possess him. Because of this feeling we have called this attainment MOKSHA – total freedom, MUKTI. He is totally free.\nAll over the world, man has searched for freedom; you cannot find a man who is not hankering after freedom in his own way. Through many paths man tries to find a state of being where he can be free, and he resents anything that gives him a feeling of bondage. He hates it. Anything that hinders, that makes him imprisoned, he fights. He struggles against it. Hence so many political fights, so many wars, revolutions; hence so many continuous family fights – wife and husband, father and son, all fighting each other. The fight is basic. The fight is for freedom. The husband feels confined, the wife has imprisoned him – now his freedom is cut. And the wife feels the same. They both resent each other, they both fight, they both try to destroy the bondage. The father fights the son because every stage of growth in the son means more freedom for him. And the father feels he is losing something: power, authority. In families, in nations, in civilizations, man is hankering after only one thing – freedom.\nBut nothing is achieved through political fights, revolutions, wars. Nothing is achieved. Because even if you get freedom, it is superficial – deep down you remain in bondage. So every freedom proves a disillusionment. Man longs so much for wealth, but as far as I understand it, it is not a longing for wealth, it is a longing for freedom. Wealth gives you a feeling of freedom. If you are poor, you are confined, your means are limited – you cannot do this, you cannot do that. You don’t have the money to do it. The more money you have, the more you feel you have freedom, you can do anything you like. But when you have all the money and you can do all that you wish, imagine, dream about, suddenly you feel this freedom is superficial, because inside your being knows well that you are powerless and that anything can attract you. You are impressed, influenced, possessed by things and persons.\nThis sutra says that you have to come to a state of consciousness where nothing impresses you, you can remain detached. How to do it? Throughout the whole day the opportunity is there to do it. That is why I say this method is good for you to do. Any moment you can become aware that something is possessing you. Then take a deep breath, inhale deeply, exhale deeply, and look at the thing again. While you are exhaling look at the thing again, but look just as a witness, as a spectator. If you can achieve the witnessing state of mind for even a single moment, suddenly you will feel you are alone, nothing can impress you; at least in that moment nothing can create desire in you. Take a deep breath and exhale it whenever you feel that something is impressing you, influencing you, dragging you away from you, becoming more important than yourself. And in that small gap created by the\nexhalation look at the thing – a beautiful face, a beautiful body, a beautiful building, or anything. If you feel it is difficult, if just by exhaling you cannot create a gap, then do one thing more: exhale, and stop inhalation for a single moment so the exhalation has thrown all the air out. Stop, don’t inhale. Then look at the thing. When the air is out, or in, when you have stopped breathing, nothing can influence you. In that moment you are unbridged – the bridge is broken. Breathing is the bridge. Try it. It will be only for a single moment that you will have the feeling of witnessing, but that will give you the taste, that will give you the feeling of what witnessing is. Then you can pursue it. Throughout the whole day, whenever something impresses you and a desire arises, exhale, stop in the interval, and look at the thing. The thing will be there, you will be there, but there will be no bridge. Breathing is the bridge. Suddenly you will feel you are powerful, you are potential. And the more powerful you feel, the more YOU will become. The more things drop, the more their power over you drops, the more crystalized you will feel. Individuality has begun. Now you have a center to refer to, and any moment you can move to the center and the world disappears. Any moment you can take shelter in your own center, and the world is powerless.\nThis sutra says, THE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME FOR AN ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS. He remains in\nthe subjective mood, he remains within himself, he remains centered in consciousness. Remaining in the subjective mood has to be practised. As many opportunities as you can get, try it. And every moment there is an opportunity, every single moment there is an opportunity. Something or other is impressing you, dragging you out, pulling you out, pushing you in.\nI am reminded of an old story. A great king, Bharthruhari, renounced the world. He renounced the world because he had lived in it totally and he had come to realize that it was futile. It was not a doctrine to him, it was a lived reality. He had come to the conclusion through his own life. He was a man of strong desire, he had indulged in life as much as possible, then suddenly he realized it was useless, futile. So he left the world, he renounced it, and he went to a forest.\nOne day he was meditating under a tree. The sun was rising. Suddenly he became aware that just on the road, the small road which passed nearby the tree, lay a very big diamond. As the sun was rising, it was reflecting the rays. Even Bharthruhari had not seen such a big diamond before. Suddenly, in a moment of unawareness, a desire arose to possess it. The body remained unmoved, but the mind moved. The body was in the posture of meditation, SIDDHASANA, but the meditation was no longer there. Only the dead body was there, the mind had moved – it had gone to the diamond.\nBefore the king could move, two men came from different directions on their horses and simultaneously they became aware of the diamond lying on the street. They pulled out their swords, each one claiming that he had sene the diamond first. There was no other way to decide so they had to fight. They fought and killed each other. Within moments two dead bodies were lying there next to the diamond. Bharthruhari laughed, closed his eyes, and went into meditation again.\nWhat happened? He again realized the futility. And what happened to these two men? The diamond became more meaningful than their whole life. This is what possession means: they threw away their life just for a stone. When desire is there, you are no more – desire can lead you to suicide. Really, every desire is leading you to suicide. When you are in the power of a desire, you are not in your senses, you are just mad.\nThe desire to possess arose in Bharthruhari’s mind also; in a fragment of a moment the desire arose. And he might have moved to get it but before he could, the other two persons came and fought, and there were two dead bodies lying on the road with the stone there in its own place. Bharthruhari laughed, closed his eyes, and went into his meditation again. For a single moment his subjectivity was lost. A stone, a diamond, the object, became more powerful. But again the subjectivity was regained. Without the diamond the whole world disappeared, and he closed his eyes.\nFor centuries meditators have been closing their eyes. Why? It is only symbolic that the world has disappeared, that there is nothing to look at, that nothing is worth anything, even to look at. You will have to remember continuously that whenever desire arises, you have moved out of your subjectivity. This is the world, this movement. Regain, move back, get centered again! You will be able to do it: the capacity is there with everyone. No one ever loses the inner potential, it is always there. You can move. If you can move out, you can move in. If I can go out of my house, why can I not come back within it? The same route is to be traveled; the same legs are to be used. If I can go out, I can come in. Every moment you are moving out, but whenever you move out, remember – and suddenly come back. Be centered. If you feel it difficult in the beginning then take a deep breath, exhale, and stop. In that moment look at the thing which was attracting you. Really, nothing was attracting you, YOU were attracted. That diamond lying there on the road in the lonely forest was not attracting anybody, it was simply lying there being itself. The diamond was not aware that Bharthruhari had been attracted, that someone had moved from his meditation, from his subjectivity, had come back into the world. The diamond was not aware that two persons had fought for it and lost their lives.\nSo nothing is attracting you – YOU get attracted. Be alert and the bridge will be broken and you will regain balance inside. Go on doing it more and more. The more you do, the better. And a moment will come when you will not need to do it because the inner power will give you such a strength that the attraction of things will be lost. It is your weakness which is attracted. Be more powerful and nothing will attract you. Only then for the first time are you master of your own being.\nThat will give you real freedom. No political freedom, no economic freedom, no social freedom, can be of much help. Not that they are not desirable, they are good, good in themselves, but they will not give you the things which the innermost core of your being is longing for – the freedom from things, from objects, the freedom to be oneself without any possibility of being possessed by anything or anybody.\nThe second technique is similar in a way, but it is from a different dimension. BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.\nThis too is based on inner power, inner strength. It is very seed-like. Believe that you are omniscient, all-knowing; believe that you are omnipotent, all-powerful; believe that you are pervading, all- pervading.… How can you believe it? It is impossible. You know you are not all-knowing, you are ignorant. You know you are not all-potent, you are absolutely powerless, helpless. You know you are not all-pervading, you are confined in a small body. So how can you believe it? And if you believe it, knowing well that this is not the case, the belief will be useless. You cannot believe against yourself. You can force a belief, but it will be useless, meaningless. You know it is not so. A belief becomes useful only when you know that it is so.\nThis has to be understood. A belief becomes powerful if you know that this is the case. True or untrue is not the point. If you know that this is the case, a belief becomes truth. If you know that this is not the case, then even a truth cannot become a belief. Why? Many things have to be understood.\nFirstly, whatsoever you are is your belief: you believe in that way, you have been brought up in that way; you have been conditioned in that way, so you believe in that way. And your belief influences you. It becomes a vicious circle. For example, there are races where man is less powerful than woman, because those races believe that a woman is stronger, more powerful, than man. Their belief has become a fact. In those races, man is weaker and woman is stronger. The women do all the work that ordinarily, in other countries, men would do, and men do the work that in other countries women would do. Not only that, their bodies are weak, their structure is weak. They have come to believe that this is so. The belief creates the phenomenon. Belief is creative.\nWhy does this happen? Because mind is more powerful than matter. If mind really believes something, matter has to follow. Matter cannot do anything against the mind because matter is dead. Even impossibilities happen. Jesus says, “Faith can move mountains.” Faith CAN move mountains. If it cannot, it only means that you don’t have faith – not that faith cannot move mountains. Your faith cannot move them because you don’t have the faith.\nNow much research is going on on this phenomenon of belief, and science is coming to many unbelievable conclusions. Religion always believed in them but science is finally coming to the same conclusions. It has to because many phenomena are being investigated for the first time. For example, you may have heard about placebo medicines. There are hundreds and hundreds of ‘pathies’ in the world – allopathy, ayurvedic, unani, homeopathy, naturopathy – hundreds, and they all claim that they can cure. And they do cure. Their claims are not false. This is the rare thing – their diagnosis is different, their treatment is different. There is one illness and there are a hundred and one diagnoses, and a hundred and one treatments, and every treatment helps. So the question is bound to be raised whether it is really the treatment that helps or the belief of the patient. This is possible.\nIn many ways, in many countries, in many universities, in many hospitals, they are working. Just water or something non-medicinal is given but the patient believes that a medicine has been given. And not only the patient, the doctor also believes it, because he also is not aware. If the doctor is aware whether it is medicine or not, it will have an effect, because the doctor gives a belief to the patient more that a medicine. So when you pay more and you have a greater doctor, you get well better and sooner. It is a question of belief. If the doctor gives you a four-penny medicine, just four pennies, you know well that nothing is going to happen. How can such a big patient with such a disease, such a great phenomenon, be cured by four pennies? Impossible! The belief cannot be created. Every doctor has to create around him an aura of belief. It helps. So if the doctor knows that it is just water that he is giving, he will not give his belief with faith. His face will show, his hands will show, his whole attitude and behavior will show that he is giving just water, and the unconscious of the patient will be affected. The doctor must believe. The more he believes the better, because his belief is infectious. The patient looks at the doctor. If the doctor feels confident – “Don’t worry, this is a new treatment, a new medicine and this is going to help you. It is a hundred per cent certain. There is no doubt about it” – if the whole personality of the doctor gives the impression of a hundred per cent hope, then already, even before taking the medicine, the patient is being cured. The cure has already started. Now they say that whatsoever you use, thirty per cent of the patients will be\ncured almost immediately; whatsoever you use – allopathy, naturopathy, homeopathy, or any ‘pathy’ – whatsoever you do, thirty per cent of the patients will be cured immediately.\nThose thirty per cent are believers. That’s the ratio. If I look at you, into you, thirty per cent are potential, are ones who can immediately be transformed. Once they get the belief, it will immediately start working. One third of humanity can be immediately transformed, changed, to new orders of being without any difficulty. The question is only how to create the belief in them. Once the belief is there, nothing can debar them. You may be one of those fortunate ones, one of the thirty per cent. But a great misfortune has happened to humanity, and that is that those thirty per cent are condemned. Society, education, civilization, all condemn them. They are thought to be stupid people. No, they are more potential people. They have a great power but they are condemned, and impotent intellectual people are praised – because they can praise with language, words, reason, they are praised. Really, they are simply impotent. They cannot do anything in the real world of inner being, they can just go on with their mind. But they possess the universities, they possess the news media, they are the masters in a way. And they are artists in condemnation. They can condemn anything. And this thirty per cent of potential humanity, those who can believe and can get transformed, they are not so articulate – they cannot be. They cannot reason, they cannot argue, that’s why they can believe. But because they cannot argue their case they have themselves become self-condemning. They think something is wrong. If you can believe, you start feeling that something is wrong with you; if you can doubt, you think something is great with you. But doubt is not a force. Through doubt no one ever got to the innermost being, to the ultimate ecstasy, no one, ever.\nIf you can believe, then this sutra will be helpful. BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING. You are that already so just by believing it, all that is hiding you, all that is covering you, will fall down immediately. But even for those thirty per cent it will be difficult because they are also conditioned to believe in something which is not the case. They are also conditioned to doubt; they are also trained to be skeptical; and they know their limitations, so how can they believe? Or, if they believe, people will think they are mad. If you say that you believe that inside you is the all-pervading, the omnipotent, the Divine, the all-powerful, then people will look at you and think you have gone crazy. How can you believe such things unless you are mad?\nBut try something. Start from the very beginning. Get a little feeling of this phenomenon, then belief will follow. If you want to use this technique, do this. Close your eyes and just feel that you have no body, feel as if the body has disappeared, melted away. Then you can feel your all-pervadingness. With the body it is difficult. That’s why many traditions go on teaching that you are not the body because with the body, limitation comes in. It is not difficult to feel that you are not the body, because you are not the body. It is just a conditioning, it is just a thought that has been forced upon your mind. Your mind has been impregnated with the thought that you are the body.\nThere are phenomena which demonstrate this. In Ceylon, Buddhist monks walk on fire. They do in India also, but the Ceylonese phenomenon is very rare – they walk for hours and they are not burned.\nIt happened once, just a few years ago, that a Christian missionary went to see the fire-walk. They do it on the night when Buddha became enlightened, a full moon night – because they say that on that day it was revealed to the world that the body is nothing, matter is nothing; that the inner being\nis all-pervading and the fire cannot burn it. But to do this for one year the monks who walk on the fire purify their bodies, through PRANAYAMA, breathing processes, and fasting. They meditate to purify their minds, empty their minds. For one year continuously they prepare. They live in isolated cells just feeling that they are not in their bodies. For one year continuously a group of fifty or sixty monks goes on thinking that they are not their bodies. A year is a long time. Thinking every moment only one thing – that they are not their bodies – continuously hammering that the body is illusory, they come to believe it. Then too they are not forced to walk on the fire. They are brought to the fire and then whosoever thinks that he will not be burned, jumps into it. A few remain doubting, hesitating – they are not allowed to jump because this is not a question of fire burning or not, this is a question of their doubt. If they hesitate a little they are stopped. So sixty are prepared and sometimes twenty, sometimes thirty people jump into the fire and they dance in it for hours together without getting burned.\nA missionary came to see it in nineteen-fifty. He was very surprised but he thought that if belief in Buddha could do this miracle, then why not belief in Jesus? So he thought for a while, hesitated a little, but then, with the idea that if Buddha could help, Jesus would also help, he jumped. He got burned, badly burned; he had to be hospitalized for six months. And he couldn’t understand the phenomenon. It was not a question of Jesus or Buddha, it was not a question of belief in someone, it was a question of belief. And that belief has to be hammered into the mind. Unless it reaches to the very core of your being, it will not start working.\nThat Christian missionary went back to England to study about hypnosis, mesmerism, and allied phenomena, and what happens during fire-walking. Then they invited two monks to Oxford University to give a demonstration. The monks went. They walked on fire. The experiment was tried many times. Then the two monks saw that one professor was looking at them, and he was looking so deeply and he was so involved that his eyes, his face, were ecstatic. The two monks went to the professor and said to him, “You can also come with us.” Immediately he ran with them, jumped into the fire, and nothing happened. he was not burned. The Christian missionary was also present, and he knew well that this professor was a professor of logic, a man who is professionally doubtful, whose profession is based on doubt. So he said to the man, “What! You have done a miracle. I couldn’t do it, and I am a believer.” The professor said, “In that moment I was a believer. The phenomenon was so real, so fantastically real, it gripped me. It was so clear that body is nothing and mind is everything and I felt so ecstatically in tune with the two monks that when they invited me, there was not a single hesitation. It was simple to walk, it was just as if there was no fire.”\nThere was no hesitation, no doubt – that is the key.\nSo first try this experiment. Sit with closed eyes for a few days just thinking that you are not your body – not only thinking but feeling that you are not your body. And if you sit with closed eyes a distance is created. Your body goes on moving away and away. You go on moving inwards. A great distance is created. Soon you can feel that you are not the body. If you feel you are not the body, then you can believe you are all-pervading, omnipotent, omniscient, all-knowing, all-powerful. This all-powerfulness or this all-knowingness is not concerned with so-called knowledge: it is a feeling, an explosion of feeling – that you KNOW. This has to be understood, particularly in the West, because whenever you say that you know, they will say, “What? What do you know?” Knowledge must be objective. You must know something. And if it is a question of knowing something you cannot be all- pervading, no one can be, because there are infinite facts to be known. No one can be all-knowing in that sense.\nThat’s why in the West they laugh when Jains claim that Mahavir was SARVAGYA, all-knowing. They laugh, because if Mahavir was all-knowing, then he must have known all that science is discovering now and even that which science will discover in future. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. He says many things which are obviously contradictory to science, which cannot be true, which are not factual. His knowledge, if it is all-pervading, should never be erroneous. But there are errors.\nChristians believe that Jesus was all-knowing. But the modern mind will laugh because he was not all-knowing – all-knowing in the sense of knowing all about the facts of the world. He didn’t know that the earth was circular, that the earth was a globe – he didn’t know. He knew that the earth was flat ground. He didn’t know that the earth had been in existence for millions and millions of years, he believed that God created it just four thousand years before him. As far as facts, objective facts are concerned, he was not all-knowing.\nBut this word ‘all-knowing’ is totally different. When the Eastern sages say ‘all-knowing’, they don’t mean knowing all about the facts – they mean all-conscious, all-aware, fully inside, fully conscious, enlightened. They are not concerned with knowing something, they are concerned only with the pure phenomenon of knowing – not knowledge, but the very quality of knowing. When we say that Buddha knows we don’t mean that he knows what Einstein knows. He doesn’t know that. He is a knower. He knows his own being and that being is all-pervading. That feeling of isness is all- pervading. And in that knowing nothing remains to be known, that is the point. Now there is no curiosity to know anything. All questions have dropped. Not that all answers have been achieved, all questions have dropped. Now there is no question to be asked. All curiosity has gone. There is no problem to be solved. This inner quietness, this inner silence, filled with inner light, is infinite knowing. This is what is meant by omniscient. It is subjective awakening.\nThis you can do. But it will not happen if you go on adding more knowledge to your mind. You can go on adding knowledge for lives together – you will know something but you will never know all. The all is infinite; it cannot be known in that way. Science will always remain incomplete, it can never be complete – that’s impossible. It is inconceivable that it can be complete. Really, the more science knows, the more it comes to know that more has to be known.\nThis all-knowingness is an inner quality of awakening. Meditate, and drop your thoughts. When you don’t have any thoughts you will feel what this omniscience is, what this all-knowledge is. When there is no thought, consciousness becomes pure, purified; in that purified consciousness you don’t have any problem. All questions have dropped. You know yourself, your being, and when you know your being, you have known all, because your being is the center of everybody’s being. Really your being is everybody’s being. Your center is the center of the universe. In this sense, Upanishads have declared, “AHAM BRAHMASMI – I am the Brahman, I am the Absolute.” Once you know this little phenomenon of your being you have known the infinite. You are just like a drop of the ocean: if even one drop is known, all the secrets of the ocean become revealed.\nBELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING. But this will come through faith, this you cannot argue with yourself. You cannot convince yourself with some argument, you will have to dig deep within you for such feelings, for sources of such feelings.\nThis word ‘believe’ is very significant. It doesn’t mean that you have a conviction, because conviction means a rational thing: you are convinced, you have argued it over, you have proofs for it. Belief\nmeans you don’t have any doubts about it, not that you have proofs. Conviction means you have proofs. You can prove, you can argue. You can say, “This is so.” You can reason it out. Belief means you don’t have any doubts. You cannot argue it, you cannot rationalize, you will be defeated if you are asked. But you have an inner grounding – you feel it is so. It is a feeling, not a reasoning.\nBut remember that such techniques can work only if you work with your feeling, not with your reasoning. So it has happened many times that very ignorant people, uneducated, uncultured, reach heights of human consciousness and those who are very cultured, educated, reasonable, rational, miss.\nJesus was just a carpenter. Friedrich Nietzsche writes somewhere that in the whole New Testament there was only one person really worth something, who was cultured, educated, philosophically knowledgeable, wise – that man was Pilate, the Roman governor who ordered Jesus to be crucified. Really he was the most cultured man, the governor-general, the viceroy. And he knew what philosophy was: at the last moment, when Jesus was going to be crucified, he asked, “What is truth?” It was a very philosophical question. Jesus remained silent – not because this puzzle was not worth answering, Pilate was the only person who could have understood deep philosophy – Jesus remained silent because he could speak only to those who could feel. Thinking was not of any use. He was asking a philosophical question. It would have been good if he had asked in a university, in an academy, but asking Jesus a philosophical question was meaningless. He remained silent because it was futile to answer. No communication was possible. But Nietzsche, himself a man of reason, condemns Jesus. He said he was uneducated, uncultured, unphilosophical – and he couldn’t answer, that’s why he remained silent. Pilate asked a beautiful question. If he had asked it of Nietzsche, Nietzsche would have talked about it for years together. “What is truth?” This one question is enough to talk about and discuss for years. All of philosophy is just this business: “What is truth?” One question and all the philosophers are involved in it.\nNietzsche’s criticism is really a criticism by reason, a condemnation by reason. Reason has always condemned the dimension of feeling because feeling is so vague, so mysterious. It is there, and you cannot say anything about it. Either you have got it or you haven’t got it; either it is there or it is not there. You cannot do anything about it and you cannot discuss it. You also have many beliefs but those beliefs are just convictions; they are not beliefs because you have doubts about them. You have crushed those doubts by your arguments, but they are there. You are sitting on top of them, but they are there. You go on fighting with them, but they are not dead. They cannot be. That’s why your life may be that of a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian, or a Jain, but it is only because of conviction. Faith is not there.\nI will tell you an anecdote. Jesus told his disciples to go by boat to the other bank of a lake where they were staying. And he said, “I will be coming later.” They went. When they were just in the middle of the lake a great wind came and there was much turmoil and they were afraid. The boat was rocking and they started crying and screaming. They started crying, “Jesus, save us!” The bank where Jesus was was very far away, but Jesus came. It is said that he came running on the water. And the first thing he said to his disciples was, “Men of little faith, why are you crying? Don’t you believe?” They were scared. Jesus said, “If you believe, then come out of the boat and walk towards me.” He was standing on the water. They saw with their own eyes that he was standing on the water, but still it was difficult to believe. They must have thought in their minds that it was a trick, or it was maybe just an illusion, or this was not Jesus. Maybe it was just the Devil, luring them or something.\nSo they started looking at each other, “Who will walk?” Then one disciple got out of the boat and walked. Really, he could walk. He couldn’t believe his own eyes. He was walking on the water. When he came close to Jesus he said, “How? How is it happening?” Immediately the whole miracle disappeared. The “How?” – and he was under water. Jesus pulled him out and said, “Man of little faith, why do you ask how?”\nBut reason asks “Why?” and “How?” Reason asks, reason questions. Faith is the dropping of all questions. If you can drop all questions and believe, then this technique can work miracles for you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8743","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/part33/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/>Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">33 Fear of transformation</h1><div class=post-meta>42 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8743 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Vigyan_Bhairav_Tantra_Vol_2/part33.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE
GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people seem to be interested in meditation, but that interest
cannot be very deep because so very few are transformed through it. If
the interest is really deep, it becomes a fire by itself. It transforms
you. Just through intense interest you start becoming different. A new
center of being arises. So many people seem to be interested but nothing
new arises in them, no new center is born, no new crystallization is
achieved. They remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>That means they are deceiving themselves. The deception is very
subtle but it is bound to be there. If you go on taking medicine, having
treatments, and the illness remains the same – rather on the contrary,
it goes on increasing – then your medicine, your treatment, is bound to
be false. Maybe deep down you don’t want to be transformed. That fear is
very real – the fear of transformation. So on the surface you go on
thinking that you are deeply interested, but deep down you go on
deceiving.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear of transformation is just like the fear of death. It is a
death, because the old will have to go and the new will come into being.
You will be there no more, something totally unknown to you will be born
out of you. Unless you are ready to die, your interest in meditation is
false, because only those who are ready to die will be reborn. The new
cannot become a continuity with the old. The old must be discontinued.
The old must go. Only then can the new come into being. The new is
not</p><p>an outgrowth of the old, the new is not continuous with it – the new
is totally new. And it comes only when the old dies. There is a gap
between the old and the new – that gap gives you the fear. You are
afraid. You want to be transformed but simultaneously you want to remain
the old. This is the deception. You want to grow, but you want to remain
you. Then growth is impossible; then you can only deceive; then you can
go on thinking and dreaming that something is happening, but nothing
will happen because the basic point has been missed.</p><p>So there are many people all over the world who are very interested
in meditation, moksha, nirvana, and nothing is happening. There is so
much noise about it but nothing real is happening. What is the
matter?</p><p>Sometimes the mind is so cunning that because you don’t want to be
transformed, the mind will create a superficial interest so that you can
say to yourself, “You are interest, you are doing whatsoever can be
done.” And you remain the same. And if nothing happens, you think that
the technique you are using is wrong, the guru you are following is
wrong, the scripture, the principle, the method, is wrong. You never
think that even with a wrong method transformation is possible if the
real interest is there; even with a wrong method you will be
transformed. If you are really interested in transformation, you will
become different even if following a wrong guru. If your soul and your
heart is in your effort, no one can mislead you except yourself. And
nothing is a barrier to your progress except your own deceptions.</p><p>When I say that even a wrong master, a wrong method, a wrong
principle, can lead you to the real, I mean that the real transformation
happens when you are intensely involved in it, not through any method.
The method is just a device, the method is just a help, the method is
secondary – your being involved in it is the fundamental thing. But you
go on doing something – not even doing, you go on talking about doing.
And words create an illusion: because you think so much about it, you
read so much about it, you listen so much about it, that you start
feeling you are doing something. So-called religious persons have
developed many deception devices.</p><p>I have heard that a motorist, driving along a road, saw the school
building on fire. The teacher of the small school of that small village
was Mulla Nasruddin. He was sitting under a tree. The motorist called to
him, “What are you doing there? The school building is on fire!” Mulla
Nasruddin said, “I know about it.” The motorist was much excited. He
said, “Then why are you not doing something?” Mulla Nasruddin said,
“Ever since it started I have been praying for rain. I am doing
something.”</p><p>Prayer is a trick to avoid meditation, and the so-called religious
mind has developed many types of prayer. Prayer can also become a
meditation – when it is not only a prayer, it is a deep effort, a deep
involvement. Prayer can also become meditation, but ordinarily prayer is
just an escape. To avoid meditation, people go on praying. To avoid
doing anything they pray. Prayer means that God must do something.
Someone else must do. Prayer means that we are passive – something must
be done to us. Meditation is not prayer in that sense: meditation is
something you do to yourself. And when you are transformed, the whole
universe behaves differently to you, because the universe is nothing but
a response to you, whatsoever you are. If you are silent, the whole
universe responds to your silence in thousands and thousands of ways. It
reflects you. Your silence is multiplied infinitely. If you are
blissful, the whole universe rejects your bliss. If you are in misery,
the same happens. The mathematics remains the same, the law remains the
same: the universe goes on multiplying your misery. Prayer won’t do.
Only meditation can help because meditation is something to be done
authentically by you, it is a doing on your part.</p><p>So the first thing I would like to say to you is be constantly alert
that you are not deceiving yourself. You may be doing something and
still deceiving yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasruddin once came running into a post
office, grasping the postmaster by the lapel, shook him, and said, “I
have gone crazy. My wife has disappeared!” The postmaster felt sorry and
he said, “Really, she has disappeared? Unfortunately this is a postal
department – you have to go to the police department to report this
disappearance.” Mulla Nasruddin shook his head negatively and said, “I
am not going to be caught again. In the past my wife also disappeared
and when I reported it to the police department, they found her. I am
not going to be caught again. If you can take the report, take it,
otherwise I am going.”</p><p><br></p><p>He wants to report to feel good, to feel that he has done whatsoever
can be done. But he doesn’t want to report to the police department
because he is afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on doing things just to feel good, just to feel that you are
doing something. But really you are not ready to be transformed. So all
that you do just passes as useless activity – not only useless, harmful
also, because it is a wastage of time, energy, and opportunity. These
techniques of Shiva are only for those who are ready to do. You can
ponder over them philosophically – that means nothing. But if you are
actually ready to do, then something will start happening to you. They
are alive methods, not dead doctrines. Your intellect is not needed;
your totality of being is required. And any method will do. If you are
ready to give it a chance, any method will do. You will become a new
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Methods are devices, I will repeat again. If you are ready, then any
method can do. They are just tricks to help you to take the jump, they
are just like jumping boards. From any jumping board you can jump into
the ocean. The jumping boards are insignificant: what color they are,
what wood they are made of is irrelevant. They are simply jumping boards
and you can take a jump from them. All these methods are jumping boards.
Whatsoever method takes your fancy, don’t go on thinking about it, do
it!</p><p><br></p><p>Difficulties will arise when you start doing something – if you don’t
do anything there will be no difficulty. Thinking is very easy doing
because you are not really traveling, but when you start doing
something, difficulties arise. So if you see that difficulties have
arisen, you can feel that you are on the right track – something is
happening to you. Then old barriers will break, old habits will go,
there will be change, there will be disturbance and chaos. All
creativity comes out of chaos. You will be created anew only if all that
you are becomes chaotic. So these methods will destroy you first, then
only will a new being be created. If there are difficulties, feel
fortunate – that shows growth. No growth is smooth... and spiritual
growth cannot be smooth, that is not its nature. Because spiritual
growth means growing upwards, spiritual growth means reaching into the
unknown, reaching into the uncharted. Difficulties will be there. But
remember that with each difficulty that is passed you are crystalized.
You become more solid. You become more real. For the first time you will
feel something centering within you, something becoming solid.</p><p><br></p><p>As you are now you are just a liquid phenomenon, changing every
moment, nothing stable. Really you cannot claim any ‘I’ – you don’t have
one. You are many ‘I’s’ just in a flow, a river-like flow. You are a
crowd, not an individual yet. But meditation can make you an
individual.</p><p>This word ‘individual’ is beautiful: it means indivisible. Right now
as you are, you are divided. You are only many fragments clinging
together anyhow without any center being there, without any master in
the house, with only servants. And for a moment any servant can become
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Every moment you are different because you are not – and unless you
are, the Divine cannot happen to you. To whom can it happen? You are not
there. People come to me and they say, “We would like to see God.” I ask
them, “Who will see? You are not there. God is always there, but you are
not there to see. It is just a passing thought that you want to see
God.” The next moment they are not interested; the next moment they have
forgotten all about it. A persistent, intense effort and longing is
needed. Then any method will do.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, we should enter the methods. The first method:</p><p>THE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME FOR AN
ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE
GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very beautiful method. You can start it as you are; no
other prerequisite is needed. The method is simple: you are surrounded
by persons, things, phenomena – every moment something is around you.
Things are there, events are there, persons are there – but because you
are not alert, you are not there. Everything is there but you are fast
asleep. Things move around you, persons move around you, events move
around you, but you are not there. Or, you are asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever happens in your surroundings becomes a master, becomes
a force over you; you are dragged by it. You are not only impressed,
conditioned by it, you are dragged by it.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything can catch you, and you will follow it. Somebody passes – you
look, the face is beautiful – and you are carried away. The dress is
beautiful, the color, the material is beautiful – you are carried away.
The car passes – you are carried away. Whatsoever happens around you,
catches you. You are not powerful. Everything else is more powerful than
you. Anything changes you. Your mood, your being, your mind, depend on
other things. Objects influence you.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says that enlightened persons and unenlightened persons
live in the same world. A Buddha and you both live and move in the same
world – the world remains the same. The difference is not in the world,
the difference happens in the Buddha: he moves in a different way. He
moves among the same objects but he moves in a different way. He is his
own master. His subjectivity remains aloof and untouched. That is the
secret. Nothing can impress him; nothing from the outside can condition
him; nothing can overpower him. He remains detached; he remains himself.
If he wants to go somewhere, he will go, but he will remain the master.
If he wants to pursue a shadow, he will pursue it, but it is his own
decision.</p><p><br></p><p>This distinction must be understood. By ‘detachment’ I don’t mean a
person who has renounced the world – then there is no sense and no
meaning in detachment. A detached person is a person who is living in
the same world as you – the difference is not in the world. A person who
renounces the world is changing the situation, not himself. And you will
insist on changing the situation if you</p><p>cannot change yourself. That is the indication of a weak personality.
A strong person, alert and aware, will start to change himself... not
the situation in which he is. Because really the situation cannot be
changed – even if you can change the situation, there will be other
situations. Every moment situations go on changing so every moment the
problem will be there.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference between the religious and the non-religious
attitude. The non-religious attitude is to change the situation, the
surrounding. It doesn’t believe in you, it believes in situations: when
the situation is okay, you will be okay. You are dependent on the
situation: if the situation is not okay, you will not be okay. So you
are not an independent entity. For communists, Marxists, socialists, and
all those who believe in changing the situation, you are not important;
really, you don’t exist. Only the situation exists and you are just a
mirror which reflects the situation. The religious attitude says that as
you are you may be a mirror, but this is not your destiny – you can
become something more, someone who is not dependent.</p><p><br></p><p>There are three steps of growth. Firstly, the situation is the
master, you are just dragged by it. You believe that ‘you are’, but you
are not. Secondly, ‘you are’, and the situation cannot drag you, the
situation cannot influence you because you have become a will, you are
integrated and crystalized. Thirdly, you start influencing the
situation: just by your being there, the situation changes.</p><p><br></p><p>The first state is that of the unenlightened; the second state is of
the person who is constantly aware but as yet unenlightened – he has to
be alert, he has to do something to be alert. The alertness has not
become natural yet so he has to fight. If he loses consciousness or
alertness for a single moment, he will be in the influence of the thing.
So he has to stand on his toes continuously. He is the seeker, the
SADHAK, the one who is practising something. The third state is that of
the SIDDHA, the enlightened one. He is not trying to be alert, he simply
is alert – there is no effort to it. Alertness is just like breathing:
it goes on, he does not have to maintain it. When alertness becomes a
phenomenon like breathing, natural, SAHAJ, spontaneous, then this type
of person, this type of centered being, automatically influences
situations. Situations change around him – not that he wishes them to
change, but he is powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>Power is the thing to be remembered. You are powerless so anything
can overpower you. And power comes through alertness, awareness: the
more alert, the more powerful; the less alert, the less powerful.
Look... while you are asleep even a dream becomes powerful because you
are fast asleep, you have lost all consciousness. Even a dream is
powerful, and you are so weak that you cannot even doubt it. Even in an
absurd dream you cannot be skeptical, you will have to believe it. And
while it lasts, it looks real. You may see just absurd things in the
dream, but while you are dreaming, you cannot doubt. You cannot say this
is not real; you cannot say this is a dream; you cannot say this is
impossible. You simply cannot say it because you are so fast asleep.
When consciousness is not there even a dream affects you. While awake,
you will laugh and you will say, “It was absurd, impossible, this cannot
happen. This dream was just illusory.” But you have not noticed that
while it was there you were influenced by it, you were totally taken
over by it. Why was a dream so powerful? The dream was not powerful –
you were powerless. Remember this: when you are powerless even a dream
becomes powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>While you are awake, a dream cannot influence you, but reality, the
so-called reality around, does. An awakened person, an enlightened
person, has become so alert that your reality also cannot influence him.
If a woman passes, a beautiful woman, you are suddenly carried away.
Desire has</p><p>arisen, the desire to possess. If you are alert, the woman will pass
by, but the desire will not arise – you have not been influenced, you
have not been taken over. When this happens for the first time, when
things move around you and you are not influenced, you will feel a
subtle joy of being. For the first time really you feel that you are;
nothing can drag you out of you. If you want to follow, that is another
thing. That is your decision. But don’t deceive yourself. You can
deceive. You can say, “Yes. The woman is not powerful, but I want to
follow her, I want to possess her.” You can deceive. Many people go on
deceiving. But you are deceiving nobody except yourself – then it is
futile. Just take a close look: you will know the desire is there. The
desire comes first, and then you start rationalizing it.</p><p><br></p><p>For an enlightened person, things are there and he is there but there
is no bridge between him and the thing. The bridge has broken. He moves
alone. He lives alone. He follows himself. Nothing else can possess him.
Because of this feeling we have called this attainment MOKSHA – total
freedom, MUKTI. He is totally free.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world, man has searched for freedom; you cannot find a
man who is not hankering after freedom in his own way. Through many
paths man tries to find a state of being where he can be free, and he
resents anything that gives him a feeling of bondage. He hates it.
Anything that hinders, that makes him imprisoned, he fights. He
struggles against it. Hence so many political fights, so many wars,
revolutions; hence so many continuous family fights – wife and husband,
father and son, all fighting each other. The fight is basic. The fight
is for freedom. The husband feels confined, the wife has imprisoned him
– now his freedom is cut. And the wife feels the same. They both resent
each other, they both fight, they both try to destroy the bondage. The
father fights the son because every stage of growth in the son means
more freedom for him. And the father feels he is losing something:
power, authority. In families, in nations, in civilizations, man is
hankering after only one thing – freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>But nothing is achieved through political fights, revolutions, wars.
Nothing is achieved. Because even if you get freedom, it is superficial
– deep down you remain in bondage. So every freedom proves a
disillusionment. Man longs so much for wealth, but as far as I
understand it, it is not a longing for wealth, it is a longing for
freedom. Wealth gives you a feeling of freedom. If you are poor, you are
confined, your means are limited – you cannot do this, you cannot do
that. You don’t have the money to do it. The more money you have, the
more you feel you have freedom, you can do anything you like. But when
you have all the money and you can do all that you wish, imagine, dream
about, suddenly you feel this freedom is superficial, because inside
your being knows well that you are powerless and that anything can
attract you. You are impressed, influenced, possessed by things and
persons.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says that you have to come to a state of consciousness
where nothing impresses you, you can remain detached. How to do it?
Throughout the whole day the opportunity is there to do it. That is why
I say this method is good for you to do. Any moment you can become aware
that something is possessing you. Then take a deep breath, inhale
deeply, exhale deeply, and look at the thing again. While you are
exhaling look at the thing again, but look just as a witness, as a
spectator. If you can achieve the witnessing state of mind for even a
single moment, suddenly you will feel you are alone, nothing can impress
you; at least in that moment nothing can create desire in you. Take a
deep breath and exhale it whenever you feel that something is impressing
you, influencing you, dragging you away from you, becoming more
important than yourself. And in that small gap created by the</p><p>exhalation look at the thing – a beautiful face, a beautiful body, a
beautiful building, or anything. If you feel it is difficult, if just by
exhaling you cannot create a gap, then do one thing more: exhale, and
stop inhalation for a single moment so the exhalation has thrown all the
air out. Stop, don’t inhale. Then look at the thing. When the air is
out, or in, when you have stopped breathing, nothing can influence you.
In that moment you are unbridged – the bridge is broken. Breathing is
the bridge. Try it. It will be only for a single moment that you will
have the feeling of witnessing, but that will give you the taste, that
will give you the feeling of what witnessing is. Then you can pursue it.
Throughout the whole day, whenever something impresses you and a desire
arises, exhale, stop in the interval, and look at the thing. The thing
will be there, you will be there, but there will be no bridge. Breathing
is the bridge. Suddenly you will feel you are powerful, you are
potential. And the more powerful you feel, the more YOU will become. The
more things drop, the more their power over you drops, the more
crystalized you will feel. Individuality has begun. Now you have a
center to refer to, and any moment you can move to the center and the
world disappears. Any moment you can take shelter in your own center,
and the world is powerless.</p><p>This sutra says, THE APPRECIATION OF OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS IS THE SAME
FOR AN ENLIGHTENED AS FOR AN UNENLIGHTENED PERSON. THE FORMER HAS ONE
GREATNESS: HE REMAINS IN THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD, NOT LOST IN THINGS. He
remains in</p><p>the subjective mood, he remains within himself, he remains centered
in consciousness. Remaining in the subjective mood has to be practised.
As many opportunities as you can get, try it. And every moment there is
an opportunity, every single moment there is an opportunity. Something
or other is impressing you, dragging you out, pulling you out, pushing
you in.</p><p>I am reminded of an old story. A great king, Bharthruhari, renounced
the world. He renounced the world because he had lived in it totally and
he had come to realize that it was futile. It was not a doctrine to him,
it was a lived reality. He had come to the conclusion through his own
life. He was a man of strong desire, he had indulged in life as much as
possible, then suddenly he realized it was useless, futile. So he left
the world, he renounced it, and he went to a forest.</p><p>One day he was meditating under a tree. The sun was rising. Suddenly
he became aware that just on the road, the small road which passed
nearby the tree, lay a very big diamond. As the sun was rising, it was
reflecting the rays. Even Bharthruhari had not seen such a big diamond
before. Suddenly, in a moment of unawareness, a desire arose to possess
it. The body remained unmoved, but the mind moved. The body was in the
posture of meditation, SIDDHASANA, but the meditation was no longer
there. Only the dead body was there, the mind had moved – it had gone to
the diamond.</p><p>Before the king could move, two men came from different directions on
their horses and simultaneously they became aware of the diamond lying
on the street. They pulled out their swords, each one claiming that he
had sene the diamond first. There was no other way to decide so they had
to fight. They fought and killed each other. Within moments two dead
bodies were lying there next to the diamond. Bharthruhari laughed,
closed his eyes, and went into meditation again.</p><p>What happened? He again realized the futility. And what happened to
these two men? The diamond became more meaningful than their whole life.
This is what possession means: they threw away their life just for a
stone. When desire is there, you are no more – desire can lead you to
suicide. Really, every desire is leading you to suicide. When you are in
the power of a desire, you are not in your senses, you are just mad.</p><p>The desire to possess arose in Bharthruhari’s mind also; in a
fragment of a moment the desire arose. And he might have moved to get it
but before he could, the other two persons came and fought, and there
were two dead bodies lying on the road with the stone there in its own
place. Bharthruhari laughed, closed his eyes, and went into his
meditation again. For a single moment his subjectivity was lost. A
stone, a diamond, the object, became more powerful. But again the
subjectivity was regained. Without the diamond the whole world
disappeared, and he closed his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>For centuries meditators have been closing their eyes. Why? It is
only symbolic that the world has disappeared, that there is nothing to
look at, that nothing is worth anything, even to look at. You will have
to remember continuously that whenever desire arises, you have moved out
of your subjectivity. This is the world, this movement. Regain, move
back, get centered again! You will be able to do it: the capacity is
there with everyone. No one ever loses the inner potential, it is always
there. You can move. If you can move out, you can move in. If I can go
out of my house, why can I not come back within it? The same route is to
be traveled; the same legs are to be used. If I can go out, I can come
in. Every moment you are moving out, but whenever you move out, remember
– and suddenly come back. Be centered. If you feel it difficult in the
beginning then take a deep breath, exhale, and stop. In that moment look
at the thing which was attracting you. Really, nothing was attracting
you, YOU were attracted. That diamond lying there on the road in the
lonely forest was not attracting anybody, it was simply lying there
being itself. The diamond was not aware that Bharthruhari had been
attracted, that someone had moved from his meditation, from his
subjectivity, had come back into the world. The diamond was not aware
that two persons had fought for it and lost their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>So nothing is attracting you – YOU get attracted. Be alert and the
bridge will be broken and you will regain balance inside. Go on doing it
more and more. The more you do, the better. And a moment will come when
you will not need to do it because the inner power will give you such a
strength that the attraction of things will be lost. It is your weakness
which is attracted. Be more powerful and nothing will attract you. Only
then for the first time are you master of your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>That will give you real freedom. No political freedom, no economic
freedom, no social freedom, can be of much help. Not that they are not
desirable, they are good, good in themselves, but they will not give you
the things which the innermost core of your being is longing for – the
freedom from things, from objects, the freedom to be oneself without any
possibility of being possessed by anything or anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>The second technique is similar in a way, but it is from a different
dimension. BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING.</p><p>This too is based on inner power, inner strength. It is very
seed-like. Believe that you are omniscient, all-knowing; believe that
you are omnipotent, all-powerful; believe that you are pervading, all-
pervading.… How can you believe it? It is impossible. You know you are
not all-knowing, you are ignorant. You know you are not all-potent, you
are absolutely powerless, helpless. You know you are not all-pervading,
you are confined in a small body. So how can you believe it? And if you
believe it, knowing well that this is not the case, the belief will be
useless. You cannot believe against yourself. You can force a belief,
but it will be useless, meaningless. You know it is not so. A belief
becomes useful only when you know that it is so.</p><p>This has to be understood. A belief becomes powerful if you know that
this is the case. True or untrue is not the point. If you know that this
is the case, a belief becomes truth. If you know that this is not the
case, then even a truth cannot become a belief. Why? Many things have to
be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, whatsoever you are is your belief: you believe in that way,
you have been brought up in that way; you have been conditioned in that
way, so you believe in that way. And your belief influences you. It
becomes a vicious circle. For example, there are races where man is less
powerful than woman, because those races believe that a woman is
stronger, more powerful, than man. Their belief has become a fact. In
those races, man is weaker and woman is stronger. The women do all the
work that ordinarily, in other countries, men would do, and men do the
work that in other countries women would do. Not only that, their bodies
are weak, their structure is weak. They have come to believe that this
is so. The belief creates the phenomenon. Belief is creative.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does this happen? Because mind is more powerful than matter. If
mind really believes something, matter has to follow. Matter cannot do
anything against the mind because matter is dead. Even impossibilities
happen. Jesus says, “Faith can move mountains.” Faith CAN move
mountains. If it cannot, it only means that you don’t have faith – not
that faith cannot move mountains. Your faith cannot move them because
you don’t have the faith.</p><p><br></p><p>Now much research is going on on this phenomenon of belief, and
science is coming to many unbelievable conclusions. Religion always
believed in them but science is finally coming to the same conclusions.
It has to because many phenomena are being investigated for the first
time. For example, you may have heard about placebo medicines. There are
hundreds and hundreds of ‘pathies’ in the world – allopathy, ayurvedic,
unani, homeopathy, naturopathy – hundreds, and they all claim that they
can cure. And they do cure. Their claims are not false. This is the rare
thing – their diagnosis is different, their treatment is different.
There is one illness and there are a hundred and one diagnoses, and a
hundred and one treatments, and every treatment helps. So the question
is bound to be raised whether it is really the treatment that helps or
the belief of the patient. This is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>In many ways, in many countries, in many universities, in many
hospitals, they are working. Just water or something non-medicinal is
given but the patient believes that a medicine has been given. And not
only the patient, the doctor also believes it, because he also is not
aware. If the doctor is aware whether it is medicine or not, it will
have an effect, because the doctor gives a belief to the patient more
that a medicine. So when you pay more and you have a greater doctor, you
get well better and sooner. It is a question of belief. If the doctor
gives you a four-penny medicine, just four pennies, you know well that
nothing is going to happen. How can such a big patient with such a
disease, such a great phenomenon, be cured by four pennies? Impossible!
The belief cannot be created. Every doctor has to create around him an
aura of belief. It helps. So if the doctor knows that it is just water
that he is giving, he will not give his belief with faith. His face will
show, his hands will show, his whole attitude and behavior will show
that he is giving just water, and the unconscious of the patient will be
affected. The doctor must believe. The more he believes the better,
because his belief is infectious. The patient looks at the doctor. If
the doctor feels confident – “Don’t worry, this is a new treatment, a
new medicine and this is going to help you. It is a hundred per cent
certain. There is no doubt about it” – if the whole personality of the
doctor gives the impression of a hundred per cent hope, then already,
even before taking the medicine, the patient is being cured. The cure
has already started. Now they say that whatsoever you use, thirty per
cent of the patients will be</p><p>cured almost immediately; whatsoever you use – allopathy,
naturopathy, homeopathy, or any ‘pathy’ – whatsoever you do, thirty per
cent of the patients will be cured immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Those thirty per cent are believers. That’s the ratio. If I look at
you, into you, thirty per cent are potential, are ones who can
immediately be transformed. Once they get the belief, it will
immediately start working. One third of humanity can be immediately
transformed, changed, to new orders of being without any difficulty. The
question is only how to create the belief in them. Once the belief is
there, nothing can debar them. You may be one of those fortunate ones,
one of the thirty per cent. But a great misfortune has happened to
humanity, and that is that those thirty per cent are condemned. Society,
education, civilization, all condemn them. They are thought to be stupid
people. No, they are more potential people. They have a great power but
they are condemned, and impotent intellectual people are praised –
because they can praise with language, words, reason, they are praised.
Really, they are simply impotent. They cannot do anything in the real
world of inner being, they can just go on with their mind. But they
possess the universities, they possess the news media, they are the
masters in a way. And they are artists in condemnation. They can condemn
anything. And this thirty per cent of potential humanity, those who can
believe and can get transformed, they are not so articulate – they
cannot be. They cannot reason, they cannot argue, that’s why they can
believe. But because they cannot argue their case they have themselves
become self-condemning. They think something is wrong. If you can
believe, you start feeling that something is wrong with you; if you can
doubt, you think something is great with you. But doubt is not a force.
Through doubt no one ever got to the innermost being, to the ultimate
ecstasy, no one, ever.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can believe, then this sutra will be helpful. BELIEVE
OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING. You are that already so just by
believing it, all that is hiding you, all that is covering you, will
fall down immediately. But even for those thirty per cent it will be
difficult because they are also conditioned to believe in something
which is not the case. They are also conditioned to doubt; they are also
trained to be skeptical; and they know their limitations, so how can
they believe? Or, if they believe, people will think they are mad. If
you say that you believe that inside you is the all-pervading, the
omnipotent, the Divine, the all-powerful, then people will look at you
and think you have gone crazy. How can you believe such things unless
you are mad?</p><p><br></p><p>But try something. Start from the very beginning. Get a little
feeling of this phenomenon, then belief will follow. If you want to use
this technique, do this. Close your eyes and just feel that you have no
body, feel as if the body has disappeared, melted away. Then you can
feel your all-pervadingness. With the body it is difficult. That’s why
many traditions go on teaching that you are not the body because with
the body, limitation comes in. It is not difficult to feel that you are
not the body, because you are not the body. It is just a conditioning,
it is just a thought that has been forced upon your mind. Your mind has
been impregnated with the thought that you are the body.</p><p><br></p><p>There are phenomena which demonstrate this. In Ceylon, Buddhist monks
walk on fire. They do in India also, but the Ceylonese phenomenon is
very rare – they walk for hours and they are not burned.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once, just a few years ago, that a Christian missionary
went to see the fire-walk. They do it on the night when Buddha became
enlightened, a full moon night – because they say that on that day it
was revealed to the world that the body is nothing, matter is nothing;
that the inner being</p><p>is all-pervading and the fire cannot burn it. But to do this for one
year the monks who walk on the fire purify their bodies, through
PRANAYAMA, breathing processes, and fasting. They meditate to purify
their minds, empty their minds. For one year continuously they prepare.
They live in isolated cells just feeling that they are not in their
bodies. For one year continuously a group of fifty or sixty monks goes
on thinking that they are not their bodies. A year is a long time.
Thinking every moment only one thing – that they are not their bodies –
continuously hammering that the body is illusory, they come to believe
it. Then too they are not forced to walk on the fire. They are brought
to the fire and then whosoever thinks that he will not be burned, jumps
into it. A few remain doubting, hesitating – they are not allowed to
jump because this is not a question of fire burning or not, this is a
question of their doubt. If they hesitate a little they are stopped. So
sixty are prepared and sometimes twenty, sometimes thirty people jump
into the fire and they dance in it for hours together without getting
burned.</p><p>A missionary came to see it in nineteen-fifty. He was very surprised
but he thought that if belief in Buddha could do this miracle, then why
not belief in Jesus? So he thought for a while, hesitated a little, but
then, with the idea that if Buddha could help, Jesus would also help, he
jumped. He got burned, badly burned; he had to be hospitalized for six
months. And he couldn’t understand the phenomenon. It was not a question
of Jesus or Buddha, it was not a question of belief in someone, it was a
question of belief. And that belief has to be hammered into the mind.
Unless it reaches to the very core of your being, it will not start
working.</p><p>That Christian missionary went back to England to study about
hypnosis, mesmerism, and allied phenomena, and what happens during
fire-walking. Then they invited two monks to Oxford University to give a
demonstration. The monks went. They walked on fire. The experiment was
tried many times. Then the two monks saw that one professor was looking
at them, and he was looking so deeply and he was so involved that his
eyes, his face, were ecstatic. The two monks went to the professor and
said to him, “You can also come with us.” Immediately he ran with them,
jumped into the fire, and nothing happened. he was not burned. The
Christian missionary was also present, and he knew well that this
professor was a professor of logic, a man who is professionally
doubtful, whose profession is based on doubt. So he said to the man,
“What! You have done a miracle. I couldn’t do it, and I am a believer.”
The professor said, “In that moment I was a believer. The phenomenon was
so real, so fantastically real, it gripped me. It was so clear that body
is nothing and mind is everything and I felt so ecstatically in tune
with the two monks that when they invited me, there was not a single
hesitation. It was simple to walk, it was just as if there was no
fire.”</p><p>There was no hesitation, no doubt – that is the key.</p><p><br></p><p>So first try this experiment. Sit with closed eyes for a few days
just thinking that you are not your body – not only thinking but feeling
that you are not your body. And if you sit with closed eyes a distance
is created. Your body goes on moving away and away. You go on moving
inwards. A great distance is created. Soon you can feel that you are not
the body. If you feel you are not the body, then you can believe you are
all-pervading, omnipotent, omniscient, all-knowing, all-powerful. This
all-powerfulness or this all-knowingness is not concerned with so-called
knowledge: it is a feeling, an explosion of feeling – that you KNOW.
This has to be understood, particularly in the West, because whenever
you say that you know, they will say, “What? What do you know?”
Knowledge must be objective. You must know something. And if it is a
question of knowing something you cannot be all- pervading, no one can
be, because there are infinite facts to be known. No one can be
all-knowing in that sense.</p><p>That’s why in the West they laugh when Jains claim that Mahavir was
SARVAGYA, all-knowing. They laugh, because if Mahavir was all-knowing,
then he must have known all that science is discovering now and even
that which science will discover in future. But that doesn’t seem to be
the case. He says many things which are obviously contradictory to
science, which cannot be true, which are not factual. His knowledge, if
it is all-pervading, should never be erroneous. But there are
errors.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians believe that Jesus was all-knowing. But the modern mind
will laugh because he was not all-knowing – all-knowing in the sense of
knowing all about the facts of the world. He didn’t know that the earth
was circular, that the earth was a globe – he didn’t know. He knew that
the earth was flat ground. He didn’t know that the earth had been in
existence for millions and millions of years, he believed that God
created it just four thousand years before him. As far as facts,
objective facts are concerned, he was not all-knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>But this word ‘all-knowing’ is totally different. When the Eastern
sages say ‘all-knowing’, they don’t mean knowing all about the facts –
they mean all-conscious, all-aware, fully inside, fully conscious,
enlightened. They are not concerned with knowing something, they are
concerned only with the pure phenomenon of knowing – not knowledge, but
the very quality of knowing. When we say that Buddha knows we don’t mean
that he knows what Einstein knows. He doesn’t know that. He is a knower.
He knows his own being and that being is all-pervading. That feeling of
isness is all- pervading. And in that knowing nothing remains to be
known, that is the point. Now there is no curiosity to know anything.
All questions have dropped. Not that all answers have been achieved, all
questions have dropped. Now there is no question to be asked. All
curiosity has gone. There is no problem to be solved. This inner
quietness, this inner silence, filled with inner light, is infinite
knowing. This is what is meant by omniscient. It is subjective
awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>This you can do. But it will not happen if you go on adding more
knowledge to your mind. You can go on adding knowledge for lives
together – you will know something but you will never know all. The all
is infinite; it cannot be known in that way. Science will always remain
incomplete, it can never be complete – that’s impossible. It is
inconceivable that it can be complete. Really, the more science knows,
the more it comes to know that more has to be known.</p><p><br></p><p>This all-knowingness is an inner quality of awakening. Meditate, and
drop your thoughts. When you don’t have any thoughts you will feel what
this omniscience is, what this all-knowledge is. When there is no
thought, consciousness becomes pure, purified; in that purified
consciousness you don’t have any problem. All questions have dropped.
You know yourself, your being, and when you know your being, you have
known all, because your being is the center of everybody’s being. Really
your being is everybody’s being. Your center is the center of the
universe. In this sense, Upanishads have declared, “AHAM BRAHMASMI – I
am the Brahman, I am the Absolute.” Once you know this little phenomenon
of your being you have known the infinite. You are just like a drop of
the ocean: if even one drop is known, all the secrets of the ocean
become revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>BELIEVE OMNISCIENT, OMNIPOTENT, PERVADING. But this will come through
faith, this you cannot argue with yourself. You cannot convince yourself
with some argument, you will have to dig deep within you for such
feelings, for sources of such feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>This word ‘believe’ is very significant. It doesn’t mean that you
have a conviction, because conviction means a rational thing: you are
convinced, you have argued it over, you have proofs for it. Belief</p><p>means you don’t have any doubts about it, not that you have proofs.
Conviction means you have proofs. You can prove, you can argue. You can
say, “This is so.” You can reason it out. Belief means you don’t have
any doubts. You cannot argue it, you cannot rationalize, you will be
defeated if you are asked. But you have an inner grounding – you feel it
is so. It is a feeling, not a reasoning.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember that such techniques can work only if you work with your
feeling, not with your reasoning. So it has happened many times that
very ignorant people, uneducated, uncultured, reach heights of human
consciousness and those who are very cultured, educated, reasonable,
rational, miss.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was just a carpenter. Friedrich Nietzsche writes somewhere that
in the whole New Testament there was only one person really worth
something, who was cultured, educated, philosophically knowledgeable,
wise – that man was Pilate, the Roman governor who ordered Jesus to be
crucified. Really he was the most cultured man, the governor-general,
the viceroy. And he knew what philosophy was: at the last moment, when
Jesus was going to be crucified, he asked, “What is truth?” It was a
very philosophical question. Jesus remained silent – not because this
puzzle was not worth answering, Pilate was the only person who could
have understood deep philosophy – Jesus remained silent because he could
speak only to those who could feel. Thinking was not of any use. He was
asking a philosophical question. It would have been good if he had asked
in a university, in an academy, but asking Jesus a philosophical
question was meaningless. He remained silent because it was futile to
answer. No communication was possible. But Nietzsche, himself a man of
reason, condemns Jesus. He said he was uneducated, uncultured,
unphilosophical – and he couldn’t answer, that’s why he remained silent.
Pilate asked a beautiful question. If he had asked it of Nietzsche,
Nietzsche would have talked about it for years together. “What is
truth?” This one question is enough to talk about and discuss for years.
All of philosophy is just this business: “What is truth?” One question
and all the philosophers are involved in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche’s criticism is really a criticism by reason, a condemnation
by reason. Reason has always condemned the dimension of feeling because
feeling is so vague, so mysterious. It is there, and you cannot say
anything about it. Either you have got it or you haven’t got it; either
it is there or it is not there. You cannot do anything about it and you
cannot discuss it. You also have many beliefs but those beliefs are just
convictions; they are not beliefs because you have doubts about them.
You have crushed those doubts by your arguments, but they are there. You
are sitting on top of them, but they are there. You go on fighting with
them, but they are not dead. They cannot be. That’s why your life may be
that of a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian, or a Jain, but it is
only because of conviction. Faith is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you an anecdote. Jesus told his disciples to go by boat
to the other bank of a lake where they were staying. And he said, “I
will be coming later.” They went. When they were just in the middle of
the lake a great wind came and there was much turmoil and they were
afraid. The boat was rocking and they started crying and screaming. They
started crying, “Jesus, save us!” The bank where Jesus was was very far
away, but Jesus came. It is said that he came running on the water. And
the first thing he said to his disciples was, “Men of little faith, why
are you crying? Don’t you believe?” They were scared. Jesus said, “If
you believe, then come out of the boat and walk towards me.” He was
standing on the water. They saw with their own eyes that he was standing
on the water, but still it was difficult to believe. They must have
thought in their minds that it was a trick, or it was maybe just an
illusion, or this was not Jesus. Maybe it was just the Devil, luring
them or something.</p><p>So they started looking at each other, “Who will walk?” Then one
disciple got out of the boat and walked. Really, he could walk. He
couldn’t believe his own eyes. He was walking on the water. When he came
close to Jesus he said, “How? How is it happening?” Immediately the
whole miracle disappeared. The “How?” – and he was under water. Jesus
pulled him out and said, “Man of little faith, why do you ask how?”</p><p><br></p><p>But reason asks “Why?” and “How?” Reason asks, reason questions.
Faith is the dropping of all questions. If you can drop all questions
and believe, then this technique can work miracles for you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

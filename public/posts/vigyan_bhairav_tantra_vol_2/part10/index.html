BUT IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THE RIGHT FOOD, RIGHT LABOUR, RIGHT SLEEP, RIGHT ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR INNER TRANSFORMATION? ISN’T IT A MISTAKE TO IGNORE THE OUTER COMPLETELY?\nTHE OUTER CANNOT CHANGE THE INNER, but the outer can help, or it can hinder. The outer can create a situation in which the inner can explode more easily. The thing to be remembered is this: that the outer transformation is not the inner. Even if you have done everything and the situation is there, the inner is not going to explode. The situation is necessary, it is helpful, but it is not the transformation. And those who get involved with the outer.…\nThe outer is a vast phenomenon. You can go on changing for lives and you will never be satisfied, and something or other will remain to be changed, because unless the inner changes, the outer can never be perfect. You can go on changing it and polishing it and conditioning it. You will never feel satisfied. You will never come to a situation where you can feel, ‘Now, the field is ready.’ So many have wasted their lives.\nIf your mind becomes obsessed with the outer – with the food, with the clothes, with the behavior... I am not saying to neglect them. No, what I am saying is, don’t get obsessed with them. They can be helpful, but they can become great hindrances if your mind becomes obsessed. Then it becomes an escape, then you are just postponing the inner change. And you can go on changing the outer. The inner is not even touched by it, the inner remains the same.\nYou might have heard one old Indian fable. In ‘Panchtantra’ it is said that a mouse was very much afraid of a cat; constantly in fear, anxiety. He couldn’t sleep: he would dream about the cat and he would tremble. A magician, just out of pity, transformed the mouse into a cat. The outer was changed, but immediately the mouse within the cat now became afraid of a dog. The anxiety was the same; only the object had changed. Previously it was the cat, now it was the dog. The trembling continued, the anguish remained, the dreams were still of fear.\nSo the magician changed the cat into a dog. Immediately the dog became afraid of the tiger, because the mouse within remained the same. The mouse was not changed; only bodies, the outer. The same anxiety, the same disease, the same fear remained. The magician changed the dog into a tiger. Immediately the mouse within the tiger became afraid of a hunter. So the magician said to the mouse, ‘Now be a mouse again, because I can change your bodies, I cannot change you. You have the heart of a mouse, so what can I do?’ The heart of a mouse.\nYou can go on changing the outer, but the heart of the mouse remains the same. And that heart creates the problems. The shape will change, the form will change, but the substance will remain the same. And it makes no difference whether you are afraid of a cat, or of a dog, or of a tiger. The question is not of whom you are afraid; the question is that you are afraid.\nThe emphasis is – my emphasis is – that you must remain aware that your outer effort should not become a substitute for the inner transformation. One thing. Take every help that can be taken. It is good to have right food, but it is nonsense and madness to become obsessed with food. It is good to have right behavior, but it is neurotic to become obsessed with it. You should not become mad about anything.\nIn India there are many sects of sannyasins who are obsessed with food. The whole day they are thinking only of food: what to eat and what not to eat; who should prepare the food and who should not prepare the food. Once I was travelling with a sannyasin. He would take only milk, and only cow’s milk, and only from those cows which were white; otherwise he would go without food. This man is mad.\nRemember this: that the inner is important, significant. The outer is helpful, it is good, but you must not become focused with it. It must not become so important that the inner is forgotten. The inner must remain the inner and the central, and the outer, if possible, should be changed just as a help.\nDon’t ignore it completely. There is no need to ignore it, because really the outer is also part of the inner. It is not something opposite to it, it is not something contrary to it, it is not something imposed upon you – it is you. But the inner is the central, and the outer is the periphery. So give as much importance as a periphery needs, as a circumference needs, as a boundary needs – but the boundary is not the house. So take care of it, but don’t become mad after it.\nOur mind is always trying to find escapes. If you can become involved with food, with sex, with clothes, with the body, your mind will be at ease, because now you are not going towards the inner. Now there is no need to change the mind. Now there is no need to destroy the mind, to go beyond the mind. With the change of food, the same mind can exist. You may eat this or that – the same mind can exist. Only when you move inwards... the more inner you reach, the more this mind which you have has to cease. The inward path is the path towards no-mind.\nThe mind becomes afraid. It will try to find some escape – something to do with the outer. Then the mind can exist as it is. Whatsoever you do makes no difference. It is irrelevant what you do – this mind can exist, and this mind can find ways for how to remain the same. And sometimes, when you struggle with the natural outlet, your mind will find some perverted outlets which are more dangerous. Rather than being a help, they will become hindrances.\nI have heard that Mulla Nasrudin fell down his stairs. His leg was fractured, so it was put in a plaster cast, and he was told that for three months he was not to go up and down the stairs. After three months he came to the doctor and the plaster was removed. Mulla asked, ‘Now can I go up and down the stairs?’\nThe doctor said, ‘Now you can go. You are absolutely okay.’\nMulla said, ‘Now I am so happy, doctor. You cannot believe how happy I am. It was so awkward to go up and down the drain-pipe the whole day. For three months, every day going up and down the drain-pipe – it was so awkward, and the whole neighborhood was laughing at me. But you had told me not to go up and down the stairs, so I had to find a way.’\nThis is what everyone is doing. If one outlet is blocked, then a perversion is bound to happen. And you don’t know the ways of the mind – =they are very cunning and very subtle. People come to me with their problems. The problem seems to be obvious – it is not. All problems seem to be obvious, clear – it is not so. Deep down something else is hidden, and unless that something else is known, discarded, gone beyond, the problem will remain. It will change its shape.\nSomeone is smoking too much and he wants to stop it. But smoking in itself is not a problem; the problem is something else. You can stop smoking, but the problem will remain, and it will have to come out in something else. When do you smoke? When you are anxious, nervous, you start smoking, and smoking helps you. You feel more confident, you feel more relaxed.\nJust by stopping the smoking, your nervousness is not going to change. You will feel nervous, you will feel anxious; the anxiety will come. Then you will do something else. And you can find something which is a beautiful substitute; it looks so different. You can do anything. You can just use a mantra instead of smoking, and whenever you feel nervous you can say, RAM, RAM, RAM – anything continuously.\nWhat are you doing with smoke? It is a mantra. You smoke in and out, you smoke in and out – it becomes a repetitive thing. Because of the repetition you feel relaxed. Repeat anything and the same will happen. But if you are using a mantra and saying, RAM, RAM, RAM, no one is going to say that you are doing something wrong. And the problem is the same.\nThe problem has not changed; only you have changed the trick. Previously you were doing it with smoke; now you are doing it with a word. Repetition helps; any nonsense thing will help. You just have to repeat it continuously. When you repeat a thing it gives relaxation, because it creates a sort of boredom. Boredom is relaxing. You can do anything that creates a sort of boredom. Boredom is relaxing. You can do anything that creates boredom.\nIf you are smoking, everyone will say that it is wrong. And if you are chanting a mantra, no one is going to say that it is wrong. But if the problem is the same, I am saying that it is also wrong – rather,\nmore dangerous than the previous one, because with smoking you were aware that it was wrong. Now, with this chanting of the mantra you are not aware, and this disease that you are unaware is more dangerous and more harmful.\nYou can do anything on the surface, but unless deeper roots are changed, nothing happens. So with the outer remember this: be aware of it, and move from the surface towards the roots and find the root – why are you nervous? Someone is eating too much food. It can be stopped. You can force yourself to not eat too much. But why is one eating too much food? Why? Because this is not a bodily need, so somewhere the mind is interfering. Something has to be done with the mind; it is not a question of the body. Why do you go on stuffing yourself?\nToo much obsession with food is a love need. If you are not loved well, you will eat more. If you are loved and you can love, you will eat less. Whenever someone loves you, you cannot eat more. Love fills you so much, you don’t feel empty. When there is not love, you feel empty; something has to be stuffed in – you go on forcing food.\nAnd there are reasons, root reasons, for it, because the first encounter of the child with love and food is simultaneous. From the same breast, from the same mother, he gets food and love – food and love become associated. If the mother is loving, the child will never take too much mild. There is no need. He is always secure in his love; he knows that whenever there is a need the food will come, the milk will be there, the mother will be there. He feels secure. But if the mother is non-loving, then he is insecure. Then he doesn’t know whether, when he feels hungry, food will come, because there is no love. He will eat more. And this will continue. It will become an unconscious root.\nSo you can go on changing your food – eat this, eat that, don’t eat this – but it makes no difference, because the basic root remains there. Then if you stop stuffing yourself with food, you will start stuffing with something else. And there are many ways. If you stop eating too much you may start accumulating money. Then again you have to be filled by something; then you go on accumulating money.\nObserve deeply, and you will see that a person who accumulates money is never in love, cannot be, because the money accumulation is really a substitute. With money he will feel secure now. When you are loved there is no insecurity; in love all fears disappear. In love there is no future, no past. This moment is enough, this very moment is eternity. You are accepted. There is no anxiety for the future, for what will happen tomorrow – there is no tomorrow in love.\nBut if love is not there, then the tomorrow is there. What will happen? Accumulate money, because you cannot rely on any person. So rely on things, rely on money and wealth. There are people who say, ‘Donate your money. Don’t accumulate money. Be non-attached to money.’ But these are superficial things, because the inner need will remain the same – then he will start accumulating something else.\nStop one outlet and you will have to create another – unless roots are destroyed. So don’t be too much concerned with the outer. Be aware of whatsoever your outer personality is. Be aware of it, be alert, and from the periphery always move towards the roots to find what the cause is there. Howsoever disturbing, move to the roots. Once you come to know the roots, once the roots are exposed.… Remember this law: the roots can exist only in darkness – not only the roots of trees, but the roots of anything. They can exist only in darkness. Once they are brought to light, they die.\nSo move with your periphery; dig it deep and go to the roots, and bring the roots to consciousness, to light. Once you have come to the root, it simply disappears. You have not to do anything about it. You have to do something only because you don’t know what the problem is. A problem rightly understood disappears. Right understanding of a problem, a root understanding of the problem, becomes the disappearance of it. The first thing.\nThe second thing: whatsoever you do is superficial; it is not you in your totality. So don’t judge a man by his actions, because action is very atomic. You see a person in anger, and you can judge that this man is filled with hatred, violence, vengeance. But a moment later the anger disappears; the man becomes as loving as possible, and a different perfume, a different flowering, comes to his face. The anger was atomic. Don’t judge the whole man. But this love is also atomic. Don’t judge the whole man by this love.\nWhatsoever you have done is not your total sum. Your actions remain just atomic – part of you of course, but your totality transcends them. You can be different immediately. And whatsoever is known about you by your behavior, by your actions, by your doings, you can contradict. You may have been a saint: you can become a sinner this very moment. No one could imagine that you, a saint, could do this. You can do it. It is not inconceivable. You may have been a sinner up to this moment, and the next moment you can jump out of it.\nWhat I am saying is, your inner is so vast and so great that by your outer it cannot be judged. Your outer remains superficial, accidental. I will repeat it. Your outer remains accidental, your inner is the essence. So remember to uncover the inner, and don’t get entangled with the outer.\nOne thing more: outer is always of the past. It is always dead, because whatsoever you have done, you have done. It is always of the past, it is never alive. The inner is always alive, it is here and now, and the outer is always dead. If you know me – whatsoever I have done and said – you know my past, you don’t know me. I am here, the living. That is my inner point, and whatsoever you know about me is just the outer. It is dead, it is no more there.\nObserve it in your own consciousness. Whatsoever you have done is not a bondage on you. It is no more really; it is just a memory. And you are greater than that. Your infinite possibilities are there. It was only accidental that you are a sinner or you are a saint. It was only accidental that you are a Christian or a Hindu. But your innermost being is not accidental; it is essential.\nThe emphasis on the inner is the emphasis on the essential. And that inner remains free, it is freedom. The outer is a slavery, because you can know the outer only when it has happened; then you cannot do anything about it. What can you do about your past? It cannot be undone, you cannot move backwards. You cannot do anything with the past; it is a slavery.\nIf you understand it rightly, then you can understand the theory of karma, the theory of actions. This theory – one of the most essential parts of Hindu realization – is that unless you go beyond karmas, you are not free; unless you have gone beyond all actions, you will remain in bondage. Don’t pay much attention to the outer, don’t get obsessed with it. Use it as a help, but continuously remembering that the inner has to be discovered.\nThese techniques we are discussing here are for the inner, for how to discover it. I will tell you one thing. There have been traditionsFor example, one of the most important religious traditions has\nbeen Jainism. But Jainism pays too much attention to the outer; too much, so much so that they completely forget that there is anything like meditation, that there is anything like a science of yoga. They forget it completely.\nThey are obsessed with food, with clothes, with sleep, with everything – but with no effort towards meditation. Not that in their tradition originally there was no meditation, because no religion can be born without it, but they got obsessed somewhere with the outer. It became so important that they forgot completely that this whole situation is just a help; it is not the goal.\nWhat you eat is not the goal. What you are is the goal. It is good if your eating habits help you to uncover the being. It is good. But if you become just obsessed with eating, continuously thinking about it, then you have missed the point. Then you are a food-addict. You are mad, neurotic.\nQuestion 2\nISN’T IT TRUE THAT ALL MEDITATION TECHNIQUES ARE REALLY DOINGS WHICH LEAD THE SEEKER TO HIS BEING?\nIn a way, yes; and in a deeper way, no. Meditation techniques are doings, because you are advised to do something. Even to meditate is to do something, even to sit silently is to do something, even to not do anything is a sort of doing. So in a superficial way, all meditation techniques are doings. But in a deeper way they are not, because if you succeed in them, the doing disappears.\nOnly in the beginning it appears like an effort. If you succeed in it, the effort disappears and the whole thing becomes spontaneous and effortless. If you succeed in it, it is not a doing. No effort on your part is needed then. It becomes just like breathing – it is there. But in the beginning the effort is bound to be, because the mind cannot do anything which is not an effort. If you tell it to be effortless, the whole thing seems absurd.\nIn Zen, where much emphasis is paid to effortlessness, the masters say to the disciples, ‘Just sit. Don’t do anything.’ And the disciple tries. Of course, what can you do other than trying? The disciple tries to just sit, and he tries to just sit, and he tries to not do anything, and then the master hits him on his head with his staff and he says, ‘Don’t do this! I have not told you to try to sit, because that becomes an effort. And don’t try not to do anything, because that is a sort of doing. Simply sit!’\nIf I tell you to simply sit, what will you do? You will do something, which will make it not a simple sitting; an effort will enter. You will be sitting with an effort; a strain will be there. You cannot simply sit. It looks strange, but the moment you try to sit simply, it has become complex. The very effort to simply sit makes it complex. So what to do?\nYears pass, and the disciple goes on sitting and being blamed, condemned by the master that he is missing the point. But he simply goes on, goes on, goes on, and every day he is a failure, because the effort is there. And he cannot deceive the master. But one day, just patiently sitting, even this consciousness to sit simply disappears. One day suddenly he is sitting – like a tree or like a rock – not doing anything. And then the master says, ‘This is the right posture. Now you have attained it. Now remember this. This is the way to sit.’ But it takes patience and long effort to achieve effortlessness.\nIn the beginning, effort will be there, doing will be there, but only in the beginning as a necessary evil. But you have to remember constantly that you have to go beyond it. A moment must come when you are not doing anything about meditation – just being there and it happens; just sitting or standing and it happens; not doing anything, just being aware, it happens.\nAll these techniques are just to help you to come to an effortless moment. The inner transformation, the inner realization, cannot happen through effort, because effort is a sort of tension. With effort you cannot be relaxed totally; the effort will become a barrier. With this background in mind, if you make effort, by and by you will become capable of leaving it also.\nIt is just like swimming. If you know about swimming, you know that in the beginning you have to make effort – but only in the beginning. Once you know the feel of it, once you know what it is, the effort has gone; you can swim effortlessly. And even a good swimmer cannot say what swimming is, what exactly he is doing. He cannot explain to you what he is doing. Really, he is not doing anything. He is simply allowing himself to be in a deep responsive relationship with the water, with the river. He is not doing anything really. And if he is still doing, he is still not an expert swimmer – he is still amateur, still learning.\nI will tell you one anecdote. In Burma, one Buddhist monk was ordered to make a design for the new temple, particularly for the gate. So he was making many designs. He had one very talented disciple, so he told that disciple to be near him. While he made the design the disciple was simply to watch, and if he liked it he had to say that it was okay, it was right. If he didn’t like it then he had to say no. And the master said, ‘When you say yes, only then will I send the design. If you go on saying no, I will discard the design and will create a new one.’\nHundreds of designs were discarded in this way. Three months passed. Even the master became afraid, but he had given his word so he had to keep it. The disciple was there, the master would make the design, and then the disciple would say no. The master would start another one.\nOne day the ink was just about to be finished, so the master said, ‘Go out and find more ink.’ The disciple went out. The master forgot him, his presence, and became effortless. His presence was the problem. The idea was constantly in his mind that the disciple was there, judging. He was constantly wondering whether he was going to like it or not, whether he would discard it again. This created an inner anxiety and the master could not be spontaneous.\nThe disciple went out. The design was completed. The disciple came in and he said ‘Wonderful! But why couldn’t you do it before?’\nThe master said, ‘Now I understand why – because you were here. Because of you – I was making an effort to get your approval. The effort destroyed the whole thing. I couldn’t be natural, I couldn’t flow, I couldn’t forget myself because of you.’\nWhenever you are doing meditation, the very effort that you are doing it, the very idea of succeeding in it, is the barrier. Be conscious of it. Go on doing, and be conscious of it. A day will come... just through patience a day comes when effort is not there. Really, you are not there, only meditation is. It may take a long time. It cannot be predicted, no one can say when it will happen. Because if something is to be achieved by effort, it can be predicted – that if you do this much effort you will\nsucceed – but meditation is going to succeed only when you become effortless. That’s why nothing can be predicted. Nothing can be said about when you will succeed. You may succeed this very moment, and you may not succeed for lives.\nThe whole thing hinges on one thing – when your effort drops and you become spontaneous, when your meditation is not an act but becomes your being, when your meditation is just like love.…\nYou cannot do anything about love, or can you? If you do anything, you falsify it. It will become artificial. It will not go deep. You will not be in it. It will become an acting. Love IS – you cannot do anything about it.\nYou cannot do anything about meditation also. But I don’t mean don’t do anything, because then you will remain whatsoever you are. You have to do something, perfectly conscious that by only doing you will not achieve. Doing will be needed in the beginning. One cannot leave it; one has to go through it. But one has to go through it, one has to transcend it, and an effortless floating has to be achieved.\nThe path is arduous and very contradictory. You cannot find anything more contradictory than meditation. Contradictory because it has to be started as an effort and it has to end as effortlessness. But it happens. You may not be able to conceive logically hot it happens, but in experience it happens. A day comes when you just get fed up with your effort. It falls.\nIt happened to Buddha this way. For six years he was making every effort possible. No human being has been so obsessed with becoming enlightened. He did everything that he could do. He moved from one teacher to another, and whatsoever he was taught, he did it perfectly. That was the problem, because no teacher could say to him, ‘You are not doing well, that’s why you are not achieving.’ That was impossible. He was doing better than any master, so the masters had to confess. They said, ‘This much we have to teach. Beyond this we don’t know, so you go somewhere else.’\nHe was a dangerous disciple – and only dangerous disciples achieve. He studied everything that was possible. Whatsoever he was told, he would do it – absolutely as it was told. And then he would come to the master and say, ‘I have done it, but nothing has happened. So what next?’\nThe teachers would say, ‘You go somewhere else. There is one teacher in the Himalayas – go there.’ Or, ‘There is one teacher in some forest – go there. We don’t know more than this.’\nHe went around and around for six years. He did all that can be done, all that is humanly possible, and then he got fed up. The whole thing appeared futile, fruitless, meaningless. One night he relaxed all efforts. He was sitting under the Bodhi tree, and he said, ’Now everything is finished. In the world there is nothing, and in this spiritual search also there is nothing. Now there is nothing for me to do. Everything is finished. Not only this world, but the other world also. Suddenly all efforts dropped. He was empty. Because when there is nothing to do, the mind cannot move. The mind moves only because there is something to do – some motivation, some goal. The mind moves because something is possible, something can be achieved, the future. If not today then tomorrow, but the possibility is there that one can achieve it – the mind moves.\nThat night Buddha came to a dead point. Really, he died that very moment, because there was no future. Nothing was to be achieved, and nothing could be achieved – ‘I have done everything. The whole world is futile and this whole existence is a nightmare.’ Not only the material world became futile, but the spiritual also. He relaxed. Not that he did something to relax. This is the point to understand: there was nothing to be tense, therefore he relaxed. There was no effort on his part to relax.\nUnder the Bodhi tree he was not trying relaxation. There was nothing to do, nothing to be tense, nothing to desire, no future, no hope. He was absolutely hopeless that night – relaxed. Relaxation happened. You cannot relax, because something or other is still there to be achieved. That goes on stirring your mind; you go on spinning and spinning around and around. Suddenly the spinning stopped, the wheel stopped – Buddha relaxed and fell asleep.\nIn the morning when he awoke, the last star was setting. He looked at the last star disappear, and with that last star disappearing, he disappeared completely, he became an enlightened one. Then people started asking, ‘How did you achieve this? How? What was the method?’\nNow you can understand Buddha’s difficulty. If he said that he had achieved through some methods, then he was wrong, because he achieved only when there was no method. If he said that he had achieved through effort, then he was wrong, because he achieved only when there was no effort. But if he said, ‘Don’t make any effort and you will achieve,’ then too he was wrong, because to his no-effort those six years of effort were the background. Without that effort, that six years’ arduous effort, this state of no-effort could not have been achieved. Only because of that mad effort he came to a peak and there was nowhere further to go; he relaxed and fell down in the valley.\nThis has to be remembered for many reasons. Spiritual effort is the most contradictory phenomenon. Effort has to be made, with full consciousness that nothing can be achieved through effort. Effort has to be made only to achieve no-effort, only to achieve effortlessness. But don’t relax your effort, because if you relax you will never achieve that relaxation which came to Buddha. You go on doing every effort, so automatically a moment comes when just by sheer effort you reach a point where relaxation happens to you.\nFor example, you may take it in a different way. As I see it, in the west, ego has been the central point: the fulfillment of the ego, the development of the ego, the achievement of a strong ego, has been the whole western effort. In the east, it has been how to achieve egolessness, how to be a non-ego, how to forget, surrender, dissolve yourself completely so that you are not. The east has been trying for egolessness. The west has been trying for the perfect ego.\nBut this is the contradictoriness of things: if you don’t have a very developed ego, you cannot surrender. You can surrender only if you have a perfectly clearcut ego. Otherwise you cannot surrender, because who will surrender? So to me, both are half and both are in misery – east and west both. Because the east has taken egolessness, which is the end part, and the beginning part is missing.\nWho will surrender the ego? The peak is not there, so who will create the valley? The valley is created only around a peak. The greater the peak, the deeper the valley. If you don’t have an ego, or a very lukewarm one, surrender is not possible. Or, your surrender will be a lukewarm surrender, just so-so. Nothing will happen out of it; there will be no explosion.\nIn the west, the beginning part has been emphasized. So you can go on growing with your ego. It will create more and more anxiety. And when you have really created it, you don’t know what to do with it, because the end part is not there.\nTo me, the spiritual search is both. Create a very great peak, create a perfect ego, just to dissolve it. That seems absurd – just to dissolve it, just to achieve a deep surrender, just to lose it somewhere. And you cannot lose something which you don’t have. So in my view, humanity has to be trained for these two things together: help everyone to create a perfect ego, a fulfilled ego – but this is only half the journey – and then, help them to surrender it.\nThe greater the peak, the deeper will be the valley. The higher the ego, the deeper you will move in your surrender. And this is for everything. On the spiritual path, remember this continuous contradictoriness. Don’t forget it even for a single moment. Become perfect egoists so that you can surrender, so that you can dissolve, melt. Do every effort that you can do, just to reach a point where effort leaves you and you are totally effortless.\nQuestion 3\nYOU SAID LAST NIGHT THAT THE MORE THE MIND GROWS, THE MORE WE KNOW THAT THE NATURE OF THE MIND IS CONFUSION. BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT THIS GROWTH OF THE MIND ALSO LEADS TO CLARITY?\nWhatsoever I was just saying is related to this.\nYes, it leads to clarity, because only when you have a very mature mind do you become aware that you are confused. Even to become aware that mind is confusion, a very developed mind is needed. Those who are not aware that their mind is confusion are really not mature minds. They are childish, juvenile, still developing. Only a very mature mind can become aware of the quality of the mind, that it is confusion. And when you have developed the mind, only then is meditation possible, because meditation is the opposite goal.\nMeditation means no-mind. But how can you achieve a no-mind if you have not achieved a mind? So achieve a mind just to lose it. And don’t think that if ultimately one has to reach the state of no- mind, then what is the use of achieving a mind? – because if you don’t achieve a mind, the ultimate is not going to happen to you. It can happen only if the mind is there. So I am not against mind, I am not against intellect. Really, I am not against anything. I am for everything, because everything can be used to reach the opposite pole.\nThere is a polarity, and the opposite pole cannot be reached if the polarity is not there. A madman cannot meditate. Why? Because he has no mind. But this no-mind is not the no-mind of Buddha. No-mind can have two dimensions: below mind and above mind. The above mind is also no-mind, and the below mind is also no-mind. You can fall down from the mind: the mind is not there, but it is not meditation. You have to go beyond mind, only then is the Buddha’s no-mind achieved. And always remember it, because they are so similar you can misunderstand the whole thing. They are so similar.\nFor example, a child is innocent. A saint is also innocent – a Jesus or a Krishna – but their innocence is not childish. It is childlike, not childish; because a child is innocent only because he is ignorant.\nHe is innocent only as a negative thing, just the absence. Sooner or later everything will erupt; he is a volcano waiting to erupt. The innocence is just the silence before the volcano erupts.\nA saint is one who has gone beyond. The eruption has happened; the volcano is silent again. But this silence is different. The first silence was very pregnant; something was present there. The silence was just on the surface; deep down that child was getting ready to be disturbed. The saint has passed the disturbance. The cyclone has gone. This silence, the innocence, appears similar, but there is a deep difference.\nSo sometimes an idiot can also appear to be saint-like. And idiots are saint-like. They are not cunning; to be cunning, intelligence is needed. They are not calculating; to be calculating, mind is needed. Idiots are simple, innocent, non-cunning, non-calculating. They cannot deceive anyone. Not that they would not like to; they cannot. The very capacity is not there. They look like saints, and sometimes saints look like idiots, because the same thing has happened again, in a different, altogether different, dimension.\nYou can fall down below the mind: then too a no-mind happens, but it is not meditation. You have simply lost even that mind which was going to become a step towards meditation. So I am not against mind. Develop mind, develop intellect, but remember well – this is just a means, and a means which has to be forsaken, thrown away. It has to be used like a boat. You reach the other shore, you leave the boat. You forget about the boat completely.\nQuestion 4\nWE VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT WE CREATE OUR OWN SUFFERINGS. IN SPITE OF THIS, WHY DO WE CONTINUE CREATING THEM? AND WHEN AND HOW DOES ONE STOP CREATING ONE’S OWN SUFFERING?\nThe first thing, and very basic to be understood, is that whenever you say WE VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT WE CREATE OUR OWN SUFFERING, this is not the case. You never really feel that you are the creator of your own suffering. You may think so, because you have been taught so; because for centuries and centuries teachers have been teaching that you are the creator of your own suffering and no one else is responsible.\nYou have heard these things, you have read these things. They have become your blood and bone, they have become your unconscious conditionings, so sometimes you repeat like a parrot WE CREATE OUR OWN SUFFERING. But this is not your feeling, this is not your realization, because if you realize it, then the other thing is impossible. Then you cannot say, IN SPITE OF THIS, WHY DO WE CONTINUE CREATING IT?\nIf you really feel, and if it is your own feeling that you are the creator of your own suffering, any moment you can stop – unless you want to create it, unless you enjoy it, unless you are a masochist. Then everything is okay, then there is no question. If you say, ‘I enjoy my suffering,’ then it is okay; you can go on creating it. But if you say, ‘I suffer and I want to go beyond it. I want to stop it completely – and I understand that I am the creator,’ then you are wrong. You don’t understand it.\nSocrates is reported to have said that knowledge is virtue. And there has been a long discussion for these two thousand years over whether Socrates is right or wrong – knowledge is virtue. Socrates\nsays that once you know something, you cannot do contrary to it. If you know that anger is suffering, you cannot be angry. This is what Socrates means – knowledge is virtue. You cannot say, ‘I know anger is bad; still I move in it. What to do about it now?’ Socrates says that the first thing is wrong. You don’t know that anger is bad; that’s why you go on moving in it. If you know, you cannot move in it. How can you move against your own knowledge?\nI know that if I put my hand in the fire it is going to be painful. If I know, I cannot put my hand in. But if somebody else has told me, if I have heard through the tradition, if I have read in the scriptures that fire burns, and I have not known fire, and I have not known any similar experience, only then can I put my hand into fire – and that too only once.\nCan you conceive it? That you have put your hand into fire and you have been burned and you have suffered, and again you go and ask, ‘I know that fire burns, but in spite of it I go on putting my hand into the fire. What to do about it?’ Who will believe that you know? And what type of knowledge is this? If your own experience of suffering and burning cannot stop you, nothing is going to stop you. Now there is no possibility, because the last possibility has been missed. But no one can miss it; that is impossible.\nSocrates is right, and all those who have know, they will agree with Socrates – that agreement has a very deep point in it. Once you knowBut remember – the knowledge must be yours. A borrowed\nknowledge won’t do; borrowed knowledge is useless. Unless it is your own experience, it is not going to change you. Others’ experiences are of no help.\nYou have heard that you are the creator of your own suffering, but this is just in the mind. It has not entered your being, it is not your own knowledge. So when you are discussing, you can discuss about it cerebrally, but when the actual phenomenon happens, you will forget, and you will behave in the way you know, not in the way others know.\nWhen you are at ease, cool, collected, silently discussing anger, you can say it is poison, it is a disease, evil. But when someone makes you angry then a complete change occurs. Not it is not an intellectual discussion, now you are involved. And the moment you are involved, you become angry. Later on again, retrospectively, when you again get cool, the memory will come back, your mind will again start functioning, and you will say, ‘That was wrong. It was not good of me to do that. I know anger is wrong.’\nWho is this ‘I’? – just intellect, just the superficial mind. You don’t know – because when someone pushes you into anger, you throw this mind away. It is useful as far as discussion is concerned, but when a real situation arises, only the real knowledge will help. When there is no situation, you can go on. Even in a discussion the real situation can arise. The other can go on contradicting you so much that you become angry and then you will forget.\nReal knowledge means that which has happened to you. You have not heard about it, not read about it, you have not collected information about it – it is your own experience. And then there is no question, because after that you cannot go against it. Not that you will have to make an effort not to go against it; simply you cannot go against it.\nHow can I? When I know this is a wall and I want to go out of this room, how can I try to pass through\nthe wall? I know this is a wall, so I will search for the door. Only a blink man will try to go out through the wall. I have got eyes. I see what is a wall and what is a door.\nBut if I try to enter the wall and tell you, ‘I know very well where the door is, and I know this to be a wall, but in spite of this, how can I stop myself from trying to enter the wall?’ then that means that as far as I am concerned that door looks false. Others have told me that it is the door, but as far as I am concerned, I know that door is false. And others have told me that this is a wall, but as far as I see, I see the door here in this wall, and that is why I try.\nIn this situation you have to make a clearcut distinction between what you know and what you have gathered as knowledge. Don’t rely on information. From the greatest source – even if you collect from the greatest source – information is information. Even if a Buddha says it to you, it is not your own, and it is not going to help you in any way. But you can remain thinking that it is your knowledge, and this misunderstanding will waste your energy, time and life.\nThe basic thing is not to ask what to do so that suffering is not created. The basic thing is to know that you are the creator of your suffering. Next time whenever a real situation arises and you are in suffering, remember to find out whether you are the cause of it. And if you can find out that you are the cause of it, the suffering will disappear, and the same suffering will not appear again – impossible.\nBut don’t deceive yourself. You can – that’s why I say it. When you are suffering you can say, ‘Yes, I know I have created this suffering,’ but deep down you know that someone else has created it. Your wife has created it, your husband has created it, someone else has created it, and this is simply a consolation because you cannot do anything. You console yourself: ‘No one has created it, I have created it myself, and by and by I will stop it.’\nBut knowledge is instant transformation; there is no ‘by and by.’ If you understand that you have created it, it will drop immediately. And it is not going to come up again. If it comes again, it means the understanding has not gone deep.\nSo there is no need to find out what to do, and how to stop. The only need is to go deep and to find out who is really the cause of it. If others are the cause then it cannot be stopped, because you cannot change the whole world. If you are the cause, only then can it be stopped.\nThat’s why I insist that only religion can lead humanity towards non-suffering. Nothing else can lead, because everyone else believes that the suffering is caused by others; only religion says that suffering is caused by you. So religion makes you the master of your destiny. You are the cause of your suffering, hence you can be the cause of your bliss.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7986","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/>Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Moving to the roots</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7986 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Vigyan_Bhairav_Tantra_Vol_2/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

UNCHANGED, UNTRANSFORMED. BUT IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THE RIGHT FOOD, RIGHT
LABOUR, RIGHT SLEEP, RIGHT ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT
FACTORS FOR INNER TRANSFORMATION? ISN’T IT A MISTAKE TO IGNORE THE OUTER
COMPLETELY?</p><p><br></p><p>THE OUTER CANNOT CHANGE THE INNER, but the outer can help, or it can
hinder. The outer can create a situation in which the inner can explode
more easily. The thing to be remembered is this: that the outer
transformation is not the inner. Even if you have done everything and
the situation is there, the inner is not going to explode. The situation
is necessary, it is helpful, but it is not the transformation. And those
who get involved with the outer.…</p><p><br></p><p>The outer is a vast phenomenon. You can go on changing for lives and
you will never be satisfied, and something or other will remain to be
changed, because unless the inner changes, the outer can never be
perfect. You can go on changing it and polishing it and conditioning it.
You will never feel satisfied. You will never come to a situation where
you can feel, ‘Now, the field is ready.’ So many have wasted their
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>If your mind becomes obsessed with the outer – with the food, with
the clothes, with the behavior... I am not saying to neglect them. No,
what I am saying is, don’t get obsessed with them. They can be helpful,
but they can become great hindrances if your mind becomes obsessed. Then
it becomes an escape, then you are just postponing the inner change. And
you can go on changing the outer. The inner is not even touched by it,
the inner remains the same.</p><p>You might have heard one old Indian fable. In ‘Panchtantra’ it is
said that a mouse was very much afraid of a cat; constantly in fear,
anxiety. He couldn’t sleep: he would dream about the cat and he would
tremble. A magician, just out of pity, transformed the mouse into a cat.
The outer was changed, but immediately the mouse within the cat now
became afraid of a dog. The anxiety was the same; only the object had
changed. Previously it was the cat, now it was the dog. The trembling
continued, the anguish remained, the dreams were still of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>So the magician changed the cat into a dog. Immediately the dog
became afraid of the tiger, because the mouse within remained the same.
The mouse was not changed; only bodies, the outer. The same anxiety, the
same disease, the same fear remained. The magician changed the dog into
a tiger. Immediately the mouse within the tiger became afraid of a
hunter. So the magician said to the mouse, ‘Now be a mouse again,
because I can change your bodies, I cannot change you. You have the
heart of a mouse, so what can I do?’ The heart of a mouse.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go on changing the outer, but the heart of the mouse remains
the same. And that heart creates the problems. The shape will change,
the form will change, but the substance will remain the same. And it
makes no difference whether you are afraid of a cat, or of a dog, or of
a tiger. The question is not of whom you are afraid; the question is
that you are afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>The emphasis is – my emphasis is – that you must remain aware that
your outer effort should not become a substitute for the inner
transformation. One thing. Take every help that can be taken. It is good
to have right food, but it is nonsense and madness to become obsessed
with food. It is good to have right behavior, but it is neurotic to
become obsessed with it. You should not become mad about anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there are many sects of sannyasins who are obsessed with
food. The whole day they are thinking only of food: what to eat and what
not to eat; who should prepare the food and who should not prepare the
food. Once I was travelling with a sannyasin. He would take only milk,
and only cow’s milk, and only from those cows which were white;
otherwise he would go without food. This man is mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this: that the inner is important, significant. The outer is
helpful, it is good, but you must not become focused with it. It must
not become so important that the inner is forgotten. The inner must
remain the inner and the central, and the outer, if possible, should be
changed just as a help.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ignore it completely. There is no need to ignore it, because
really the outer is also part of the inner. It is not something opposite
to it, it is not something contrary to it, it is not something imposed
upon you – it is you. But the inner is the central, and the outer is the
periphery. So give as much importance as a periphery needs, as a
circumference needs, as a boundary needs – but the boundary is not the
house. So take care of it, but don’t become mad after it.</p><p><br></p><p>Our mind is always trying to find escapes. If you can become involved
with food, with sex, with clothes, with the body, your mind will be at
ease, because now you are not going towards the inner. Now there is no
need to change the mind. Now there is no need to destroy the mind, to go
beyond the mind. With the change of food, the same mind can exist. You
may eat this or that – the same mind can exist. Only when you move
inwards... the more inner you reach, the more this mind which you have
has to cease. The inward path is the path towards no-mind.</p><p>The mind becomes afraid. It will try to find some escape – something
to do with the outer. Then the mind can exist as it is. Whatsoever you
do makes no difference. It is irrelevant what you do – this mind can
exist, and this mind can find ways for how to remain the same. And
sometimes, when you struggle with the natural outlet, your mind will
find some perverted outlets which are more dangerous. Rather than being
a help, they will become hindrances.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasrudin fell down his stairs. His leg was
fractured, so it was put in a plaster cast, and he was told that for
three months he was not to go up and down the stairs. After three months
he came to the doctor and the plaster was removed. Mulla asked, ‘Now can
I go up and down the stairs?’</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor said, ‘Now you can go. You are absolutely okay.’</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, ‘Now I am so happy, doctor. You cannot believe how happy
I am. It was so awkward to go up and down the drain-pipe the whole day.
For three months, every day going up and down the drain-pipe – it was so
awkward, and the whole neighborhood was laughing at me. But you had told
me not to go up and down the stairs, so I had to find a way.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is what everyone is doing. If one outlet is blocked, then a
perversion is bound to happen. And you don’t know the ways of the mind –
=they are very cunning and very subtle. People come to me with their
problems. The problem seems to be obvious – it is not. All problems seem
to be obvious, clear – it is not so. Deep down something else is hidden,
and unless that something else is known, discarded, gone beyond, the
problem will remain. It will change its shape.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone is smoking too much and he wants to stop it. But smoking in
itself is not a problem; the problem is something else. You can stop
smoking, but the problem will remain, and it will have to come out in
something else. When do you smoke? When you are anxious, nervous, you
start smoking, and smoking helps you. You feel more confident, you feel
more relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by stopping the smoking, your nervousness is not going to
change. You will feel nervous, you will feel anxious; the anxiety will
come. Then you will do something else. And you can find something which
is a beautiful substitute; it looks so different. You can do anything.
You can just use a mantra instead of smoking, and whenever you feel
nervous you can say, RAM, RAM, RAM – anything continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you doing with smoke? It is a mantra. You smoke in and out,
you smoke in and out – it becomes a repetitive thing. Because of the
repetition you feel relaxed. Repeat anything and the same will happen.
But if you are using a mantra and saying, RAM, RAM, RAM, no one is going
to say that you are doing something wrong. And the problem is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem has not changed; only you have changed the trick.
Previously you were doing it with smoke; now you are doing it with a
word. Repetition helps; any nonsense thing will help. You just have to
repeat it continuously. When you repeat a thing it gives relaxation,
because it creates a sort of boredom. Boredom is relaxing. You can do
anything that creates a sort of boredom. Boredom is relaxing. You can do
anything that creates boredom.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are smoking, everyone will say that it is wrong. And if you
are chanting a mantra, no one is going to say that it is wrong. But if
the problem is the same, I am saying that it is also wrong – rather,</p><p>more dangerous than the previous one, because with smoking you were
aware that it was wrong. Now, with this chanting of the mantra you are
not aware, and this disease that you are unaware is more dangerous and
more harmful.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do anything on the surface, but unless deeper roots are
changed, nothing happens. So with the outer remember this: be aware of
it, and move from the surface towards the roots and find the root – why
are you nervous? Someone is eating too much food. It can be stopped. You
can force yourself to not eat too much. But why is one eating too much
food? Why? Because this is not a bodily need, so somewhere the mind is
interfering. Something has to be done with the mind; it is not a
question of the body. Why do you go on stuffing yourself?</p><p><br></p><p>Too much obsession with food is a love need. If you are not loved
well, you will eat more. If you are loved and you can love, you will eat
less. Whenever someone loves you, you cannot eat more. Love fills you so
much, you don’t feel empty. When there is not love, you feel empty;
something has to be stuffed in – you go on forcing food.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are reasons, root reasons, for it, because the first
encounter of the child with love and food is simultaneous. From the same
breast, from the same mother, he gets food and love – food and love
become associated. If the mother is loving, the child will never take
too much mild. There is no need. He is always secure in his love; he
knows that whenever there is a need the food will come, the milk will be
there, the mother will be there. He feels secure. But if the mother is
non-loving, then he is insecure. Then he doesn’t know whether, when he
feels hungry, food will come, because there is no love. He will eat
more. And this will continue. It will become an unconscious root.</p><p><br></p><p>So you can go on changing your food – eat this, eat that, don’t eat
this – but it makes no difference, because the basic root remains there.
Then if you stop stuffing yourself with food, you will start stuffing
with something else. And there are many ways. If you stop eating too
much you may start accumulating money. Then again you have to be filled
by something; then you go on accumulating money.</p><p><br></p><p>Observe deeply, and you will see that a person who accumulates money
is never in love, cannot be, because the money accumulation is really a
substitute. With money he will feel secure now. When you are loved there
is no insecurity; in love all fears disappear. In love there is no
future, no past. This moment is enough, this very moment is eternity.
You are accepted. There is no anxiety for the future, for what will
happen tomorrow – there is no tomorrow in love.</p><p><br></p><p>But if love is not there, then the tomorrow is there. What will
happen? Accumulate money, because you cannot rely on any person. So rely
on things, rely on money and wealth. There are people who say, ‘Donate
your money. Don’t accumulate money. Be non-attached to money.’ But these
are superficial things, because the inner need will remain the same –
then he will start accumulating something else.</p><p><br></p><p>Stop one outlet and you will have to create another – unless roots
are destroyed. So don’t be too much concerned with the outer. Be aware
of whatsoever your outer personality is. Be aware of it, be alert, and
from the periphery always move towards the roots to find what the cause
is there. Howsoever disturbing, move to the roots. Once you come to know
the roots, once the roots are exposed.… Remember this law: the roots can
exist only in darkness – not only the roots of trees, but the roots of
anything. They can exist only in darkness. Once they are brought to
light, they die.</p><p>So move with your periphery; dig it deep and go to the roots, and
bring the roots to consciousness, to light. Once you have come to the
root, it simply disappears. You have not to do anything about it. You
have to do something only because you don’t know what the problem is. A
problem rightly understood disappears. Right understanding of a problem,
a root understanding of the problem, becomes the disappearance of it.
The first thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: whatsoever you do is superficial; it is not you in
your totality. So don’t judge a man by his actions, because action is
very atomic. You see a person in anger, and you can judge that this man
is filled with hatred, violence, vengeance. But a moment later the anger
disappears; the man becomes as loving as possible, and a different
perfume, a different flowering, comes to his face. The anger was atomic.
Don’t judge the whole man. But this love is also atomic. Don’t judge the
whole man by this love.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you have done is not your total sum. Your actions remain
just atomic – part of you of course, but your totality transcends them.
You can be different immediately. And whatsoever is known about you by
your behavior, by your actions, by your doings, you can contradict. You
may have been a saint: you can become a sinner this very moment. No one
could imagine that you, a saint, could do this. You can do it. It is not
inconceivable. You may have been a sinner up to this moment, and the
next moment you can jump out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying is, your inner is so vast and so great that by your
outer it cannot be judged. Your outer remains superficial, accidental. I
will repeat it. Your outer remains accidental, your inner is the
essence. So remember to uncover the inner, and don’t get entangled with
the outer.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more: outer is always of the past. It is always dead,
because whatsoever you have done, you have done. It is always of the
past, it is never alive. The inner is always alive, it is here and now,
and the outer is always dead. If you know me – whatsoever I have done
and said – you know my past, you don’t know me. I am here, the living.
That is my inner point, and whatsoever you know about me is just the
outer. It is dead, it is no more there.</p><p><br></p><p>Observe it in your own consciousness. Whatsoever you have done is not
a bondage on you. It is no more really; it is just a memory. And you are
greater than that. Your infinite possibilities are there. It was only
accidental that you are a sinner or you are a saint. It was only
accidental that you are a Christian or a Hindu. But your innermost being
is not accidental; it is essential.</p><p><br></p><p>The emphasis on the inner is the emphasis on the essential. And that
inner remains free, it is freedom. The outer is a slavery, because you
can know the outer only when it has happened; then you cannot do
anything about it. What can you do about your past? It cannot be undone,
you cannot move backwards. You cannot do anything with the past; it is a
slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand it rightly, then you can understand the theory of
karma, the theory of actions. This theory – one of the most essential
parts of Hindu realization – is that unless you go beyond karmas, you
are not free; unless you have gone beyond all actions, you will remain
in bondage. Don’t pay much attention to the outer, don’t get obsessed
with it. Use it as a help, but continuously remembering that the inner
has to be discovered.</p><p><br></p><p>These techniques we are discussing here are for the inner, for how to
discover it. I will tell you one thing. There have been traditions<span class=s4></span>For example, one of the most important religious
traditions has</p><p>been Jainism. But Jainism pays too much attention to the outer; too
much, so much so that they completely forget that there is anything like
meditation, that there is anything like a science of yoga. They forget
it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>They are obsessed with food, with clothes, with sleep, with
everything – but with no effort towards meditation. Not that in their
tradition originally there was no meditation, because no religion can be
born without it, but they got obsessed somewhere with the outer. It
became so important that they forgot completely that this whole
situation is just a help; it is not the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>What you eat is not the goal. What you are is the goal. It is good if
your eating habits help you to uncover the being. It is good. But if you
become just obsessed with eating, continuously thinking about it, then
you have missed the point. Then you are a food-addict. You are mad,
neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>ISN’T IT TRUE THAT ALL MEDITATION TECHNIQUES ARE REALLY DOINGS WHICH
LEAD THE SEEKER TO HIS BEING?</p><p><br></p><p>In a way, yes; and in a deeper way, no. Meditation techniques are
doings, because you are advised to do something. Even to meditate is to
do something, even to sit silently is to do something, even to not do
anything is a sort of doing. So in a superficial way, all meditation
techniques are doings. But in a deeper way they are not, because if you
succeed in them, the doing disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Only in the beginning it appears like an effort. If you succeed in
it, the effort disappears and the whole thing becomes spontaneous and
effortless. If you succeed in it, it is not a doing. No effort on your
part is needed then. It becomes just like breathing – it is there. But
in the beginning the effort is bound to be, because the mind cannot do
anything which is not an effort. If you tell it to be effortless, the
whole thing seems absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen, where much emphasis is paid to effortlessness, the masters
say to the disciples, ‘Just sit. Don’t do anything.’ And the disciple
tries. Of course, what can you do other than trying? The disciple tries
to just sit, and he tries to just sit, and he tries to not do anything,
and then the master hits him on his head with his staff and he says,
‘Don’t do this! I have not told you to try to sit, because that becomes
an effort. And don’t try not to do anything, because that is a sort of
doing. Simply sit!’</p><p><br></p><p>If I tell you to simply sit, what will you do? You will do something,
which will make it not a simple sitting; an effort will enter. You will
be sitting with an effort; a strain will be there. You cannot simply
sit. It looks strange, but the moment you try to sit simply, it has
become complex. The very effort to simply sit makes it complex. So what
to do?</p><p><br></p><p>Years pass, and the disciple goes on sitting and being blamed,
condemned by the master that he is missing the point. But he simply goes
on, goes on, goes on, and every day he is a failure, because the effort
is there. And he cannot deceive the master. But one day, just patiently
sitting, even this consciousness to sit simply disappears. One day
suddenly he is sitting – like a tree or like a rock – not doing
anything. And then the master says, ‘This is the right posture. Now you
have attained it. Now remember this. This is the way to sit.’ But it
takes patience and long effort to achieve effortlessness.</p><p>In the beginning, effort will be there, doing will be there, but only
in the beginning as a necessary evil. But you have to remember
constantly that you have to go beyond it. A moment must come when you
are not doing anything about meditation – just being there and it
happens; just sitting or standing and it happens; not doing anything,
just being aware, it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>All these techniques are just to help you to come to an effortless
moment. The inner transformation, the inner realization, cannot happen
through effort, because effort is a sort of tension. With effort you
cannot be relaxed totally; the effort will become a barrier. With this
background in mind, if you make effort, by and by you will become
capable of leaving it also.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like swimming. If you know about swimming, you know that
in the beginning you have to make effort – but only in the beginning.
Once you know the feel of it, once you know what it is, the effort has
gone; you can swim effortlessly. And even a good swimmer cannot say what
swimming is, what exactly he is doing. He cannot explain to you what he
is doing. Really, he is not doing anything. He is simply allowing
himself to be in a deep responsive relationship with the water, with the
river. He is not doing anything really. And if he is still doing, he is
still not an expert swimmer – he is still amateur, still learning.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you one anecdote. In Burma, one Buddhist monk was ordered
to make a design for the new temple, particularly for the gate. So he
was making many designs. He had one very talented disciple, so he told
that disciple to be near him. While he made the design the disciple was
simply to watch, and if he liked it he had to say that it was okay, it
was right. If he didn’t like it then he had to say no. And the master
said, ‘When you say yes, only then will I send the design. If you go on
saying no, I will discard the design and will create a new one.’</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of designs were discarded in this way. Three months passed.
Even the master became afraid, but he had given his word so he had to
keep it. The disciple was there, the master would make the design, and
then the disciple would say no. The master would start another one.</p><p><br></p><p>One day the ink was just about to be finished, so the master said,
‘Go out and find more ink.’ The disciple went out. The master forgot
him, his presence, and became effortless. His presence was the problem.
The idea was constantly in his mind that the disciple was there,
judging. He was constantly wondering whether he was going to like it or
not, whether he would discard it again. This created an inner anxiety
and the master could not be spontaneous.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple went out. The design was completed. The disciple came in
and he said ‘Wonderful! But why couldn’t you do it before?’</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, ‘Now I understand why – because you were here.
Because of you – I was making an effort to get your approval. The effort
destroyed the whole thing. I couldn’t be natural, I couldn’t flow, I
couldn’t forget myself because of you.’</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are doing meditation, the very effort that you are doing
it, the very idea of succeeding in it, is the barrier. Be conscious of
it. Go on doing, and be conscious of it. A day will come... just through
patience a day comes when effort is not there. Really, you are not
there, only meditation is. It may take a long time. It cannot be
predicted, no one can say when it will happen. Because if something is
to be achieved by effort, it can be predicted – that if you do this much
effort you will</p><p>succeed – but meditation is going to succeed only when you become
effortless. That’s why nothing can be predicted. Nothing can be said
about when you will succeed. You may succeed this very moment, and you
may not succeed for lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole thing hinges on one thing – when your effort drops and you
become spontaneous, when your meditation is not an act but becomes your
being, when your meditation is just like love.…</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot do anything about love, or can you? If you do anything,
you falsify it. It will become artificial. It will not go deep. You will
not be in it. It will become an acting. Love IS – you cannot do anything
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot do anything about meditation also. But I don’t mean don’t
do anything, because then you will remain whatsoever you are. You have
to do something, perfectly conscious that by only doing you will not
achieve. Doing will be needed in the beginning. One cannot leave it; one
has to go through it. But one has to go through it, one has to transcend
it, and an effortless floating has to be achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>The path is arduous and very contradictory. You cannot find anything
more contradictory than meditation. Contradictory because it has to be
started as an effort and it has to end as effortlessness. But it
happens. You may not be able to conceive logically hot it happens, but
in experience it happens. A day comes when you just get fed up with your
effort. It falls.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to Buddha this way. For six years he was making every
effort possible. No human being has been so obsessed with becoming
enlightened. He did everything that he could do. He moved from one
teacher to another, and whatsoever he was taught, he did it perfectly.
That was the problem, because no teacher could say to him, ‘You are not
doing well, that’s why you are not achieving.’ That was impossible. He
was doing better than any master, so the masters had to confess. They
said, ‘This much we have to teach. Beyond this we don’t know, so you go
somewhere else.’</p><p><br></p><p>He was a dangerous disciple – and only dangerous disciples achieve.
He studied everything that was possible. Whatsoever he was told, he
would do it – absolutely as it was told. And then he would come to the
master and say, ‘I have done it, but nothing has happened. So what
next?’</p><p><br></p><p>The teachers would say, ‘You go somewhere else. There is one teacher
in the Himalayas – go there.’ Or, ‘There is one teacher in some forest –
go there. We don’t know more than this.’</p><p><br></p><p>He went around and around for six years. He did all that can be done,
all that is humanly possible, and then he got fed up. The whole thing
appeared futile, fruitless, meaningless. One night he relaxed all
efforts. He was sitting under the Bodhi tree, and he said, ’Now
everything is finished. In the world there is nothing, and in this
spiritual search also there is nothing. Now there is nothing for me to
do. Everything is finished. Not only this world, but the other world
also. Suddenly all efforts dropped. He was empty. Because when there is
nothing to do, the mind cannot move. The mind moves only because there
is something to do – some motivation, some goal. The mind moves because
something is possible, something can be achieved, the future. If not
today then tomorrow, but the possibility is there that one can achieve
it – the mind moves.</p><p>That night Buddha came to a dead point. Really, he died that very
moment, because there was no future. Nothing was to be achieved, and
nothing could be achieved – ‘I have done everything. The whole world is
futile and this whole existence is a nightmare.’ Not only the material
world became futile, but the spiritual also. He relaxed. Not that he did
something to relax. This is the point to understand: there was nothing
to be tense, therefore he relaxed. There was no effort on his part to
relax.</p><p><br></p><p>Under the Bodhi tree he was not trying relaxation. There was nothing
to do, nothing to be tense, nothing to desire, no future, no hope. He
was absolutely hopeless that night – relaxed. Relaxation happened. You
cannot relax, because something or other is still there to be achieved.
That goes on stirring your mind; you go on spinning and spinning around
and around. Suddenly the spinning stopped, the wheel stopped – Buddha
relaxed and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning when he awoke, the last star was setting. He looked at
the last star disappear, and with that last star disappearing, he
disappeared completely, he became an enlightened one. Then people
started asking, ‘How did you achieve this? How? What was the
method?’</p><p><br></p><p>Now you can understand Buddha’s difficulty. If he said that he had
achieved through some methods, then he was wrong, because he achieved
only when there was no method. If he said that he had achieved through
effort, then he was wrong, because he achieved only when there was no
effort. But if he said, ‘Don’t make any effort and you will achieve,’
then too he was wrong, because to his no-effort those six years of
effort were the background. Without that effort, that six years’ arduous
effort, this state of no-effort could not have been achieved. Only
because of that mad effort he came to a peak and there was nowhere
further to go; he relaxed and fell down in the valley.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be remembered for many reasons. Spiritual effort is the
most contradictory phenomenon. Effort has to be made, with full
consciousness that nothing can be achieved through effort. Effort has to
be made only to achieve no-effort, only to achieve effortlessness. But
don’t relax your effort, because if you relax you will never achieve
that relaxation which came to Buddha. You go on doing every effort, so
automatically a moment comes when just by sheer effort you reach a point
where relaxation happens to you.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you may take it in a different way. As I see it, in the
west, ego has been the central point: the fulfillment of the ego, the
development of the ego, the achievement of a strong ego, has been the
whole western effort. In the east, it has been how to achieve
egolessness, how to be a non-ego, how to forget, surrender, dissolve
yourself completely so that you are not. The east has been trying for
egolessness. The west has been trying for the perfect ego.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the contradictoriness of things: if you don’t have a very
developed ego, you cannot surrender. You can surrender only if you have
a perfectly clearcut ego. Otherwise you cannot surrender, because who
will surrender? So to me, both are half and both are in misery – east
and west both. Because the east has taken egolessness, which is the end
part, and the beginning part is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Who will surrender the ego? The peak is not there, so who will create
the valley? The valley is created only around a peak. The greater the
peak, the deeper the valley. If you don’t have an ego, or a very
lukewarm one, surrender is not possible. Or, your surrender will be a
lukewarm surrender, just so-so. Nothing will happen out of it; there
will be no explosion.</p><p>In the west, the beginning part has been emphasized. So you can go on
growing with your ego. It will create more and more anxiety. And when
you have really created it, you don’t know what to do with it, because
the end part is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, the spiritual search is both. Create a very great peak, create
a perfect ego, just to dissolve it. That seems absurd – just to dissolve
it, just to achieve a deep surrender, just to lose it somewhere. And you
cannot lose something which you don’t have. So in my view, humanity has
to be trained for these two things together: help everyone to create a
perfect ego, a fulfilled ego – but this is only half the journey – and
then, help them to surrender it.</p><p><br></p><p>The greater the peak, the deeper will be the valley. The higher the
ego, the deeper you will move in your surrender. And this is for
everything. On the spiritual path, remember this continuous
contradictoriness. Don’t forget it even for a single moment. Become
perfect egoists so that you can surrender, so that you can dissolve,
melt. Do every effort that you can do, just to reach a point where
effort leaves you and you are totally effortless.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID LAST NIGHT THAT THE MORE THE MIND GROWS, THE MORE WE KNOW
THAT THE NATURE OF THE MIND IS CONFUSION. BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT THIS
GROWTH OF THE MIND ALSO LEADS TO CLARITY?</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever I was just saying is related to this.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it leads to clarity, because only when you have a very mature
mind do you become aware that you are confused. Even to become aware
that mind is confusion, a very developed mind is needed. Those who are
not aware that their mind is confusion are really not mature minds. They
are childish, juvenile, still developing. Only a very mature mind can
become aware of the quality of the mind, that it is confusion. And when
you have developed the mind, only then is meditation possible, because
meditation is the opposite goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation means no-mind. But how can you achieve a no-mind if you
have not achieved a mind? So achieve a mind just to lose it. And don’t
think that if ultimately one has to reach the state of no- mind, then
what is the use of achieving a mind? – because if you don’t achieve a
mind, the ultimate is not going to happen to you. It can happen only if
the mind is there. So I am not against mind, I am not against intellect.
Really, I am not against anything. I am for everything, because
everything can be used to reach the opposite pole.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a polarity, and the opposite pole cannot be reached if the
polarity is not there. A madman cannot meditate. Why? Because he has no
mind. But this no-mind is not the no-mind of Buddha. No-mind can have
two dimensions: below mind and above mind. The above mind is also
no-mind, and the below mind is also no-mind. You can fall down from the
mind: the mind is not there, but it is not meditation. You have to go
beyond mind, only then is the Buddha’s no-mind achieved. And always
remember it, because they are so similar you can misunderstand the whole
thing. They are so similar.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a child is innocent. A saint is also innocent – a Jesus
or a Krishna – but their innocence is not childish. It is childlike, not
childish; because a child is innocent only because he is ignorant.</p><p>He is innocent only as a negative thing, just the absence. Sooner or
later everything will erupt; he is a volcano waiting to erupt. The
innocence is just the silence before the volcano erupts.</p><p><br></p><p>A saint is one who has gone beyond. The eruption has happened; the
volcano is silent again. But this silence is different. The first
silence was very pregnant; something was present there. The silence was
just on the surface; deep down that child was getting ready to be
disturbed. The saint has passed the disturbance. The cyclone has gone.
This silence, the innocence, appears similar, but there is a deep
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>So sometimes an idiot can also appear to be saint-like. And idiots
are saint-like. They are not cunning; to be cunning, intelligence is
needed. They are not calculating; to be calculating, mind is needed.
Idiots are simple, innocent, non-cunning, non-calculating. They cannot
deceive anyone. Not that they would not like to; they cannot. The very
capacity is not there. They look like saints, and sometimes saints look
like idiots, because the same thing has happened again, in a different,
altogether different, dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>You can fall down below the mind: then too a no-mind happens, but it
is not meditation. You have simply lost even that mind which was going
to become a step towards meditation. So I am not against mind. Develop
mind, develop intellect, but remember well – this is just a means, and a
means which has to be forsaken, thrown away. It has to be used like a
boat. You reach the other shore, you leave the boat. You forget about
the boat completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>WE VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT WE CREATE OUR OWN SUFFERINGS. IN SPITE OF
THIS, WHY DO WE CONTINUE CREATING THEM? AND WHEN AND HOW DOES ONE STOP
CREATING ONE’S OWN SUFFERING?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing, and very basic to be understood, is that whenever
you say WE VERY OFTEN FEEL THAT WE CREATE OUR OWN SUFFERING, this is not
the case. You never really feel that you are the creator of your own
suffering. You may think so, because you have been taught so; because
for centuries and centuries teachers have been teaching that you are the
creator of your own suffering and no one else is responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard these things, you have read these things. They have
become your blood and bone, they have become your unconscious
conditionings, so sometimes you repeat like a parrot WE CREATE OUR OWN
SUFFERING. But this is not your feeling, this is not your realization,
because if you realize it, then the other thing is impossible. Then you
cannot say, IN SPITE OF THIS, WHY DO WE CONTINUE CREATING IT?</p><p><br></p><p>If you really feel, and if it is your own feeling that you are the
creator of your own suffering, any moment you can stop – unless you want
to create it, unless you enjoy it, unless you are a masochist. Then
everything is okay, then there is no question. If you say, ‘I enjoy my
suffering,’ then it is okay; you can go on creating it. But if you say,
‘I suffer and I want to go beyond it. I want to stop it completely – and
I understand that I am the creator,’ then you are wrong. You don’t
understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates is reported to have said that knowledge is virtue. And there
has been a long discussion for these two thousand years over whether
Socrates is right or wrong – knowledge is virtue. Socrates</p><p>says that once you know something, you cannot do contrary to it. If
you know that anger is suffering, you cannot be angry. This is what
Socrates means – knowledge is virtue. You cannot say, ‘I know anger is
bad; still I move in it. What to do about it now?’ Socrates says that
the first thing is wrong. You don’t know that anger is bad; that’s why
you go on moving in it. If you know, you cannot move in it. How can you
move against your own knowledge?</p><p><br></p><p>I know that if I put my hand in the fire it is going to be painful.
If I know, I cannot put my hand in. But if somebody else has told me, if
I have heard through the tradition, if I have read in the scriptures
that fire burns, and I have not known fire, and I have not known any
similar experience, only then can I put my hand into fire – and that too
only once.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you conceive it? That you have put your hand into fire and you
have been burned and you have suffered, and again you go and ask, ‘I
know that fire burns, but in spite of it I go on putting my hand into
the fire. What to do about it?’ Who will believe that you know? And what
type of knowledge is this? If your own experience of suffering and
burning cannot stop you, nothing is going to stop you. Now there is no
possibility, because the last possibility has been missed. But no one
can miss it; that is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates is right, and all those who have know, they will agree with
Socrates – that agreement has a very deep point in it. Once you
know<span class=s4></span>But remember – the knowledge must be yours.
A borrowed</p><p>knowledge won’t do; borrowed knowledge is useless. Unless it is your
own experience, it is not going to change you. Others’ experiences are
of no help.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard that you are the creator of your own suffering, but
this is just in the mind. It has not entered your being, it is not your
own knowledge. So when you are discussing, you can discuss about it
cerebrally, but when the actual phenomenon happens, you will forget, and
you will behave in the way you know, not in the way others know.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are at ease, cool, collected, silently discussing anger, you
can say it is poison, it is a disease, evil. But when someone makes you
angry then a complete change occurs. Not it is not an intellectual
discussion, now you are involved. And the moment you are involved, you
become angry. Later on again, retrospectively, when you again get cool,
the memory will come back, your mind will again start functioning, and
you will say, ‘That was wrong. It was not good of me to do that. I know
anger is wrong.’</p><p><br></p><p>Who is this ‘I’? – just intellect, just the superficial mind. You
don’t know – because when someone pushes you into anger, you throw this
mind away. It is useful as far as discussion is concerned, but when a
real situation arises, only the real knowledge will help. When there is
no situation, you can go on. Even in a discussion the real situation can
arise. The other can go on contradicting you so much that you become
angry and then you will forget.</p><p><br></p><p>Real knowledge means that which has happened to you. You have not
heard about it, not read about it, you have not collected information
about it – it is your own experience. And then there is no question,
because after that you cannot go against it. Not that you will have to
make an effort not to go against it; simply you cannot go against
it.</p><p><br></p><p>How can I? When I know this is a wall and I want to go out of this
room, how can I try to pass through</p><p>the wall? I know this is a wall, so I will search for the door. Only
a blink man will try to go out through the wall. I have got eyes. I see
what is a wall and what is a door.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I try to enter the wall and tell you, ‘I know very well where
the door is, and I know this to be a wall, but in spite of this, how can
I stop myself from trying to enter the wall?’ then that means that as
far as I am concerned that door looks false. Others have told me that it
is the door, but as far as I am concerned, I know that door is false.
And others have told me that this is a wall, but as far as I see, I see
the door here in this wall, and that is why I try.</p><p><br></p><p>In this situation you have to make a clearcut distinction between
what you know and what you have gathered as knowledge. Don’t rely on
information. From the greatest source – even if you collect from the
greatest source – information is information. Even if a Buddha says it
to you, it is not your own, and it is not going to help you in any way.
But you can remain thinking that it is your knowledge, and this
misunderstanding will waste your energy, time and life.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic thing is not to ask what to do so that suffering is not
created. The basic thing is to know that you are the creator of your
suffering. Next time whenever a real situation arises and you are in
suffering, remember to find out whether you are the cause of it. And if
you can find out that you are the cause of it, the suffering will
disappear, and the same suffering will not appear again –
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t deceive yourself. You can – that’s why I say it. When you
are suffering you can say, ‘Yes, I know I have created this suffering,’
but deep down you know that someone else has created it. Your wife has
created it, your husband has created it, someone else has created it,
and this is simply a consolation because you cannot do anything. You
console yourself: ‘No one has created it, I have created it myself, and
by and by I will stop it.’</p><p><br></p><p>But knowledge is instant transformation; there is no ‘by and by.’ If
you understand that you have created it, it will drop immediately. And
it is not going to come up again. If it comes again, it means the
understanding has not gone deep.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no need to find out what to do, and how to stop. The only
need is to go deep and to find out who is really the cause of it. If
others are the cause then it cannot be stopped, because you cannot
change the whole world. If you are the cause, only then can it be
stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I insist that only religion can lead humanity towards
non-suffering. Nothing else can lead, because everyone else believes
that the suffering is caused by others; only religion says that
suffering is caused by you. So religion makes you the master of your
destiny. You are the cause of your suffering, hence you can be the cause
of your bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

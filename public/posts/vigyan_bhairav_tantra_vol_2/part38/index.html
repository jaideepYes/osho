IT SEEMS THAT WE NEED TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THESE TECHNIQUES. WERE TECHNIQUES LIKE THESE MEANT FOR VERY ADVANCED PERSONS WHO COULD JUST BECOME COSMIC AT A MERE SUGGESTION?\nSuch techniques were meant, not for very advanced persons, but for very innocent persons – simple, innocent, trusting. Then just a suggestion is enough. You have to have something to do because you cannot trust.You don’t have faith. Unless you do something, nothing can happen to you because you believe in action. If something happens to you suddenly without any doing on your part, you will be scared and you will not believe it. You may even bypass it; you may not even record in the mind that it happened. Unless you DO, you cannot feel something happening to you – this is the way of the ego. But for an innocent person, for an innocent, open mind, just a suggestion is enough. Why? Because really, the innermost being is not something to be achieved in the future – it is here and now, it is already the case. Whatsoever is to be attained is here, present in you right this very moment. If you can trust without any effort, it can become revealed. It is not a question of time, of you having to work it out. It is not somewhere far away that you have to travel to. It is you. You may call it God, you may call it nirvana or whatsoever you like – it is you already. So even a suggestion\n, if believed totally, can reveal it to you. That’s why so much significance is given to SHRADDHA, trust, faith. If a person can believe in the master, just a hint, a suggestion, an indication – and in a flash everything will be revealed.\nThe basic point to be understood is this: there are things which you cannot attain right now because time will be needed to produce them. They are not with you. If I give you a seed, it cannot immediately become a tree. Time will be needed, and you will have to wait and work. Then the seed cannot become the tree immediately. But you are really the tree already. It is not a seed which has to be worked, it is a tree hidden in darkness, it is a tree which is covered, it is a tree which you are inattentive too – that’s all. Your inattention is the cover. You are not looking at it, that’s all. You are looking somewhere else and that’s why you are missing it. In a trusting moment the master can tell you, just by a suggestion, that it is here. And if you can believe, if you can look in that dimension in trust, it will be revealed to you.\nThese techniques are not for advanced people; they are for simple, innocent people. Advanced people are, in a way, difficult. They are not innocent, they have been working, they have attained something, and they have a subtle ego behind it. They know something so they are not innocent, they cannot believe. You will have to argue and convince them – and then too they will have to make some efforts. By an innocent mind, I mean a mind which is not arguing. It is just like a small child. The child goes with his father hand in hand, he is not afraid. Whatsoever the father is leading, he must be leading in the right direction. The father knows – so the child need not worry about it. He is not thinking of the future, what is going to happen is not his concern. He is enjoying the very journey; the end is not the problem at all. For the father it may be a problem. He may be afraid. He may be wondering whether they have lost the path or not, whether they are on the right path or not. But for the child it is not a problem. He knows that the father knows. That’s all. And wherever the father leads, he will follow – and he is happy at this very moment.\nA trusting disciple, an innocent mind is just like a child – and the master is more than a father. Once the disciple surrenders, he trusts. Then at any moment, when the master feels that the disciple is tuned, that the disciple is in harmony, he will just give a hint.\nI have heard about a Zen master, Bokuju. He struggled hard to attain enlightenment, but nothing happened. Really, with a hard struggle sometimes nothing will happen, because the hard struggle is through the ego. And through hard struggle the ego becomes more hard. He did whatsoever could be done but the goal was no nearer. Rather, on the contrary, it was further away; further away than when he had started the journey. He was puzzled, confused, so he came to his master. The master said, “For a few years just completely stop any effort, any goal, any destination. Just forget, and live moment to moment near me. Don’t do anything. Simply eat, sleep, walk, and just be near me. And don’t raise any question... just see me, my presence. And don’t make any effort because nothing is to be achieved. Forget the achieving mind because the achieving mind is always in the future – that’s why it goes on missing the present. Just forget that you have to achieve anything.”\nBokuju believed in his master. He started living with him. For a few days, a few months, ideas floated in, thoughts came, and sometimes he would become uneasy and would think, “I am wasting time. I am not doing anything. How can it happen without doing anything? If it couldn’t happen through such hard effort, how is it going to be easily attained by not doing anything?” But, still, he believed in the master. By and by the mind slowed down, and in the present of his master he started to feel\na subtle calm flowing – a silence would fall from the master onto him. He started feeling a merging. Years passed. He completely forgot that he was. The master became the center and he started to live like a shadow.\nThen the miracle is possible – this happening itself is the miracle. One day, suddenly, the master called his name, “Bokuju, are you here?” Just this, “Bokuju, are you here?” And he said, “Yes, master.” And, it is said, he became enlightened.\nThere was nothing like a technique, not even a suggestion – just, “Bokuju, are you here?” The total presence had been called, “Are you here, not moving anywhere, not gone somewhere else? With total intensity, are you present here?” And Bokuju said, “Yes, master.” In that “yes” he became totally present there.\nIt is said that the master started laughing and Bokuju started laughing, and the master said, “Now you can go. Now you can move out there and help people by your presence.” Bokuju never taught any method. He would simply ask this much, “Just be near. Remain present.” And whenever a disciple was in tune, he would call the name of the disciple and ask, “Are you here?” This was the whole technique.\nBut this technique will need a grounding of your mind, a deep innocence. There are many techniques which are simple, the simplest possible: just a saying, “Be this one” – just a hint. But it must have been said by the master in a certain moment. “Be this one” cannot always be said. It must have been said in a certain tuning, when the disciple was totally one with the master, or totally with the universe, merged. Then the master says, “Be this one” – and suddenly the focus will change and the last part of the ego will dissolve.\nThese methods worked in the past but now it is difficult, very difficult, because you are so calculating, you are so clever. And being clever is just against being innocent. You are so calculating, you know too much arithmetic. This calculation goes on and on in the mind: whatsoever you do, it is always calculated, planned. You are never innocent, never open, receptive; you believe too much in yourself. Hence you go on missing. These methods won’t be helpful for you unless you prepare. That preparation can be very long, and you are very impatient.\nThis age is basically the most impatient age that has ever happened on this earth. Everyone is impatient, everyone is too time-conscious, and everyone wants to do everything immediately. Not that it cannot be done – it can be done immediately. But with such time-consciousness it is impossible. People come to me and they say that they have come only for one day. The next day they are going to Sai Baba, and after meeting him they will go to Rishikesh, and then they will go somewhere else. Then they return frustrated and they think there is nothing India can give. It is not a question of whether India can give something or not, the question is always whether you can receive it or not. You are in such a hurry and you want something immediately. Just like instant coffee, you think of instant meditation, instant nirvana. It is not possible. Nirvana cannot be packed, cannot be made instant. Not that it is impossible to make it instant, it can become instant – but it can become instant only with the mind which is not after the instant. That’s the problem. It can become instant. Immediately, this moment, it can happen. Not even a single moment is needed. But only to one who is relaxed about time completely, to one who can wait for infinity – for him it will happen instantly.\nThis looks paradoxical but this is the case. If you can wait for eternity, you will not need to wait at all. But if you cannot wait for even a single moment, you will have to wait for eternity. You will have to wait because the mind which says, “Let it happen immediately,” is a mind which has already moved from the moment. It is running, it is standing nowhere, it is just on the move. A mind which is on the move, on the way, cannot be innocent.\nYou may not be aware of it but innocent people are always without time-consciousness. Time lingers slowly. There is no hurry to go anywhere, they are not running. They are enjoying moment to moment. They are chewing each moment. And each moment has its own ecstasy to deliver. But you are in such a hurry that it cannot be delivered. While you are here, your hands are in the future, your mind is in the future – you will miss this moment. And this will be always the case; you will always miss the now. And NOW is the only time! The future is false, the past is just memory. The past is no more, the future is yet to be – and all that ever happens is the now. Now is the only time.\nSo if you can be prepared to slow down a little, to become non-calculating, playing like children, here and now, then these simple techniques can work miracles. But this century is too time- conscious. That’s why you ask, IT SEEMS THAT WE NEED TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THESE TECHNIQUES. No. These are techniques, not end-results. They look like end-results because you cannot conceive of how they can work. They can work in particular mind; they cannot work in other types of mind. And really, those who know, they say that all the techniques will ultimately bring you to the innocence where the phenomenon happens. When the phenomenon happens, it will be because the techniques will have brought you to that innocence – if the innocence is there.\nBut it is difficult now because nowhere is innocence taught; everywhere we are teaching cleverness. Universities are not to make you innocent, they are to make you clever, cunning, calculating. The more clever you are, the better you will be in the struggle of life. You can gain much wealth, prestige, power, if you are calculating. If you are innocent, you will prove to be stupid; if you are innocent, then you will be nowhere in this competitive world. This is the problem: in this competitive world you may not be anywhere, but in that non-competitive world of nirvana, if you are innocent, you will be somewhere. If you are calculating you will not be anywhere in the world of nirvana, but in this world you will be somewhere. And we have chosen this world to be our goal.\nOld universities differed completely, their orientation was totally different. Nalanda, Takshila – they did not teach calculation, they did not teach cleverness. They were teaching innocence. Their orientation was different from Oxford or Kashi or Cambridge. Their orientation was totally different – they were creating a different type of mind. So it almost always happened that a person who studied in Takshshila or Nalanda would become a BHIKKHU, a SANNYASIN, in the end. By the time he graduated from university he would renounce this world. Those universities were anti-world; they were preparing for some other dimension. They were preparing you for something else which cannot be measured in terms of this world. These techniques were for those type of people. Either they were innocent by their nature or they were training themselves to be innocent.\nWhen Jesus said to his followers, “If someone hits you on one cheek, you give him the other,” what is he intending to do? He is trying to make you innocent. Only a foolish person would do this. When someone hits you on one cheek, a calculating mind will say, “Hit him hard, immediately.” And a really calculating mind will say, “Before someone hits you, hit him. Because attack is the best defense.” Ask Machiavelli – he is the cleverest mind. He says, “Before someone attacks you, you attack him,\nbecause attack is the best defense. Once someone has attacked you, you are already weak; he has already gained over you. Now the race is not equal. He is ahead of you. So don’t allow the enemy to go ahead. Attack before anybody attacks you.”\nThis is a calculating mind; this is a clever mind. Machiavelli was read by every prince and every king in medieval Europe – but he was such a clever person that no king would employ him. He was read – his book was the bible for power-politics, every prince would read his book The Prince and they would follow it – but no king was ready to employ him because he was such a clever man. It was better to keep him away – he was dangerous; he knew too much. He said, “Virtue is not good, but pretending to be virtuous is. Don’t be virtuous, but pretend always that you are virtuous. That is the real good because then you gain from both the ends: from vice you gain, and from virtue also.” This is the calculating mind. Go on pretending that you are virtuous, and always praise virtue. But never be really virtuous. Always praise virtue so others know that you are a virtuous person. Always condemn vice – but don’t be afraid to use it.\nJesus says, “When someone hits you on one cheek, give him the other. And if someone takes your coat, snatches it, give him your shirt also. And if someone forces you to carry his load for one mile, tell him that you are ready to carry it for two miles.” This is patent foolishness, but very meaningful. If you can do this, these techniques will be for you. Jesus is preparing his disciples for sudden enlightenment. Just think about it. If you can be so innocent, so trusting, that if the other is hitting you, he must be hitting you for your good – so give him the other cheek also, and let him hit it. The other’s goodness is believed in, trusted in; no one is your enemy. When Jesus says, “Love your enemies,” this is the meaning. No one is your enemy; don’t see the enemy anywhere. That doesn’t mean that there will not be enemies and there will not be people who will exploit you. There will be. They will exploit you. But be exploited – and don’t be cunning. Just look at that dimension: be exploited but don’t be cunning. Be exploited but don’t be mistrusting, don’t disbelieve, don’t lose faith. That is more valuable than anything others can cheat you of. Nothing else is so valuable.\nBut how do our minds function? If one man deceives you, the whole of humanity is evil. If one man is dishonest or you think that he is dishonest, then you don’t believe in man at all. Then the whole of humanity has become dishonest. If one Jew is a miser, then the whole race of Jews is miserly. If one Mohammedan is bigoted, then all Mohammedans are. Just one is enough for us to lose our faith in all. Jesus says, “Even if all are dishonest, you should not lose faith, because faith is more valuable than what these dishonest people can take from you by their dishonesty.” So really, if you lose faith you are losing something; otherwise nothing is lost.\nFor such innocent people these techniques are enough, they will not ask for anything more. You say, and it happens to them. Just on hearing the master many have become illumined – but in the past, not in this age.\nI have heard a story about Rinzai. He was a very poor BHIKKHU, a poor SANNYASIN, a beggar. As he was sleeping in his hut a thief entered. There was nothing in the hut except a blanket that he himself was using. He was sleeping on the floor, covered with his blanket. Then he became very uncomfortable and stared to think, “What an unfortunate fellow! He has come so far from the village to find something, and there is nothing in my hut. What misery! How to help him? The only thing is this blanket.” And he was under it and the thief would not have the courage to snatch the blanket, so he slipped out from under it, left it there and slipped into a dark corner. The thief took the blanket\nand went away. The night was very cold, but Rinzai was happy that the thief had not gone back empty-handed.\nThen he sat at the window of his hut. The night was cool, and the full moon was in the sky. He wrote a small haiku, a small poem. In the haiku he said, “If I could have given this moon to that thief, I would have.” This mind! What has he lost? Just a blanket. What has he gained? The whole world, all that can be gained. He has gained innocence, trust, love.\nFor this man no technique is needed. His master would say, “Just look. Be aware. Be alert.” And that would do.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nHOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE DICTATES OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THAT OF THE INNER GUIDE? HOW CAN ONE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INNER GUIDE HAS COME INTO FUNCTION?\nThe first thing: because of Freud, much misunderstanding has arisen around the word “unconscious”. Freud completely misunderstood it, misinterpreted it. And he has become the very basis of modern knowledge about mind. To Freud, unconscious meant simply the repressed conscious, the suppressed part of the conscious. So all that is evil and bad, immoral, has been suppressed. Because the society cannot allow it, it has to be suppressed within. For Freud, that repressed part is the unconscious – but not for mystics. Freud is not a mystic; he has not entered his own unconscious. He has been simply observing cases of patients: ill people, abnormal people, mad, insane, pathological. He has been studying the pathological mind, and through the study of the pathological mind – and that, too, from without – he concluded that just underneath the conscious there is an unconscious mind. That unconscious mind carries all that has been suppressed from the childhood, all that society has condemned. The mind has suppressed it, just to forget that it is there.\nBut it is there – and it goes on functioning. And it is very powerful: it goes on changing the conscious, it goes on playing tricks with the conscious. The conscious is really impotent before it, because whatsoever is repressed is repressed only because it is so powerful that society cannot cope with it. So society has been repressing it and society doesn’t know what else to do with it. For example, sex. It is so powerful that if you don’t repress it you won’t know what to do with it. It will lead you into dangerous paths. And it is such a forceful energy that the whole society will become chaotic if it is allowed completely.No marriage could exist, no love could exist, everything could be just a chaos if it was allowed total freedom – because then man would behave like an animal. If there were no marriage, no family, the whole society would be destroyed. Society depends on the unity of the family; the family depends on marriage; marriage depends on sex-suppression. Everything that is natural, forceful, has been inhibited, tabooed – so forcibly that you feel guilty about it and you go on fighting with it. Society has not only created policemen outside, it has created inner policemen, your conscience – a double arrangement so that you don’t go astray so that you cannot be natural, you have to be unnatural.\nNow modern psychologists say that insanity is part of civilization – no civilization can be without madness. But mad people are suffering because you have forced such an order over them that\ntheir natural instincts are crushed. They have been crippled. It may be that your madmen are more powerful than you, that’s why their inner instincts have revolted and they have thrown their conscience, their mind, everything, overboard. That’s why they are mad. A better concept of humanity, a better organization, a better discipline with more knowledge and wisdom, may use them. They may prove geniuses; they may prove very talented people. They are. But they have such a force in them that they cannot repress themselves. And society will not allow them to move because they are wild. Freud came to the conclusion that civilization needs the unconscious, the repressed part.\nBut really, for Tantra and yoga this unconscious is not the unconscious, it is just between the conscious and the unconscious, a small boundary. It is subconscious. The conscious has forced something down, but the conscious knows about it. It is not really unconscious, you know about it. You may not want to recognize it, you may not want to be attentive to it, because you are afraid that if you give it attention it will come up. You have forced it into darkness but you are conscious bout it. The Freudian unconscious is not really unconscious, it is only subconscious. It is not dark night, it is in the light, you can see it.\nTantra talks about the real unconscious which is not suppressed by you but which is your deepest being. And your conscious is just one part of it which has come into light, the one-tenth part which has seen the light, which has become conscious. Nine parts, nine-tenths, are just hidden underneath. That unconscious is really your source of life-energy, of being. Your conscious mind is one-tenth of the whole mind and this conscious mind has created its own center: that center is the ego. This center is false because it doesn’t belong to the whole mind, it is not the center of the whole mind. It is just a center of the conscious part, a fragment. The fragment has created its own center and that center goes on pretending it is the center of the whole being. No, your total mind has a center: that center is called the guide. That center is in the unconscious and it will be revealed only when five fragments, or half of the mind, come into light. Then the center which is the guide will be revealed. It is hidden in the unconscious.\nSo you need not be afraid of the unconscious; it is the Freudian unconscious you are afraid of. It is something to be afraid of. But this Freudian unconscious can be thrown out in catharsis. Hence my great insistence on catharsis. This Freudian unconscious can be thrown out in catharsis: whatsoever you wanted to do and you have not done, do it, meditatively. Don’t do it to anyone because that will create a chain of events – and you will not be in control. Just do it in a vacuum. If you are angry, do it in a vacuum. If you feel sexuality, throw it into the sky. If you feel anything, just allow it to move from your inwards outwards. Express it. A meditative catharsis will relieve you of the Freudian unconscious. With the technique that I am teaching – if it is followed – the Freudian unconscious will simply disappear. And only when this Freudian unconscious disappears can you penetrate the real unconscious. It is just in-between, between the conscious and the unconscious. You just go on throwing your rubbish things into a room and you close it; you go on accumulating a junkyard – Freudian unconscious is just a junkyard. Don’t throw it in – I say, throw it out. When it moves in, you will become pathological, you can go insane. When it moves out you will become fresh, young, unburdened. For this age, catharsis is a must. No one can reach the inner guide without catharsis. And once you are in deep catharsis you need not be afraid. Then the real unconscious will start revealing itself; then it will penetrate into your conscious, and then for the first time you will become aware of your vast territory. You are not such a small fragment, you have a very vast being, and this vast being has a center – that center is the inner guide.\nHow to differentiate between the unconscious and the inner guide? How to differentiate between the Freudian unconscious and the inner guide? It will be difficult if you don’t go through catharsis. But you can feel a difference by and by because the Freudian unconscious is just a repressed thing. If something appears in you with a violent force, know well that this violent force is coming because you have repressed it in the first place. If something simply appears in you without any violence, just bubbles up silently, easily, without any sounds, even soundlessly, then know that this is the real unconscious. From the guide something is coming to you. But you will become proficient only when you go through catharsis. Then you will know what is happening. Whenever anything comes from the Freudian unconscious you will feel disturbed, it will make you uneasy, uncomfortable; and whenever something comes from the guide you will feel such serenity, you will feel so happy, so at ease, so at home, that you cannot imagine it. You will simply feel that this is the thing. Your total being is in harmony with it, there is no resistance. You know this is the right, this is the good, this is the truth – and nobody can convince you otherwise. With the Freudian unconscious you can never be serene, you can never be still and calm; you will be disturbed. It is a sort of disease that has come up – and there will be a fight with it. So it is better if you pass through deep catharsis, then the Freudian unconscious will become silent, by and by.\nAnd just as bubbles come up from a riverbed, come up to the very surface of the water, you will feel bubbles coming up from the very bed of your being. They will come to your conscious mind. But their very coming will give you a deep tranquility – a feeling that nothing can be more right than this. But before it happens you have to unburden yourself of the Freudian unconscious. And that can happen only if you are in a let-go, because the innermost being is so nonviolent that it will not assert itself. The Freudian unconscious will want to assert itself; every moment it is trying to assert itself and you are pushing it back. This is the difference. It wants to assert itself, it wants to become active, it wants to lead you somewhere, it wants to manipulate you – and you are resisting it, fighting it. The real unconscious, the guide, is not assertive. If you allow it, if you invite it, prayerfully, it will come to you just like an invited guest. You have to be in a let-go. Only then will it come. When it feels you are ready, when it feels it will not be denied, rejected, when it feels it will be welcomed, then it will come to you. So, you have to do two things: catharsis for the Freudian unconscious, and training in let-go and surrender for the real guide, the real unconscious. These two things done, you will know the difference.\nThe difference really cannot be taught to you – you will know it. When it happens, you will know it. How do you know the difference between when there is pain in your body and when the whole body feels a well-being? When the whole body is filled with well-being and when your head has a headache, how do you feel what the difference is? You simply know it. You cannot define it, you simply know it: you know what a headache is and you know what well-being is.\nThe real guide will always give you a feeling of well-being, and the Freudian unconscious will always give you a feeling of headache. It is a turmoil, it is an inner conflict, it is anguish, it is pain suppressed. So whenever it comes you will feel painful all over.\nBecause of this Freudian unconscious, many things have become painful which are not naturally painful For example, sex. Because society has repressed sex, it has become painful. One of the most blissful things in natural life is sex. But it has become painful. If you move into sex you will feel frustrated, you will feel guilty, at the end you will feel weakened. And you will decide never to have sex again. This is not because of natural sex, this is because of the unconscious. Sex has become\npainful. It has been so repressed that it has become ugly and painful Otherwise it is one of the most natural ecstasies. If a child is never taught that sex is bad and a sin he will enjoy it, and every time he will feel a deep well-being flowing all over the body.\nMen feel more well-being than women – because women are repressed more. No one requires that a boy should be a virgin but everyone requires, even the boy himself, that the girl he is going to marry should be a virgin. Even playboys require that the girl should be a virgin. Women’s unconscious has been repressed ore than men’s, that’s why only a few women achieve orgasm. And that, too, in the West – in the east not more than five per cent of women, at the most, achieve any enjoyment in sex. Ninety-five percent are simply fed up with it. That’s why when sadhus and monks teach that sex is sin, women always agree. They gather in multitudes around monks because the thing appeals to them, it is right. Because they are so suppressed they have never known any bliss out of it. In India, while making love, woman are not supposed to move, be active. They have to lie still like a corpse. If they are active their man will become suspicious: they are enjoying sex and this is not the sign of a good woman. A good woman is one who doesn’t enjoy. In the East they will say that if you want to marry, marry a good woman, and if you want to enjoy, then have a friendship with a bad woman – because only bad women can enjoy. This is unfortunate. The woman is not supposed to move, to be active, she should be just dead. How can she achieve orgasm when the energy is not moving?\nAnd if she cannot enjoy it she is bound to be against the husband and she is bound to think that the husband is evil. Every day Indian women come to me and they say that they are fed up with sex and their husbands are forcing them again and again to have sex. They don’t like it, they are disgusted. And why are the husbands not so disgusted? Why are the women disgusted? The reason is that they have a greater repressed unconscious about sex than men.\nSex will become painful. If you have suppressed it, it is a headache. Anything can become a headache – just suppress it, that is the trick. It will become a suffering. And anything can become blissful – just express it, don’t suppress it.\nThis Freudian unconscious is all that you know right now. You don’t know about the real unconscious, the Tantra unconscious – that’s why you are afraid. And afraid, you cannot let go. Afraid, you cannot lose control. You know that if you lose control, immediately the suppressed instincts will take over. Immediately, whatsoever you have repressed will come to the mind and it will insist on being acted out. That’s why you are afraid. Catharsis is needed first so the fear goes. And then you can let go. And if you let go, a very silent force will start flowing to your conscious mind and you will feel a well-being, you will feel that you are at home, you will feel that everything is good, you will feel that you are blessed.\nHOW CAN ONE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INNER GUIDE HAS COME INTO FUNCTION? This will\nbe the first sign: you will start feeling good, good about yourself. Remember, you always feel bad about yourself. I almost never come across a person who feels good about himself. Everyone is condemning himself, everyone thinks he is bad. And when you think you are bad how do you suppose that someone else is going to love you? And when no one loves you, you feel frustrated. But you yourself don’t love you. You have never touched your hand lovingly, you have never felt your body lovingly, you have never thanked God that he has given you such a beautiful body, such a beautiful organism. No, you just feel disgusted. And the religions, the so-called religions have taught you to feel condemned – this body is a bag of sins. You are carrying a burden.\nWhen the unconscious is released you will feel suddenly that you are accepted, you are not bad. Nothing is bad. The whole of life becomes deep down a blessing. You feel blessed. And the moment you feel blessed, all others around you become blessed; you can bless them, you can feel happy. Because you feel condemned, you feel bad about yourself and you think the same about others. How can you love another’s body if you condemn your own body? If you are against your own body, how can you love another body? You will condemn – deep down you will condemn. Really, religions have prepared you to become just ghosts. They don’t want you to be with the body, they want you to be just unembodied spirits. Everything has been so condemned..and you have taken it for granted. I have seen in scriptures, in many scriptures, that it written that your body has nothing but blood, fat, phlegm – just to condemn it. I don’t know what these persons who were writing these scriptures wanted. Did they want gold to be there? Why is blood bad? Blood is life! But they have condemned it and we have accepted the condemnation. They must be mad, insane.\nJains always say that their TEERTHANKARAS never urinated, they don’t defecate. Such bad things. But why is urine bad? What do you want to urinate instead of urine? And what is bad in it? But it is such a bad thing. And psychologists say that because the sex center and the urinating organ are the same in man, sex has become condemned. And in woman the sex center is just in the middle, on one side defecation and on the other side urination, sex cannot be good if it is between two such bad things. The condemnation of sex has come because we have condemned defecation. But why? Why condemn it? What is bad? But we accept condemnation and when we accept, then there are problems.\nYour whole body is condemned by neurotic people. They may have written scriptures but that doesn’t make any difference. They may have been great leaders – neurotics almost always are. They are great leaders because they are so fanatic that they can immediately get a following. And there are always people who worship fanaticism. Anyone who says something strongly will have people falling at his feet saying he is the right leader. and he may be just neurotic, just mad. These neurotic people have condemned you and you have accepted them, you have been conditioned by them.\nWhen the unconscious flows in you, a subtle well-being will come. You will feel good: everything is good, and everything is Divine. Your body comes from the Divine, your blood also, your urine also. Everything is Divine. When the unconscious flows in you, everything is Divine, everything becomes spiritual. Nothing is bd, nothing is condemned. This will be the feeling, and then you will fly. You will become so light you cannot walk. Then nothing is a burden on your head. Then you can enjoy small things in a very great way. Then every trivial things becomes a beauty. But that beauty is given by you – whatsoever you touch becomes golden because deep down you are so filled with bliss.\nThis will be the first thing that will happen to you – a goodness about yourself. And, when the unconscious starts flowing into your conscious, the second thing will be that you will become less world-oriented, less intellectual, more total. Then if you are happy you will not just simply say that you are happy – you will dance. Just saying, “I am happy,” is pale, meaningless. I see people who say, “I am happy” – but just look at their faces! I know people who say, “I love you,” but their body is not expressing anything. Words are dead but we have substituted them for life. When the unconscious flows in you, this will be the difference: you will live with your total being. When you feel happy, you will dance. Then you will not simply say, “I am happy”-you will be happy: that’s the difference. You will not say, “I am happy” – there is no need to say it because you will be happy. Then there will be no need to say to someone, “I love you” – you will be love. Your whole being will\nshow the feeling, you will vibrate with love. Anybody passing nearby will feel that you love; anyone just touched by your hand will feel a subtle energy has entered into him. There is a warmth in your presence, a happiness.\nThis will be the second thing. First, you will feel a goodness about yourself and about everything; and second, you will become total. When the guide takes you, you will be total.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nWHEN THAT INTUITION STARTS FUNCTIONING, IS SURRENDER THE ONLY TECHNIQUE FOR THAT INTUITION, OR THE INNER GUIDE? DOES A PERSON LIVING THROUGH INTUITION ALWAYS SUCCEED? HOW DO YOU VALUE SUCCESS AND FAILURE? IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THE PERSON LIVING INTUITIVELY WILL BECOME WEAK INTELLECTUALLY?\nSurrender is the only technique for the inner being to become active.\nDOES A PERSON LIVING THROUGH INTUITION ALWAYS SUCCEED? No, but he is always happy\n– whether he succeeds or not. And a person not living intuitively is always unhappy whether he succeeds or not. Success is not the criterion because success depends on many things. Happiness is the criterion because happiness depends only on you. You may not succeed because others are competitors there. Even if you are working intuitively, others may be working more cunningly, more cleverly, more calculatingly, more violently, more immorally. So success depends on many other things; success is a social phenomenon. You may not succeed.\nWho can say that Jesus succeeded? Crucifixion is not a success, it is the greatest failure. A man crucified when he was just thirty-three – what type of success is this? No one knew about him. Just a few villagers, uneducated people, were his disciples. He had no position, no prestige, no power. What type of success is this? Crucifixion cannot be said to be a success. But he was happy. He was totally blissful – even when being crucified. And those who were crucifying him would remain alive for many years but they would remain in misery. So really, who was undergoing crucifixion? That is the point. Those who crucified Jesus, were they undergoing crucifixion? Or was Jesus, who was crucified? He was happy. How can you crucify happiness? He was ecstatic. How can you crucify ecstasy? You can kill the body but you cannot kill the soul. Those who crucified him, they lived, but their life was nothing but a long slow crucifixion – misery and misery and misery.\nSo the first thing is that I don’t say that if you follow the inner guide you will always succeed – in the sense that the world recognizes success; but in the sense that a Buddha or a Jesus recognizes success, you will succeed. But that success is measured by your happiness, your bliss – whatsoever happens is irrelevant, you will be happy. Whether the world says that you have been a failure, or the world makes you a star, a success, it doesn’t make any difference. You will be happy whatsoever the case; you will be blissful. Bliss is success to me. If you can understand that bliss is success, then I say you will succeed always.\nBut to you bliss is not success; success is something else. It may even be misery. Even if you know that it is going to be a misery, you long for success. Ask political leaders – they are in misery. I\nhave not seen any political leader who is happy. They are just miserable, but still they are trying for higher posts, trying to get still higher on the ladder. And those who are already above him are in misery, and he knows it. But we are ready to be miserable if success comes to us. So what is success to us? Success is egoistic fulfillment, not bliss. It is just so that people will say that you have succeeded. You may have lost everything – you may have lost your soul; you may have lost all that innocence that gives bliss; you may have lost all that peace, silence, that brings you nearer to the Divine; you may have lost all, and become just a madman – but the world will say you are a success.\nFor the world, ego gratification is the success; for me it is not. For me, to be blissful is success – whether anyone knows about you or not. It is irrelevant whether anyone knows about you or not, whether you live totally unknown, unheard of, unnoticed. But if you are blissful, you have succeeded.\nSo remember this distinction because there are many people who would like to be intuitive, who would like to find the inner guide, just to succeed in the world. For them the inner guide will be a frustration. In the first place, they cannot find it. In the second place, even if they can find it, they will be miserable. Because what they are aiming at is recognition by the world, ego fulfillment – not bliss.\nBe clear in the mind – don’t be success-oriented. Success is the greatest failure in the world. So don’t try to succeed otherwise you will be a failure. Think of being blissful. Every moment think of being more and more blissful. Then the whole world may say you are a failure but you will not be a failure. You have attained.\nBuddha was a failure in the eyes of his friends, family, wife, father, teachers, society – he was a failure. He had become just a beggar. What type of success is this? He could have been a great emperor: he had the qualities, he had the personality, he had the mind. He could have been a great emperor but he became a beggar. He was a failure – obviously. But I say to you he was not a failure. If he had become an emperor then he would have been a failure because he would have missed the real life. What he attained under the Bodhi Tree was the real and what he lost was unreal.\nWith the real you will succeed in the inner life; with the unreal... I don’t know. If you want to succeed in the unreal then follow the path of those who are working in cunningness, cleverness, competition, jealousy, violence. Follow their path, the inner guide is not for you. If you want to gain something of the world, then don’t listen to the inner guide.\nBut ultimately you will feel that although you have won the whole world, you have lost yourself. Jesus says, “And what does a man get if he loses his soul and gains the whole world?” Who will you call a success: Alexander the Great or Jesus the Crucified? So if – and that ‘if’ has to be understood well – if you are interested in the world, then the inner guide is not a guide for you. If you are interested in the inner dimension of being then the inner guide, and only the inner guide, can help.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7864","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/part38/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vigyan_bhairav_tantra_vol_2/>Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">38 The inner guide</h1><div class=post-meta>37 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7864 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Vigyan_Bhairav_Tantra_Vol_2/part38.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part37>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BE END RESULTS AND NOT TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THOSE THAT SAY TO “BECOME
UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS” OR “BE THIS ONE” ETC. IT SEEMS THAT WE NEED
TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THESE TECHNIQUES. WERE TECHNIQUES LIKE THESE MEANT
FOR VERY ADVANCED PERSONS WHO COULD JUST BECOME COSMIC AT A MERE
SUGGESTION?</p><p><br></p><p>Such techniques were meant, not for very advanced persons, but for
very innocent persons – simple, innocent, trusting. Then just a
suggestion is enough. You have to have something to do because you
cannot trust.You don’t have faith. Unless you do something, nothing can
happen to you because you believe in action. If something happens to you
suddenly without any doing on your part, you will be scared and you will
not believe it. You may even bypass it; you may not even record in the
mind that it happened. Unless you DO, you cannot feel something
happening to you – this is the way of the ego. But for an innocent
person, for an innocent, open mind, just a suggestion is enough. Why?
Because really, the innermost being is not something to be achieved in
the future – it is here and now, it is already the case. Whatsoever is
to be attained is here, present in you right this very moment. If you
can trust without any effort, it can become revealed. It is not a
question of time, of you having to work it out. It is not somewhere far
away that you have to travel to. It is you. You may call it God, you may
call it nirvana or whatsoever you like – it is you already. So even a
suggestion</p><p>, if believed totally, can reveal it to you. That’s why so much
significance is given to SHRADDHA, trust, faith. If a person can believe
in the master, just a hint, a suggestion, an indication – and in a flash
everything will be revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic point to be understood is this: there are things which you
cannot attain right now because time will be needed to produce them.
They are not with you. If I give you a seed, it cannot immediately
become a tree. Time will be needed, and you will have to wait and work.
Then the seed cannot become the tree immediately. But you are really the
tree already. It is not a seed which has to be worked, it is a tree
hidden in darkness, it is a tree which is covered, it is a tree which
you are inattentive too – that’s all. Your inattention is the cover. You
are not looking at it, that’s all. You are looking somewhere else and
that’s why you are missing it. In a trusting moment the master can tell
you, just by a suggestion, that it is here. And if you can believe, if
you can look in that dimension in trust, it will be revealed to you.</p><p><br></p><p>These techniques are not for advanced people; they are for simple,
innocent people. Advanced people are, in a way, difficult. They are not
innocent, they have been working, they have attained something, and they
have a subtle ego behind it. They know something so they are not
innocent, they cannot believe. You will have to argue and convince them
– and then too they will have to make some efforts. By an innocent mind,
I mean a mind which is not arguing. It is just like a small child. The
child goes with his father hand in hand, he is not afraid. Whatsoever
the father is leading, he must be leading in the right direction. The
father knows – so the child need not worry about it. He is not thinking
of the future, what is going to happen is not his concern. He is
enjoying the very journey; the end is not the problem at all. For the
father it may be a problem. He may be afraid. He may be wondering
whether they have lost the path or not, whether they are on the right
path or not. But for the child it is not a problem. He knows that the
father knows. That’s all. And wherever the father leads, he will follow
– and he is happy at this very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>A trusting disciple, an innocent mind is just like a child – and the
master is more than a father. Once the disciple surrenders, he trusts.
Then at any moment, when the master feels that the disciple is tuned,
that the disciple is in harmony, he will just give a hint.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a Zen master, Bokuju. He struggled hard to attain
enlightenment, but nothing happened. Really, with a hard struggle
sometimes nothing will happen, because the hard struggle is through the
ego. And through hard struggle the ego becomes more hard. He did
whatsoever could be done but the goal was no nearer. Rather, on the
contrary, it was further away; further away than when he had started the
journey. He was puzzled, confused, so he came to his master. The master
said, “For a few years just completely stop any effort, any goal, any
destination. Just forget, and live moment to moment near me. Don’t do
anything. Simply eat, sleep, walk, and just be near me. And don’t raise
any question... just see me, my presence. And don’t make any effort
because nothing is to be achieved. Forget the achieving mind because the
achieving mind is always in the future – that’s why it goes on missing
the present. Just forget that you have to achieve anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bokuju believed in his master. He started living with him. For a few
days, a few months, ideas floated in, thoughts came, and sometimes he
would become uneasy and would think, “I am wasting time. I am not doing
anything. How can it happen without doing anything? If it couldn’t
happen through such hard effort, how is it going to be easily attained
by not doing anything?” But, still, he believed in the master. By and by
the mind slowed down, and in the present of his master he started to
feel</p><p>a subtle calm flowing – a silence would fall from the master onto
him. He started feeling a merging. Years passed. He completely forgot
that he was. The master became the center and he started to live like a
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the miracle is possible – this happening itself is the miracle.
One day, suddenly, the master called his name, “Bokuju, are you here?”
Just this, “Bokuju, are you here?” And he said, “Yes, master.” And, it
is said, he became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>There was nothing like a technique, not even a suggestion – just,
“Bokuju, are you here?” The total presence had been called, “Are you
here, not moving anywhere, not gone somewhere else? With total
intensity, are you present here?” And Bokuju said, “Yes, master.” In
that “yes” he became totally present there.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that the master started laughing and Bokuju started
laughing, and the master said, “Now you can go. Now you can move out
there and help people by your presence.” Bokuju never taught any method.
He would simply ask this much, “Just be near. Remain present.” And
whenever a disciple was in tune, he would call the name of the disciple
and ask, “Are you here?” This was the whole technique.</p><p><br></p><p>But this technique will need a grounding of your mind, a deep
innocence. There are many techniques which are simple, the simplest
possible: just a saying, “Be this one” – just a hint. But it must have
been said by the master in a certain moment. “Be this one” cannot always
be said. It must have been said in a certain tuning, when the disciple
was totally one with the master, or totally with the universe, merged.
Then the master says, “Be this one” – and suddenly the focus will change
and the last part of the ego will dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>These methods worked in the past but now it is difficult, very
difficult, because you are so calculating, you are so clever. And being
clever is just against being innocent. You are so calculating, you know
too much arithmetic. This calculation goes on and on in the mind:
whatsoever you do, it is always calculated, planned. You are never
innocent, never open, receptive; you believe too much in yourself. Hence
you go on missing. These methods won’t be helpful for you unless you
prepare. That preparation can be very long, and you are very
impatient.</p><p><br></p><p>This age is basically the most impatient age that has ever happened
on this earth. Everyone is impatient, everyone is too time-conscious,
and everyone wants to do everything immediately. Not that it cannot be
done – it can be done immediately. But with such time-consciousness it
is impossible. People come to me and they say that they have come only
for one day. The next day they are going to Sai Baba, and after meeting
him they will go to Rishikesh, and then they will go somewhere else.
Then they return frustrated and they think there is nothing India can
give. It is not a question of whether India can give something or not,
the question is always whether you can receive it or not. You are in
such a hurry and you want something immediately. Just like instant
coffee, you think of instant meditation, instant nirvana. It is not
possible. Nirvana cannot be packed, cannot be made instant. Not that it
is impossible to make it instant, it can become instant – but it can
become instant only with the mind which is not after the instant. That’s
the problem. It can become instant. Immediately, this moment, it can
happen. Not even a single moment is needed. But only to one who is
relaxed about time completely, to one who can wait for infinity – for
him it will happen instantly.</p><p>This looks paradoxical but this is the case. If you can wait for
eternity, you will not need to wait at all. But if you cannot wait for
even a single moment, you will have to wait for eternity. You will have
to wait because the mind which says, “Let it happen immediately,” is a
mind which has already moved from the moment. It is running, it is
standing nowhere, it is just on the move. A mind which is on the move,
on the way, cannot be innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be aware of it but innocent people are always without
time-consciousness. Time lingers slowly. There is no hurry to go
anywhere, they are not running. They are enjoying moment to moment. They
are chewing each moment. And each moment has its own ecstasy to deliver.
But you are in such a hurry that it cannot be delivered. While you are
here, your hands are in the future, your mind is in the future – you
will miss this moment. And this will be always the case; you will always
miss the now. And NOW is the only time! The future is false, the past is
just memory. The past is no more, the future is yet to be – and all that
ever happens is the now. Now is the only time.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you can be prepared to slow down a little, to become
non-calculating, playing like children, here and now, then these simple
techniques can work miracles. But this century is too time- conscious.
That’s why you ask, IT SEEMS THAT WE NEED TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE THESE
TECHNIQUES. No. These are techniques, not end-results. They look like
end-results because you cannot conceive of how they can work. They can
work in particular mind; they cannot work in other types of mind. And
really, those who know, they say that all the techniques will ultimately
bring you to the innocence where the phenomenon happens. When the
phenomenon happens, it will be because the techniques will have brought
you to that innocence – if the innocence is there.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is difficult now because nowhere is innocence taught;
everywhere we are teaching cleverness. Universities are not to make you
innocent, they are to make you clever, cunning, calculating. The more
clever you are, the better you will be in the struggle of life. You can
gain much wealth, prestige, power, if you are calculating. If you are
innocent, you will prove to be stupid; if you are innocent, then you
will be nowhere in this competitive world. This is the problem: in this
competitive world you may not be anywhere, but in that non-competitive
world of nirvana, if you are innocent, you will be somewhere. If you are
calculating you will not be anywhere in the world of nirvana, but in
this world you will be somewhere. And we have chosen this world to be
our goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Old universities differed completely, their orientation was totally
different. Nalanda, Takshila – they did not teach calculation, they did
not teach cleverness. They were teaching innocence. Their orientation
was different from Oxford or Kashi or Cambridge. Their orientation was
totally different – they were creating a different type of mind. So it
almost always happened that a person who studied in Takshshila or
Nalanda would become a BHIKKHU, a SANNYASIN, in the end. By the time he
graduated from university he would renounce this world. Those
universities were anti-world; they were preparing for some other
dimension. They were preparing you for something else which cannot be
measured in terms of this world. These techniques were for those type of
people. Either they were innocent by their nature or they were training
themselves to be innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus said to his followers, “If someone hits you on one cheek,
you give him the other,” what is he intending to do? He is trying to
make you innocent. Only a foolish person would do this. When someone
hits you on one cheek, a calculating mind will say, “Hit him hard,
immediately.” And a really calculating mind will say, “Before someone
hits you, hit him. Because attack is the best defense.” Ask Machiavelli
– he is the cleverest mind. He says, “Before someone attacks you, you
attack him,</p><p>because attack is the best defense. Once someone has attacked you,
you are already weak; he has already gained over you. Now the race is
not equal. He is ahead of you. So don’t allow the enemy to go ahead.
Attack before anybody attacks you.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a calculating mind; this is a clever mind. Machiavelli was
read by every prince and every king in medieval Europe – but he was such
a clever person that no king would employ him. He was read – his book
was the bible for power-politics, every prince would read his book The
Prince and they would follow it – but no king was ready to employ him
because he was such a clever man. It was better to keep him away – he
was dangerous; he knew too much. He said, “Virtue is not good, but
pretending to be virtuous is. Don’t be virtuous, but pretend always that
you are virtuous. That is the real good because then you gain from both
the ends: from vice you gain, and from virtue also.” This is the
calculating mind. Go on pretending that you are virtuous, and always
praise virtue. But never be really virtuous. Always praise virtue so
others know that you are a virtuous person. Always condemn vice – but
don’t be afraid to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “When someone hits you on one cheek, give him the other.
And if someone takes your coat, snatches it, give him your shirt also.
And if someone forces you to carry his load for one mile, tell him that
you are ready to carry it for two miles.” This is patent foolishness,
but very meaningful. If you can do this, these techniques will be for
you. Jesus is preparing his disciples for sudden enlightenment. Just
think about it. If you can be so innocent, so trusting, that if the
other is hitting you, he must be hitting you for your good – so give him
the other cheek also, and let him hit it. The other’s goodness is
believed in, trusted in; no one is your enemy. When Jesus says, “Love
your enemies,” this is the meaning. No one is your enemy; don’t see the
enemy anywhere. That doesn’t mean that there will not be enemies and
there will not be people who will exploit you. There will be. They will
exploit you. But be exploited – and don’t be cunning. Just look at that
dimension: be exploited but don’t be cunning. Be exploited but don’t be
mistrusting, don’t disbelieve, don’t lose faith. That is more valuable
than anything others can cheat you of. Nothing else is so valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>But how do our minds function? If one man deceives you, the whole of
humanity is evil. If one man is dishonest or you think that he is
dishonest, then you don’t believe in man at all. Then the whole of
humanity has become dishonest. If one Jew is a miser, then the whole
race of Jews is miserly. If one Mohammedan is bigoted, then all
Mohammedans are. Just one is enough for us to lose our faith in all.
Jesus says, “Even if all are dishonest, you should not lose faith,
because faith is more valuable than what these dishonest people can take
from you by their dishonesty.” So really, if you lose faith you are
losing something; otherwise nothing is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>For such innocent people these techniques are enough, they will not
ask for anything more. You say, and it happens to them. Just on hearing
the master many have become illumined – but in the past, not in this
age.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story about Rinzai. He was a very poor BHIKKHU, a poor
SANNYASIN, a beggar. As he was sleeping in his hut a thief entered.
There was nothing in the hut except a blanket that he himself was using.
He was sleeping on the floor, covered with his blanket. Then he became
very uncomfortable and stared to think, “What an unfortunate fellow! He
has come so far from the village to find something, and there is nothing
in my hut. What misery! How to help him? The only thing is this
blanket.” And he was under it and the thief would not have the courage
to snatch the blanket, so he slipped out from under it, left it there
and slipped into a dark corner. The thief took the blanket</p><p>and went away. The night was very cold, but Rinzai was happy that the
thief had not gone back empty-handed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he sat at the window of his hut. The night was cool, and the
full moon was in the sky. He wrote a small haiku, a small poem. In the
haiku he said, “If I could have given this moon to that thief, I would
have.” This mind! What has he lost? Just a blanket. What has he gained?
The whole world, all that can be gained. He has gained innocence, trust,
love.</p><p><br></p><p>For this man no technique is needed. His master would say, “Just
look. Be aware. Be alert.” And that would do.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE DICTATES OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND
THAT OF THE INNER GUIDE? HOW CAN ONE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INNER GUIDE HAS
COME INTO FUNCTION?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: because of Freud, much misunderstanding has arisen
around the word “unconscious”. Freud completely misunderstood it,
misinterpreted it. And he has become the very basis of modern knowledge
about mind. To Freud, unconscious meant simply the repressed conscious,
the suppressed part of the conscious. So all that is evil and bad,
immoral, has been suppressed. Because the society cannot allow it, it
has to be suppressed within. For Freud, that repressed part is the
unconscious – but not for mystics. Freud is not a mystic; he has not
entered his own unconscious. He has been simply observing cases of
patients: ill people, abnormal people, mad, insane, pathological. He has
been studying the pathological mind, and through the study of the
pathological mind – and that, too, from without – he concluded that just
underneath the conscious there is an unconscious mind. That unconscious
mind carries all that has been suppressed from the childhood, all that
society has condemned. The mind has suppressed it, just to forget that
it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is there – and it goes on functioning. And it is very
powerful: it goes on changing the conscious, it goes on playing tricks
with the conscious. The conscious is really impotent before it, because
whatsoever is repressed is repressed only because it is so powerful that
society cannot cope with it. So society has been repressing it and
society doesn’t know what else to do with it. For example, sex. It is so
powerful that if you don’t repress it you won’t know what to do with it.
It will lead you into dangerous paths. And it is such a forceful energy
that the whole society will become chaotic if it is allowed
completely.No marriage could exist, no love could exist, everything
could be just a chaos if it was allowed total freedom – because then man
would behave like an animal. If there were no marriage, no family, the
whole society would be destroyed. Society depends on the unity of the
family; the family depends on marriage; marriage depends on
sex-suppression. Everything that is natural, forceful, has been
inhibited, tabooed – so forcibly that you feel guilty about it and you
go on fighting with it. Society has not only created policemen outside,
it has created inner policemen, your conscience – a double arrangement
so that you don’t go astray so that you cannot be natural, you have to
be unnatural.</p><p><br></p><p>Now modern psychologists say that insanity is part of civilization –
no civilization can be without madness. But mad people are suffering
because you have forced such an order over them that</p><p>their natural instincts are crushed. They have been crippled. It may
be that your madmen are more powerful than you, that’s why their inner
instincts have revolted and they have thrown their conscience, their
mind, everything, overboard. That’s why they are mad. A better concept
of humanity, a better organization, a better discipline with more
knowledge and wisdom, may use them. They may prove geniuses; they may
prove very talented people. They are. But they have such a force in them
that they cannot repress themselves. And society will not allow them to
move because they are wild. Freud came to the conclusion that
civilization needs the unconscious, the repressed part.</p><p><br></p><p>But really, for Tantra and yoga this unconscious is not the
unconscious, it is just between the conscious and the unconscious, a
small boundary. It is subconscious. The conscious has forced something
down, but the conscious knows about it. It is not really unconscious,
you know about it. You may not want to recognize it, you may not want to
be attentive to it, because you are afraid that if you give it attention
it will come up. You have forced it into darkness but you are conscious
bout it. The Freudian unconscious is not really unconscious, it is only
subconscious. It is not dark night, it is in the light, you can see
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra talks about the real unconscious which is not suppressed by
you but which is your deepest being. And your conscious is just one part
of it which has come into light, the one-tenth part which has seen the
light, which has become conscious. Nine parts, nine-tenths, are just
hidden underneath. That unconscious is really your source of
life-energy, of being. Your conscious mind is one-tenth of the whole
mind and this conscious mind has created its own center: that center is
the ego. This center is false because it doesn’t belong to the whole
mind, it is not the center of the whole mind. It is just a center of the
conscious part, a fragment. The fragment has created its own center and
that center goes on pretending it is the center of the whole being. No,
your total mind has a center: that center is called the guide. That
center is in the unconscious and it will be revealed only when five
fragments, or half of the mind, come into light. Then the center which
is the guide will be revealed. It is hidden in the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>So you need not be afraid of the unconscious; it is the Freudian
unconscious you are afraid of. It is something to be afraid of. But this
Freudian unconscious can be thrown out in catharsis. Hence my great
insistence on catharsis. This Freudian unconscious can be thrown out in
catharsis: whatsoever you wanted to do and you have not done, do it,
meditatively. Don’t do it to anyone because that will create a chain of
events – and you will not be in control. Just do it in a vacuum. If you
are angry, do it in a vacuum. If you feel sexuality, throw it into the
sky. If you feel anything, just allow it to move from your inwards
outwards. Express it. A meditative catharsis will relieve you of the
Freudian unconscious. With the technique that I am teaching – if it is
followed – the Freudian unconscious will simply disappear. And only when
this Freudian unconscious disappears can you penetrate the real
unconscious. It is just in-between, between the conscious and the
unconscious. You just go on throwing your rubbish things into a room and
you close it; you go on accumulating a junkyard – Freudian unconscious
is just a junkyard. Don’t throw it in – I say, throw it out. When it
moves in, you will become pathological, you can go insane. When it moves
out you will become fresh, young, unburdened. For this age, catharsis is
a must. No one can reach the inner guide without catharsis. And once you
are in deep catharsis you need not be afraid. Then the real unconscious
will start revealing itself; then it will penetrate into your conscious,
and then for the first time you will become aware of your vast
territory. You are not such a small fragment, you have a very vast
being, and this vast being has a center – that center is the inner
guide.</p><p>How to differentiate between the unconscious and the inner guide? How
to differentiate between the Freudian unconscious and the inner guide?
It will be difficult if you don’t go through catharsis. But you can feel
a difference by and by because the Freudian unconscious is just a
repressed thing. If something appears in you with a violent force, know
well that this violent force is coming because you have repressed it in
the first place. If something simply appears in you without any
violence, just bubbles up silently, easily, without any sounds, even
soundlessly, then know that this is the real unconscious. From the guide
something is coming to you. But you will become proficient only when you
go through catharsis. Then you will know what is happening. Whenever
anything comes from the Freudian unconscious you will feel disturbed, it
will make you uneasy, uncomfortable; and whenever something comes from
the guide you will feel such serenity, you will feel so happy, so at
ease, so at home, that you cannot imagine it. You will simply feel that
this is the thing. Your total being is in harmony with it, there is no
resistance. You know this is the right, this is the good, this is the
truth – and nobody can convince you otherwise. With the Freudian
unconscious you can never be serene, you can never be still and calm;
you will be disturbed. It is a sort of disease that has come up – and
there will be a fight with it. So it is better if you pass through deep
catharsis, then the Freudian unconscious will become silent, by and
by.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as bubbles come up from a riverbed, come up to the very
surface of the water, you will feel bubbles coming up from the very bed
of your being. They will come to your conscious mind. But their very
coming will give you a deep tranquility – a feeling that nothing can be
more right than this. But before it happens you have to unburden
yourself of the Freudian unconscious. And that can happen only if you
are in a let-go, because the innermost being is so nonviolent that it
will not assert itself. The Freudian unconscious will want to assert
itself; every moment it is trying to assert itself and you are pushing
it back. This is the difference. It wants to assert itself, it wants to
become active, it wants to lead you somewhere, it wants to manipulate
you – and you are resisting it, fighting it. The real unconscious, the
guide, is not assertive. If you allow it, if you invite it, prayerfully,
it will come to you just like an invited guest. You have to be in a
let-go. Only then will it come. When it feels you are ready, when it
feels it will not be denied, rejected, when it feels it will be
welcomed, then it will come to you. So, you have to do two things:
catharsis for the Freudian unconscious, and training in let-go and
surrender for the real guide, the real unconscious. These two things
done, you will know the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference really cannot be taught to you – you will know it.
When it happens, you will know it. How do you know the difference
between when there is pain in your body and when the whole body feels a
well-being? When the whole body is filled with well-being and when your
head has a headache, how do you feel what the difference is? You simply
know it. You cannot define it, you simply know it: you know what a
headache is and you know what well-being is.</p><p><br></p><p>The real guide will always give you a feeling of well-being, and the
Freudian unconscious will always give you a feeling of headache. It is a
turmoil, it is an inner conflict, it is anguish, it is pain suppressed.
So whenever it comes you will feel painful all over.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this Freudian unconscious, many things have become painful
which are not naturally painful For example, sex. Because society has
repressed sex, it has become painful. One of the most blissful things in
natural life is sex. But it has become painful. If you move into sex you
will feel frustrated, you will feel guilty, at the end you will feel
weakened. And you will decide never to have sex again. This is not
because of natural sex, this is because of the unconscious. Sex has
become</p><p>painful. It has been so repressed that it has become ugly and painful
Otherwise it is one of the most natural ecstasies. If a child is never
taught that sex is bad and a sin he will enjoy it, and every time he
will feel a deep well-being flowing all over the body.</p><p><br></p><p>Men feel more well-being than women – because women are repressed
more. No one requires that a boy should be a virgin but everyone
requires, even the boy himself, that the girl he is going to marry
should be a virgin. Even playboys require that the girl should be a
virgin. Women’s unconscious has been repressed ore than men’s, that’s
why only a few women achieve orgasm. And that, too, in the West – in the
east not more than five per cent of women, at the most, achieve any
enjoyment in sex. Ninety-five percent are simply fed up with it. That’s
why when sadhus and monks teach that sex is sin, women always agree.
They gather in multitudes around monks because the thing appeals to
them, it is right. Because they are so suppressed they have never known
any bliss out of it. In India, while making love, woman are not supposed
to move, be active. They have to lie still like a corpse. If they are
active their man will become suspicious: they are enjoying sex and this
is not the sign of a good woman. A good woman is one who doesn’t enjoy.
In the East they will say that if you want to marry, marry a good woman,
and if you want to enjoy, then have a friendship with a bad woman –
because only bad women can enjoy. This is unfortunate. The woman is not
supposed to move, to be active, she should be just dead. How can she
achieve orgasm when the energy is not moving?</p><p><br></p><p>And if she cannot enjoy it she is bound to be against the husband and
she is bound to think that the husband is evil. Every day Indian women
come to me and they say that they are fed up with sex and their husbands
are forcing them again and again to have sex. They don’t like it, they
are disgusted. And why are the husbands not so disgusted? Why are the
women disgusted? The reason is that they have a greater repressed
unconscious about sex than men.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex will become painful. If you have suppressed it, it is a headache.
Anything can become a headache – just suppress it, that is the trick. It
will become a suffering. And anything can become blissful – just express
it, don’t suppress it.</p><p><br></p><p>This Freudian unconscious is all that you know right now. You don’t
know about the real unconscious, the Tantra unconscious – that’s why you
are afraid. And afraid, you cannot let go. Afraid, you cannot lose
control. You know that if you lose control, immediately the suppressed
instincts will take over. Immediately, whatsoever you have repressed
will come to the mind and it will insist on being acted out. That’s why
you are afraid. Catharsis is needed first so the fear goes. And then you
can let go. And if you let go, a very silent force will start flowing to
your conscious mind and you will feel a well-being, you will feel that
you are at home, you will feel that everything is good, you will feel
that you are blessed.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW CAN ONE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INNER GUIDE HAS COME INTO FUNCTION?
This will</p><p>be the first sign: you will start feeling good, good about yourself.
Remember, you always feel bad about yourself. I almost never come across
a person who feels good about himself. Everyone is condemning himself,
everyone thinks he is bad. And when you think you are bad how do you
suppose that someone else is going to love you? And when no one loves
you, you feel frustrated. But you yourself don’t love you. You have
never touched your hand lovingly, you have never felt your body
lovingly, you have never thanked God that he has given you such a
beautiful body, such a beautiful organism. No, you just feel disgusted.
And the religions, the so-called religions have taught you to feel
condemned – this body is a bag of sins. You are carrying a burden.</p><p>When the unconscious is released you will feel suddenly that you are
accepted, you are not bad. Nothing is bad. The whole of life becomes
deep down a blessing. You feel blessed. And the moment you feel blessed,
all others around you become blessed; you can bless them, you can feel
happy. Because you feel condemned, you feel bad about yourself and you
think the same about others. How can you love another’s body if you
condemn your own body? If you are against your own body, how can you
love another body? You will condemn – deep down you will condemn.
Really, religions have prepared you to become just ghosts. They don’t
want you to be with the body, they want you to be just unembodied
spirits. Everything has been so condemned..and you have taken it for
granted. I have seen in scriptures, in many scriptures, that it written
that your body has nothing but blood, fat, phlegm – just to condemn it.
I don’t know what these persons who were writing these scriptures
wanted. Did they want gold to be there? Why is blood bad? Blood is life!
But they have condemned it and we have accepted the condemnation. They
must be mad, insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Jains always say that their TEERTHANKARAS never urinated, they don’t
defecate. Such bad things. But why is urine bad? What do you want to
urinate instead of urine? And what is bad in it? But it is such a bad
thing. And psychologists say that because the sex center and the
urinating organ are the same in man, sex has become condemned. And in
woman the sex center is just in the middle, on one side defecation and
on the other side urination, sex cannot be good if it is between two
such bad things. The condemnation of sex has come because we have
condemned defecation. But why? Why condemn it? What is bad? But we
accept condemnation and when we accept, then there are problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Your whole body is condemned by neurotic people. They may have
written scriptures but that doesn’t make any difference. They may have
been great leaders – neurotics almost always are. They are great leaders
because they are so fanatic that they can immediately get a following.
And there are always people who worship fanaticism. Anyone who says
something strongly will have people falling at his feet saying he is the
right leader. and he may be just neurotic, just mad. These neurotic
people have condemned you and you have accepted them, you have been
conditioned by them.</p><p><br></p><p>When the unconscious flows in you, a subtle well-being will come. You
will feel good: everything is good, and everything is Divine. Your body
comes from the Divine, your blood also, your urine also. Everything is
Divine. When the unconscious flows in you, everything is Divine,
everything becomes spiritual. Nothing is bd, nothing is condemned. This
will be the feeling, and then you will fly. You will become so light you
cannot walk. Then nothing is a burden on your head. Then you can enjoy
small things in a very great way. Then every trivial things becomes a
beauty. But that beauty is given by you – whatsoever you touch becomes
golden because deep down you are so filled with bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the first thing that will happen to you – a goodness
about yourself. And, when the unconscious starts flowing into your
conscious, the second thing will be that you will become less
world-oriented, less intellectual, more total. Then if you are happy you
will not just simply say that you are happy – you will dance. Just
saying, “I am happy,” is pale, meaningless. I see people who say, “I am
happy” – but just look at their faces! I know people who say, “I love
you,” but their body is not expressing anything. Words are dead but we
have substituted them for life. When the unconscious flows in you, this
will be the difference: you will live with your total being. When you
feel happy, you will dance. Then you will not simply say, “I am
happy”-you will be happy: that’s the difference. You will not say, “I am
happy” – there is no need to say it because you will be happy. Then
there will be no need to say to someone, “I love you” – you will be
love. Your whole being will</p><p>show the feeling, you will vibrate with love. Anybody passing nearby
will feel that you love; anyone just touched by your hand will feel a
subtle energy has entered into him. There is a warmth in your presence,
a happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the second thing. First, you will feel a goodness about
yourself and about everything; and second, you will become total. When
the guide takes you, you will be total.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THAT INTUITION STARTS FUNCTIONING, IS SURRENDER THE ONLY
TECHNIQUE FOR THAT INTUITION, OR THE INNER GUIDE? DOES A PERSON LIVING
THROUGH INTUITION ALWAYS SUCCEED? HOW DO YOU VALUE SUCCESS AND FAILURE?
IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THE PERSON LIVING INTUITIVELY WILL BECOME WEAK
INTELLECTUALLY?</p><p><br></p><p>Surrender is the only technique for the inner being to become
active.</p><p><br></p><p>DOES A PERSON LIVING THROUGH INTUITION ALWAYS SUCCEED? No, but he is
always happy</p><p>– whether he succeeds or not. And a person not living intuitively is
always unhappy whether he succeeds or not. Success is not the criterion
because success depends on many things. Happiness is the criterion
because happiness depends only on you. You may not succeed because
others are competitors there. Even if you are working intuitively,
others may be working more cunningly, more cleverly, more calculatingly,
more violently, more immorally. So success depends on many other things;
success is a social phenomenon. You may not succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>Who can say that Jesus succeeded? Crucifixion is not a success, it is
the greatest failure. A man crucified when he was just thirty-three –
what type of success is this? No one knew about him. Just a few
villagers, uneducated people, were his disciples. He had no position, no
prestige, no power. What type of success is this? Crucifixion cannot be
said to be a success. But he was happy. He was totally blissful – even
when being crucified. And those who were crucifying him would remain
alive for many years but they would remain in misery. So really, who was
undergoing crucifixion? That is the point. Those who crucified Jesus,
were they undergoing crucifixion? Or was Jesus, who was crucified? He
was happy. How can you crucify happiness? He was ecstatic. How can you
crucify ecstasy? You can kill the body but you cannot kill the soul.
Those who crucified him, they lived, but their life was nothing but a
long slow crucifixion – misery and misery and misery.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is that I don’t say that if you follow the inner
guide you will always succeed – in the sense that the world recognizes
success; but in the sense that a Buddha or a Jesus recognizes success,
you will succeed. But that success is measured by your happiness, your
bliss – whatsoever happens is irrelevant, you will be happy. Whether the
world says that you have been a failure, or the world makes you a star,
a success, it doesn’t make any difference. You will be happy whatsoever
the case; you will be blissful. Bliss is success to me. If you can
understand that bliss is success, then I say you will succeed
always.</p><p><br></p><p>But to you bliss is not success; success is something else. It may
even be misery. Even if you know that it is going to be a misery, you
long for success. Ask political leaders – they are in misery. I</p><p>have not seen any political leader who is happy. They are just
miserable, but still they are trying for higher posts, trying to get
still higher on the ladder. And those who are already above him are in
misery, and he knows it. But we are ready to be miserable if success
comes to us. So what is success to us? Success is egoistic fulfillment,
not bliss. It is just so that people will say that you have succeeded.
You may have lost everything – you may have lost your soul; you may have
lost all that innocence that gives bliss; you may have lost all that
peace, silence, that brings you nearer to the Divine; you may have lost
all, and become just a madman – but the world will say you are a
success.</p><p><br></p><p>For the world, ego gratification is the success; for me it is not.
For me, to be blissful is success – whether anyone knows about you or
not. It is irrelevant whether anyone knows about you or not, whether you
live totally unknown, unheard of, unnoticed. But if you are blissful,
you have succeeded.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember this distinction because there are many people who would
like to be intuitive, who would like to find the inner guide, just to
succeed in the world. For them the inner guide will be a frustration. In
the first place, they cannot find it. In the second place, even if they
can find it, they will be miserable. Because what they are aiming at is
recognition by the world, ego fulfillment – not bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Be clear in the mind – don’t be success-oriented. Success is the
greatest failure in the world. So don’t try to succeed otherwise you
will be a failure. Think of being blissful. Every moment think of being
more and more blissful. Then the whole world may say you are a failure
but you will not be a failure. You have attained.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was a failure in the eyes of his friends, family, wife,
father, teachers, society – he was a failure. He had become just a
beggar. What type of success is this? He could have been a great
emperor: he had the qualities, he had the personality, he had the mind.
He could have been a great emperor but he became a beggar. He was a
failure – obviously. But I say to you he was not a failure. If he had
become an emperor then he would have been a failure because he would
have missed the real life. What he attained under the Bodhi Tree was the
real and what he lost was unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>With the real you will succeed in the inner life; with the unreal...
I don’t know. If you want to succeed in the unreal then follow the path
of those who are working in cunningness, cleverness, competition,
jealousy, violence. Follow their path, the inner guide is not for you.
If you want to gain something of the world, then don’t listen to the
inner guide.</p><p><br></p><p>But ultimately you will feel that although you have won the whole
world, you have lost yourself. Jesus says, “And what does a man get if
he loses his soul and gains the whole world?” Who will you call a
success: Alexander the Great or Jesus the Crucified? So if – and that
‘if’ has to be understood well – if you are interested in the world,
then the inner guide is not a guide for you. If you are interested in
the inner dimension of being then the inner guide, and only the inner
guide, can help.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part37>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It means divine energy. And you have to play with your energy as much as possible. Create more and more loving intimacy with your energy, allow it all kinds of play. Sitting silently, let kriya happen and don’t inhibit it, don’t repress it; that is the way to commune with god. Don’t be miserly; be open and flowing. The more you flow into existence, the more existence will flow into you: it is always in the same proportion. Whatsoever you sow, you reap and whatsoever you give, you get.\nSo if you want to get more energy give more energy; if you want to get more love give more love. If you want the existence to shower on you in great torrents of bliss, then make people blissful wherever you go. With whomsoever you commune remember only one thing: make people blissful, bring some joy to them... and it is so easy to bring joy to people.\nIt is so easy to be kind and loving, it is so easy to be happy; it costs nothing, but just miserliness has been taught to us. We very reluctantly give ourselves to anybody – not even to those who we love. With them too, we are holding, as if, if we lose something we will never get it again. We are hoarders, and out of hoarding fear arises, and because of fear you become more of a hoarder. By and by you lose contact with divine energy, and it is available everywhere! You just start pouring: from one end you start pouring and from another end you start getting it. And when energy circulates it keeps you vibrant.\nIt is like the circulation of the blood. When new fresh, air goes on coming into your room, your room has a liveliness. When a pool becomes stagnant it starts dying; it becomes dirty, unhygienic.\nClose the doors and windows of the room and you are closing doors to life and to the sun and to the air. Soon you will be living in stale air, and nobody else is responsible except you. Those windows are there to be opened! These senses are our windows, this body is our house; we have to open all these windows.\nPour yourself into existence and you will be surprised: the moment you pour yourself, something goes immediately into you from some unknown source, something is poured into you, because nature abhors a vacuum. That is a very simple scientific law, and it is as exact about spirituality as it is about the material world: nature abhors a vacuum.\nSo create as much of a vacuum as you can and you will be filled by more and more energy, and fresh energy, vital energy. And once you have learned the secret you become an emperor. That is the meaning of the word’swami’: you become a master. You know now there is nothing to lose: the more you lose, the more you get.\nJesus says, ‘Those who are afraid to lose themselves will lose and those who are ready to lose themselves will gain’! He is proposing a very fundamental law.\nPrem means love, shakti means power. Love is the only power there is; all else is impotence and all else makes us weak. All else that is known as power is only pretension.\nMoney is not power, prestige is not power, respectability is not power, political status is not power. These are just ways to hide our impotence, these are ways to cover the impotence that is there. These are ways to hide our deep-rooted inferiority complex from the world; but they only hide, they never destroy it.\nSo others may think you are very powerful because you have a big car and a big house and a big yacht and this and that, and a big bank balance. Others may think you are powerful, but you know; how can you deceive yourself? You can deceive the whole world but you cannot deceive yourself because you know that deep down you are just nothing. All those things are there outside. Others may be deceived because they watch from the outside, but you know yourself from within and there the yacht cannot reach, the car cannot reach, the bank balance cannot reach.\nSo a very very strange phenomenon happens: the richer a man becomes, the poorer he starts feeling. In contrast to all his riches all around he starts feeling very very poor. The more powerful a man becomes, the more powerless he starts feeling within himself. Now he has the contrast: he can see how powerless he is. So all so-called superior people suffer from inferiority. Their dreams are full of inferiority, shadowed by inferiority.\nThere is only one thing that makes a man really powerful, mm? – that is love.\nAnd another strange thing: when love makes you powerful you become humble. A powerful man is always humble. A powerful man is naturally, inevitably unpretending; he is not presumptuous. He does not claim... he need not claim. He never tries to prove; he is so there is no point in proving.\nPeople who try to prove are the people who know they are not. The man of power is unassuming. The really powerful man is one who has no need to prove to anybody that he is powerful. Even a\nsmall child can slap him and he will not retaliate because he has no need even to defend. He knows he is powerful – he will not feel insulted; nobody can insult him.\nPeople can insult you only because deep down you know their insults are true. But when you know they are not true, then they don’t relate to you, they don’t refer to you; they are just pointless, meaningless.\nSo love gives power but in a very new way. The quality is different: the quality is that of a humble man.\nJesus is powerful but so humble. His disciples were waiting thinking that he might show them some miracle when he was crucified. They thought he was the man of power – and they knew that he was. They had seen a thousand and one miracles just happening around him; now was the time to prove his power! They were hiding there in the crowd, waiting – waiting for the right moment when jesus would prove that he was the son of god and would descend from the cross, untouched, whole.\nBut jesus simply died. Nothing happened. That is the miracle! He didn’t try to prove; that’s the miracle. If he had done something he would have been an ordinary man on a power trip. If he had tried to prove his power he would be no more special than those ordinary disciples; the logic would have been the same. No, he simply relaxed and died; he died like such an ordinary man. That is real power.\nTo me, his resurrection does not matter much; that seems to be the story that is needed by the disciples. Whether it happened or not is not the point, but it was needed by the disciples very much. If he didn’t resurrect there would have been no christianity.\nSo whether he resurrected or not is pointless. The disciples managed a story that he resurrected – then everything was okay: he did the miracle. He had come out of death: he proved his power.\nSo christians are very defensive about resurrection. If you disbelieve the resurrection you cannot be a christian; the whole christianity topples down because it depends on power. And the real miracle and the real power happened on the cross in the moment jesus said, ‘Thy kingdom come, thy will be done’.… That was the prayer of a humble man, of a really powerful man. In that moment he proved that he was the son of god; no other proof was needed.\nSo, when power comes through love, it is humble. It has no qualities of the so-called powerful man; it is unassuming. It does not leave a trace behind it. It leaves no shadow even, it makes no shadow: it moves as if it is not. That’s the beauty: love makes you egoless, and then comes power. If power comes before love the ego will absorb it and will become very very stubborn.\nSo always approach shakti power through love; that is one of my fundamentals. Approach knowledge through love, approach power through love, approach god through love... approach everything through love and you will never be in any way going wrong. Approach everything through love and that will be a great protection.\nLove protects and keeps you on the right track because a loving heart cannot go wrong; that is impossible.\n[Osho explains the meaning of anand yatra: a journey to bliss, a pilgrimage to bliss. My whole effort here is to make you pilgrims on the path of bliss. To me bliss is god. To me, to be blissful is the only virtue, and to be miserable, the only sin.]\nPeople think that they are miserable because they have committed sins in the past; that is not true. By being miserable they are committing the sin right now, and if you cannot start being happy you become virtuous because a happy person cannot harm. Only a sad person can harm, only a sad person becomes a sadist: only a miserable person starts looking for other’s misery. And a miserable person wants everybody to be miserable; only then does he feel good, comparatively. If he sees that everybody is miserable, then he can relax; then he can say ‘So I’m not wrong in some way; this is how things are’.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"1648","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_further_shore/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_further_shore/>The Further Shore</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28 The more you flow into existence, the more it flows into you</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1648 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Further_Shore/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark27>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>28</span></p><p><br></p><p>The more you flow into existence, the more it flows into you</p><p><br></p><p>30 June 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Deva shakta.

You haven’t allowed yourself to ever be wild, you’ve always had a subtle control inside you – and that can be a hindrance to spiritual growth... ]\nThere is a subtle difference between repression and control. Repression is not having understanding of what you are doing; you simply repress something. Control is a little more intellectual; you feel convinced that this is the right thing to do, so you control.\nYou are not repressed but you are controlled. Intellectually you understand what is the right thing to do and what is not, and you try to do the right thing. By and by that has become a habit, the very style of your life. That’s why you are not streaming, not flowing, not dancing. And unless you dance, unless you go wholeheartedly with your energy – even if it takes a wild form, even if it becomes almost maddening – you will not grow. One has to go with it totally, and one day a different kind of discipline arises. There are three different things: one is repression without even intellectual understanding; another is control with intellectual understanding; the third is discipline with spiritual awareness... and that is what is needed. We substitute it by control or many more people substitute it by simply repressing.\nYou are in the second category, the controlled category. It is better than people who live with repression but one step more is needed: you have to drop control and you have to come to an inner discipline – which is not a kind of control at all. It is simply your awareness: you know and your act follows your knowing. The act is spontaneous like your shadow follows you; it follows your knowing.\nSo while you are here, relax control; that is the first thing. The second thing: whenever you feel that you can go a little more, try. For example, you are dancing and you feel that if you try a little more you can go a little wilder. Then try it – because we never know how much we can go unless we try.\nSlowly, slowly, you take one step, two steps, three steps, and you become more confident and a great trust arises in energy – that wherever it leads it is good. The day that trust arises the transformation starts.\nWe have been taught not to trust the energy, not to trust life. We have been taught just to trust reason which is a very small fragment and which is in the service of the society. All that is vital, alive, has been denied, and dead reason has been given full rein.\nSo when you are doing the dynamic meditation or the kundalini or some other meditation and you feel that you can go a step more, then go. That one step will make it possible to go one step more, then go. That one step will make it possible to go one step more and so on and so forth: one step leads to another. Soon you will be going far away from your self-drawn boundaries.\nOnce you start going beyond the boundaries you start expanding. That’s what expansion of consciousness is, and that’s what man is always hankering for.\nThere is no need to be small; you can be the whole! Even the sky is not the limit: you can be as big as the whole existence, but for that great courage is needed.\nWe live in a very very shrunken state with small boundaries which we hide behind. Come out! Those caves will not give you light; in those caves light never reaches. Come out in the open!\nSo first, relax control; second, whenever you feel a boundary try to go at least one step beyond it; and third, don’t be afraid of the wild and the mad.\nIf a person remains afraid of the wild and the mad he cannot expand. And the fear is unnecessary... in fact the fear is very dangerous. If a person remains afraid of the wild and the animal and the mad, then all madness goes on accumulating. Layer upon layer you are piling it up: one day it will be too much. One day it will be so much that you will not be able to control it. It will explode and then you will be nowhere. That’s how madness happens.\nMadness happens because of the control. These people in the madhouses are very very controlled people: their madness is the conclusion of their whole life’s effort.\nA man who allows madness, allows wildness, never accumulates any madness and is out of danger. Rather than having it wholesale it is better to have it retail. It is very good to be angry sometimes rather than not being angry for ten years and then one day murdering a man. In those small homeopathic doses anger is good; nothing is wrong. If you don’t use it in small doses, one day it will be so much that your system will not be able to bear it. These three things, remember.\n[Osho explains that prem means love, abhinivesh means devotion... and that’s what his path is going to be. Start looking at life through the eyes of devotion, and there are different ways of regarding life]\nWhen a scientist looks at a certain thing he looks with a rational eye; he wants to know what it is. When a poet looks at the same thing he looks with the aesthetic eye; he wants to enjoy it. When a devotee looks at the same thing he looks with the eye of devotion; he wants to worship it.\nIt may be a rose flowerA scientist looking at it, thinks of the chemicals, elements, composition,\ncolour, of how it is made, of what it is made. He starts analysing, dissecting in his mind, categorising, labelling things, thinking of what species it belongs to, from what country it comes.\nWhen a poet looks at the same rose flower he is not worried about what country it comes from; he is not worried about the composition, about the chemistry of the rose. He is simply interested in the alchemy of the rose, mm! – the beauty of it, the joy of it. In the scientist’s mind the rose becomes an analysis; in the poet’s mind the rose becomes a song.and it is the same rose!\nIt can be looked at with the eyes of devotion too. A devotee looks at the rose as if it is god manifest; for a devotee everything is god manifest. God is green in the trees, red in the rosegod is a cloud\nin the clouds and light in the sun raysgod is a child in a child and very very old in an old man.\nEverything is divine; that is the vision of the devotee.\nSo for a devotee the rose comes as an incarnation of god. He wants to worship it. He would like to bow down to it. He would like to surrender to it: he would like to dance and surrender around it. For the scientist the rose becomes analysis, chemistry; for the poet it becomes a song or a painting. For the devotee it becomes god himself!\nThe devotee’s vision is the greatest vision. All other visions are partial; the devotee’s vision is the total vision.\nThat is the meaning of abhinivesh. Attain to this vision, start looking at life with worshipping eyes – and you will be surprised that that capacity exists in you. You have not used it yet; nobody has told you to use it.\nIt happens many times that we have a certain thing there already, but if nobody tells you you will not become aware of it. By becoming a sannyasin you are simply saying to me, ‘Now if you tell me something, I am going to follow it’. That’s the meaning of sannyas.\nThis is what I see – that you can become a devotee. You may not have ever thought about it, it may not have even dawned in your dreams – but start, and you will see it growing. And once it starts growing it is such a joy that nothing else is comparable to it.\nA devotee forgets about everything else. He says, ‘Everything is so divine, nothing else is needed’. He is moving from one temple to another, from one god to another god. His whole life is worship, his work is worshiphe lives in the atmosphere of worship. Create it!\n[A sannyasin says: I just want you to see my heart.]\nThis is right. The real thing cannot be said. The real thing is not a thought; that’s why it cannot be said. The real thing is inexpressible by its very nature. And you are right: it is there in the heart. Only the heart counts, only the heart has any value.\n[A sannyasin says she’s always hard on herself, always fighting with herself, and she’s sick of it. She has a certain discipline – that she shouldn’t smoke, shouldn’t eat certain things, and when she goes against it she gets angry with herself, tries to rationalise away what she does. Really tired of it? chuckles Osho, Then drop it!]\n... It will not become a discipline. If you drop it through understanding that it is meaningless, it does not create another discipline. If you force it, if you force it out by creating another discipline, then the other becomes the discipline. If through seeing its stupidity you simply drop it, it does not create another discipline. The difference between these two is tremendous.\nIf you see that the patterns you have lived in up to now are simply confining – they are not liberating and they have made you hard towards yourselfIf you are hard towards yourself you will be hard\ntowards other people too. That’s the natural consequence of being hard towards oneself. You will be harder towards others than you are towards yourself; it is the natural corollary.\nIf you are soft towards yourself, only then are you soft towards others. If you love yourself tremendously, only then do you love others tremendously. If you are too much of a disciplinarian, too much of a perfectionist, then you will always be expecting others also to be perfectionists: they should do this and should not do that.\nWhatsoever your expectation is of yourself it is bound to be your expectation of others also, and if they fall below it a deep condemnation and judgement will be there. You will not be able to love human beings – you can only love saintsand they are not available. Then you cannot love anybody\nand you start living in a loveless world.\nYou cannot love yourself and you cannot love anybody else: you become more and more hard, you start becoming more and more steel-like.\nSeeing this – that this is death, seeing this – that it is harmful to you, you can drop it. I’m not saying to practise dropping. If you practise, then the other thing becomes a discipline. I’m not saying to practise dropping; I’m saying to drop it suddenly. Be finished with it this very moment.\nIt will haunt you for a few days, it will come again and again in the mind, but say that you are finished. Don’t create the new discipline; just go on saying to the old that you are finished, good-bye! You have nothing to do with it. And start relaxing, start loosening up.\nLife is only when you are relaxed, when there is no should and no should-not, when the ‘ought’ disappears, the prison disappears, when you start floating with things, when you accept limitations, when you accept imperfections, when you accept that life is like that.\nThere is only one golden rule – that there are no golden rules. Once this becomes your understanding.,. I’m not saying to create another pattern, a new structure around you; start living without a structure. Now you will have to watch because the mind is such that it can easily move to the other extreme.\nFor example: if you have been dieting, eating this, not eating that or not eating much, then one day seeing the futility of it you drop it, you will start eating too much. If you start eating too much, sooner\nor later you will fall back to the old pattern again, because when you eat too much you will start feeling fat; you will start feeling a stomach trouble and this and that. Then you will say that the first discipline was far better.\nSo in fact if you start eating too much that means that the old discipline is creating this to bring you back home. It is a trap.\nMm? – if you have lived without smoking, with a very strict rule to never smoke, and then the next day thinking that now you have dropped it you start smoking the whole day, you become a chain smoker. You start coughing, the heart feels it and the lungs feel it. After two, three days, you feel tired of smoking and you say, ‘It was better not to smoke’. This smoking too much is just a trick of the old mind. The mind says, ‘So you want to drop the discipline? Now go and do the other and see what happens, and then you will choose me again.’\nSo if you really understand that the discipline is meaningless, don’t go to the other extreme; otherwise sooner or later you will be in the trap. There is nothing very much wrong; occasionally one smokes – there is nothing very much wrong. It is just innocent stupidity; that much I allow! It is just foolish, but one should not be wise twenty-four hours, mm? – that becomes heavy. Yes, once in a while it is okay.\nAnd you are not harming anybody, just doing a innocent thing: taking smoke in and throwing it out, taking it in and throwing out. It is like a transcendental meditation. You are doing a japa with the smoke: in/out, in/out, in/out. Once in a while it is nothing to be worried about. One should be so relaxed in life.\nIf one day you eat too much, nothing wrong. The body is so adjustable that it can always allow a few holidays. Mm? – you go for a picnic and you eat too much: it is perfectly okay, but don’t make it a daily thing; then there is trouble.\nOne should live in such a relaxed freedom that occasionally everything is allowed – but nothing is made into a habit. This man I call a free man. A free man has no character; character is always binding. The good man’s character binds him and the bad man’s character also binds him. The really free man has no character – he is simple freedom: he lives moment to moment. He is responsible but he carries no rules and regulations; he depends on his consciousness.\nSo if your consciousness allows you some day – friends have come and the ice-cream is really so tasty – one can eat a little more; nothing is wrong. But this should not become a habit, then there is no need for dieting. But the mind is always happy moving from dieting to over-eating, then from over-eating to dieting; this way it goes on like a pendulum.\nWhat I am suggesting is to let the pendulum hang just in the middle so the clock stops. Don’t go to the extreme; remain in the middle. Try it! It will be a great experience.\nThere are two types of people who miss life: one is the person who goes into indulgence too much and one is the person who goes into discipline too much. These are the two persons in this life. One misses by going to the left too much, one by going to the right too much.\nThe rich man, the really rich man – rich in the sense of being more conscious, more free, more alive – is the man who always remains in the middle.\nHave you ever seen how a tightrope walker walks? He keeps balance by continuously balancing himself. Sometimes he leans towards the right, just for a single moment, and then he leans towards the left immediately; then again to the right, then again to the left he goes on. He keeps a pole in his hand to keep balance. But he never leans too much to the right, otherwise he will fall, and never too much to the left, otherwise again he will fall.\nThe man of understanding is a tightrope walker. Great joy is there, great dance is there, but one should be in the middle, just in the middle. Just to keep in the middle sometimes you can lean left, right; that’s perfectly okay.\nTry it, and from tomorrow you start living. Mm? but don’t go to the other extreme. Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2889","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_further_shore/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_further_shore/>The Further Shore</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16 There are not golden rules</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2889 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Further_Shore/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

it will be helpful for him to know. You haven’t allowed yourself to ever
be wild, you’ve always had a subtle control inside you – and that can be
a hindrance to spiritual growth... ]</p><p><br></p><p>There is a subtle difference between repression and control.
Repression is not having understanding of what you are doing; you simply

looks with the aesthetic eye; he wants to enjoy it. When a devotee looks
at the same thing he looks with the eye of devotion; he wants to worship
it.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be a rose flower<span class=s4></span>A scientist looking at
it, thinks of the chemicals, elements, composition,</p><p>colour, of how it is made, of what it is made. He starts analysing,
dissecting in his mind, categorising, labelling things, thinking of what
species it belongs to, from what country it comes.</p><p><br></p><p>When a poet looks at the same rose flower he is not worried about
what country it comes from; he is not worried about the composition,
about the chemistry of the rose. He is simply interested in the alchemy
of the rose, mm! – the beauty of it, the joy of it. In the scientist’s
mind the rose becomes an analysis; in the poet’s mind the rose becomes a
song.<span class=s4></span>and it is the same rose!</p><p><br></p><p>It can be looked at with the eyes of devotion too. A devotee looks at
the rose as if it is god manifest; for a devotee everything is god
manifest. God is green in the trees, red in the rose<span class=s4></span>god is a cloud</p><p>in the clouds and light in the sun rays<span class=s4></span>god is
a child in a child and very very old in an old man.</p><p>Everything is divine; that is the vision of the devotee.</p><p><br></p><p>So for a devotee the rose comes as an incarnation of god. He wants to
worship it. He would like to bow down to it. He would like to surrender
to it: he would like to dance and surrender around it. For the scientist
the rose becomes analysis, chemistry; for the poet it becomes a song or
a painting. For the devotee it becomes god himself!</p><p><br></p><p>The devotee’s vision is the greatest vision. All other visions are
partial; the devotee’s vision is the total vision.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of abhinivesh. Attain to this vision, start
looking at life with worshipping eyes – and you will be surprised that
that capacity exists in you. You have not used it yet; nobody has told
you to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens many times that we have a certain thing there already, but
if nobody tells you you will not become aware of it. By becoming a
sannyasin you are simply saying to me, ‘Now if you tell me something, I
am going to follow it’. That’s the meaning of sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I see – that you can become a devotee. You may not have
ever thought about it, it may not have even dawned in your dreams – but
start, and you will see it growing. And once it starts growing it is
such a joy that nothing else is comparable to it.</p><p><br></p><p>A devotee forgets about everything else. He says, ‘Everything is so
divine, nothing else is needed’. He is moving from one temple to
another, from one god to another god. His whole life is worship, his
work is worship<span class=s4></span>he lives in the atmosphere of
worship. Create it!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I just want you to see my heart.]</p><p><br></p><p>This is right. The real thing cannot be said. The real thing is not a
thought; that’s why it cannot be said. The real thing is inexpressible
by its very nature. And you are right: it is there in the heart. Only
the heart counts, only the heart has any value.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she’s always hard on herself, always fighting with
herself, and she’s sick of it. She has a certain discipline – that she
shouldn’t smoke, shouldn’t eat certain things, and when she goes against
it she gets angry with herself, tries to rationalise away what she does.
Really tired of it? chuckles Osho, Then drop it!]</p><p><br></p><p>... It will not become a discipline. If you drop it through
understanding that it is meaningless, it does not create another
discipline. If you force it, if you force it out by creating another
discipline, then the other becomes the discipline. If through seeing its
stupidity you simply drop it, it does not create another discipline. The
difference between these two is tremendous.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see that the patterns you have lived in up to now are simply
confining – they are not liberating and they have made you hard towards
yourself<span class=s4></span>If you are hard towards yourself you
will be hard</p><p>towards other people too. That’s the natural consequence of being
hard towards oneself. You will be harder towards others than you are
towards yourself; it is the natural corollary.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are soft towards yourself, only then are you soft towards
others. If you love yourself tremendously, only then do you love others
tremendously. If you are too much of a disciplinarian, too much of a
perfectionist, then you will always be expecting others also to be
perfectionists: they should do this and should not do that.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever your expectation is of yourself it is bound to be your
expectation of others also, and if they fall below it a deep
condemnation and judgement will be there. You will not be able to love
human beings – you can only love saints<span class=s4></span>and they
are not available. Then you cannot love anybody</p><p>and you start living in a loveless world.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot love yourself and you cannot love anybody else: you become
more and more hard, you start becoming more and more steel-like.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing this – that this is death, seeing this – that it is harmful to
you, you can drop it. I’m not saying to practise dropping. If you
practise, then the other thing becomes a discipline. I’m not saying to
practise dropping; I’m saying to drop it suddenly. Be finished with it
this very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>It will haunt you for a few days, it will come again and again in the
mind, but say that you are finished. Don’t create the new discipline;
just go on saying to the old that you are finished, good-bye! You have
nothing to do with it. And start relaxing, start loosening up.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is only when you are relaxed, when there is no should and no
should-not, when the ‘ought’ disappears, the prison disappears, when you
start floating with things, when you accept limitations, when you accept
imperfections, when you accept that life is like that.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one golden rule – that there are no golden rules. Once
this becomes your understanding.,. I’m not saying to create another
pattern, a new structure around you; start living without a structure.
Now you will have to watch because the mind is such that it can easily
move to the other extreme.</p><p><br></p><p>For example: if you have been dieting, eating this, not eating that
or not eating much, then one day seeing the futility of it you drop it,
you will start eating too much. If you start eating too much, sooner</p><p><br></p><p>or later you will fall back to the old pattern again, because when
you eat too much you will start feeling fat; you will start feeling a
stomach trouble and this and that. Then you will say that the first
discipline was far better.</p><p><br></p><p>So in fact if you start eating too much that means that the old
discipline is creating this to bring you back home. It is a trap.</p><p><br></p><p>Mm? – if you have lived without smoking, with a very strict rule to
never smoke, and then the next day thinking that now you have dropped it
you start smoking the whole day, you become a chain smoker. You start
coughing, the heart feels it and the lungs feel it. After two, three
days, you feel tired of smoking and you say, ‘It was better not to
smoke’. This smoking too much is just a trick of the old mind. The mind
says, ‘So you want to drop the discipline? Now go and do the other and
see what happens, and then you will choose me again.’</p><p><br></p><p>So if you really understand that the discipline is meaningless, don’t
go to the other extreme; otherwise sooner or later you will be in the
trap. There is nothing very much wrong; occasionally one smokes – there
is nothing very much wrong. It is just innocent stupidity; that much I
allow! It is just foolish, but one should not be wise twenty-four hours,
mm? – that becomes heavy. Yes, once in a while it is okay.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are not harming anybody, just doing a innocent thing: taking
smoke in and throwing it out, taking it in and throwing out. It is like
a transcendental meditation. You are doing a japa with the smoke:
in/out, in/out, in/out. Once in a while it is nothing to be worried
about. One should be so relaxed in life.</p><p><br></p><p>If one day you eat too much, nothing wrong. The body is so adjustable
that it can always allow a few holidays. Mm? – you go for a picnic and
you eat too much: it is perfectly okay, but don’t make it a daily thing;
then there is trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>One should live in such a relaxed freedom that occasionally
everything is allowed – but nothing is made into a habit. This man I
call a free man. A free man has no character; character is always
binding. The good man’s character binds him and the bad man’s character
also binds him. The really free man has no character – he is simple
freedom: he lives moment to moment. He is responsible but he carries no
rules and regulations; he depends on his consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>So if your consciousness allows you some day – friends have come and
the ice-cream is really so tasty – one can eat a little more; nothing is
wrong. But this should not become a habit, then there is no need for
dieting. But the mind is always happy moving from dieting to
over-eating, then from over-eating to dieting; this way it goes on like
a pendulum.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am suggesting is to let the pendulum hang just in the middle
so the clock stops. Don’t go to the extreme; remain in the middle. Try
it! It will be a great experience.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two types of people who miss life: one is the person who
goes into indulgence too much and one is the person who goes into
discipline too much. These are the two persons in this life. One misses
by going to the left too much, one by going to the right too much.</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man, the really rich man – rich in the sense of being more
conscious, more free, more alive – is the man who always remains in the
middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen how a tightrope walker walks? He keeps balance by
continuously balancing himself. Sometimes he leans towards the right,
just for a single moment, and then he leans towards the left
immediately; then again to the right, then again to the left he goes on.
He keeps a pole in his hand to keep balance. But he never leans too much
to the right, otherwise he will fall, and never too much to the left,
otherwise again he will fall.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of understanding is a tightrope walker. Great joy is there,
great dance is there, but one should be in the middle, just in the
middle. Just to keep in the middle sometimes you can lean left, right;
that’s perfectly okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Try it, and from tomorrow you start living. Mm? but don’t go to the
other extreme. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

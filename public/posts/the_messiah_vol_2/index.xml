In this silence
20 January 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
AND AN ORATOR SAID, SPEAK TO US OF FREEDOM. AND HE ANSWERED:
AT THE CITY GATE AND BY YOUR FIRESIDE I HAVE SEEN YOU PROSTRATE YOURSELF AND WORSHIP YOUR OWN FREEDOM,
EVEN AS SLAVES HUMBLE THEMSELVES BEFORE A TYRANT AND PRAISE HIM THOUGH HE SLAYS THEM.
AY, IN THE GROVE OF THE TEMPLE AND IN THE SHADOW OF THE CITADEL I HAVE SEEN THE FREEST AMONG YOU WEAR THEIR FREEDOM AS A YOKE AND A HANDCUFF.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
YOU ARE GOOD WHEN YOU ARE FULLY AWAKE IN YOUR SPEECH.
YET YOU ARE NOT EVIL WHEN YOU SLEEP WHILE YOUR TONGUE STAGGERS WITHOUT PURPOSE.
AND EVEN STUMBLING SPEECH MAY STRENGTHEN A WEAK TONGUE.
YOU ARE GOOD WHEN YOU WALK TO YOUR GOAL FIRMLY AND WITH BOLD STEPS.</description>

The seed of blissfulness

IT IS THE BLOSSOMING OF YOUR DESIRES, BUT IT IS NOT THEIR FRUIT.
IT IS A DEPTH CALLING UNTO A HEIGHT, BUT IT IS NOT THE DEEP NOR THE HIGH.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
A dewdrop cannot offend the ocean
5 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
AND SOME OF YOUR ELDERS REMEMBER PLEASURES WITH REGRET LIKE WRONGS COMMITTED IN DRUNKENNESS.
BUT REGRET IS THE BECLOUDING OF THE MIND AND NOT ITS CHASTISEMENT.
THEY SHOULD REMEMBER THEIR PLEASURES WITH GRATITUDE, AS THEY WOULD THE HARVEST OF A SUMMER.
YET IF IT COMFORTS THEM TO REGRET, LET THEM BE COMFORTED.</description>

In you are hidden all men

BELOVED OSHO,
YOUR DAILY LIFE IS YOUR TEMPLE AND YOUR RELIGION. WHENEVER YOU ENTER INTO IT TAKE WITH YOU YOUR ALL.
TAKE THE PLOUGH AND THE FORGE AND THE MALLET AND THE LUTE, THE THINGS YOU HAVE FASHIONED IN NECESSITY OR FOR DELIGHT.
FOR IN REVERIE YOU CANNOT RISE ABOVE YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS NOR FALL LOWER THAN YOUR FAILURES.</description>

The real freedom
20 January 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
AND WHAT IS IT BUT FRAGMENTS OF YOUR OWN SELF YOU WOULD DISCARD THAT YOU MAY BECOME FREE?
IF IT IS AN UNJUST LAW YOU WOULD ABOLISH, THAT LAW WAS WRITTEN WITH YOUR OWN HAND UPON YOUR OWN FOREHEAD.
YOU CANNOT ERASE IT BY BURNING YOUR LAW BOOKS NOR BY WASHING THE FOREHEADS OF YOUR JUDGES, THOUGH YOU POUR THE SEA UPON THEM.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
THE MIST THAT DRIFTS AWAY AT DAWN, LEAVING BUT DEW IN THE FIELDS, SHALL RISE AND GATHER INTO A CLOUD AND THEN FALL DOWN IN RAIN.
AND NOT UNLIKE THE MIST HAVE I BEEN.
IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT I HAVE WALKED IN YOUR STREETS, AND MY SPIRIT HAS ENTERED YOUR HOUSES,</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
WISE MEN HAVE COME TO YOU TO GIVE YOU OF THEIR WISDOM. I CAME TO TAKE OF YOUR WISDOM:

“HE SITS ALONE ON HILLTOPS AND LOOKS DOWN UPON OUR CITY.”
TRUE IT IS THAT I HAVE CLIMBED THE HILLS AND WALKED IN REMOTE PLACES.</description>

BELOVED OSHO,
THIS WOULD I HAVE YOU REMEMBER IN REMEMBERING ME:
THAT WHICH SEEMS MOST FEEBLE AND BEWILDERED IN YOU IS THE STRONGEST AND MOST DETERMINED.

AND IS IT NOT A DREAM WHICH NONE OF YOU REMEMBER HAVING DREAMT, THAT BUILDED YOUR CITY AND FASHIONED ALL THERE IS IN IT?</description>

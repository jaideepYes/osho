AND HE SAID:\nYOUR PAIN IS THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL THAT ENCLOSES YOUR UNDERSTANDING.\nEVEN AS THE STONE OF THE FRUIT MUST BREAK, THAT ITS HEART MAY STAND IN THE SUN, SO MUST YOU KNOW PAIN.\nAND COULD YOU KEEP YOUR HEART IN WONDER AT THE DAILY MIRACLES OF YOUR LIFE, YOUR PAIN WOULD NOT SEEM LESS WONDROUS THAN YOUR JOY;\nAND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART, EVEN AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THE SEASONS THAT PASS OVER YOUR FIELDS.\nAND YOU WOULD WATCH WITH SERENITY THROUGH THE WINTERS OF YOUR GRIEF. MUCH OF YOUR PAIN IS SELF-CHOSEN.\nIT IS THE BITTER POTION BY WHICH THE PHYSICIAN WITHIN YOU HEALS YOUR SICK SELF.\nTHEREFORE TRUST THE PHYSICIAN, AND DRINK HIS REMEDY IN SILENCE AND TRANQUILITY:\nFOR HIS HAND, THOUGH HEAVY AND HARD, IS GUIDED BY THE TENDER HAND OF THE UNSEEN,\nAND THE CUP HE BRINGS, THOUGH IT BURN YOUR LIPS, HAS BEEN FASHIONED OF THE CLAY WHICH THE POTTER HAS MOISTENED WITH HIS OWN SACRED TEARS.\nIt seems that it is very difficult, even for a man of Kahlil Gibran’s caliber, to forget a deep-rooted, male chauvinistic attitude. I am saying this because the statements that Almustafa is going to make are right in a way – but still they miss something very essential.\nAlmustafa forgets that the question is raised by a woman, and his answer is very general, applicable to both man and woman. But the truth is that the pain and suffering that women of the world have gone through is a thousandfold more than man has even known. That’s why I say Almustafa is answering the question, but not the questioner. And unless the questioner is answered, the answer remains superficial – howsoever profound it may sound. I would like you to remember again and again: Wherever I see that just a small sentence or sometimes just even a word would have made it truer, far deeper, far more compassionate.…\nThe answer seems to be academic, philosophical.\nIt does not have the insight into what man has done to the woman – and it is not a question of one day, but of thousands of years. He does not even mention it. On the contrary, he goes on doing the same that the priests and the politicians have been doing always – giving consolations. Behind beautiful words there is nothing but consolation. And consolation cannot be a substitute for truth.\nAND A WOMAN SPOKE.…\nIs it not strange that out of that whole crowd no man asked about pain? – is it just accidental? No, absolutely no. It is very relevant that a woman asked the question, “Tell us of pain,” because only the woman knows how many wounds she has been carrying, how much slavery – physical, mental and spiritual – she has suffered and is still suffering. A woman is hurting in the deepest core of her being. No man knows the depth pain can go into you and destroy your dignity, your pride, your very humanity.\nAlmustafa said:\nYOUR PAIN IS THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL THAT ENCLOSES YOUR UNDERSTANDING.\nA very poor statement – so superficial that I feel ashamed of Kahlil Gibran sometimes. Any idiot can say it. It is not worthy of Kahlil Gibran: your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. It is a very simple and general statement.\nEVEN AS THE STONE OF THE FRUIT MUST BREAK, THAT ITS HEART MAY STAND IN THE SUN, SO MUST YOU KNOW PAIN.\nI hate this statement; he is supporting the idea that you must experience pain. It is a truism, but not a truth. It is very factual – a seed has to go through great suffering, because unless the seed dies\nin his suffering the tree will never be born, and the great foliage and the beauty of the flowers will never come into existence. But who remembers the seed and its courage to die for the unknown to be born?\nThe same is true, if...the shell that encloses your understanding... goes through suffering, breaks down, allows freedom to your understanding, there is going to be a certain pain.\nBut what is the shell? That’s how poets have escaped from crucifixions; he should have explained what the shell is. All the knowledge, all your conditionings, the whole process of your upbringing, your education, your society and civilization – they constitute the shell which keeps you and your understanding imprisoned. But he is not mentioning a single word of what he means by “shell.”\nObviously no religion has condemned Kahlil Gibran. If he had been more sincere and honest then he himself would have known what pain is. He has received only praise for his beautiful poetic sayings, but behind that praise there is some weakness; something of the coward is still lurking in the darkness of his soul.\nIf he had said, “Your religion, your philosophy, your political ideology, your nationality, your race – these are all constituents of your imprisonment,” then, instead of having international respect and honor, he would have been condemned by all the religions, by all the nations, by all the races – which means by almost the whole world. I have been passing through that pain for my whole life, so when I say it, I say it out of my own experience.\nJust make a single statement against those who are benefited by reducing the whole humanity to slaves, and all the powerful ones are going to be against you. And the masses are blind, the masses are not intelligent, the masses are poor; they are not going to listen to me – because what can I give them? I can give to them understanding, but they cannot eat understanding, they cannot live by understanding. And their own conditioning is all that they have been taught – that it is wisdom.\nSo it is not only the powerful ones; those who are being exploited, whose power has been taken away by the powerful ones – otherwise from where will they get the power? – they are also going to follow them. The powerful ones are the shepherds, and they have reduced the whole humanity to a crowd of sheep.\nIt is almost unbelievable that those who could have raised humanity and its consciousness to such beauty, wisdom and joy have never been heard – although they were shouting from the housetops. Every effort has been made that either they should be forced to remain silent, or they should be crucified. Those who had not the courage – seeing the whole thing – have remained silent; but in remaining silent you are also participating in the suffering the whole humanity is going through.\nOnly very few people have spoken – and they have been poisoned, crucified, killed, assassinated. You have been killing your friends. You have been killing those who have loved you so much that they were ready to sacrifice their life, but were not ready to remain silent. And you have followed your enemies, who are sucking your blood every moment.\nWhen I spoke for the first time for birth control, for legalization of abortion, I was condemned by everyone. If they had listened to me at that time, today India would have been rich, because when I\nstarted telling people, “This growth of your population is going to kill you, to destroy you,” there were only four hundred million people in India. After thirty years there are nine hundred million people; five hundred million people could have been prevented, and the country would not be starving.\nBut still they are not willing to listen to me. They are still listening to the shankaracharyas who are against birth control, they are listening to Mother Teresas who are against birth control. THEY are your enemies. But it seems you are so blind you cannot see a simple fact.\nAlmustafa is saying: your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. It is true, but it would have been more sincere if he had explained what he means by “the shell,” because the whole thing depends on the meaning of the word “shell” – what is the shell?\nPeople will read it just like fiction, poetry, and nobody will ever take note that they have passed the word “shell,” which contains your whole past. And unless you are ready to disconnect yourself from your past, there is going to be pain – it is your past; it is not easy just to get out of it. It is not like clothes that you can change, it is like peeling your skin. But without passing through this pain there is no possibility of any understanding.\nThis is true for both men and women, but it is more true for women because the whole past is created by the male; the female has been simply a shadow, not very substantial. All Hindu incarnations of God are men; it is so surprising and shocking that they can accept animals as the incarnation of God, but they have not accepted a single woman as an incarnation of God.\nThe woman has been completely ignored, has not been taken into account at all. She constitutes half of the world, and for thousands of years she has had no voting right. In China it has been believed that she has no soul, so the question of pain does not arise. If you destroy your furniture do you think the furniture will go through great suffering? that there will be pain? If you slap the table do you think there will be tears? China, for centuries, has categorized woman with things; hence, in the Chinese morality, to murder your own wife is not a crime. It is your wife, it is your possession; you can do anything you want to do.\nIn India.Gautam Buddha is a man, his great disciples – Mahakashyap, Sariputta, Moggalayan –\nall are men. Was there not a single woman who could have been raised to the same consciousness? But Gautam Buddha himself was denying initiation to women, as if they are a species not of humanity but of some subhuman state. Why bother with them? – let them first attain manhood.\nThe statement of Gautam Buddha is that man is the crossroads from where you can go anywhere – to enlightenment, to ultimate freedom. But the woman is not mentioned at all. She is not a crossroads, but just a dark street where no municipal corporation has even put lights; it goes nowhere. Man is a superhighway; so first let the woman come on the superhighway, let her become a man, be born in the body of a man – then there is some possibility of her becoming enlightened.\nSays Almustafa.so must you know pain – but for what? If the woman cannot become enlightened,\nwhy should she go through pain? She is not gold, in that going through fire she will become purer.\nAND COULD YOU KEEP YOUR HEART IN WONDER AT THE DAILY MIRACLES OF YOUR LIFE, YOUR PAIN WOULD NOT SEEM LESS WONDROUS THAN YOUR JOY.…\nIt is true, but sometimes truth can be very dangerous, a double-edged sword. On one hand it protects, on another hand it destroys. It is true that if you keep the wonder in your eyes you will be surprised to know that even pain has its own sweetness, its own miracle, its own joy. It is not less wondrous than joy itself.\nBut the strange fact is that the woman is always more like a child, more full of wonder than man. Man is always after knowledge – and what is knowledge? Knowledge is just a means to get rid of wonder. The whole of science is trying to demystify existence, and the word “science” means knowledge. And it is a very simple fact that the more you know, the less you wonder.\nJust go for a morning walk with a small child.My father used to drag me out of bed so early in the\nmorning, at five o’clock. It was still one hour before the sun would rise; everything was dark. And I had told him many times, “I cannot understand; what kind of arithmetic is this? – when I want to remain awake I am forced to go to bed. When the night sky is so full of stars and I want to go to the river, I am prevented. And then, when the stars have started disappearing, the sun has not yet arisen, and I am feeling sleepy, I am forced to go for a morning walk. You are dragging me! – it is not a morning walk. I just want to understand the logic of it.”\nEvery child feels it – every child, without exception, because the family wants to get rid of him: “Go to sleep.” Don’t disturb them. And they want the child to get up early in the morning.\nAnd my father quoted an ancient saying which exists in all the languages all over the world: “Early to bed and early to get out of the bed keeps you healthy and wise.”\nI said, “A strange kind of logic.”\nBut there was no wayhe was so insistent I had to go. But as darkness started disappearing and\nthe birds started singing... and the morning freshnessand the beautiful sunrays, as if a new sun\nhad come – the old died last night – I would ask him many questions. He said, “While walking you have to be silent.”\nI said, “I can be silent only on one condition.” He said, “What?”\nI said, “My condition is – don’t disturb my sleep in the morning. You can choose. If you wake me up, you also wake my intelligence. It is good that people in England take their dogs for walks: I am not a dog! So either you have to go alone for your walk – wherever you want to go, goEven if you\ndon’t want to return, nobody is going to worry about it. One day you will go and you will not return – and that can be any day. But if you drag me out of my bed, then be prepared for my questions. And my questions are not out of curiosityI feel so full of wonder about each and every thing.”\nHe said, “I cannot leave you sleeping. I am creating a foundation for your whole life. It is a healthy habit – because the air is fresh, the sun is young, everybody is asleep, all over there is silence. And the birds only sing once in a while; their singing does not disturb the silence, on the contrary, it deepens it.”\nI said, “I am ready.”\nHe said, “Let us have a compromise.”\nI said, “I don’t believe in compromises. Either I am right or I am wrong. What kind of compromise? What do you mean by...?”\nHe said, “You don’t have to do anything; it is all on my part. I will take you for the morning walk, and you can ask any questions you like, as many questions as you like, but I am not going to answer.”\nI said, “That’s perfectly okay.”\nAnd it was really a joy! I would pull his shirt, nudge him, that there was a question. For a few minutes he would keep silent; finally he would get angry. He would say, “What kind of boy have I got? You don’t allow me to enjoy my walk!”\nAnd I said, “What about my sleep?”\nFinally he dropped it; he said, “You sleep and I’ll go for a walk.”\nAs you grow older you lose the sensitivity for wonder, you become more and more dull. But the reason for it is that now you know everything. You know nothing, but your mind is now full of borrowed knowledge, and you have not ever thought that underneath it is nothing but darkness and ignorance.\nIn India there were only two persons who were known as Mahatma, the great soul. One was Mahatma Gandhi, another was Mahatma Bhagwandin. Mahatma Bhagwandin used to stay with my family – he was constantly traveling. I have never seen such a knowledgeable man, about everything; he knew so much that he was almost the ninth wonder of the world! With him I used to go for a morning walk. He needed me because he was so full of knowledge, he wanted somebody to ask questions.\nMy father said, “This is strange. I am tired of you, and whenever Mahatma Bhagwandin comes he asks for nobody else’s company, he simply asks about you. I have to drag you out of the bed, but when he is here, you drag him out of the bed. Not five, but four o’clock will do, even three will do: ‘Let us go for a walk.’”\nSometimes he would say, “This is too early!”\nI would say, “Nothing is early. The earlier it is, the wiser you become.”\nBut he enjoyed my company because I was constantly asking about everything. He knew the names of all the trees, he knew all their medicinal uses. He himself was a wonder. But one day our friendship was finished because I asked a wrong question, although he realized before he died.…\nI was present three days before he died, and he confessed before his death, “You were right, just forgive me – because now I know my life-energy is spent. It is only a question of a few hours, or at the most a few days. And you have come at the right time to see me. I was waiting for you, because I owe this apology to you.”\nI said, “What are you talking about?” I had completely forgotten. It was many years before that he had become angry because I had asked him, “I do understand that you know much about trees, you know much about the stars, you know much about the earth, you know much about everything – and whatever I have asked you have never said, ‘I don’t know’ – but now I want to ask, ‘Do you know yourself?’ And don’t deceive a child, because that will be a real sin. I am asking out of my love and respect for you.\n“And secondly, is all this knowledge that you have gathered going to help you to know yourself? And is not all this knowledge simply borrowed? What is the point of your knowing the Latin name of a tree, the medicinal use of its leaves, of the bark, of the roots, of the flowers? Is it your own discovery? – or have you just been collecting information?”\nHe became angry. I said, “Your anger is enough of an answer. You have never become angry before, because I was asking things about which you have collected information. You are a walking ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA – that is accepted. But what about you? All this knowledge will disappear when death knocks on your door, and this is not going to help YOU.”\nHe was so angry that he told my father, “From tomorrow I am going alone for my morning walk.”\nMy father said, “I had suggested that to you from the very beginning. Why take unnecessary trouble on yourself?”\nHe said, “He has never been a trouble up to now, but today he has certainly troubled me. The whole day has passed but his question is still ringing into my head.”\nBefore he died... it must have been many years afterwards; he died somewhere near 1960. It was just a coincidence that as I was coming from Warda.Mahatma Gandhi’s son Ramdas was\nvery much interested in me for the simple reason that, as he said, “You are the only man who has criticized my father – everybody worshiped him. I could see many times that he was going too far in illogical, superstitious things, but he was a man of great weight. It was better to remain silent – because what happened with my eldest brother, Haridas? He was thrown out of the home, and my mother was told, ‘If you allow him any entry in the house, remember – you will be the next to be thrown out.’”\nAnd Haridas never could enter the house again. Twenty years more Mahatma Gandhi lived, but he always refused him, saying that he did not even want to see Haridas’ face. And what was Haridas’ crime? His crime was that he wanted to be educated. Gandhi was against education – he was against everything that was modern, contemporary. So naturally the other children were very afraid.\nRamdas was very interested in me because I had been criticizing Gandhi point by point, and no Gandhian had dared to answer me on anything – they could not answer. So when Gandhi died, Ramdas became the head of his ashram, and he used to invite me once in a while.\nSo I was coming from Warda, and Mahatma Bhagwandin was in Nagpur, which was on the way. Just in the train, by coincidence, one of my friends, who was also very intimate with Mahatma Bhagwandin, told me, “Do you know that he is going to die any moment? So just stop here, at least for one day.”\nI went to the hospital. I have never seen such a sad state – Bhagwandin had become just bones, just a skeleton covered with skin, and he was continually coughing and throwing up mucus. His lungs were just about to fail any moment. And the doctor said, “Sad, we don’t have any remedy.”\nSeeing me, Bhagwandin smiled and he said, “I was hoping that somebody would inform you, because I wanted, before I depart from the world, to apologize for my anger. You were right: all my knowledge is of no use. The whole world one can know, but unless one knows oneself it is futile knowledge – a burden that you are carrying for no purpose.”\nHe said, “I am dying; still I don’t know how to answer you. Your question has remained with me all these years, but I don’t know how to know myself. And it is too late – perhaps tomorrow I will be gone.”\nI said, “It is never too late. Anybody can be gone tomorrow; even a young man, perfectly healthy, may be gone tomorrow through a heart attack. It will be difficult for you... I can see you – you cannot even talk, you are coughing and throwing up mucus and your body has become a skeleton; but even in this condition a simple meditation, Vipassana, may be able to open the doors.\n“And as you have realized that all your knowledge is meaningless, you are almost ready to take a jump into silence, into your own inner center, because that is the only thing that is going with you. Before you leave the body, at least be introduced to it. That small introduction to yourself may give you a new life on a higher level.”\nAlmustafa does not mention the fact that women always remain more like the child than men; that is one part of their beauty – their innocence, they don’t know. Man has never allowed them to know anything. They know small things – about keeping the house and the kitchen and taking care of the children and the husband – but these are not the things that can prevent.This is not great\nknowledge; this can be put aside very easily.\nThat’s why, whenever a woman has come to listen to me, she has heard me more deeply, more intimately, more lovingly. But when a man first comes to hear me, he is very resistant, alert, afraid that he may be influenced, hurt if his knowledge is not supported. Or, if he is very cunning, he goes on interpreting whatever is said according to his own knowledge, and he will say, “I know it all – there was nothing new.” This is a measure to protect his ego, to protect the hard shell. And unless that shell breaks and you find yourself wondering like a child, there is no possibility of your ever being in a space which we have always known as the soul – your very being.\nThis has been my experience all over the world – that the woman listens, and you can see the glitter of wonder in her eyes. It is not superficial, its roots are deep into her heart. But Kahlil Gibran does not mention the fact, although the question is asked by a woman. In fact, man is even so cowardly that he is afraid to ask questions, because your question proves your ignorance.\nAll the best questions in THE PROPHET you will find are asked by women – about love, about marriage, about children, about pain, authentic, realnot about God, not about any philosophical\nsystem, but about life itself. They may not look like great questions but they are really the greatest questions, and the person who can solve them has entered into a new world. But Almustafa answers as if the question has been asked by anybody, any XYZ – he is not answering the questioner. And my approach is always that the real question is the questioner.…\nWhy has the question arisen in a woman and not in a man? Because the woman has suffered slavery, the woman has suffered humiliation, the woman has suffered economic dependence, and above all she has suffered a constant state of pregnancy – for centuries. She has lived in pain and pain and pain. The growing child in her does not allow her to eat – she is always feeling like throwing up, vomiting. When the child has grown to nine months, the birth of the child is almost the death of the woman. And she is not even free of one pregnancy and the husband is ready to make her pregnant again. It seems that the woman’s only function is to be a factory to produce crowds.\nAnd what is man’s function? He does not participate in her pain. Nine months she suffers, the birth of the child she suffers, and what does the man do? As far as the man is concerned, he simply uses the woman as an object to fulfill his lust and sexuality. He is not concerned at all about what the consequence will be for the woman, and still he goes on saying, “I love you.” If he had really loved her, the world would not have been overpopulated. His word “love” is absolutely empty: he has treated her almost like cattle.\nAND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART, EVEN AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THE SEASONS THAT PASS OVER YOUR FIELDS.\nTrue, and yet not absolutely true: true if you forget about the questioner, but not true if you remember the questioner. Just as a philosophical statement it is true.\nAND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART.…\nSometimes there is pleasure, and sometimes there is pain, and sometimes there is just indifference – no pain, no pleasure. He is saying, “If you accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields”\nSuperficially it is true. Acceptance of anything gives you a certain peace, a certain calmness. You are not too worried, you know this too will pass. But as far as the woman is concerned there is a difference. She is constantly living in one season – pain and pain. The seasons don’t change from summer to winteror to rain. The woman’s life is really hard.\nIt is not so hard today, but only in the advanced countries. In the so-called developing countries, which are not really developing, which are really undeveloped countriesOnly the word has been\nchanged; they used to be called “undeveloped” countries. And this is the cunningness of human mind, that the word “undeveloped” hurts – hence “developing countries,” to hide the fact that nothing is developing.\nEighty percent of India’s population lives in villages, where you can see the real hardship that the woman goes through. She has been going through that hardship for centuries, and the season does not change. If you look into this fact then this statement becomes anti-revolutionary, this statement becomes a consolation: “Accept the slavery of man, accept the torture of the man.”\nYou will be surprised that one of the great saints that Hindus worship, Tulsidasit is his book about\nthe life of Rama which is perhaps the book most read by the Hindus. He says, “Just as you cannot produce sounds without beating the drum.…” And of course Nivedano will support the fact that a drum has to be beaten; otherwise there is no sound. Tulsidas puts the woman in the same category\n– the drum, the untouchable, the animals and the woman... unless you go on beating them, your life will become miserable. Once in a while a woman has to be beaten, whether there is any excuse for it or not, so that she understands her position.\nThis man, Tulsidas, is thought to be one of the greatest saints of Hinduism – and I am asked not to criticize him! This man is a criminal. It is not a criticism; it is a simple fact that a man who puts the woman in the category of drumsIt is good that Nivedano has not read him; otherwise the life\nof Gayan would have been a constant practice of beating. “When you are tired of the drum, beat Gayan – only then can you keep the woman in control.” What kind of people, what kind of sayings?\nAnd it was his own wifewithout her, Tulsidas would have never been known to the world. The story\nis so significant, I would like you to understand it, and that will make you understand the statement too – that it is really his violence and his anger against his wife. Tulsidas must have been a very passionate man, too sexual. His wife had gone for a few days to her father and mother’s house. It was impossible for Tulsidas to live without his wife, even for a few days. It was the rainy season, and the house of his father-in-law was not far away – on one side of the river he lived, and on the other side lived the family of his wife. But the river was a mountainous river, and it had been raining for days. The river had become a vast ocean; you could not see the other shore.\nIn the middle of the night, Tulsidas was so full of mental, cerebral sex, that he jumped into the river, and a dead corpseLust makes a man blind – he thought it was a piece of a tree. So taking that\ncorpse which was floating in the river as a help, he passed across the river. Of course he was afraid to enter through the front door in the middle of the night, so he went to the back of the house. He was immensely happy that a rope was hanging there, because his wife lived on the first floor, and so there was no need to disturb anybody. He could just catch hold of the rope and get to the first floor. But it was not a rope, it was a snake. That’s how blind lust is.\nBut he reached the first floor and knocked on the doors of his wife’s rooms. She came out with a lantern, and she saw the snake. She said, “What have you done? This is a snake, this is not a rope! And why have you come in the middle of the night? The river is going mad with such a current!”\nHe said, “My God, perhaps the thing that I had taken the support of to pass across the river was not wood – because it was smelling, stinking like a corpse.”\nHis wife said to him, “If you had loved God, if you had loved truth with such passion, the way you love me, you would have been a transformed man. Feel ashamed! Go back – because I am feeling ashamed that my husband cannot live for a few days without me, and he is so blind that he could not see what was a corpse, he could not see what was a snake! And what will my family say when they find you in the house in the morning? How will I show my face today? Just think of me too! Go back and remember: with this much energy, this much love, you can find God – and you are being blind for a poor, ordinary woman.”\nInsulted, he went back, but not to his home. He traveled to Varanasi, the holy city of the Hindus. He renounced the world – he became a saint because he renounced the world – and he wrote a beautiful book on the life of Rama. And that book is so simple that even villagers, who are not educated, can understand it. So it became one of the most famous books of the Hindus, and he became a great saint.\nCan you see the ugliness of his behavior? It was his wife who provoked in him a sense of searching for the truth, it was his wife who made him a saint, but he became a saint in anger. This statement shows his anger towards his wife, but he is not courageous enough to say clearly, “I am talking about my wife.” He condemns all women.\nThat’s how the human mind functions: one man deceives you, and you start distrusting the whole humanity. He should have worshiped the woman. But his ugliness is that he is taking revenge not only on his wife, but on the whole of womankind, categorizing them with drums, with animals, with untouchables: “Beat them! – the better a beating you give them, the more they will be humble, the more they will be within your hands.”\nThe woman has lived in such pain... and yet Almustafa completely forgets who is asking the question. It is possible to accept the change of seasons, but not ten thousand years of slavery. The season does not change.…\nThe woman needs revolt, not acceptance.\nMan is the most lustful animal on the earth. Every animal has a season when the male becomes interested in the female. Sometimes the season is only for a few weeks, sometimes a month or two months, and then for the whole year they forget all about sex, they forget all about reproduction. That’s why they are not in a situation of overpopulation. It is only man who is sexual all the year round, and if he is American then he is sexual in the night, he is sexual in the morning. And you are asking the woman to accept the pain?\nI cannot ask my people to accept such pain, pain which is imposed by others on you. You need a revolution.\nAnd if man is treating you as a drum then you have to treat your man also as a drum. You have an equal right: beat your man, so then he remains in his senses.\nAND YOU WOULD WATCH WITH SERENITY THROUGH THE WINTERS OF YOUR GRIEF.\nWhy? When we can change it, why should we watch? Watch only that which cannot be changed.\nWatch only that which is natural – be a witness to it.\nBut this is poetic cunningness. Beautiful words: and watch with serenity... what about Kahlil Gibran being beaten by his own wife? “Watch with serenity!”\nWatch anything that is natural with serenity, and revolt against all suffering that is imposed by anybody. Whether it is a man or woman, whether it is your father or mother, whether it is the priest or the professor, whether it is the government or the society – revolt!\nUnless you have a rebellious spirit you are not alive in the true sense of the word.\nMUCH OF YOUR PAIN IS SELF CHOSEN.\nThis is true. All your misery, all your pain... much of it is not imposed by others. Against that which is imposed by others, revolt, but that which you have chosen yourself – drop it. There is no need to watch. Just the understanding that “I have imposed it upon myself,” is enough – throw it away. Let others watch you throw it! Seeing you throwing it away, perhaps they will also understand, “Why unnecessarily suffer? – the neighbors are throwing away their grief.”\nYour jealousies, your anger, your greed – they all bring pain. Your ambitions, they all bring pain. And they are self-chosen.\nIT IS THE BITTER POTION BY WHICH THE PHYSICIAN WITHIN YOU HEALS YOUR SICK SELF.\nAgain he comes back to console you. He is not making a clear-cut distinction. There are pains which are imposed by others – revolt against them. And there are pains which are natural – witness them, and witness them with serenity, because it is the bitter medicine that nature, the physician, within you uses to heal your sick self.\nTHEREFORE TRUST THE PHYSICIAN, AND DRINK HIS REMEDY IN SILENCE AND TRANQUILITY.\nBut remember it is about the physician – not about your husband, not about the government. They impose pain over you, not to heal you but to destroy you, to crush you, because the more you are destroyed, the more easily you can be dominated – then there is no fear of rebellion from your side. So remember who the physician is. Nature heals, time heals: you simply wait, witness. But be very clear what is natural and what is artificial.\nFOR HIS HAND, THOUGH HEAVY AND HARD, IS GUIDED BY THE TENDER HAND OF THE UNSEEN.\nNature is nothing but the visible part of the invisible God. Even if his hand is heavy and hard, it is guided by the very spirit of existence. So don’t be worried.\nTHE CUP HE BRINGS, THOUGH IT BURN YOUR LIPS, HAS BEEN FASHIONED OF THE CLAY WHICH THE POTTER HAS MOISTENED WITH HIS OWN SACRED TEARS.\nWhatever is natural, against which no rebellion is possibleThen don’t be miserable; then accept\nit with gratitude. It is the invisible hand of the divine which wants to heal you, which wants to bring you to a higher state of consciousness. But whatever is unnatural.…\nTo yield to any kind of slavery is to destroy your own soul. It is better to die than to live as a slave, because the death of a rebel gives a dignity to him.\nSocrates has that dignity, even today. He could have easily saved his life. The chief judge had given him the opportunity, because he also felt that the man had not committed any crime – he was innocent. But it was a city-democracy, and the votes were divided. There was not much difference: forty-nine percent were for Socrates, and fifty-one percent were against him. But all laws are blind.\nJust because of two percent of the people of the city – who may be retarded, who may be idiots, who may be mad – they destroyed their best flower.\nSince then, Greece has never come to the same glory. It has gone down and down, and today what status has Greece in the world, what power? Just killing one man who was their highest consciousness, a bringer of the good news to the peopleThey destroyed him because what he\nwas saying was painful. He was saying, “Get rid of all that is old; only then will you be reborn. Trust only in that which is your experience; otherwise you are just carrying rubbish.”\nThe chief judge was feeling sad. The same sadness was in the heart of Pontius Pilate when Jews asked that Jesus should be crucified. Pontius Pilate was more cultured, more human, and he had no Jewish prejudices because he was not a Jew. The situation with Socrates was very different. He was himself a Greek, and there were many who felt offended because of his height. Every camel feels offended if you take him to the mountains. That’s why they never go to the mountains, they live in the desert; there they are the mountains.\nThe judge said, “I give you some alternatives, you can choose. You can leave Athens. And it is only a city-state – you can be just outside the boundary of Athens, and those who love you will reach there. It is not far away.”\nSocrates said, “No, because that will show that I was more interested in saving my life than fighting for the truth.”\nThe judge said, “Then you do one thing: Remain in Athens, but don’t do your teaching work. Stop talking about truth; be silent.”\nSocrates says, “Then what is the purpose of my being alive if I cannot speak the truth?”\nThe chief judge said, “Then you are putting me into such a helpless situation that the only alternative is to kill you by giving you poison.”\nSocrates said, “That seems to be the best out of all the alternatives you have proposed, because at least I can die with dignity, and I will be remembered with dignity.” And certainly Greece has not produced another man of the same dignity. With Socrates something essential died in the very soul of that land.\nSo always remember that truth is higher than life. Everything can be sacrificed, but truth cannot be sacrificed. Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6989","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_2/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_2/>The Messiah, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Breaking the shell of the past</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6989 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Messiah_Vol_2/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND HE SAID:</p><p>YOUR PAIN IS THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL THAT ENCLOSES YOUR
UNDERSTANDING.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN AS THE STONE OF THE FRUIT MUST BREAK, THAT ITS HEART MAY STAND
IN THE SUN, SO MUST YOU KNOW PAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>AND COULD YOU KEEP YOUR HEART IN WONDER AT THE DAILY MIRACLES OF YOUR
LIFE, YOUR PAIN WOULD NOT SEEM LESS WONDROUS THAN YOUR JOY;</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART, EVEN AS YOU HAVE
ALWAYS ACCEPTED THE SEASONS THAT PASS OVER YOUR FIELDS.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WOULD WATCH WITH SERENITY THROUGH THE WINTERS OF YOUR GRIEF.
MUCH OF YOUR PAIN IS SELF-CHOSEN.</p><p>IT IS THE BITTER POTION BY WHICH THE PHYSICIAN WITHIN YOU HEALS YOUR
SICK SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE TRUST THE PHYSICIAN, AND DRINK HIS REMEDY IN SILENCE AND
TRANQUILITY:</p><p>FOR HIS HAND, THOUGH HEAVY AND HARD, IS GUIDED BY THE TENDER HAND OF
THE UNSEEN,</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE CUP HE BRINGS, THOUGH IT BURN YOUR LIPS, HAS BEEN FASHIONED
OF THE CLAY WHICH THE POTTER HAS MOISTENED WITH HIS OWN SACRED
TEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that it is very difficult, even for a man of Kahlil Gibran’s
caliber, to forget a deep-rooted, male chauvinistic attitude. I am
saying this because the statements that Almustafa is going to make are
right in a way – but still they miss something very essential.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa forgets that the question is raised by a woman, and his
answer is very general, applicable to both man and woman. But the truth
is that the pain and suffering that women of the world have gone through
is a thousandfold more than man has even known. That’s why I say
Almustafa is answering the question, but not the questioner. And unless
the questioner is answered, the answer remains superficial – howsoever
profound it may sound. I would like you to remember again and again:
Wherever I see that just a small sentence or sometimes just even a word
would have made it truer, far deeper, far more compassionate.…</p><p><br></p><p>The answer seems to be academic, philosophical.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not have the insight into what man has done to the woman –
and it is not a question of one day, but of thousands of years. He does
not even mention it. On the contrary, he goes on doing the same that the
priests and the politicians have been doing always – giving
consolations. Behind beautiful words there is nothing but consolation.
And consolation cannot be a substitute for truth.</p><p><br></p><p>AND A WOMAN SPOKE.…</p><p><br></p><p>Is it not strange that out of that whole crowd no man asked about
pain? – is it just accidental? No, absolutely no. It is very relevant
that a woman asked the question, “Tell us of pain,” because only the
woman knows how many wounds she has been carrying, how much slavery –
physical, mental and spiritual – she has suffered and is still
suffering. A woman is hurting in the deepest core of her being. No man
knows the depth pain can go into you and destroy your dignity, your
pride, your very humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa said:</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR PAIN IS THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL THAT ENCLOSES YOUR
UNDERSTANDING.</p><p><br></p><p>A very poor statement – so superficial that I feel ashamed of Kahlil
Gibran sometimes. Any idiot can say it. It is not worthy of Kahlil
Gibran: your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your
understanding. It is a very simple and general statement.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN AS THE STONE OF THE FRUIT MUST BREAK, THAT ITS HEART MAY STAND
IN THE SUN, SO MUST YOU KNOW PAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>I hate this statement; he is supporting the idea that you must
experience pain. It is a truism, but not a truth. It is very factual – a
seed has to go through great suffering, because unless the seed dies</p><p>in his suffering the tree will never be born, and the great foliage
and the beauty of the flowers will never come into existence. But who
remembers the seed and its courage to die for the unknown to be
born?</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true, if...the shell that encloses your understanding...
goes through suffering, breaks down, allows freedom to your
understanding, there is going to be a certain pain.</p><p><br></p><p>But what is the shell? That’s how poets have escaped from
crucifixions; he should have explained what the shell is. All the
knowledge, all your conditionings, the whole process of your upbringing,
your education, your society and civilization – they constitute the
shell which keeps you and your understanding imprisoned. But he is not
mentioning a single word of what he means by “shell.”</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously no religion has condemned Kahlil Gibran. If he had been
more sincere and honest then he himself would have known what pain is.
He has received only praise for his beautiful poetic sayings, but behind
that praise there is some weakness; something of the coward is still
lurking in the darkness of his soul.</p><p><br></p><p>If he had said, “Your religion, your philosophy, your political
ideology, your nationality, your race – these are all constituents of
your imprisonment,” then, instead of having international respect and
honor, he would have been condemned by all the religions, by all the
nations, by all the races – which means by almost the whole world. I
have been passing through that pain for my whole life, so when I say it,
I say it out of my own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Just make a single statement against those who are benefited by
reducing the whole humanity to slaves, and all the powerful ones are
going to be against you. And the masses are blind, the masses are not
intelligent, the masses are poor; they are not going to listen to me –
because what can I give them? I can give to them understanding, but they
cannot eat understanding, they cannot live by understanding. And their
own conditioning is all that they have been taught – that it is
wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not only the powerful ones; those who are being exploited,
whose power has been taken away by the powerful ones – otherwise from
where will they get the power? – they are also going to follow them. The
powerful ones are the shepherds, and they have reduced the whole
humanity to a crowd of sheep.</p><p><br></p><p>It is almost unbelievable that those who could have raised humanity
and its consciousness to such beauty, wisdom and joy have never been
heard – although they were shouting from the housetops. Every effort has
been made that either they should be forced to remain silent, or they
should be crucified. Those who had not the courage – seeing the whole
thing – have remained silent; but in remaining silent you are also
participating in the suffering the whole humanity is going through.</p><p><br></p><p>Only very few people have spoken – and they have been poisoned,
crucified, killed, assassinated. You have been killing your friends. You
have been killing those who have loved you so much that they were ready
to sacrifice their life, but were not ready to remain silent. And you
have followed your enemies, who are sucking your blood every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>When I spoke for the first time for birth control, for legalization
of abortion, I was condemned by everyone. If they had listened to me at
that time, today India would have been rich, because when I</p><p>started telling people, “This growth of your population is going to
kill you, to destroy you,” there were only four hundred million people
in India. After thirty years there are nine hundred million people; five
hundred million people could have been prevented, and the country would
not be starving.</p><p><br></p><p>But still they are not willing to listen to me. They are still
listening to the shankaracharyas who are against birth control, they are
listening to Mother Teresas who are against birth control. THEY are your
enemies. But it seems you are so blind you cannot see a simple fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is saying: your pain is the breaking of the shell that
encloses your understanding. It is true, but it would have been more
sincere if he had explained what he means by “the shell,” because the
whole thing depends on the meaning of the word “shell” – what is the
shell?</p><p><br></p><p>People will read it just like fiction, poetry, and nobody will ever
take note that they have passed the word “shell,” which contains your
whole past. And unless you are ready to disconnect yourself from your
past, there is going to be pain – it is your past; it is not easy just
to get out of it. It is not like clothes that you can change, it is like
peeling your skin. But without passing through this pain there is no
possibility of any understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>This is true for both men and women, but it is more true for women
because the whole past is created by the male; the female has been
simply a shadow, not very substantial. All Hindu incarnations of God are
men; it is so surprising and shocking that they can accept animals as
the incarnation of God, but they have not accepted a single woman as an
incarnation of God.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman has been completely ignored, has not been taken into
account at all. She constitutes half of the world, and for thousands of
years she has had no voting right. In China it has been believed that
she has no soul, so the question of pain does not arise. If you destroy
your furniture do you think the furniture will go through great
suffering? that there will be pain? If you slap the table do you think
there will be tears? China, for centuries, has categorized woman with
things; hence, in the Chinese morality, to murder your own wife is not a
crime. It is your wife, it is your possession; you can do anything you
want to do.</p><p><br></p><p>In India.<span class=s4></span>Gautam Buddha is a man, his great
disciples – Mahakashyap, Sariputta, Moggalayan –</p><p>all are men. Was there not a single woman who could have been raised
to the same consciousness? But Gautam Buddha himself was denying
initiation to women, as if they are a species not of humanity but of
some subhuman state. Why bother with them? – let them first attain
manhood.</p><p><br></p><p>The statement of Gautam Buddha is that man is the crossroads from
where you can go anywhere – to enlightenment, to ultimate freedom. But
the woman is not mentioned at all. She is not a crossroads, but just a
dark street where no municipal corporation has even put lights; it goes
nowhere. Man is a superhighway; so first let the woman come on the
superhighway, let her become a man, be born in the body of a man – then
there is some possibility of her becoming enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Almustafa.<span class=s4></span>so must you know pain – but
for what? If the woman cannot become enlightened,</p><p>why should she go through pain? She is not gold, in that going
through fire she will become purer.</p><p><br></p><p>AND COULD YOU KEEP YOUR HEART IN WONDER AT THE DAILY MIRACLES OF YOUR
LIFE, YOUR PAIN WOULD NOT SEEM LESS WONDROUS THAN YOUR JOY.…</p><p>It is true, but sometimes truth can be very dangerous, a double-edged
sword. On one hand it protects, on another hand it destroys. It is true
that if you keep the wonder in your eyes you will be surprised to know
that even pain has its own sweetness, its own miracle, its own joy. It
is not less wondrous than joy itself.</p><p><br></p><p>But the strange fact is that the woman is always more like a child,
more full of wonder than man. Man is always after knowledge – and what
is knowledge? Knowledge is just a means to get rid of wonder. The whole
of science is trying to demystify existence, and the word “science”
means knowledge. And it is a very simple fact that the more you know,
the less you wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go for a morning walk with a small child.<span class=s4></span>My father used to drag me out of bed so early in
the</p><p>morning, at five o’clock. It was still one hour before the sun would
rise; everything was dark. And I had told him many times, “I cannot
understand; what kind of arithmetic is this? – when I want to remain
awake I am forced to go to bed. When the night sky is so full of stars
and I want to go to the river, I am prevented. And then, when the stars
have started disappearing, the sun has not yet arisen, and I am feeling
sleepy, I am forced to go for a morning walk. You are dragging me! – it
is not a morning walk. I just want to understand the logic of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Every child feels it – every child, without exception, because the
family wants to get rid of him: “Go to sleep.” Don’t disturb them. And
they want the child to get up early in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>And my father quoted an ancient saying which exists in all the
languages all over the world: “Early to bed and early to get out of the
bed keeps you healthy and wise.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “A strange kind of logic.”</p><p><br></p><p>But there was no way<span class=s4></span>he was so insistent I had
to go. But as darkness started disappearing and</p><p>the birds started singing... and the morning freshness<span class=s4></span>and the beautiful sunrays, as if a new sun</p><p>had come – the old died last night – I would ask him many questions.
He said, “While walking you have to be silent.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I can be silent only on one condition.” He said, “What?”</p><p>I said, “My condition is – don’t disturb my sleep in the morning. You
can choose. If you wake me up, you also wake my intelligence. It is good
that people in England take their dogs for walks: I am not a dog! So
either you have to go alone for your walk – wherever you want to go,
go<span class=s4></span>Even if you</p><p>don’t want to return, nobody is going to worry about it. One day you
will go and you will not return – and that can be any day. But if you
drag me out of my bed, then be prepared for my questions. And my
questions are not out of curiosity<span class=s4></span>I feel so full
of wonder about each and every thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot leave you sleeping. I am creating a foundation for
your whole life. It is a healthy habit – because the air is fresh, the
sun is young, everybody is asleep, all over there is silence. And the
birds only sing once in a while; their singing does not disturb the
silence, on the contrary, it deepens it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am ready.”</p><p>He said, “Let us have a compromise.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t believe in compromises. Either I am right or I am
wrong. What kind of compromise? What do you mean by...?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t have to do anything; it is all on my part. I will
take you for the morning walk, and you can ask any questions you like,
as many questions as you like, but I am not going to answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s perfectly okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was really a joy! I would pull his shirt, nudge him, that
there was a question. For a few minutes he would keep silent; finally he
would get angry. He would say, “What kind of boy have I got? You don’t
allow me to enjoy my walk!”</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “What about my sleep?”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he dropped it; he said, “You sleep and I’ll go for a
walk.”</p><p><br></p><p>As you grow older you lose the sensitivity for wonder, you become
more and more dull. But the reason for it is that now you know
everything. You know nothing, but your mind is now full of borrowed
knowledge, and you have not ever thought that underneath it is nothing
but darkness and ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there were only two persons who were known as Mahatma, the
great soul. One was Mahatma Gandhi, another was Mahatma Bhagwandin.
Mahatma Bhagwandin used to stay with my family – he was constantly
traveling. I have never seen such a knowledgeable man, about everything;
he knew so much that he was almost the ninth wonder of the world! With
him I used to go for a morning walk. He needed me because he was so full
of knowledge, he wanted somebody to ask questions.</p><p><br></p><p>My father said, “This is strange. I am tired of you, and whenever
Mahatma Bhagwandin comes he asks for nobody else’s company, he simply
asks about you. I have to drag you out of the bed, but when he is here,
you drag him out of the bed. Not five, but four o’clock will do, even
three will do: ‘Let us go for a walk.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes he would say, “This is too early!”</p><p><br></p><p>I would say, “Nothing is early. The earlier it is, the wiser you
become.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he enjoyed my company because I was constantly asking about
everything. He knew the names of all the trees, he knew all their
medicinal uses. He himself was a wonder. But one day our friendship was
finished because I asked a wrong question, although he realized before
he died.…</p><p><br></p><p>I was present three days before he died, and he confessed before his
death, “You were right, just forgive me – because now I know my
life-energy is spent. It is only a question of a few hours, or at the
most a few days. And you have come at the right time to see me. I was
waiting for you, because I owe this apology to you.”</p><p>I said, “What are you talking about?” I had completely forgotten. It
was many years before that he had become angry because I had asked him,
“I do understand that you know much about trees, you know much about the
stars, you know much about the earth, you know much about everything –
and whatever I have asked you have never said, ‘I don’t know’ – but now
I want to ask, ‘Do you know yourself?’ And don’t deceive a child,
because that will be a real sin. I am asking out of my love and respect
for you.</p><p><br></p><p>“And secondly, is all this knowledge that you have gathered going to
help you to know yourself? And is not all this knowledge simply
borrowed? What is the point of your knowing the Latin name of a tree,
the medicinal use of its leaves, of the bark, of the roots, of the
flowers? Is it your own discovery? – or have you just been collecting
information?”</p><p><br></p><p>He became angry. I said, “Your anger is enough of an answer. You have
never become angry before, because I was asking things about which you
have collected information. You are a walking ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA –
that is accepted. But what about you? All this knowledge will disappear
when death knocks on your door, and this is not going to help YOU.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was so angry that he told my father, “From tomorrow I am going
alone for my morning walk.”</p><p><br></p><p>My father said, “I had suggested that to you from the very beginning.
Why take unnecessary trouble on yourself?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “He has never been a trouble up to now, but today he has
certainly troubled me. The whole day has passed but his question is
still ringing into my head.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before he died... it must have been many years afterwards; he died
somewhere near 1960. It was just a coincidence that as I was coming from
Warda.<span class=s4></span>Mahatma Gandhi’s son Ramdas was</p><p>very much interested in me for the simple reason that, as he said,
“You are the only man who has criticized my father – everybody worshiped
him. I could see many times that he was going too far in illogical,
superstitious things, but he was a man of great weight. It was better to
remain silent – because what happened with my eldest brother, Haridas?
He was thrown out of the home, and my mother was told, ‘If you allow him
any entry in the house, remember – you will be the next to be thrown
out.’”</p><p><br></p><p>And Haridas never could enter the house again. Twenty years more
Mahatma Gandhi lived, but he always refused him, saying that he did not
even want to see Haridas’ face. And what was Haridas’ crime? His crime
was that he wanted to be educated. Gandhi was against education – he was
against everything that was modern, contemporary. So naturally the other
children were very afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramdas was very interested in me because I had been criticizing
Gandhi point by point, and no Gandhian had dared to answer me on
anything – they could not answer. So when Gandhi died, Ramdas became the
head of his ashram, and he used to invite me once in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>So I was coming from Warda, and Mahatma Bhagwandin was in Nagpur,
which was on the way. Just in the train, by coincidence, one of my
friends, who was also very intimate with Mahatma Bhagwandin, told me,
“Do you know that he is going to die any moment? So just stop here, at
least for one day.”</p><p>I went to the hospital. I have never seen such a sad state –
Bhagwandin had become just bones, just a skeleton covered with skin, and
he was continually coughing and throwing up mucus. His lungs were just
about to fail any moment. And the doctor said, “Sad, we don’t have any
remedy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing me, Bhagwandin smiled and he said, “I was hoping that somebody
would inform you, because I wanted, before I depart from the world, to
apologize for my anger. You were right: all my knowledge is of no use.
The whole world one can know, but unless one knows oneself it is futile
knowledge – a burden that you are carrying for no purpose.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am dying; still I don’t know how to answer you. Your
question has remained with me all these years, but I don’t know how to
know myself. And it is too late – perhaps tomorrow I will be gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is never too late. Anybody can be gone tomorrow; even a
young man, perfectly healthy, may be gone tomorrow through a heart
attack. It will be difficult for you... I can see you – you cannot even
talk, you are coughing and throwing up mucus and your body has become a
skeleton; but even in this condition a simple meditation, Vipassana, may
be able to open the doors.</p><p><br></p><p>“And as you have realized that all your knowledge is meaningless, you
are almost ready to take a jump into silence, into your own inner
center, because that is the only thing that is going with you. Before
you leave the body, at least be introduced to it. That small
introduction to yourself may give you a new life on a higher level.”</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa does not mention the fact that women always remain more
like the child than men; that is one part of their beauty – their
innocence, they don’t know. Man has never allowed them to know anything.
They know small things – about keeping the house and the kitchen and
taking care of the children and the husband – but these are not the
things that can prevent.<span class=s4></span>This is not great</p><p>knowledge; this can be put aside very easily.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why, whenever a woman has come to listen to me, she has heard
me more deeply, more intimately, more lovingly. But when a man first
comes to hear me, he is very resistant, alert, afraid that he may be
influenced, hurt if his knowledge is not supported. Or, if he is very
cunning, he goes on interpreting whatever is said according to his own
knowledge, and he will say, “I know it all – there was nothing new.”
This is a measure to protect his ego, to protect the hard shell. And
unless that shell breaks and you find yourself wondering like a child,
there is no possibility of your ever being in a space which we have
always known as the soul – your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been my experience all over the world – that the woman
listens, and you can see the glitter of wonder in her eyes. It is not
superficial, its roots are deep into her heart. But Kahlil Gibran does
not mention the fact, although the question is asked by a woman. In
fact, man is even so cowardly that he is afraid to ask questions,
because your question proves your ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>All the best questions in THE PROPHET you will find are asked by
women – about love, about marriage, about children, about pain,
authentic, real<span class=s4></span>not about God, not about any
philosophical</p><p>system, but about life itself. They may not look like great questions
but they are really the greatest questions, and the person who can solve
them has entered into a new world. But Almustafa answers as if the
question has been asked by anybody, any XYZ – he is not answering the
questioner. And my approach is always that the real question is the
questioner.…</p><p>Why has the question arisen in a woman and not in a man? Because the
woman has suffered slavery, the woman has suffered humiliation, the
woman has suffered economic dependence, and above all she has suffered a
constant state of pregnancy – for centuries. She has lived in pain and
pain and pain. The growing child in her does not allow her to eat – she
is always feeling like throwing up, vomiting. When the child has grown
to nine months, the birth of the child is almost the death of the woman.
And she is not even free of one pregnancy and the husband is ready to
make her pregnant again. It seems that the woman’s only function is to
be a factory to produce crowds.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is man’s function? He does not participate in her pain. Nine
months she suffers, the birth of the child she suffers, and what does
the man do? As far as the man is concerned, he simply uses the woman as
an object to fulfill his lust and sexuality. He is not concerned at all
about what the consequence will be for the woman, and still he goes on
saying, “I love you.” If he had really loved her, the world would not
have been overpopulated. His word “love” is absolutely empty: he has
treated her almost like cattle.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART, EVEN AS YOU HAVE
ALWAYS ACCEPTED THE SEASONS THAT PASS OVER YOUR FIELDS.</p><p><br></p><p>True, and yet not absolutely true: true if you forget about the
questioner, but not true if you remember the questioner. Just as a
philosophical statement it is true.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE SEASONS OF YOUR HEART.…</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes there is pleasure, and sometimes there is pain, and
sometimes there is just indifference – no pain, no pleasure. He is
saying, “If you accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have
always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Superficially it is true. Acceptance of anything gives you a certain
peace, a certain calmness. You are not too worried, you know this too
will pass. But as far as the woman is concerned there is a difference.
She is constantly living in one season – pain and pain. The seasons
don’t change from summer to winter<span class=s4></span>or to rain.
The woman’s life is really hard.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not so hard today, but only in the advanced countries. In the
so-called developing countries, which are not really developing, which
are really undeveloped countries<span class=s4></span>Only the word
has been</p><p>changed; they used to be called “undeveloped” countries. And this is
the cunningness of human mind, that the word “undeveloped” hurts – hence
“developing countries,” to hide the fact that nothing is developing.</p><p><br></p><p>Eighty percent of India’s population lives in villages, where you can
see the real hardship that the woman goes through. She has been going
through that hardship for centuries, and the season does not change. If
you look into this fact then this statement becomes anti-revolutionary,
this statement becomes a consolation: “Accept the slavery of man, accept
the torture of the man.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that one of the great saints that Hindus
worship, Tulsidas<span class=s4></span>it is his book about</p><p>the life of Rama which is perhaps the book most read by the Hindus.
He says, “Just as you cannot produce sounds without beating the drum.…”
And of course Nivedano will support the fact that a drum has to be
beaten; otherwise there is no sound. Tulsidas puts the woman in the same
category</p><p>– the drum, the untouchable, the animals and the woman... unless you
go on beating them, your life will become miserable. Once in a while a
woman has to be beaten, whether there is any excuse for it or not, so
that she understands her position.</p><p><br></p><p>This man, Tulsidas, is thought to be one of the greatest saints of
Hinduism – and I am asked not to criticize him! This man is a criminal.
It is not a criticism; it is a simple fact that a man who puts the woman
in the category of drums<span class=s4></span>It is good that Nivedano
has not read him; otherwise the life</p><p>of Gayan would have been a constant practice of beating. “When you
are tired of the drum, beat Gayan – only then can you keep the woman in
control.” What kind of people, what kind of sayings<span class=s4></span>?</p><p><br></p><p>And it was his own wife<span class=s4></span>without her, Tulsidas
would have never been known to the world. The story</p><p>is so significant, I would like you to understand it, and that will
make you understand the statement too – that it is really his violence
and his anger against his wife. Tulsidas must have been a very
passionate man, too sexual. His wife had gone for a few days to her
father and mother’s house. It was impossible for Tulsidas to live
without his wife, even for a few days. It was the rainy season, and the
house of his father-in-law was not far away – on one side of the river
he lived, and on the other side lived the family of his wife. But the
river was a mountainous river, and it had been raining for days. The
river had become a vast ocean; you could not see the other shore.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle of the night, Tulsidas was so full of mental, cerebral
sex, that he jumped into the river, and a dead corpse<span class=s4></span>Lust makes a man blind – he thought it was a piece of
a tree. So taking that</p><p>corpse which was floating in the river as a help, he passed across
the river. Of course he was afraid to enter through the front door in
the middle of the night, so he went to the back of the house. He was
immensely happy that a rope was hanging there, because his wife lived on
the first floor, and so there was no need to disturb anybody. He could
just catch hold of the rope and get to the first floor. But it was not a
rope, it was a snake. That’s how blind lust is.</p><p><br></p><p>But he reached the first floor and knocked on the doors of his wife’s
rooms. She came out with a lantern, and she saw the snake. She said,
“What have you done? This is a snake, this is not a rope! And why have
you come in the middle of the night? The river is going mad with such a
current!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, perhaps the thing that I had taken the support of
to pass across the river was not wood – because it was smelling,
stinking like a corpse.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife said to him, “If you had loved God, if you had loved truth
with such passion, the way you love me, you would have been a
transformed man. Feel ashamed! Go back – because I am feeling ashamed
that my husband cannot live for a few days without me, and he is so
blind that he could not see what was a corpse, he could not see what was
a snake! And what will my family say when they find you in the house in
the morning? How will I show my face today? Just think of me too! Go
back and remember: with this much energy, this much love, you can find
God – and you are being blind for a poor, ordinary woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>Insulted, he went back, but not to his home. He traveled to Varanasi,
the holy city of the Hindus. He renounced the world – he became a saint
because he renounced the world – and he wrote a beautiful book on the
life of Rama. And that book is so simple that even villagers, who are
not educated, can understand it. So it became one of the most famous
books of the Hindus, and he became a great saint.</p><p>Can you see the ugliness of his behavior? It was his wife who
provoked in him a sense of searching for the truth, it was his wife who
made him a saint, but he became a saint in anger. This statement shows
his anger towards his wife, but he is not courageous enough to say
clearly, “I am talking about my wife.” He condemns all women.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how the human mind functions: one man deceives you, and you
start distrusting the whole humanity. He should have worshiped the
woman. But his ugliness is that he is taking revenge not only on his
wife, but on the whole of womankind, categorizing them with drums, with
animals, with untouchables: “Beat them! – the better a beating you give
them, the more they will be humble, the more they will be within your
hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman has lived in such pain... and yet Almustafa completely
forgets who is asking the question. It is possible to accept the change
of seasons, but not ten thousand years of slavery. The season does not
change.…</p><p><br></p><p>The woman needs revolt, not acceptance.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is the most lustful animal on the earth. Every animal has a
season when the male becomes interested in the female. Sometimes the
season is only for a few weeks, sometimes a month or two months, and
then for the whole year they forget all about sex, they forget all about
reproduction. That’s why they are not in a situation of overpopulation.
It is only man who is sexual all the year round, and if he is American
then he is sexual in the night, he is sexual in the morning. And you are
asking the woman to accept the pain?</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot ask my people to accept such pain, pain which is imposed by
others on you. You need a revolution.</p><p>And if man is treating you as a drum then you have to treat your man
also as a drum. You have an equal right: beat your man, so then he
remains in his senses.</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WOULD WATCH WITH SERENITY THROUGH THE WINTERS OF YOUR
GRIEF.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? When we can change it, why should we watch? Watch only that
which cannot be changed.</p><p>Watch only that which is natural – be a witness to it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is poetic cunningness. Beautiful words: and watch with
serenity... what about Kahlil Gibran being beaten by his own wife?
“Watch with serenity!”</p><p><br></p><p>Watch anything that is natural with serenity, and revolt against all
suffering that is imposed by anybody. Whether it is a man or woman,
whether it is your father or mother, whether it is the priest or the
professor, whether it is the government or the society – revolt!</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you have a rebellious spirit you are not alive in the true
sense of the word.</p><p>MUCH OF YOUR PAIN IS SELF CHOSEN.</p><p><br></p><p>This is true. All your misery, all your pain... much of it is not
imposed by others. Against that which is imposed by others, revolt, but
that which you have chosen yourself – drop it. There is no need to
watch. Just the understanding that “I have imposed it upon myself,” is
enough – throw it away. Let others watch you throw it! Seeing you
throwing it away, perhaps they will also understand, “Why unnecessarily
suffer? – the neighbors are throwing away their grief.”</p><p><br></p><p>Your jealousies, your anger, your greed – they all bring pain. Your
ambitions, they all bring pain. And they are self-chosen.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS THE BITTER POTION BY WHICH THE PHYSICIAN WITHIN YOU HEALS YOUR
SICK SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>Again he comes back to console you. He is not making a clear-cut
distinction. There are pains which are imposed by others – revolt
against them. And there are pains which are natural – witness them, and
witness them with serenity, because it is the bitter medicine that
nature, the physician, within you uses to heal your sick self.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE TRUST THE PHYSICIAN, AND DRINK HIS REMEDY IN SILENCE AND
TRANQUILITY.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember it is about the physician – not about your husband, not
about the government. They impose pain over you, not to heal you but to
destroy you, to crush you, because the more you are destroyed, the more
easily you can be dominated – then there is no fear of rebellion from
your side. So remember who the physician is. Nature heals, time heals:
you simply wait, witness. But be very clear what is natural and what is
artificial.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR HIS HAND, THOUGH HEAVY AND HARD, IS GUIDED BY THE TENDER HAND OF
THE UNSEEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature is nothing but the visible part of the invisible God. Even if
his hand is heavy and hard, it is guided by the very spirit of
existence. So don’t be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>THE CUP HE BRINGS, THOUGH IT BURN YOUR LIPS, HAS BEEN FASHIONED OF
THE CLAY WHICH THE POTTER HAS MOISTENED WITH HIS OWN SACRED TEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever is natural, against which no rebellion is possible<span class=s4></span>Then don’t be miserable; then accept</p><p>it with gratitude. It is the invisible hand of the divine which wants
to heal you, which wants to bring you to a higher state of
consciousness. But whatever is unnatural.…</p><p><br></p><p>To yield to any kind of slavery is to destroy your own soul. It is
better to die than to live as a slave, because the death of a rebel
gives a dignity to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates has that dignity, even today. He could have easily saved his
life. The chief judge had given him the opportunity, because he also
felt that the man had not committed any crime – he was innocent. But it
was a city-democracy, and the votes were divided. There was not much
difference: forty-nine percent were for Socrates, and fifty-one percent
were against him. But all laws are blind.</p><p>Just because of two percent of the people of the city – who may be
retarded, who may be idiots, who may be mad – they destroyed their best
flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Since then, Greece has never come to the same glory. It has gone down
and down, and today what status has Greece in the world, what power?
Just killing one man who was their highest consciousness, a bringer of
the good news to the people<span class=s4></span>They destroyed him
because what he</p><p>was saying was painful. He was saying, “Get rid of all that is old;
only then will you be reborn. Trust only in that which is your
experience; otherwise you are just carrying rubbish.”</p><p><br></p><p>The chief judge was feeling sad. The same sadness was in the heart of
Pontius Pilate when Jews asked that Jesus should be crucified. Pontius
Pilate was more cultured, more human, and he had no Jewish prejudices
because he was not a Jew. The situation with Socrates was very
different. He was himself a Greek, and there were many who felt offended
because of his height. Every camel feels offended if you take him to the
mountains. That’s why they never go to the mountains, they live in the
desert; there they are the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>The judge said, “I give you some alternatives, you can choose. You
can leave Athens. And it is only a city-state – you can be just outside
the boundary of Athens, and those who love you will reach there. It is
not far away.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “No, because that will show that I was more interested
in saving my life than fighting for the truth.”</p><p><br></p><p>The judge said, “Then you do one thing: Remain in Athens, but don’t
do your teaching work. Stop talking about truth; be silent.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates says, “Then what is the purpose of my being alive if I
cannot speak the truth?”</p><p><br></p><p>The chief judge said, “Then you are putting me into such a helpless
situation that the only alternative is to kill you by giving you
poison.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “That seems to be the best out of all the alternatives
you have proposed, because at least I can die with dignity, and I will
be remembered with dignity.” And certainly Greece has not produced
another man of the same dignity. With Socrates something essential died
in the very soul of that land.</p><p><br></p><p>So always remember that truth is higher than life. Everything can be
sacrificed, but truth cannot be sacrificed. Okay, Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

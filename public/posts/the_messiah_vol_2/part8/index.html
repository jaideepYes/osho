AND HE ANSWERED, SAYING:\nYOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS;\nAND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU LIVE IN YOUR LIPS, AND SOUND IS A DIVERSION AND A PASTIME.\nAND IN MUCH OF YOUR TALKING, THINKING IS HALF MURDERED.\nFOR THOUGHT IS A BIRD OF SPACE, THAT IN A CAGE OF WORDS MAY INDEED UNFOLD ITS WINGS BUT CANNOT FLY.\nTHERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF BEING ALONE.\nTHE SILENCE OF ALONENESS REVEALS TO THEIR EYES THEIR NAKED SELVES AND THEY WOULD ESCAPE.\nAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.\nAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE TRUTH WITHIN THEM, BUT THEY TELL IT NOT IN WORDS.\nIN THE BOSOM OF SUCH AS THESE THE SPIRIT DWELLS IN RHYTHMIC SILENCE.\nWHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.\nLET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR;\nFOR HIS SOUL WILL KEEP THE TRUTH OF YOUR HEART AS THE TASTE OF THE WINE IS REMEMBERED.\nWHEN THE COLOR IS FORGOTTEN AND THE VESSEL IS NO MORE.\nKahlil Gibran, even in his most profound statements, always misses a few things – and those few things are so essential that their absence destroys the whole profundity. It also shows that he is not speaking from experience.\nThe first thing is: he always answers the question as if the question has been asked by an empty sky. A man who knows does not answer the question: he always answers the questioner. But Kahlil Gibran continuously forgets the questioner.\nSecondly, he never goes deeper than the heart – and the heart is not your real being. Just as you are surrounded by a thick wall of thoughts called mind, you are surrounded by a more delicate but still very strong wall – sometimes even stronger than your thoughts – the wall of your feelings, emotions, sentiments. Unless you go beyond both, howsoever beautiful the statement may be, it lacks life, it lacks the truth.\nAND THEN A SCHOLAR SAID.…\nScholars are the most foolish people in the world because they know nothing, yet they behave as if they know all. They are the people who are living on borrowed knowledge – rotten knowledge which has been out of date for centuries. Their heads are full, their hearts are empty – and they know nothing of the being.\nThe only knowledge worth calling knowledge is an experience of your innermost center, the center of the cyclone. The feelings, the sentiments, the emotions, these are all cyclones. Thoughts, howsoever decorated, are nothing but the outer part of the cyclone.\nYour being is utterly silent, still: there is no thought, there is no feeling, there is no emotion – just a pure isness. Its very purity is so virgin.… What to say of others? – even you have not entered in your virgin soul.\nThe scholar is a collector of all kinds of junk. I have met scholars of almost all religions, I have met philosophers teaching in the universities, but everything they say is only skin-deep; just scratch a little and you will be aware of their darkness, ignorance. Hence they are very, very touchy. That’s\nwhy every day I go on receiving summons from people – their feelings are hurt, their religions are hurt. Truth is never hurt – only lies are hurt – because truth can never be exposed. Lies can be exposed any moment.…\nBut they had believed in a lie as a truth. They have not bothered even to look at the roots – to see whether they are carrying a real rosebush, or just something plastic. And they are perfectly happy – at least to the outside world – because the world pays them respect and goes on fulfilling their egos. And because their ego is fulfilled, they go on collecting more and more junk.\nIn Jabalpur there was a special market called the thieves’ market, Chor Bazaar; you could get anything there – everything that had been stolen in Jabalpur, or in surrounding towns, was sold there. I was a constant visitor, particularly to a small shop one old man used to run. He used to sell newspapers, old magazines, books, stolen books. He had no price for them; they were sold by their weight – SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA, one kilo.\nThe old man started, by and by, loving me because I was a constant visitor. I told the old man, “You must be the greatest scholar in the world.”\nHe said, “What? I’m a poor man. I can read a little bit, but I’m not a scholar.”\nI said, “But you have so much junk.” From his shop you could have found all the religious scriptures,\nall great novels, Nobel Prize winner books. I am remembering him today because I had got\nTHE PROPHET from his bookshop, just for two annas – that was the price, because the book is small and it has not much weight.\nI said, “I am saying that you are a great scholar, because your shop is nothing but a magnified form of the mind of a scholar.” He is loaded with knowledge – and knows nothing. And if you question him, you hurt him, if you argue against his knowledge, he will take you to the court.\nWhat kind of a strange world have we created? To be a scholar you don’t need any intelligence, just a mechanical memory; intelligence is a totally different phenomenon. The scholar can answer only that question which is stored in his memory system, in his bio-computer. Sometimes even computers are more intelligent.\nI have heard about a computerA man was very much amazed when he heard about the miracles\nthat a computer can do. He said, “I would like to check it. I cannot believe that a machine can answer your questions.”\nSo he went to the central system where the biggest and the most sophisticated computer was available, and he asked, “Can you tell me where my father is?”\nFor a moment the computer was silent and then he said, “Your father? He has been dead for almost five years.”\nThe man laughed. He said, “I knew from the very beginning that it is all nonsense! My father has gone fishing. Just now I have left him on the riverbank and I have come here; and you are saying my father has been dead for five years.”\nHe could not believe it when the computer laughed loudly. He said, “My God, you can laugh also!”\nThe computer said, “Why not? – because the man you think you have left on the boat is not your father; he is only the husband of your mother.”\nHe was very shocked – and so many people heard it. The whole office knew, “This man is a bastard. The man he thinks is his father is only the husband of his mother; his real father has been dead for five years. Even this much intelligence you will not find in a scholar. Ask only what has been fed into his bio-computer. He can repeat the question, he can give the answer, but if something new arises, which has not been fed into his memory, he is absolutely impotent. Intelligence is a totally different matter. It is your awareness encountering a new situation, and finding out ways and means to deal with it.\nThis country has known the greatest scholars of the world for ten thousand years, but what is their contribution? They cannot contribute anything. They can only repeat what has been repeated by others to them.\nSituations go on changing, life brings new problems, new questions. But these scholars – they somehow go on giving old answers which are absolutely irrelevant to the real situation through which they are passing; otherwise ten thousand years of intelligence... this country would have been a real paradise, not a dream but a reality. But on the contrary, this country has become a hell. And who is responsible? – all your scholars. Memory is cheap – even idiots have memory.\nIntelligence needs arduous effort – to go into your aloneness, inwards, in the darkness, and to find the center of your life. The moment you find that center, immediately something that was asleep is awakened. We have called that awakened man the real and authentic man. We have called him the jina, because he has conquered himself. We have called him the Buddha, because he is enlightened. We have called him the seer, because now – only now, for the first time – he has eyes: up to now he has been a blind fellow.\nAlmustafa would have done better if he first hammered the scholar a little, and he looked at the poverty of his question.\nAND THEN A SCHOLAR SAID, SPEAK OF TALKING.…\nOnly parrots can ask that question. Talking? – was the scholar a baby who does not know how to talk? Almustafa did not indicate, “Your question is stupid and you are a very scholarly idiot.” He started answering him. He is not taking any note of the questioner. And I say unto you again and again: unless the questioner is answered, just to answer the question is not of much use, because it is arising out of the questioner and his ignorance. You have to light a candle into his being first; perhaps then he may be able to understand what you are going to say. This is not a small matter: it is the most important matter.\nThat’s why Kahlil Gibran’s very profound statements have been read by millions just like poetry; nobody has thought that there is any truth in it. Yes, everybody has said that his way of saying has a beauty of its own – his words are so poetic and so musical. But that is as if you are talking about the beauty of a woman and you talk about her clothes – “You are a great beauty, your clothes\nare so beautiful, your ornaments are so valuable” – and you don’t mention her eyes and you don’t mention her face and you don’t mention the warmth of her body and you don’t mention the love that surrounds her. She is going to freak out, “You seem to be a cloth merchant or a goldsmith! I am not my clothes, neither am I my ornaments. You have not mentioned anything that belongs to me.”\nYOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS.…\nThat is not necessarily true. You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts. Why should you talk – and about what are you going to talk – when all your thoughts are at peace, fast asleep? I would like to say to you: you talk, or you are capable of talking, when your mind completely stops disturbing your consciousness – but it is not necessary. If you want troubles, you talk. If you want to remain peaceful and silent and enjoy, you remain silent. In this insane world, to say anything true is challenging all the idiots – because their lies are exposed. But it is not only that the thoughts are at peace.\nThoughts are never at peace. Either they are, or they are not.\nIt is a contradictory statement. Perhaps he has a certain faraway insight into the truth, but he is not clear. His words...at peace with your thoughts... are a self-contradiction. Either you can have thoughts, or you can have peace – because thoughts are the only disturbances in your consciousness.\nYOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS;\nAND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU LIVE.…\nWhy do people want to talk? Everybody all over the world is talking. I have heard that only once, far back, for one minute, all talking on the earth had stopped, because a prophet had declared, “If you want to hear God... for one minute, when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky, has crossed half way, as your clocks start chiming that it is twelve o’clock, for one minute... stop! – if you want to hear God.”\nIt is an ancient story, told by Chuang Tzu – in whose name this auditorium is dedicated. I love many, many people, but Chuang Tzu stands separate as a class, a category in himself. He was really a great rascal saint. I love him, not because he was a saint – because saints are one rupee a dozen – but because he was a rascal saint, which is rare – a very rare combination.\nBecause Chuang Tzu was respected all over China, people believed him, and for one moment there was silence all over the earth. Nobody heard God – because there is no God. But nobody complained. The story has such a beautiful meaning. Nobody complained “You have deceived us, unnecessarily wasted our time – one minute. We could have smoked a cigarette or gone on chewing our gum or talking about beautiful things; you stopped us for one minute.”\nBut nobody came to complain to him. He himself asked people, “Are you disappointed in me?”\nThey said, “No. The moment we became silent, we heard a very still, small voice within our own heart, within our own being. We have come to show our gratitude to you and touch your feet, because we would never have stopped – even for one minute – and would never have been able to discover that God is not in the sky, but within our own being.”\nBut He does not shout, He whispers – just the way lovers whisper to each other, just as secrets are whispered from one mouth to another ear.\nIt is said that if you want your wife to listen to what you are saying, don’t say it loudly; just whisper to somebody, and she will hear it, certainly. The very whispering makes it clear that something is being hidden from her, something is being kept as a secret, and she is not included in it. But if you are talking loudly, no wife listens. This is an everyday ritual.…\nI was staying in Calcutta, and I had to reach a meeting – and I hate to be late. The husband who was driving me was honking the horn for his wife to come. Everybody heard the honking of his horn – “Has he gone mad or what? The car is standing... nobody is ahead – why is he honking?” And then his wife opened the window and said, “I have said to you at least one thousand times that I am coming in one minute, but you go on honking your horn. Go on – but I will take my time. I will come in one minute!”\nI said, “My God, she cannot even say ‘in one minute’ one thousand times!” The husband said, “You will not be able to understand; you are not a husband.”\nI said, “I am not a husband because of people like you. Seeing all around me the situation of husbands, I decided that it is better not to be a husband than to remain in a constant hell.”\nAlmustafa is saying: You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts. It has a different meaning also. I have given you the meaning that I would like, but you must be made aware of the different meaning. He is saying, “When you are not involved with your thoughts you cannot remain silent.” You have become so accustomed to continually talking inside your mind. What else is your mind? – a talking machine, most of the time, like a gramophone whose needle has stuck at a certain point, so you go on again and again – every day the same ritual, the same thought, the same fear – and it stops at the same point.\nHe is saying that you talk only when your thoughts are not available to you. When your thoughts are not playing football in your mind, then you start playing football with somebody else. What is your conversation? – just a football match, throwing words at each other. Nobody is listening. Have you ever listened to anybody? You simply pick up a certain word from which you can start talking – you don’t listen to what he is saying. He waits just out of courtesy, looking for the right word from which he can start again. This is called conversation: it is simply a football match.\nAlmustafa is right, that a man of silence will enjoy his silence. But you cannot remain silent even for a few minutes; you have to do something.\nI used to live with a friend who could not stay at rest either in mind or body for a single moment; he was fidgeting in the body, tossing and turning. I said, “What kind of yoga have you learned? I have\ngone through Patanjali and all other yoga scriptures; I have never come across this exercise that you do.”\nAnd he was always in search of somebody to start conversation. People who used to come to me started asking me, “Is your house owner in the house? Then we are not coming, because he catches hold of us just at the gate. He holds our hands so we cannot even escape – it looks very odd – and he starts talking about all of kinds of things. We go on saying ‘We have come to meet your guest.’ He says, ‘First meet the host. This is the price you have to pay.’ So just tell us when he is not at home, then we will come; otherwise meet us in a nearby garden and let him wait at the gate.”\nI asked him many times, “Were you an American in your last birth?”\nHe said, “Why do you say that?” – because smoking cigarettes is a substitute for conversation when you don’t have anybody else; chewing gum is a substitute for talking when you have nobody else. At least the chewing gum gives you an excuse to open your mouth and close your mouth, and open your mouth and close your mouth. Without chewing gum you can also do it, but then it will look very absurd.…\nAND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU LIVE IN YOUR LIPS, AND SOUND IS A DIVERSION AND A PASTIME.\nWhen you are unable to live in silence, your whole life becomes concentrated in your lips. This is nothing but a diversion and a pastime. You are destroying your time, and you are destroying the time of others; and it is such a self-deception that you are not even aware of it.\nAND IN MUCH OF YOUR TALKING, THINKING IS HALF MURDERED.\nThinking needs solitude, aloneness, so that you can figure out things in a sane way. But you continually murder your thinking, because all your energy is wasted in talking. And people are talking without thinking – what can they talk about? They repeat the newspaper they have been reading, they repeat the film they have seen, they repeat the fight that went on in their house. It is all rubbish.\nAlmustafa is saying that thinking should come out of contemplation; but contemplation needs that you try to be silent. Contemplation is not the greatest thing in your life. Higher than contemplation is meditation.\nSo these are the three layers in you: talking, which murders half of your thinking; contemplation, which can give you new insights, but they will also be converted sooner or later into thoughts; meditation, which takes you beyond, into the very center of silence and solitude. Thinking is not born out of it.\nA man of meditation can talk because for him his mind has become a servant; he can use it like any machine.\nOrdinarily it is just the opposite. Mind has become your master, and it has filled your whole inner space with thoughts. Even contemplation is difficult, and meditation is not even heard of.\nFOR THOUGHT IS A BIRD OF SPACE, THAT IN A CAGE OF WORDS MAY INDEED UNFOLD ITS WINGS BUT CANNOT FLY.\nFor thought is a bird of spaceIt is such a great insight that only now has science become aware\nthat thoughts are only certain vibrations moving in space. If you have the right instrument to catch them, you can catch them. But words become cagesthat in a cage of words may indeed unfold\nits wings but cannot flyYou must have seen cages in words.\nI used to visit one of the great freedom fighters. He had traveled all over the world many times; he was a very well respected man, very rich. He was next only to Winston Churchill in being continually a member of Parliament for sixty years, nonstop. From every country he used to bring birds – he loved them – and he was rich, so the cages were very beautiful. But I said to him, “You are deceiving yourself that you love these birds. If you love them, open the doors, let them fly, because love always gives freedom. Any love that becomes an imprisonment is not love, it is hate.” He was shocked.\nNext morning he came to me and said, “Perhaps you are right. I don’t love the birds, I simply love decorating my garden and my palace.” His house was called a palace, because his father served the British government, and the British government had given him a title of raja, a king. Hence his house – it was palatial – had been called since then “the Palace of Raja Gokuldas,” because that was his father’s name.\nI said, “You simply love your ego.”\nHe said, “Come with mehelp me to free all those birds.” And it was such a joy to see those birds\nagain opening their wings into the sky and disappearing into space.\nI said, “This will give you some sense of what love is: it never encages anybody, it gives only freedom.”\nTHERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF BEING ALONE.\nYou go to talkative friends for a simple reason: you are afraid of being alone. I have seen people even talking to themselves. In my village, just by the side of my house there was a dark street, and I managed to create a rumor in the whole city that it was full of ghosts – just to keep my house in complete silence, so that at least in the night nobody would go by. Almost ninety-nine percent of people stopped.\nA few priests used to live there, and they did not believe the rumor. But it was half-hearted – who knows? Perhaps there are ghosts. But they had lived there for a long time, and this small boy has filled the whole city with the rumorThey were not going to be dominated by my rumor. So they\nused to start chanting mantras – “Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!” – and running fast. I was amazed: “This is strange. Why do they shout their mantras? In the day they don’t shout them.”\nSpeaking creates the feeling that there is somebody else with you, because you always speak to somebody else – it is a deep association.\nI had stopped one person too, with just a small bamboo stick. The street was very narrow, and there were only two or three persons left, but they were making more noise than all the people who lived beyond the street had ever made. So I I used a simple strategy. I would just take a bamboo, tie it to a tree on this side, and to one on the other side, and the priest would come “Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!” and... flop. Then he would run saying, “My God, that boy is right!” And they had not even the courage to see that it was just a bamboo that had prevented them. Once those priests also stopped passing... it was a little tedious for them, because they had to go almost half a mile to go to their house if they wanted to avoid that street – it was a short cut.\nThe street became so silent, and so peaceful, that I used to meditate there. The night became, in that street, so sacred – no temple is so silent. And since I used to sit there for hours, late in the night, those priests spread another rumor that not only should you be afraid of the ghosts, this boy is also in conspiracy with the ghosts; we have seen him sitting there for hours. We cannot pass the street, but he sits there and no ghost tortures him.\nAnd people started asking me.… Even the principal of my school asked me, “I have heard many rumors: first I heard that the whole street is filled with ghosts, and now I hear that nobody goes there after the sun sets, but you have been found sitting there in the middle of the night. So what is the secret of it?”\nI said, “Are you capable of keeping a secret to yourself? – because it is a dangerous secret. If you open your mouth about it to anybody, then it is beyond me, I cannot help you. Those ghosts”\nHe said, “You keep it to yourself, because it is one of the most difficult things in life to keep a secret. One is tempted to tell it to somebody, to share it.”\nI said, “That is your choice. I am willing to tell you, but then I’m out of the game; then the ghosts and you are in direct contact.”\nHe said, “I don’t want that! And today I had asked myselfI’m sad, and I ask to be forgiven. Never\non your account tell me the secret. Don’t tell anybody; just keep it to yourself. This is your business – why should I get into it? I don’t have to pass that street, I live on another road. Just out of curiosity I had asked.”\nI said, “I am willing to fulfill your curiosity. But once the secret is open.The contract between me\nand the ghosts is that if I tell anybody, then they will take care of that person. I cannot do anything, I cannot prevent it – I’m helpless.”\nHe said, “You simply go, and even if you do some mischief, which you are continuously doing in the school – a day rarely passes when your teachers are not sending you to my office – I am circulating a notice that this boy should not be sent to my office, because someday if he opens his mouth.… It is very difficult to keep the secret – I can understand – and you are so young you may open the secret – then I’m finished. I have children, I have a wife, I have an old father, I have an old mother. Be compassionate!”\nI said, “That’s good.that is another contract between me and you – no teacher can send me to the\nprincipal.”\nHe said, “Agreed.”\nI said, “This is how I make contracts.”\nAnd whenever any teacher said, “If you do this kind of mischief” And they were not mischiefs, just\nsimple things, but people who are in power are always worried – if just a brick is taken out of their power, then the whole house can collapse.\nOne day I had just brought a donkey in the class. Now it is not a mischief, because I told the teacher, “This poor fellow wants to be enrolled. I am going to give his fee.”\nThe teacher said, “I have never seen a boy like you – a donkey”\nI said, “You are teaching so many donkeys; you yourself have been taught. Who are you? – just a donkey.”\nHe said, “This is too much. I will send you to the principal.”\nI said, “I am ready, my donkey is ready. I will ride on the donkey and go to the principal. But remember that he has sent a notice to every teacher that I should not be sent to him. And you are sending me not only alone, but with my donkey. You will be in trouble!”\nHe said, “Wait! Just don’t torture me – let the donkey go, because I am only temporarily appointed. If the principal gets angry at me – and he is bound to get angry, seeing you coming on the donkey to his office – my service will be finished. I am not yet confirmed.”\nSo I said, “Okay, when you get confirmed please inform me. This is a contract.”\nHe said, “You are a strange person. You go on making contracts with everybody – one-sided contracts.”\nI said, “It is not one-sided. I am saving your children, your wife, your mother, your old father. What are you giving in return? It is just out of compassion. If you find or think that I am doing something which is a mischief, ignore it; otherwise the donkey will be back.\n“And this donkey is no ordinary donkey. He used to live very close – he was a donkey of a washerman who used to wash our clothes, so he used to come every day. The washerman used to collect the clothes while I used to talk to the donkey. Slowly, slowly we became very close friends. If I simply give him the sign ‘Come in,’ he will come in; and if I say ‘Go out,’ he will go out. So,” I said, “this is no ordinary donkey. It is very intelligent. Do you want to see?”\nHe said, “An intelligent donkey?”\nI said, “What do you think about yourself? Just because he cannot speak, innocent dumb fellow, you think he has no intelligence?” I said, “Come in!” And he immediately came in. I said, “He even understands English.” And I said, “That’s okay, you can go.” He went out.\nThat teacher said, “Okay, the contract is made. How many contracts do you have, and how do you remember?”\nI said, “I have a notebook with me. Every contract is written in it, and the person with whom I make the contract has to sign it, because I don’t believe in verbal things. So this is your contract – you sign it.”\nHe said, “This is strange. If you show it to anybody he will think I am also a donkey.”\nI said, “There is no question of anybody thinking – you are! So simply sign it; otherwise I am going to the principal. Should I call my donkey?”\nHe said, “No, wait!” and he immediately signed.\nAnd I said, “Write in your own handwriting that ‘This contract will remain valid as long as I am alive.’” He said, “Do you mean even when I have left this school, and am working somewhere else?”\nI said, “It does not matter where you are. Once a contract is signed with me, it is signed until death parts us.”\nHe said, “Okay.”\nSomewhere, somebody is preserving that diary, in which all the contracts that I used to make are still written. It is a historical monument against the whole humanity, asking, “What kind of people do you have?”\nTHERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF BEING ALONE.\nYou don’t talk because you have to convey something, you don’t talk because your talk is going to enhance the richness of the person, you don’t talk because you want some intimacy, some friendship; you are destroying that person’s time simply out of your own fear because you don’t want to be alone.\nEvery woman knows it; whenever the husband gets angry she throws her keys and says, “I am going!” and immediately all anger disappears. “I am going to my father’s and mother’s!” – and the man knows perfectly well he cannot live alone. This woman is a constant pain in the neck, but what to do? – this is the fate of man and there is no medicine for it. Have you ever heard of any medicine which can help a pain in the neck? For a pain in the head there are medicines. A pain in the neck is a psychological phenomenon; no medicine can help it.\nSo the wife comes back, and you come with ice cream and flowers – perhaps. I say “perhaps,” because it depends on different people. Some women will rejoice that you take care of them; some women will suspect that there is something cooking – why have you brought ice cream? Just to hide some guilt? Are you after some other woman? – because that’s what happens; whenever a man starts being interested in some other woman, his conscience pricks. Just to erase it he comes with sweets, ice cream, flowers, new clothes, for the wife, chocolates for the children.\nBut any intelligent woman can say, “You never come with these things. Suddenly today – and it is not Christmas time, it is not the Hindu festival of Diwali – what special reason is there that you wasted your money? It is not even the date when you get your salary; you must have brought all these things by borrowing money from someone, because it is the end of the month, so don’t try to deceive me!” So it depends on each woman, each man, what the outcome will be. But one thing is certain; nobody wants to be alone.\nAnd to be alone is the greatest gift of existence.\nThis is the poverty of man and his consciousness, that he is destroying the greatest gift – because it is only in your aloneness that you can blossom, that you can find the source of your life, which is also light and which is also laughter.\nTHE SILENCE OF ALONENESS REVEALS TO THEIR EYES THEIR NAKED SELVES AND THEY WOULD ESCAPE.\nTalking, seeing a movie or sitting before a television set helps you only in one thing. These are all alcoholic drugs, whether you understand it or not, because their function is the same. People drink alcohol to forget their ugliness, their jealousy, their anxiety, their competitiveness, their meanness, their greed – and the line is long. To forget it all, they drink; to forget it all, they talk, they become engaged in talk. Naturally, their mind cannot do both things simultaneously.\nAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.\nThey say something borrowed, something upon which they have stumbled accidentally; they don’t even understand that it is truth. You may stumble upon a diamond on the road, but unless a jeweler cuts it, shapes it, gives it as many aspects as possible, you will not be able to recognize that it is a true diamond. You may think it is a good stone – at the most. Or you may throw it off the road, because it may hurt somebody else.\nAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.\nIt is not that you are the first one in the world who is going to find the truth; it has been found again and again by thousands of people, it has been given expression in different ways by different people. You may stumble upon it, you may start talking about it, but you don’t know what you are talking about; neither can you explain it to the person who is listening to you.\nAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE TRUTH WITHIN THEM, BUT THEY TELL IT NOT IN WORDS.\nThey are the mystics. They have realized it, and also realized that it is next to impossible to express it in words; hence, they remain silent.\nIN THE BOSOM OF SUCH AS THESE THE SPIRIT DWELLS IN RHYTHMIC SILENCE.\nThese are the people who are the very salt of the earth, but because they remain silent, they don’t help much in rising – awakening – those who are asleep. They are awake, but they are not at all interested that the whole world is asleep. They will not nudge you, they will not shake you, they will not throw cold water in your eyes. They have found the truth, but they are not the people who are ready to sacrifice themselves for the truth they have found. Hence there is one category, even above the mystics, which Kahlil Gibran completely forgets – perhaps he is not aware of: the category of the masters, who are mystics.\nAs far as their own growth is concerned, mystics have reached to the highest peak; but they seem to be dry souls, unconcerned about others who are struggling in darkness, searching and seeking, and whose lives are nothing but misery.\nThe master is a mystic who knows that it is very difficult to expressbut makes every effort – even\nto the point of being crucified, even to the point of being stoned, even to the point of being poisoned.\nI would have remained silent – there was no police commissioner’s order: “You have to speak within thirty minutes!” – but I could not see the point. If I am not going to speak, to live on the earth, which is unnecessarily crowded, already overcrowded.… If I have found it, it means everybody else is capable of finding it.\nIt is natural that if you disturb somebody in his sleep, he is going to be angry. Hence, whatever has happened to me – all kinds of harassments from religions, from governments, from police officers, from ordinary idiots of all religions – I don’t blame them. It is my own responsibility.\nWhat they are doing is simply showing their irritation – “We were sleeping so silently, perhaps we were seeing a beautiful dream, a naked girl from the Playboy magazine, and this man comes and starts waking us.”\nIn the day people don’t allowEven Playboy magazines or Playgirl magazines and that type of\npornography is sold under the table, because even the seller is ashamed, the buyer is ashamed, and anybody else standing may spread the news that this professor, this doctor, this engineer was buying a pornographic magazine. And they hide all these magazines in their BIBLES, in their BHAGAVAD- GITAS, in their RAMAYANAS, so nobody in the home is aware – because nobody touches these books. BIBLES, GITAS, KORANSnobody touches these books.\nIt happened.A man who used to sell encyclopedias knocked on a door. The woman of the house\nopened the door, and she said immediately, “We have a very good encyclopedia. You can see it there on the table, so please don’t bother us again.”\nThe man looked at the table and he said, “That is not an encyclopedia, that is the HOLY BIBLE.”\nThe woman said, “You seem to be a magician. From that far, how can you assume that it is the HOLY BIBLE?”\nHe said, “The dust on it is enough proof that nobody ever touches it.” These are untouchable books; all your holy books are untouchable. They simply gather dust.\nSo if you disturb somebody’s sleep, naturally he’s going to be angry; hence, I have no complaint against anybody. Just once in a while I think, would it not have been better not to get involved with this insane humanity? But now it is too late. Now I’m going to speak harder and harder, and hurt as many people as possible.\nI have asked my legal advisor, Tathagat, who is here, “Ask permission for me to enter directly into the courts, and to fight the cases.” Why harass advocates and waste money unnecessarily? I can fight far better myself.\nI am going to fight to the very last breath of my life, because I still believe in this vast oceanic crowd of humanity; there must be a few people who will be benefited – and I have nothing to lose. Particularly for the people who have gathered around me... for them I have to speak. And I have to speak for the new man who is going to be born, a new humanity, and a new earth. Any sacrifice is small, compared to the future generations.\nI would like to become a demarcation line between the past and the future.\nWHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.\nBut not without the movement of your spirit.If this simple statement is followed, the whole world\nwill fall into a deep silence. What have you to say? – it is not the movement of your spirit, but only rubbish thoughts gathered in the head.\nLET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR.\nHe’s saying: Let the voice within your voicebecause there is a voice that will be heard outside.\nBut before it is heard outside, there is a voice you hear inside. That which you hear inside, in the deepest parts of your being, only that is worth speaking, and only that is worth listening to. But the moment you listen only with the ears which are outside, it is not of any use. Unless you listen with the ear which is hidden inside the ear, which is directly connected to your being.All your senses\nhave two sides – one, the roots that go inwards; and the other, the branches and the trunk and the foliage that go outside. If you don’t have roots, please, don’t speak – the tree is dead or perhaps is made of plastic.\nSpeak from within, use the voice that can take it on it’s wings to the outside. And the same has to be as far as listening is concerned: Don’t just hear, listen – let it reach to the very roots of your being. Then only is there a communion.\nWHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.\nLET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR;\nFOR HIS SOUL WILL KEEP THE TRUTH OF YOUR HEART AS THE TASTE OF THE WINE IS REMEMBERED.\nYou must have heard of people who, with blindfolded eyes, taste the wine and can tell what make it is, in what year it was made, from what country it is coming – just by tasting it; they still remember the taste. I have heard... one man entered a pub and said, “I challenge all the drinkers here: These are one thousand dollars. Blindfold my eyes and give me any kind of wine, and I will give you the wine’s name, the manufacturer’s name, the country, and the year. If I fail, these one thousand dollars are yours. But if I succeed, then whoever takes the challenge and brings the wine to me, puts one thousand dollars on top of it, so the challenge goes on becoming bigger – then it is two thousand at stake, then it is three thousand dollars at stake, then it is five thousand dollars at stake.”\nEverybody was excited; it was worth accepting the challenge. The man seemed to be insane, because to tell the year, the country, the name of the wine, the name of the makers – such a difficult job – just by tasting it.But the man went on winning, and winning. Ten people lost, and there was\na pile of eleven thousand dollars.\nThen a man brought a cup, and he tasted it, wondered for a moment, tasted it again, and then opened his blindfold. He said, “Who is this man? This is man’s urine, this is not wine.” And somebody in the crowd said, “But tell us whose; otherwise you are lost. It is fresh, there is no need to be bothered about the date, but tell whose it is.” But there are experts: if Morarji Desai were there, he would have told if it was not fresh, or fresh; he would have told whether it belonged to a Hindu or a Mohammedan, whether it belonged to some royal family or some sudra, whether it belonged to a Ghandian or to a controversial man – Osho.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7501","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_2/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_2/>The Messiah, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 Into the very center of silence</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7501 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Messiah_Vol_2/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND HE ANSWERED,
SAYING:</p><p>YOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS;</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU
LIVE IN YOUR LIPS, AND SOUND IS A DIVERSION AND A PASTIME.</p><p><br></p><p>AND IN MUCH OF YOUR TALKING, THINKING IS HALF MURDERED.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR THOUGHT IS A BIRD OF SPACE, THAT IN A CAGE OF WORDS MAY INDEED
UNFOLD ITS WINGS BUT CANNOT FLY.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF
BEING ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SILENCE OF ALONENESS REVEALS TO THEIR EYES THEIR NAKED SELVES AND
THEY WOULD ESCAPE.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT
REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</p><p>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE TRUTH WITHIN THEM, BUT THEY TELL IT
NOT IN WORDS.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE BOSOM OF SUCH AS THESE THE SPIRIT DWELLS IN RHYTHMIC
SILENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET
THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.</p><p><br></p><p>LET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR;</p><p><br></p><p>FOR HIS SOUL WILL KEEP THE TRUTH OF YOUR HEART AS THE TASTE OF THE
WINE IS REMEMBERED.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE COLOR IS FORGOTTEN AND THE VESSEL IS NO MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Kahlil Gibran, even in his most profound statements, always misses a
few things – and those few things are so essential that their absence
destroys the whole profundity. It also shows that he is not speaking
from experience.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing is: he always answers the question as if the question
has been asked by an empty sky. A man who knows does not answer the
question: he always answers the questioner. But Kahlil Gibran
continuously forgets the questioner.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, he never goes deeper than the heart – and the heart is not
your real being. Just as you are surrounded by a thick wall of thoughts
called mind, you are surrounded by a more delicate but still very strong
wall – sometimes even stronger than your thoughts – the wall of your
feelings, emotions, sentiments. Unless you go beyond both, howsoever
beautiful the statement may be, it lacks life, it lacks the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEN A SCHOLAR SAID.…</p><p><br></p><p>Scholars are the most foolish people in the world because they know
nothing, yet they behave as if they know all. They are the people who
are living on borrowed knowledge – rotten knowledge which has been out
of date for centuries. Their heads are full, their hearts are empty –
and they know nothing of the being.</p><p><br></p><p>The only knowledge worth calling knowledge is an experience of your
innermost center, the center of the cyclone. The feelings, the
sentiments, the emotions, these are all cyclones. Thoughts, howsoever
decorated, are nothing but the outer part of the cyclone.</p><p><br></p><p>Your being is utterly silent, still: there is no thought, there is no
feeling, there is no emotion – just a pure isness. Its very purity is so
virgin.… What to say of others? – even you have not entered in your
virgin soul.</p><p><br></p><p>The scholar is a collector of all kinds of junk. I have met scholars
of almost all religions, I have met philosophers teaching in the
universities, but everything they say is only skin-deep; just scratch a
little and you will be aware of their darkness, ignorance. Hence they
are very, very touchy. That’s</p><p>why every day I go on receiving summons from people – their feelings
are hurt, their religions are hurt. Truth is never hurt – only lies are
hurt – because truth can never be exposed. Lies can be exposed any
moment.…</p><p><br></p><p>But they had believed in a lie as a truth. They have not bothered
even to look at the roots – to see whether they are carrying a real
rosebush, or just something plastic. And they are perfectly happy – at
least to the outside world – because the world pays them respect and
goes on fulfilling their egos. And because their ego is fulfilled, they
go on collecting more and more junk.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jabalpur there was a special market called the thieves’ market,
Chor Bazaar; you could get anything there – everything that had been
stolen in Jabalpur, or in surrounding towns, was sold there. I was a
constant visitor, particularly to a small shop one old man used to run.
He used to sell newspapers, old magazines, books, stolen books. He had
no price for them; they were sold by their weight – SHRIMAD
BHAGAVADGITA, one kilo.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man started, by and by, loving me because I was a constant
visitor. I told the old man, “You must be the greatest scholar in the
world.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What? I’m a poor man. I can read a little bit, but I’m not
a scholar.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “But you have so much junk.<span class=s4></span>” From his
shop you could have found all the religious scriptures,</p><p>all great novels, Nobel Prize winner books. I am remembering him
today because I had got</p><p><br></p><p>THE PROPHET from his bookshop, just for two annas – that was the
price, because the book is small and it has not much weight.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am saying that you are a great scholar, because your shop
is nothing but a magnified form of the mind of a scholar.” He is loaded
with knowledge – and knows nothing. And if you question him, you hurt
him, if you argue against his knowledge, he will take you to the
court.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of a strange world have we created? To be a scholar you
don’t need any intelligence, just a mechanical memory; intelligence is a
totally different phenomenon. The scholar can answer only that question
which is stored in his memory system, in his bio-computer. Sometimes
even computers are more intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a computer<span class=s4></span>A man was very
much amazed when he heard about the miracles</p><p>that a computer can do. He said, “I would like to check it. I cannot
believe that a machine can answer your questions.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went to the central system where the biggest and the most
sophisticated computer was available, and he asked, “Can you tell me
where my father is?”</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment the computer was silent and then he said, “Your father?
He has been dead for almost five years.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed. He said, “I knew from the very beginning that it is
all nonsense! My father has gone fishing. Just now I have left him on
the riverbank and I have come here; and you are saying my father has
been dead for five years.”</p><p>He could not believe it when the computer laughed loudly. He said,
“My God, you can laugh also!”</p><p><br></p><p>The computer said, “Why not? – because the man you think you have
left on the boat is not your father; he is only the husband of your
mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very shocked – and so many people heard it. The whole office
knew, “This man is a bastard. The man he thinks is his father is only
the husband of his mother; his real father has been dead for five years.
Even this much intelligence you will not find in a scholar. Ask only
what has been fed into his bio-computer. He can repeat the question, he
can give the answer, but if something new arises, which has not been fed
into his memory, he is absolutely impotent. Intelligence is a totally
different matter. It is your awareness encountering a new situation, and
finding out ways and means to deal with it.</p><p><br></p><p>This country has known the greatest scholars of the world for ten
thousand years, but what is their contribution? They cannot contribute
anything. They can only repeat what has been repeated by others to
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Situations go on changing, life brings new problems, new questions.
But these scholars – they somehow go on giving old answers which are
absolutely irrelevant to the real situation through which they are
passing; otherwise ten thousand years of intelligence... this country
would have been a real paradise, not a dream but a reality. But on the
contrary, this country has become a hell. And who is responsible? – all
your scholars. Memory is cheap – even idiots have memory.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence needs arduous effort – to go into your aloneness,
inwards, in the darkness, and to find the center of your life. The
moment you find that center, immediately something that was asleep is
awakened. We have called that awakened man the real and authentic man.
We have called him the jina, because he has conquered himself. We have
called him the Buddha, because he is enlightened. We have called him the
seer, because now – only now, for the first time – he has eyes: up to
now he has been a blind fellow.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa would have done better if he first hammered the scholar a
little, and he looked at the poverty of his question.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEN A SCHOLAR SAID, SPEAK OF TALKING.…</p><p><br></p><p>Only parrots can ask that question. Talking? – was the scholar a baby
who does not know how to talk? Almustafa did not indicate, “Your
question is stupid and you are a very scholarly idiot.” He started
answering him. He is not taking any note of the questioner. And I say
unto you again and again: unless the questioner is answered, just to
answer the question is not of much use, because it is arising out of the
questioner and his ignorance. You have to light a candle into his being
first; perhaps then he may be able to understand what you are going to
say. This is not a small matter: it is the most important matter.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Kahlil Gibran’s very profound statements have been read by
millions just like poetry; nobody has thought that there is any truth in
it. Yes, everybody has said that his way of saying has a beauty of its
own – his words are so poetic and so musical. But that is as if you are
talking about the beauty of a woman and you talk about her clothes –
“You are a great beauty, your clothes</p><p>are so beautiful, your ornaments are so valuable” – and you don’t
mention her eyes and you don’t mention her face and you don’t mention
the warmth of her body and you don’t mention the love that surrounds
her. She is going to freak out, “You seem to be a cloth merchant or a
goldsmith! I am not my clothes, neither am I my ornaments. You have not
mentioned anything that belongs to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>YOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS.…</p><p><br></p><p>That is not necessarily true. You talk when you cease to be at peace
with your thoughts. Why should you talk – and about what are you going
to talk – when all your thoughts are at peace, fast asleep? I would like
to say to you: you talk, or you are capable of talking, when your mind
completely stops disturbing your consciousness – but it is not
necessary. If you want troubles, you talk. If you want to remain
peaceful and silent and enjoy, you remain silent. In this insane world,
to say anything true is challenging all the idiots – because their lies
are exposed. But it is not only that the thoughts are at peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are never at peace. Either they are, or they are not.</p><p>It is a contradictory statement. Perhaps he has a certain faraway
insight into the truth, but he is not clear. His words...at peace with
your thoughts... are a self-contradiction. Either you can have thoughts,
or you can have peace – because thoughts are the only disturbances in
your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU TALK WHEN YOU CEASE TO BE AT PEACE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS;</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU
LIVE.…</p><p><br></p><p>Why do people want to talk? Everybody all over the world is talking.
I have heard that only once, far back, for one minute, all talking on
the earth had stopped, because a prophet had declared, “If you want to
hear God... for one minute, when the sun is exactly in the middle of the
sky, has crossed half way, as your clocks start chiming that it is
twelve o’clock, for one minute... stop! – if you want to hear God.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is an ancient story, told by Chuang Tzu – in whose name this
auditorium is dedicated. I love many, many people, but Chuang Tzu stands
separate as a class, a category in himself. He was really a great rascal
saint. I love him, not because he was a saint – because saints are one
rupee a dozen – but because he was a rascal saint, which is rare – a
very rare combination.</p><p><br></p><p>Because Chuang Tzu was respected all over China, people believed him,
and for one moment there was silence all over the earth. Nobody heard
God – because there is no God. But nobody complained. The story has such
a beautiful meaning. Nobody complained “You have deceived us,
unnecessarily wasted our time – one minute. We could have smoked a
cigarette or gone on chewing our gum or talking about beautiful things;
you stopped us for one minute.”</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody came to complain to him. He himself asked people, “Are you
disappointed in me?”</p><p>They said, “No. The moment we became silent, we heard a very still,
small voice within our own heart, within our own being. We have come to
show our gratitude to you and touch your feet, because we would never
have stopped – even for one minute – and would never have been able to
discover that God is not in the sky, but within our own being.”</p><p><br></p><p>But He does not shout, He whispers – just the way lovers whisper to
each other, just as secrets are whispered from one mouth to another
ear.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that if you want your wife to listen to what you are
saying, don’t say it loudly; just whisper to somebody, and she will hear
it, certainly. The very whispering makes it clear that something is
being hidden from her, something is being kept as a secret, and she is
not included in it. But if you are talking loudly, no wife listens. This
is an everyday ritual.…</p><p><br></p><p>I was staying in Calcutta, and I had to reach a meeting – and I hate
to be late. The husband who was driving me was honking the horn for his
wife to come. Everybody heard the honking of his horn – “Has he gone mad
or what? The car is standing... nobody is ahead – why is he honking?”
And then his wife opened the window and said, “I have said to you at
least one thousand times that I am coming in one minute, but you go on
honking your horn. Go on – but I will take my time. I will come in one
minute!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “My God, she cannot even say ‘in one minute’ one thousand
times!” The husband said, “You will not be able to understand; you are
not a husband.”</p><p>I said, “I am not a husband because of people like you. Seeing all
around me the situation of husbands, I decided that it is better not to
be a husband than to remain in a constant hell.”</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is saying: You talk when you cease to be at peace with your
thoughts. It has a different meaning also. I have given you the meaning
that I would like, but you must be made aware of the different meaning.
He is saying, “When you are not involved with your thoughts you cannot
remain silent.” You have become so accustomed to continually talking
inside your mind. What else is your mind? – a talking machine, most of
the time, like a gramophone whose needle has stuck at a certain point,
so you go on again and again – every day the same ritual, the same
thought, the same fear – and it stops at the same point.</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying that you talk only when your thoughts are not available
to you. When your thoughts are not playing football in your mind, then
you start playing football with somebody else. What is your
conversation? – just a football match, throwing words at each other.
Nobody is listening. Have you ever listened to anybody? You simply pick
up a certain word from which you can start talking – you don’t listen to
what he is saying. He waits just out of courtesy, looking for the right
word from which he can start again. This is called conversation: it is
simply a football match.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is right, that a man of silence will enjoy his silence. But
you cannot remain silent even for a few minutes; you have to do
something.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with a friend who could not stay at rest either in
mind or body for a single moment; he was fidgeting in the body, tossing
and turning. I said, “What kind of yoga have you learned? I have</p><p>gone through Patanjali and all other yoga scriptures; I have never
come across this exercise that you do.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was always in search of somebody to start conversation. People
who used to come to me started asking me, “Is your house owner in the
house? Then we are not coming, because he catches hold of us just at the
gate. He holds our hands so we cannot even escape – it looks very odd –
and he starts talking about all of kinds of things. We go on saying ‘We
have come to meet your guest.’ He says, ‘First meet the host. This is
the price you have to pay.’ So just tell us when he is not at home, then
we will come; otherwise meet us in a nearby garden and let him wait at
the gate.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him many times, “Were you an American in your last
birth?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Why do you say that?” – because smoking cigarettes is a
substitute for conversation when you don’t have anybody else; chewing
gum is a substitute for talking when you have nobody else. At least the
chewing gum gives you an excuse to open your mouth and close your mouth,
and open your mouth and close your mouth. Without chewing gum you can
also do it, but then it will look very absurd.…</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DWELL IN THE SOLITUDE OF YOUR HEART YOU
LIVE IN YOUR LIPS, AND SOUND IS A DIVERSION AND A PASTIME.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are unable to live in silence, your whole life becomes
concentrated in your lips. This is nothing but a diversion and a
pastime. You are destroying your time, and you are destroying the time
of others; and it is such a self-deception that you are not even aware
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>AND IN MUCH OF YOUR TALKING, THINKING IS HALF MURDERED.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking needs solitude, aloneness, so that you can figure out things
in a sane way. But you continually murder your thinking, because all
your energy is wasted in talking. And people are talking without
thinking – what can they talk about? They repeat the newspaper they have
been reading, they repeat the film they have seen, they repeat the fight
that went on in their house. It is all rubbish.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is saying that thinking should come out of contemplation;
but contemplation needs that you try to be silent. Contemplation is not
the greatest thing in your life. Higher than contemplation is
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So these are the three layers in you: talking, which murders half of
your thinking; contemplation, which can give you new insights, but they
will also be converted sooner or later into thoughts; meditation, which
takes you beyond, into the very center of silence and solitude. Thinking
is not born out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of meditation can talk because for him his mind has become a
servant; he can use it like any machine.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily it is just the opposite. Mind has become your master, and
it has filled your whole inner space with thoughts. Even contemplation
is difficult, and meditation is not even heard of.</p><p>FOR THOUGHT IS A BIRD OF SPACE, THAT IN A CAGE OF WORDS MAY INDEED
UNFOLD ITS WINGS BUT CANNOT FLY.</p><p><br></p><p>For thought is a bird of space<span class=s4></span>It is such a
great insight that only now has science become aware</p><p>that thoughts are only certain vibrations moving in space. If you
have the right instrument to catch them, you can catch them. But words
become cages<span class=s4></span>that in a cage of words may indeed
unfold</p><p>its wings but cannot fly<span class=s4></span>You must have seen
cages in words.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to visit one of the great freedom fighters. He had traveled
all over the world many times; he was a very well respected man, very
rich. He was next only to Winston Churchill in being continually a
member of Parliament for sixty years, nonstop. From every country he
used to bring birds – he loved them – and he was rich, so the cages were
very beautiful. But I said to him, “You are deceiving yourself that you
love these birds. If you love them, open the doors, let them fly,
because love always gives freedom. Any love that becomes an imprisonment
is not love, it is hate.” He was shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>Next morning he came to me and said, “Perhaps you are right. I don’t
love the birds, I simply love decorating my garden and my palace.” His
house was called a palace, because his father served the British
government, and the British government had given him a title of raja, a
king. Hence his house – it was palatial – had been called since then
“the Palace of Raja Gokuldas,” because that was his father’s name.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You simply love your ego.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Come with me<span class=s4></span>help me to free all
those birds.” And it was such a joy to see those birds</p><p>again opening their wings into the sky and disappearing into
space.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This will give you some sense of what love is: it never
encages anybody, it gives only freedom.”</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF
BEING ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>You go to talkative friends for a simple reason: you are afraid of
being alone. I have seen people even talking to themselves. In my
village, just by the side of my house there was a dark street, and I
managed to create a rumor in the whole city that it was full of ghosts –
just to keep my house in complete silence, so that at least in the night
nobody would go by. Almost ninety-nine percent of people stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>A few priests used to live there, and they did not believe the rumor.
But it was half-hearted – who knows? Perhaps there are ghosts. But they
had lived there for a long time, and this small boy has filled the whole
city with the rumor<span class=s4></span>They were not going to be
dominated by my rumor. So they</p><p>used to start chanting mantras – “Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!” – and
running fast. I was amazed: “This is strange. Why do they shout their
mantras? In the day they don’t shout them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking creates the feeling that there is somebody else with you,
because you always speak to somebody else – it is a deep
association.</p><p>I had stopped one person too, with just a small bamboo stick. The
street was very narrow, and there were only two or three persons left,
but they were making more noise than all the people who lived beyond the
street had ever made. So I I used a simple strategy. I would just take a
bamboo, tie it to a tree on this side, and to one on the other side, and
the priest would come “Hare Krishna! Hare Rama!” and... flop. Then he
would run saying, “My God, that boy is right!” And they had not even the
courage to see that it was just a bamboo that had prevented them. Once
those priests also stopped passing... it was a little tedious for them,
because they had to go almost half a mile to go to their house if they
wanted to avoid that street – it was a short cut.</p><p><br></p><p>The street became so silent, and so peaceful, that I used to meditate
there. The night became, in that street, so sacred – no temple is so
silent. And since I used to sit there for hours, late in the night,
those priests spread another rumor that not only should you be afraid of
the ghosts, this boy is also in conspiracy with the ghosts; we have seen
him sitting there for hours. We cannot pass the street, but he sits
there and no ghost tortures him.</p><p><br></p><p>And people started asking me.… Even the principal of my school asked
me, “I have heard many rumors: first I heard that the whole street is
filled with ghosts, and now I hear that nobody goes there after the sun
sets, but you have been found sitting there in the middle of the night.
So what is the secret of it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Are you capable of keeping a secret to yourself? – because
it is a dangerous secret. If you open your mouth about it to anybody,
then it is beyond me, I cannot help you. Those ghosts<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You keep it to yourself, because it is one of the most
difficult things in life to keep a secret. One is tempted to tell it to
somebody, to share it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is your choice. I am willing to tell you, but then I’m
out of the game; then the ghosts and you are in direct contact.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t want that! And today I had asked myself<span class=s4></span>I’m sad, and I ask to be forgiven. Never</p><p>on your account tell me the secret. Don’t tell anybody; just keep it
to yourself. This is your business – why should I get into it? I don’t
have to pass that street, I live on another road. Just out of curiosity
I had asked.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am willing to fulfill your curiosity. But once the secret
is open.<span class=s4></span>The contract between me</p><p>and the ghosts is that if I tell anybody, then they will take care of
that person. I cannot do anything, I cannot prevent it – I’m
helpless.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You simply go, and even if you do some mischief, which you
are continuously doing in the school – a day rarely passes when your
teachers are not sending you to my office – I am circulating a notice
that this boy should not be sent to my office, because someday if he
opens his mouth.… It is very difficult to keep the secret – I can
understand – and you are so young you may open the secret – then I’m
finished. I have children, I have a wife, I have an old father, I have
an old mother. Be compassionate!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s good.<span class=s4></span>that is another contract
between me and you – no teacher can send me to the</p><p>principal.”</p><p>He said, “Agreed.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is how I make contracts.”</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever any teacher said, “If you do this kind of mischief<span class=s4></span>” And they were not mischiefs, just</p><p>simple things, but people who are in power are always worried – if
just a brick is taken out of their power, then the whole house can
collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I had just brought a donkey in the class. Now it is not a
mischief, because I told the teacher, “This poor fellow wants to be
enrolled. I am going to give his fee.”</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher said, “I have never seen a boy like you – a donkey<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are teaching so many donkeys; you yourself have been
taught. Who are you? – just a donkey.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is too much. I will send you to the principal.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am ready, my donkey is ready. I will ride on the donkey
and go to the principal. But remember that he has sent a notice to every
teacher that I should not be sent to him. And you are sending me not
only alone, but with my donkey. You will be in trouble!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Wait! Just don’t torture me – let the donkey go, because I
am only temporarily appointed. If the principal gets angry at me – and
he is bound to get angry, seeing you coming on the donkey to his office
– my service will be finished. I am not yet confirmed.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “Okay, when you get confirmed please inform me. This is a
contract.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are a strange person. You go on making contracts with
everybody – one-sided contracts.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not one-sided. I am saving your children, your wife,
your mother, your old father. What are you giving in return? It is just
out of compassion. If you find or think that I am doing something which
is a mischief, ignore it; otherwise the donkey will be back.</p><p><br></p><p>“And this donkey is no ordinary donkey. He used to live very close –
he was a donkey of a washerman who used to wash our clothes, so he used
to come every day. The washerman used to collect the clothes while I
used to talk to the donkey. Slowly, slowly we became very close friends.
If I simply give him the sign ‘Come in,’ he will come in; and if I say
‘Go out,’ he will go out. So,” I said, “this is no ordinary donkey. It
is very intelligent. Do you want to see?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “An intelligent donkey?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What do you think about yourself? Just because he cannot
speak, innocent dumb fellow, you think he has no intelligence?” I said,
“Come in!” And he immediately came in. I said, “He even understands
English.” And I said, “That’s okay, you can go.” He went out.</p><p>That teacher said, “Okay, the contract is made. How many contracts do
you have, and how do you remember?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have a notebook with me. Every contract is written in it,
and the person with whom I make the contract has to sign it, because I
don’t believe in verbal things. So this is your contract – you sign
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is strange. If you show it to anybody he will think I
am also a donkey.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no question of anybody thinking – you are! So
simply sign it; otherwise I am going to the principal. Should I call my
donkey?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, wait!” and he immediately signed.</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “Write in your own handwriting that ‘This contract will
remain valid as long as I am alive.’” He said, “Do you mean even when I
have left this school, and am working somewhere else?”</p><p>I said, “It does not matter where you are. Once a contract is signed
with me, it is signed until death parts us.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhere, somebody is preserving that diary, in which all the
contracts that I used to make are still written. It is a historical
monument against the whole humanity, asking, “What kind of people do you
have?”</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE THOSE AMONG YOU WHO SEEK THE TALKATIVE THROUGH FEAR OF
BEING ALONE.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t talk because you have to convey something, you don’t talk
because your talk is going to enhance the richness of the person, you
don’t talk because you want some intimacy, some friendship; you are
destroying that person’s time simply out of your own fear because you
don’t want to be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Every woman knows it; whenever the husband gets angry she throws her
keys and says, “I am going!” and immediately all anger disappears. “I am
going to my father’s and mother’s!” – and the man knows perfectly well
he cannot live alone. This woman is a constant pain in the neck, but
what to do? – this is the fate of man and there is no medicine for it.
Have you ever heard of any medicine which can help a pain in the neck?
For a pain in the head there are medicines. A pain in the neck is a
psychological phenomenon; no medicine can help it.</p><p><br></p><p>So the wife comes back, and you come with ice cream and flowers –
perhaps. I say “perhaps,” because it depends on different people. Some
women will rejoice that you take care of them; some women will suspect
that there is something cooking – why have you brought ice cream? Just
to hide some guilt? Are you after some other woman? – because that’s
what happens; whenever a man starts being interested in some other
woman, his conscience pricks. Just to erase it he comes with sweets, ice
cream, flowers, new clothes, for the wife, chocolates for the
children.</p><p>But any intelligent woman can say, “You never come with these things.
Suddenly today – and it is not Christmas time, it is not the Hindu
festival of Diwali – what special reason is there that you wasted your
money? It is not even the date when you get your salary; you must have
brought all these things by borrowing money from someone, because it is
the end of the month, so don’t try to deceive me!” So it depends on each
woman, each man, what the outcome will be. But one thing is certain;
nobody wants to be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And to be alone is the greatest gift of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the poverty of man and his consciousness, that he is
destroying the greatest gift – because it is only in your aloneness that
you can blossom, that you can find the source of your life, which is
also light and which is also laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SILENCE OF ALONENESS REVEALS TO THEIR EYES THEIR NAKED SELVES AND
THEY WOULD ESCAPE.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking, seeing a movie or sitting before a television set helps you
only in one thing. These are all alcoholic drugs, whether you understand
it or not, because their function is the same. People drink alcohol to
forget their ugliness, their jealousy, their anxiety, their
competitiveness, their meanness, their greed – and the line is long. To
forget it all, they drink; to forget it all, they talk, they become
engaged in talk. Naturally, their mind cannot do both things
simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT
REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</p><p><br></p><p>They say something borrowed, something upon which they have stumbled
accidentally; they don’t even understand that it is truth. You may
stumble upon a diamond on the road, but unless a jeweler cuts it, shapes
it, gives it as many aspects as possible, you will not be able to
recognize that it is a true diamond. You may think it is a good stone –
at the most. Or you may throw it off the road, because it may hurt
somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK, AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR FORETHOUGHT
REVEAL A TRUTH WHICH THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that you are the first one in the world who is going to
find the truth; it has been found again and again by thousands of
people, it has been given expression in different ways by different
people. You may stumble upon it, you may start talking about it, but you
don’t know what you are talking about; neither can you explain it to the
person who is listening to you.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE TRUTH WITHIN THEM, BUT THEY TELL IT
NOT IN WORDS.</p><p><br></p><p>They are the mystics. They have realized it, and also realized that
it is next to impossible to express it in words; hence, they remain
silent.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE BOSOM OF SUCH AS THESE THE SPIRIT DWELLS IN RHYTHMIC
SILENCE.</p><p>These are the people who are the very salt of the earth, but because
they remain silent, they don’t help much in rising – awakening – those
who are asleep. They are awake, but they are not at all interested that
the whole world is asleep. They will not nudge you, they will not shake
you, they will not throw cold water in your eyes. They have found the
truth, but they are not the people who are ready to sacrifice themselves
for the truth they have found. Hence there is one category, even above
the mystics, which Kahlil Gibran completely forgets – perhaps he is not
aware of: the category of the masters, who are mystics.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as their own growth is concerned, mystics have reached to the
highest peak; but they seem to be dry souls, unconcerned about others
who are struggling in darkness, searching and seeking, and whose lives
are nothing but misery.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is a mystic who knows that it is very difficult to
express<span class=s4></span>but makes every effort – even</p><p>to the point of being crucified, even to the point of being stoned,
even to the point of being poisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have remained silent – there was no police commissioner’s
order: “You have to speak within thirty minutes!” – but I could not see
the point. If I am not going to speak, to live on the earth, which is
unnecessarily crowded, already overcrowded.… If I have found it, it
means everybody else is capable of finding it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural that if you disturb somebody in his sleep, he is going
to be angry. Hence, whatever has happened to me – all kinds of
harassments from religions, from governments, from police officers, from
ordinary idiots of all religions – I don’t blame them. It is my own
responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>What they are doing is simply showing their irritation – “We were
sleeping so silently, perhaps we were seeing a beautiful dream, a naked
girl from the Playboy magazine, and this man comes and starts waking
us.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the day people don’t allow<span class=s4></span>Even Playboy
magazines or Playgirl magazines and that type of</p><p>pornography is sold under the table, because even the seller is
ashamed, the buyer is ashamed, and anybody else standing may spread the
news that this professor, this doctor, this engineer was buying a
pornographic magazine. And they hide all these magazines in their
BIBLES, in their BHAGAVAD- GITAS, in their RAMAYANAS, so nobody in the
home is aware – because nobody touches these books. BIBLES, GITAS,
KORANS<span class=s4></span>nobody touches these books.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened.<span class=s4></span>A man who used to sell
encyclopedias knocked on a door. The woman of the house</p><p>opened the door, and she said immediately, “We have a very good
encyclopedia. You can see it there on the table, so please don’t bother
us again.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at the table and he said, “That is not an
encyclopedia, that is the HOLY BIBLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “You seem to be a magician. From that far, how can
you assume that it is the HOLY BIBLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The dust on it is enough proof that nobody ever touches
it.” These are untouchable books; all your holy books are untouchable.
They simply gather dust.</p><p>So if you disturb somebody’s sleep, naturally he’s going to be angry;
hence, I have no complaint against anybody. Just once in a while I
think, would it not have been better not to get involved with this
insane humanity? But now it is too late. Now I’m going to speak harder
and harder, and hurt as many people as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked my legal advisor, Tathagat, who is here, “Ask permission
for me to enter directly into the courts, and to fight the cases.” Why
harass advocates and waste money unnecessarily? I can fight far better
myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to fight to the very last breath of my life, because I
still believe in this vast oceanic crowd of humanity; there must be a
few people who will be benefited – and I have nothing to lose.
Particularly for the people who have gathered around me... for them I
have to speak. And I have to speak for the new man who is going to be
born, a new humanity, and a new earth. Any sacrifice is small, compared
to the future generations.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to become a demarcation line between the past and the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET
THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.</p><p><br></p><p>But not without the movement of your spirit.<span class=s4></span>If this simple statement is followed, the whole
world</p><p>will fall into a deep silence. What have you to say? – it is not the
movement of your spirit, but only rubbish thoughts gathered in the
head.</p><p><br></p><p>LET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR.</p><p><br></p><p>He’s saying: Let the voice within your voice<span class=s4></span>because there is a voice that will be heard
outside.</p><p>But before it is heard outside, there is a voice you hear inside.
That which you hear inside, in the deepest parts of your being, only
that is worth speaking, and only that is worth listening to. But the
moment you listen only with the ears which are outside, it is not of any
use. Unless you listen with the ear which is hidden inside the ear,
which is directly connected to your being.<span class=s4></span>All
your senses</p><p>have two sides – one, the roots that go inwards; and the other, the
branches and the trunk and the foliage that go outside. If you don’t
have roots, please, don’t speak – the tree is dead or perhaps is made of
plastic.</p><p><br></p><p>Speak from within, use the voice that can take it on it’s wings to
the outside. And the same has to be as far as listening is concerned:
Don’t just hear, listen – let it reach to the very roots of your being.
Then only is there a communion.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ON THE ROADSIDE OR IN THE MARKET-PLACE, LET
THE SPIRIT IN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS AND DIRECT YOUR TONGUE.</p><p><br></p><p>LET THE VOICE WITHIN YOUR VOICE SPEAK TO THE EAR OF HIS EAR;</p><p><br></p><p>FOR HIS SOUL WILL KEEP THE TRUTH OF YOUR HEART AS THE TASTE OF THE
WINE IS REMEMBERED.</p><p>You must have heard of people who, with blindfolded eyes, taste the
wine and can tell what make it is, in what year it was made, from what
country it is coming – just by tasting it; they still remember the
taste. I have heard... one man entered a pub and said, “I challenge all
the drinkers here: These are one thousand dollars. Blindfold my eyes and
give me any kind of wine, and I will give you the wine’s name, the
manufacturer’s name, the country, and the year. If I fail, these one
thousand dollars are yours. But if I succeed, then whoever takes the
challenge and brings the wine to me, puts one thousand dollars on top of
it, so the challenge goes on becoming bigger – then it is two thousand
at stake, then it is three thousand dollars at stake, then it is five
thousand dollars at stake.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody was excited; it was worth accepting the challenge. The man
seemed to be insane, because to tell the year, the country, the name of
the wine, the name of the makers – such a difficult job – just by
tasting it.<span class=s4></span>But the man went on winning, and
winning. Ten people lost, and there was</p><p>a pile of eleven thousand dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>Then a man brought a cup, and he tasted it, wondered for a moment,
tasted it again, and then opened his blindfold. He said, “Who is this
man? This is man’s urine, this is not wine.” And somebody in the crowd
said, “But tell us whose; otherwise you are lost. It is fresh, there is
no need to be bothered about the date, but tell whose it is.” But there
are experts: if Morarji Desai were there, he would have told if it was
not fresh, or fresh; he would have told whether it belonged to a Hindu
or a Mohammedan, whether it belonged to some royal family or some sudra,
whether it belonged to a Ghandian or to a controversial man – Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO\nPLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.\nSUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO VICE. AS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER\nMAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN BLAZING FIRE\nCREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE,\n2\nTAKES THIS THROUGH WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.\nSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE FONTANELLE\nSTROKE THE UVULA, WITH THE TONGUE IN A SORT OF COITION AND CONFUSE\nTHAT WHICH FETTERS WITH WHAT GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL THEMSELVES YOGIS.\nTantra is freedom: freedom from all mind-constructs, from all mind-games; freedom from all structures; freedom from the other. Tantra is a space to be. Tantra is liberation.\nTantra is not a religion in the ordinary sense – religion again is a mind game; religion gives you a certain pattern. A Christian has a certain pattern, so has the Hindu, so has the Muslim Religion gives you a certain style, a discipline. Tantra takes all disciplines away.\nWhen there is no discipline, when there is no enforced order, a totally different kind of order arises in you. What Lao Tzu calls Tao, what Buddha calls DHARMA – that arises in you. That is not anything done by you; it happens to you. Tantra simply creates space for it to happen. It does not even invite, it does not wait; it simply creates a space. And when the space is ready, the whole flows in.\nI have heard a very beautiful story, a very ancient one.\nIn a province, no rain had fallen for a long time. Everything was dried up. At last the citizens decided to fetch the rainmaker. A deputation was sent to see him in the distant town where he lived with the urgent request to come as soon as possible and make rain for their parched fields.\nThe rainmaker, a wise old man, promised to do so on condition that he be provided with a solitary little cottage in the open country where he could withdraw by himself for three days. No food or drink would be required, then he would see what could be done. His requests were met.\nOn the evening of the third day abundant rain fell and, full of.praise, a grateful crowd made a pilgrimage to his house and exclaimed ‘How did you do it? Tell us.’\n‘It was quite simple’ the rainmaker answered. ‘For three days all I have done is to put myself in order. For I know that once I am in order, then the world will be in order, and the drought must yield place to the rain.’\nTantra says: If you are in order, then the whole world is in order for you. When you are in harmony, then the whole existence is in harmony for you. When you are in disorder, then the whole world is\ndisorder. And the order has not to be a false one, it has not to be a forced one. When you force some order upon yourself, you simply become split; deep down the disorder continues.\nYou can observe it: if you are an angry person, you can force your anger, you can repress it deep down in the unconscious, but it is not going to disappear. Maybe you become completely unaware of it, but it is there – and you know that it is there. It is running underneath you, it is in the dark basement of your being, but it is there. On top of it you can sit smiling, but you know it can erupt at any moment. And your smile cannot be very deep, and your smile cannot be true, and your smile will be just an effort that you will be making against yourself.\nA man who forces an order from the outside remains in disorder. Tantra says there is another kind of order: You don’t impose any order, you don’t impose any discipline; you simply drop all structures, you simply become natural and spontaneous. It is the greatest step a man can be asked to take. It will need great courage because the society will not like it; the society will be dead against it. The society wants a certain order. If you follow the society, the society is happy with you. If you go a little bit astray here and there, the society is very angry. And the mob is mad.\nTantra is a rebellion. I don’t call it revolutionary because it has no politics in it. And I don’t call it revolutionary because it has no plans to change the world: it has no plans to change the state and the society. It is rebellious, it is individual rebellion. It is one individual slipping out of the structures and the slavery. But the moment you slip out of the slavery, you come to feel another kind of existence around you which you have never felt before – as if you were living with a blindfold and suddenly the blindfold has become loose, your eyes have opened, and you can see a totally different world.\nThis blindfold is what you call your mind; your thinking, your prejudices, your knowledge, your scriptures – they all make the thick layer of a blindfold. They are keeping you blind, they are keeping you dull, they are keeping you unalive. Tantra wants you to be alive – as alive as the trees, as alive as the rivers, as alive as the sun and the moon. That is your birthright. You don’t gain anything by losing it; you lose all. And if everything is to be lost in gaining it, nothing is lost. Even a single moment of utter freedom is enough to satisfy. And a long life of a hundred years, yoked like a slave, is meaningless.\nTo be in the world of Tantra needs courage: it is adventurous. Up to now, only a few people have been able to move on that path. But the future is very hopeful. Tantra will become more and more important. Man is understanding more and more what slavery is. And man is understanding also that no political revolution has proved revolutionary.\nAll political revolutions finally turn into anti-revolutions. Once they are in power they become anti- revolutionary. Power IS anti-revolutionary. So there is a built-in mechanism in power. Give anybody power and he becomes anti-revolutionary. Power creates its own world. So, up to now, there have been many revolutions in the world and all have failed, utterly failed – no revolution has helped. Now man is becoming aware of it.\nTantra gives a different perspective. It is not revolutionary, it is rebellious. Rebellion means individual. You can rebel alone, you need not organize a party for it. You can rebel alone, on your own. It is not a fight against society, remember, it is just going beyond society. It is not anti-social, it is asocial; it has nothing to do with society. It is not against slavery, it is for freedom – freedom to be.\nJust look at your life. Are you a free man? You are not: there are a thousand and one bondages around you. You may not look at them – it is very embarrassing, you may not recognize them – it hurts, but it doesn’t change the situation: you are a slave. To move into the dimension of Tantra you will have to recognize your slavery. It is very deep-rooted. It has to be dropped. And being aware of it helps you to drop it.\nDon’t go on pacifying yourself, don’t go on consoling yourself, don’t go on saying ‘Everything is okay.’ It is not; nothing is okay, your whole life is just a nightmare. Have a look at it! There is no poetry, and no song, and no dance, and no love, and no prayer. There is no celebration. Joy? – is just a word in the dictionary. Bliss? – yes, you have heard about it, but you have not known anything about it. God? – in the temples, in the churches. Yes, people talk about it: those who talk, they don’t know. Those who hear, they don’t know. All that is beautiful seems to be meaningless; and all that is meaningless seems to be very, very important.\nA man goes on accumulating money and thinks that he is doing something very significant. Human stupidity is infinite. Beware of it. It will destroy your whole life. It has destroyed millions of people’s lives down the ages.\nTake hold of your awareness – that is the only possibility to get out of stupidity.\nBefore we enter today’s sutras, something has to be understood about the Tantra map of inner consciousness. I have told you a few things about it – a few more things have to be told.\nFirst: Tantra says that no man is just man and no woman is just woman, each man is both man and woman, and so is each woman – woman and man. Adam has Eve in him, and Eve has Adam in her. In fact, nobody is just Adam and nobody is just Eve: we are Adam-Eves. This is one of the greatest insights ever attained.\nModern depth psychology has become aware of it. They call it bisexuality. But, for at least five thousand years, Tantra has known it, preached it. It is one of the greatest discoveries of the world because with this understanding you can move in your inner direction, otherwise you cannot move in your inner direction. Why does a man fall in love with a woman? – because he carries a woman inside him, otherwise he would not fall in love. And why do you fall in love with a certain woman? There are thousands of women. But why, suddenly, does a certain woman become most important to you, as if all other women had disappeared and that were the only woman in the world. Why? Why does a certain man attract you? Why, at first sight, does something suddenly click? Tantra says: You are carrying an image of a woman inside you, an image of a man inside you. Each man is carrying a woman and each woman is carrying a man. When somebody on the outside fits with your inner image, you fall in love – that is the meaning of love.\nYou don’t understand it. You simply shrug your shoulders – you say ‘It has happened.’ But there is a subtle mechanism in it. Why did it happen with a certain woman? Why not with others? Your inner image fits somehow. The outer woman is similar in a way. Something just hits your inner image, you feel that ‘this is my woman’, or ‘this is my man’: this feeling is what love is. But the outer woman is not going to satisfy, because no outer woman is going to completely fit with your inner woman.\nThe reality is not that way at all. Maybe she fits a little bitt – here is an appeal, a magnetism, but it\nwill be worn out sooner or later. Soon you will recognize that there are a thousand and one things that you don’t like in the woman. It will take a bit of time to come to know about those things.\nFirst you will be infatuated. First the similarity will be too much, it will overwhelm you. But by and by you will see that there are a thousand and one things – details of life – that don’t fit; that you are aliens, strangers. Yes, you still love her, but the love has no more infatuation; that romantic vision is disappearing. And she will also recognize that something appeals in you, but your totality is not appealing. That’s why each husband tries to change the wife and each wife tries to change the husband. What are they trying to do? Why? Why does a wife continuously try to change the husband? For what? She has fallen in love with this man, then immediately she starts changing this man. Now that she has become aware of the dissimilarities, she wants to drop those dissimilarities. She wants to take a few chunks off this man, so that he completely fits with her idea of a man. And the husband tries also – not so hard, not so stubbornly as women try, because the husband becomes tired very soon – the woman hopes longer.\nThe woman thinks ‘Today or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow – some day I will change...’ It takes almost twenty, twenty-five years to recognize the fact that you cannot change the other. By the age of fifty, when the woman has passed her menopause and the man too, when they are getting really old, then they become alert by and by that nothing has changed. They have tried hard, they have tried every way... the woman remains the same and the man remains the same. Nobody can change anybody. This is a great experience to come to – a great understanding.\nThat’s why old people become more tolerant: they know that nothing can be done. That’s why old people become more graceful: they know that things are as they are. That’s why old people become more accepting. Young people are very angry, nonaccepting. They want to change everything. They want to make the world the way they would like it. They struggle hard, but it has never happened; it cannot happen – it is not in the nature of things.\nThe outer man can never fit with your inner man and the outer woman can never be absolutely the same as your inner woman. That’s why love gives pleasure and pain too. Love gives happiness and unhappiness too. And, the unhappiness is much more than the happiness.\nWhat does Tantra propose about it? What has to be done then?\nTantra says: There is no way to be satisfied with the outer; you will have to move inward. You will have to find your inner woman and inner man. You will have to atta.in to a sexual intercourse inside. That is a great contribution.\nHow can it happen? Try to understand this map. I talked about seven chakras, the Tantra yoga physiology. In man the MULADHAR is male and SWADHISTAN, female. In woman the MULADHAR is female and SWADHISTAN, male, and so on and so forth. In seven chakras, up to the sixth, the duality remains; the seventh is non-dual.\nThere are three pairs inside you: MULADHAR-SWADHISTAN get married. MANIPURA-ANAHATA have to get married. VISUDDHA-AJNA have to get married.\nWhen the energy moves outside, you need a woman outside. You have a little glimpse for a moment, because the coition with a woman outside cannot be permanent – it can be only momentary. For\na single moment you can lose yourself into each other. Again you are thrown back to yourself, and thrown back with a vengeance. That’s why after each love-making there is a certain frustration: you have failed again, it didn’t happen the way you wanted it to happen. Yes, you reached to a peak, but before you had even become aware of it, the decline, the fall began. Before the peak was achieved... the valley. Before you had met the woman or the man... and the separation. The divorce comes with marriage so fast that it is frustrating. All lovers are frustrated people. They hope much, they hope against their experience; they hope again and again, but nothing can be done – you cannot destroy the laws of reality. You have to understand those laws.\nThe outer meeting can only be momentary, but the inner meeting can become eternal. And the higher you move the more eternal it can become.\nThe first, MULADHAR, in man is male. Even while making love to a woman outside, Tantra- says, remember the inner. Make, love to the woman outside, but remember the inner. Let your consciousness move inward – forget the outer woman completely. In the moment of orgasm forget the woman or the man completely. Close your eyes and be in, and let it be a meditation. When energy is stirred, don’t miss this opportunity. That is the moment when you can have a contact – an inward journey.\nOrdinarily, it is difficult to look in, but in a love-moment, some gap, you are not ordinary. In a love- moment you are at your maximum. When orgasm happens, your whole body energy is throbbing with dance; each cell, each fibre dancing in a rhythm, in a harmony that you don’t know in ordinary life. This is the moment: this moment of harmony, use it as a passage inward. While making love, become meditative, look in.\nA door opens at that moment. This is the Tantra experience. A door opens in that moment, and Tantra says that you feel happy only because that door opens and something of your inner bliss flows to you. It is not coming from the outer woman, it is not coming from the outer man; it is coming from your innermost core. The outer is just as excuse.\nTantra does not say that to make love to the outer is sin, it simply says that it is not very far-going. It does not condemn it, it accepts its naturalness. But it says that you can use that love wave to go far inside. In that moment of thrill, things are not on the earth: you can fly. Your arrow can lead the bow towards the target. You can become a Saraha.\nIf, while making love you become meditative you become silent, you start looking in, you close your eyes, you forget the outer man or woman then it happens. The MULADHAR, your male centre inside, starts moving towards the female centre – the female centre is SWADHISTAN – and there is a coition, there is an intercourse inside.\nSometimes it happens without your knowing it. Many sannyasins have written me lettersI have\nnever answered before because it was not possible to answer, now I can answer, you will be able to understand.\nOne sannyasin writes to me again and again, and he must be wondering why I am not answering.… The map was not available up to now, now I am giving you the map. Listening to me, he always feels as if he is going into orgasm. His whole body starts throbbing, and he has the same experience\nas he has while making love to a woman. He becomes very puzzled – naturally so. He loses track of what he was listening to, he forgets... and the thrill is so much and the joy is so much that he is worried: What is happening? What is this inside him?\nThis is happening: the MULADHAR is meeting with the SWADHISTAN, your male centre is meeting with your female centre. That is the joy when you move into meditation, when you move into prayer. This is the mechanism of your inner celebration. And the moment MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN meet, the energy is released. Just as when you love your woman energy is released, when SWADHISTAN and MULADHAR meet, energy is released and that energy hits the higher centre, MANIPURA.\nMANIPURA is male, ANAHATA is female. Once you have become attuned to the first meeting of your man and woman inside, one day the second meeting suddenly happens. You have not to do anything about it just the energy released from the first meeting creates the possibility for the second meeting. And when energy is created by the second meeting, it creates the possibility for the third meeting.\nThe third meeting is between VISUDDHA and AJNA. And when the third meeting happens, the energy is created for the fourth, which is not a meeting, which is not a union, but unity. SAHASRAR is alone, there is no male-female. The Adam and Eve have disappeared into each other, totally, utterly. Man has become the woman, the woman has become the man; all division disappears. This is the absolute, the eternal meeting. This is what Hindus call SATCHITANANDA. This is what Jesus calls ‘the Kingdom of God’.\nIn fact, the number seven has been used by all the religions. Seven days are symbolic, and the seventh day is the holiday, the holy day. Six days God worked, and on the seventh day he rested. Six chakras you will have to work in, the seventh is the state of great rest, utter rest, absolute relaxation – you have come home.\nWith the seventh you disappear as part of duality; all polarities disappear, all distinctions disappear. Night is no more night, and day is no more day. Summer is no more summer, and winter is no more winter. Matter is no more matter, and mind is no more mind – you have gone beyond. This is the transcendental space Buddha calls NIRVANA.\nThese three meetings inside you and the achievement of the fourth have another dimension too. I have talked to you many times about four states: sleep, dream, waking, TURIYA. TURIYA means ‘the fourth’, ‘the beyond’. These seven chakras, and the work through them, have a correspondence with these four states also.\nThe first meeting between MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN IS like sleep. The meeting happens, but you cannot be very aware of it. You will enjoy it, you will feel a great freshness arising in you. You will feel great rest, as if you have slept deeply; but you will not be able to see it exactly – it is very dark. The man and woman have met inside you, but they have met in the unconscious. The meeting was not in the daylight, it was in the dark night. Yes, the result will be felt, the consequence will be felt. You will suddenly feel a new energy in you, a new radiance, a new glow. You will have an aura. Even others may start feeling that you have a certainly quality of presence, a ‘vibe’. But you will not be exactly alert to what is happening. So the first meeting is like sleep.\nThe second meeting is like dream – when MANIPURA and ANAHATA meet, your meeting with the inner woman is as if you have met in a dream. Yes, you can remember a little bit of it. Just as in the morning you can remember the dream that you had last night – a little bit here and there, a few glimpses; maybe something has been forgotten, maybe the whole is not remembered – but still you can remember. The second meeting is like dream. You will become more aware of it. You will start feeling that something is happening. You will start feeling that you are changing, that a transformation is on the way, that you are no more the old person. And with the second you will start becoming aware that your interest in the outer woman is lessening. Your interest in the outer man is not as infatuating as it used to be.\nWith the first also there will be a change, but you will not be aware of it. With the first you may start thinking that you are no more interested in YOUR woman, but you will not be able to understand that you are not interested in ANY woman at all. You may think you are bored with your woman and you will be more happy with some other woman; some change will be good, a different climate will be good, a different quality of woman will be good. This will be just a guess. With the second you will start feeling that you are no longer interested in the woman or the man, that your interest is turning inward’.\nWith the third you will become perfectly aware. It is like waking. VISUDDHA meeting AJNA... you will become perfectly aware, the meeting is happening in the daylight. Or you can say it in this way: the first meeting happens in the dark middle of the night; the second meeting happens in a twilight time between the day and the night; the third meeting happens in full noon – you are fully alert, everything is clear. Now you know you are finished with the outer. It does not mean that you will leave your wife or your husband, it simply means that the infatuation is no more; you will feel compassion. Certainly the woman who has helped you so far is a great friend, the man who has brought you so far is a great friend; you are grateful.\nYou will start being grateful and compassionate to each other. It is always so when understanding arises – it brings compassion. If you leave your wife and escape to the forest, that simply shows you are cruel and compassion has not arisen. It can be only out of non-understanding, it cannot be out of understanding. If you understand, you will have compassion.\nWhen Buddha became enlightened, the first thing he said to his disciples was ‘I would like to go to Yashodhara and talk to her.’ His wife...\nAnanda was very much disturbed. He said ‘What is the point of your going back to the palace and talking to your wife? You have left her. Twelve years have passed.’ And Ananda was a little bit disturbed also, because how can a Buddha think about his wife? Buddhas are not expected to think that way.\nWhen the others had left, Ananda said to Buddha ‘This is not good. What will people think?’\nBuddha said ‘What will people think? I have to express my gratitude to her, and I have to thank her for all the help she gave me. And I have to give something of that which has happened to me – I owe that much to her. I will have to go.’\nHe came back. He went to the palace. He saw his wife. Certainly Yashodhara was mad! This man escaped one night without even saying anything to her. She said to Buddha ’Couldn’t you have\ntrusted me? You could have said that you wanted to go, and I would have been the last woman in the world to prevent you. Couldn’t you have trusted me even that much?’ And she was crying. Twelve years of anger! And this man had escaped like a thief in the middle of the night – suddenly, without giving a single hint to her.\nBuddha apologized and he said ‘It was out of non-understanding. I was ignorant, I was not aware. But now I am aware and I know – that’s why I have come back. You have helped me tremendously. Forget those old things, now there is no point in thinking about ’spilt milk’. Look at me! Something great has happened. I have come home. And I felt my first duty was towards you: to come, and to convey, and to share my experience with you.’\nThe anger gone, the rage subsided, Yashodhara looked out through her tears. ‘Yes, this man has changed tremendously.’ This was not the same man she used to know. This was not the same man, not at all; this looked like a great luminosity... She could almost see the aura, a light around him. And he was so peaceful and so silent; he had almost disappeared. His presence was almost absence. And then, in spite of herself, she forgot what she was doing – she fell at his feet and she asked to be initiated.\nWhen you understand, there is bound to be compassion. That’s why I don’t say to my sannyasins to leave their families. Be there.\nRabindranath has written a poem about this incident when Buddha comes. Yashodhara asked him one thing. ‘Just tell me one thing’ she said. ‘Whatever you have attained... I can see you have attained, whatsoever it is. I don’t know what it is – just tell me one thing: was it not possible to attain it here in this house?’ And Buddha could not say no. It was possible to attain it here in this house. Now he knew. Because it has nothing to do with forest or with town, with family or with ashram – it has nothing to do with any place; it has something to do with your innermost core. It is available everywhere.\nFirst, you will start feeling that your interest in the other is loosening. It will be a dim phenomenon, dark – looking through a dark glass, looking through a very foggy morning. Second, things become a little more clear, like a dream; the fog is not so much. Third, you are fully awake. It has happened: the inner woman has met the inner man. The biopolarity is no longer there, suddenly you are one. Schizophrenia has disappeared; you are not split.\nWith this integration you become individual. Before that you are not an individual, you are a crowd: you are a mob, you are many people, you are multi-psychic. Suddenly you fall into order. That’s what this ancient story says.\nThe man had asked for three days... If sometimes you look into these small stories you will be wonderstruck; their symbols are great. The man had asked for three days to sit silently. Why three days? Those are the three points: in sleep, in dream, in waking, he wanted to put himself in order. First it happens in sleep, then it happens in dream, then it happens in waking. And when you are in order, the whole existence is in order. When you are an individual – when your split has disappeared and you are bridged together – then everything is bridged together. It will look very paradoxical, but it has to be said: the individual is the universal. When you have become individual, suddenly you see that you are the universal. Up to now you have been thinking that you were separate from existence. Now you cannot think that.\nAdam and Eve have disappeared into each other. This is the goal that everybody is trying to find in some way or other. Tantra is the surest science for achieving it. This is the target.\nA few things more:\nI told you that the MULADHAR has to be relaxed, only then can the energy move upward, inward. And ‘inward’ and ‘upward’ mean the same; ‘outward’ and ‘downward’ mean the same. Energy can move inward or upward only when the MULADHAR is relaxed. So the first thing is to relax the MULADHAR.\nYou are holding your sex centre very tightly. The society has made you very much aware of the sex centre; it has made you obsessed with it, so you are holding it tightly. You can simply watch. You are always holding your genital organism very tightly, as if you are afraid that something will go amiss if you relax. Your whole conditioning has been to keep it uptight. Relax it, leave it to itself. Don’t be afraid: fear creates tension. Drop the fear. Sex is beautiful; it is not a sin, it is a virtue.\nOnce you think in terms of its being a virtue, you will be able to relax. I have talked about how to relax the MULADHAR before. And I have talked about how to relax the SWADHISTAN; it is the death centre. Don’t be afraid of death. These are the two fears which have been dominating humanity: the fear of sex and the fear of death. Both fears are dangerous; they have not allowed you to grow. Drop both the fears.\nThe third chakra is MANIPURA; it is loaded with negative emotions. That’s why your stomach becomes disturbed – when you are emotionally disturbed, MANIPURA is affected immediately. In all the languages of the world we have expressions like Ll cannot stomach it.’ It is literally true. Sometimes, when you cannot stomach a certain thing, you start feeling nauseous; you would like to vomit. In fact, sometimes it happens – a psychological vomit. Somebody has said something, and you CANNOT stomach it; and suddenly you feel a nausea, vomit comes, and after vomiting you feel very relaxed.\nIn Yoga they have methods for it. The yogi has to drink enough water in the morning – a bucketful of water with salt, the water has to be lukewarm – and then he has to vomit it. It helps to relax the MANIPURA. It is a great process, a great cleansing process.\nYou will be surprised, now many modern therapies have become aware of it – that vomiting helps. Action Analysis is aware of the fact that vomiting helps. Primal Therapy is aware of the fact that vomiting helps. It releases the MANIPURA. Tantra and Yoga have always been aware of it.\nNegative emotions: anger, hatred, jealousy, and so on and so forth – they all have been repressed; your MANIPURA is too loaded. Those repressed emotions don’t allow the energy to go up; those repressed emotions function like a rock: your passage is blocked. Encounter, Gestalt and therapies like that, all function unknowingly on the MANIPURA. They try to provoke your anger. they try to provoke your jealousy, your greed; they provoke your aggression, your violence, so that it bubbles up, surfaces. The society has done one thing: it has trained you to repress all that is negative, and pretend all that is positive. Now, both are dangerous. To pretend the positive is false – hypocrisy, and to repress the negative is dangerous; it is poisonous, it is poisoning your system.\nTantra says: Express the negative and allow the positive. If anger comes, don’t repress it; if aggression comes, don’t repress it. Tantra does not say: Go and kill a person. But Tantra says that there a thousand and one ways to express the repressed emotions. You can go into the garden and chop wood. Have you watched woodcutters? They look more silent than anybody else. Have you watched hunters? Hunters are very good people. The do a very dirty thing, but they are good people. Something happens to them while they are hunting. Killing animals, their anger, their aggression is dissolved. The so-called ‘nonviolent’ people are the ugliest in the world. They are not good people, because they are holding down a volcano. You cannot feel at ease with them. Something is dangerously present there. You can feel it, you can touch it; it is oozing out of them. You can just go into the forest and shout, scream – Primal Therapy is just scream therapy, tantrum therapy. And Encounter and Primal, Gestalt, are of tremendous help in relaxing the MANIPURA.\nOnce MANIPURA IS relaxed, there arises a balance between the negative and the positive. And when the negative and positive are balanced, the passage is open; then the energy can move higher. MANIPURA is male. If MANIPURA IS blocked, then energy cannot go upwards. It has to be relaxed.\nPolarity Balancing can be of great help in bringing about the balance between positive and negative. That’s why I am allowing all sorts of methods from all over the world in this ashram. Anything that can be of help has to be used, because man has been damaged so much that all sources of help should be made available. You may not even be able to understand why I am making available all the methods to you: Yoga, Tantra, Tao; Sufi, Jain, Buddhist, Hindu; Gestalt, Psychodrama, Encounter, Primal Therapy, Polarity Balancing, Rolfing, Structural Integration – why I am making all these things available to you. You have never heard of these things being done in any ashram anywhere in the East at all. There is a reason for it. Man has been damaged so much that all sources should be tapped. Help should be taken from every source possible, only then there is hope – otherwise man is doomed.\nThe fourth chakra is ANAHATA. Doubt is the problem with the fourth chakra. If you are a doubting person, your fourth chakra will remain unopened. Trust opens it. So anything that creates doubt destroys your heart. It is the heart chakra: ANAHATA. Logic, logic-chopping, argumentativeness, too much rationality, too much of Aristotle in you, destroy ANAHATA. Philosophy, scepticism, destroy ANAHATA.\nIf you want to open the ANAHATA you will have to be more trusting. Poetry is more helpful than philosophy, and intuition is more helpful than reasoning, and feeling is more helpful than thinking. So you will have to shift from doubt to trust, only then does your ANAHATA become open, your ANAHATA becomes capable of receiving the male energy from MANIPURA. ANAHATA is female. With doubt it becomes dry; it cannot receive the male energy. With trust it opens, with trust moisture is released in that chakra and it can allow the penetration of the male energy.\nThen the fifth: VISUDDHA. Non-creativity, imitativeness, parroting, monkeying – these are damaging.\nJust the other day I was reading a small anecdote:\nA schoolchild was asked ‘Ten copy-cats are sitting on a fence. One jumped and went away. How many are left?’\nAnd the child says ‘None.’\nThe teacher says ‘None? Only one has left!’ And the child says ‘They are copy-cats.’ When one jumps, all jump.\nVISUDDHA is destroyed by copying. Don’t be an imitator, don’t be just a carbon copy. Don’t try to become a Buddha and don’t try to become a Christ. Beware of books like Thomas a Kempis IMITATION OF CHRIST. Beware. No imitation is going to help. VISUDDHA is destroyed by non- creativity, limitation; and VISUDDHA IS helped by creativity, expression, finding your own style of life, being courageous enough to ‘do your own thing’. Art, song, music, dance, inventiveness – all are helpful. But be inventive – whatsoever you do, try to do it in a new way. Try to bring some individuality into it, bring some authentic signature. Even cleaning a floor, you can do it in your own way. Even cooking food, you can do it in your own way. You can bring creativity to everything that you do; it should be brought. In as much as you are creative – good, VISUDDHA will open. And when VISUDDHA opens, then only can the energy move into the AJNA, the third eye centre, the sixth centre.\nThis is the process. First cleanse every centre, purify it, beware of what damages it, and help it so that it becomes naturally functioning. Blocks are removed... energy rushes.\nBeyond the sixth is SAHASRAR, TURIYA, the one-thousand-petalled lotus. You bloom. Yes, that’s exactly what it is. Man is a tree: MULADHAR is the root and SAHASRAR is the blooming of it. The flower has bloomed, your fragrance is released to the winds. That is the only prayer; that is the only offering to the feet of the divine. Borrowed flowers won’t do, stolen flowers from the trees won’t do; you have to flower and offer your flowers.\nNow the sutras. The first sutra:\nFOR THE DELIGHTS OF KISSING THE DELUDED CRAVE DECLARING IT TO BE THE ULTIMATELY REAL –\nLIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.\nKissing is symbolic – symbolic of any meeting between yin and yang, between male and female, between Shiva and Shakti. Whether you are holding hands with a woman – this is a kissing: hands kissing each other, or you are touching her lips with your lips – that is kissing; or your genital organs together – that, too, is a kiss. So the kiss is symbolic in Tantra of all meetings of opposite polarities. Sometimes you can kiss just by seeing a woman. If your eyes meet and touch each other – there is a kiss; the meeting has happened.\nFOR THE DELIGHTS OF KISSING THE DELUDED CRAVE DECLARING IT TO BE THE ULTIMATELY REAL –\nSaraha says that the deluded – the people who are not alert at all to what they are doing – go on hankering for, missing, the other: man, the woman; the woman, the man. They are continuously hankering to meet the other. And the meeting never happens. The absurdity of it is this: that you hanker and hanker, and desire and desire, and nothing but frustration comes into your hands. Saraha says this is not the ultimately real meeting. The ultimately real meeting is that which happens in SAHASRAR. Once it has happened, it has happened forever. That is real. The meeting that happens outside is unreal, momentary, temporal, just a delusion.\nIt is...\nLIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.\nA beautiful simile. Saraha says that holding the hand of a woman outside, while the woman inside is waiting to be yours and forever yours, is just...\nLIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.\nFirst: LEAVES HIS HOUSE... You are leaving your house, your innermost core, in search of a woman outside... and the woman is within. You will miss her wherever you go – you can go on running all over the earth and chasing all sorts of women and men. It is a mirage, it is a rainbow search – nothing comes into your hands. The woman is inside... and you are leaving the house.\nAnd then, STANDING AT THE DOOR... That too is symbolic. You are always standing at the door, by the senses – those are doors. Eyes are doors, hands are doors, genital organs are doors, ears are doors – these are doors. We are always standing at the doors. Looking through the eyes, hearing through the ears, trying to touch with the hands, a man continuously remains at the doors and forgets how to go inside the house. And then the absurdity of it – you don’t know what love is and you ask a woman about the delights, about her experience. You think that by listening to her experience you will become blissful. It is taking the menu for the food.\nSaraha is saying that first you go out of yourself – stand at the door – and then you ask others what delight is, what life is, what joy is, what God is. And God is waiting all the time within you. He resides in you... and you are asking others. And do you think that by listening to them you will come to any understanding?\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS. SUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN\nFROM CELESTIAL SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO VICE.\nFirst: sex is not the ultimate in pleasure, it is just the beginning, the alpha, the ABC of it; it is not the omega. Sex is not the ultimately real, it is not the bliss supreme, but just an echo of it; SAHASRAR is far away. When your sex centre feels a little happiness, it is just a far-away echo of SAHASRAR. The closer you come to SAHASRAR, the more happiness...\nWhen you move from MULADHAR to SWADHISTAN, you feel more happy – the first meeting of MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN is of great joy. Then the second meeting is of even greater joy. Then the third meeting... You cannot believe that more joy can be possible – but more is still possible because you are still away, not very far, but still away from SAHASRAR. SAHASRAR is just incredible. The bliss is so much that you are no more, only bliss is. The bliss is so much that you cannot say ‘I am blissful’, you simply know that you ARE bliss.\nAt the seventh you are just a tremor of joy. Naturally so. Joy happens in SAHASRAR, and then it has to pass six layers – much is lost; it is just an echo. Beware, don’t mistake the echo for the real. Yes even in the echo something of the real is there. Find the thread of reality in it. Catch hold of the thread, and start moving inwards.\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.\nAnd because of this delusion that sex is the ultimate in pleasure, so many artificial things have become very important. Money has become very important, because you can purchase anything for money – you can purchase sex... Power has become important, because through power you can have as much sex as you want. A poor man cannot afford it. Kings used to have thousands of wives – even in this twentieth century, the Nizam of Hyderabad had five hundred wives. Naturally, one who has power can have as much sex as he wants.\nBecause of this delusion that sex is the ultimately real, thousands of other problems have arisen: money, power, prestige.\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS...\nIt is just imagination; it is just imagination that you are thinking to be pleasure. It is an auto-hypnosis, an auto-suggestion. And once you auto-suggest to yourself, it looks like pleasure. Just think: holding the hand of a woman... and you feel so pleasurable. It is just an auto-hypnosis, it is just an idea in the mind.\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES... Because of this idea, your bioenergy is stirred. It is stirred sometimes even while looking at a PLAYBOY picture – there is nobody, just lines and colours – and your energy can be stirred. Sometimes, just an idea in the mind, and your energy can be stirred. Energy follows imagination.\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS...\nYou can create dreams; you can project dreams onto the screen of nothingness.\nHAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.\nIf you watch the pathology of man you will be amazed. People have such ideas that you cannot believe that this is happening. Some man cannot make love to his woman unless he looks at pornography first – the real-seems to be less real than the unreal. He becomes excited only through the unreal. Have you not seen it again and again in your own life – that the real seems to be less exciting than the unreal?\nJust there is sitting Rushma. She has come from Nairobi. The other day she asked ‘I hanker for you, Osho, so much in Nairobi. I dream about you, I fantasize about you, and I have come from so far. And now my heart is not fluttering that way. What has happened?’ Nothing has happened. Just that we are more in love with the imaginary than with the real. The unreal has become more real. So in Nairobi you have ‘your’ Osho – that is your imagination, I have nothing to do with it – that is your idea. But when you come to me, I am here, and then suddenly your imaginary ideas are no more relevant: You come with a dream in your mind. My reality will destroy the dream.\nRemember to change your consciousness from the imaginary to the real. Always listen to the real. Unless you are very, very alert, you will remain in the trap of the imaginary.\nThe imaginary seems to be very satisfying for many reasons: it is under your control. You can have Osho’s nose as long as you want – in you imagination. You can think whatsoever you want to think. Nobody can hinder it, nobody can enter into your imagination; you are utterly free. You can paint me as you want, you can imagine me, you can expect... you can make whatsoever you want of me – you are free; the ego feels very good.\nThat’s why when a Master is dead he finds more disciples than while he is alive. With a dead Master, disciples are completely at ease; with a living Master, they are in difficulty. Buddha never had so many disciples as he has now, after twenty-five centuries. Jesus had only twelve disciples\n– now, half of the earth. Just see the impact of the absent Master: now Jesus is in your hands\n– you can do whatsoever you want to do with him. He is no more alive; he cannot destroy your dreams and imaginations. If the so-called Christians had seen the real Jesus, their hearts would stop fluttering immediately. Why? – because they would not believe; they have imagined things. And Jesus is a real man. You could have found him in a pub, drinking with friends and gossiping. Now this doesn’t look like the ‘only begotten son of God’, it looks very ordinary. Maybe he is just the carpenter Joseph’s son. But once Jesus is gone, then he cannot interfere with your imagination. Then you can picture and paint and create images of him as you like.\nFar away it is easier – the imagination has full power. The closer you come to me, the less and less power will your imagination have. And you will never be able to see me unless you drop your imagination. So is the case with all other pleasures.\nTHE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS. SUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO VICE.\nIf you imagine too much, you will lose your celestial space. Imagination is SAMSARA, imagination is your dream. If you dream too much, you will lose the celestial space, you will lose your divinity; you will not be a conscious being. Imagination will outweigh you, it will overburden you; you will be lost in a fantasy. You can faint in your fantasy and you can think that this is SAMADHI. There are people who faint. and then they think they are in SAMADHI – Buddha has called such SAMADHIS ‘wrong SAMADHIS’. So says Saraha: It is a wrong SAMADHI. Imagining about God, going on into your imagination, feeding your imagination, nurturing it more and more, fantasizing more and more – you will faint, you will lose all consciousness; you will have beautiful dreams of your own creation.\nBut this is falling from the celestial space. And Saraha says that this is the only vice: to fall from your purity of awareness. What does he mean by the ‘celestial space’? Space without any dreams. Dreaming is the world; without dreaming you are in NIRVANA\nAS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER MAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN BLAZING FIRE\nCREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, TAKES THIS THROUGH WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.\nIn India, the Brahmins have been doing YAGNAS. They have been offering rice and butter into the fire, the blazing fire, and imagining that this offering is going to God. Sitting around a fire, fasting for many days, doing certain rituals, certain mantras, repeating certain scriptures, you can create a state of autohypnosis. You can be fooled by yourself and you can think that you are reaching to God.\nSaraha says: Those who really want to enter into God, they will have to burn their inner fire – the outer fire won’t do. And those who really want to attain, they will have to burn their own seeds of desire – rice won’t do. And those who really want to attain, they will have to burn their ego – butter won’t do. Butter is just the most essential part of milk, the most purified part of milk. So is ego the most purified dream; it is GHEE, purified butter. Offering GHEE to fire is not going to help. You have to burn your inner fire.\nAnd sexual energy moving upwards becomes fire. It becomes a flame. It is fire! Even when it moves outwards, it gives birth to life; sex energy is the most miraculous thing. It is through sex energy that life is born. Life is fire: it is a function of fire. Without fire life could not exist. Without the sun there would be no trees, no men, no birds, no animals. It is transformed fire that becomes life.\nWhile making love to a woman, the fire is going out. While moving inward, the fire is going in. And when you throw your seeds of desire, seeds of thought, seeds of ambition, seeds of greed into this fire, they are burnt. And then, finally, you throw your ego – the most purified dream – that too is burnt. This is real YAGNA, real ritual, real sacrifice.\nAS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER MAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN BLAZING FIRE\nCREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, TAKES THIS THROUGH WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.\nAnd he thinks, through wishful thinking, that this is the ultimate. The man who is making love to a woman and thinks that this is the ultimate. is throwing into the outer fire in exactly the same way. He is pouring into something outside. And so is the woman who thinks she is making love or moving into a great space of bliss and benediction by just making love to a man, just throwing out her fire.\nThe fire has to move inwards, then it gives a rebirth to you, it rejuvenates you.\nSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE FONTANELLE STROKE THE UVULA WITH THE TONGUE IN A SORT OF COITION AND CONFUSE\nTHAT WHICH FETTERS WITH WHAT GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL THEMSELVES YOGIS.\nAnd a very important thing: Just as I explained to you the map, you have to remember that the VISUDDHA, the fifth CHAKRA, is in the throat. VISUDDHA, the throat chakra, is the last point from which you can fall. Up to that point there is a possibility of falling back. With the sixth chakra – the third eye attained, there is no possibility of falling back. You have gone beyond the point from which one can return. The point of no return is the third eye. If you die at the third eye centre, you will be born at the third eye centre. If you die at SAHASRAR, you will not be born again. But if you are at the VISUDDHA, you will slip back to the first, MULADHAR. In the next life you will have to start from MULADHAR again.\nSo up to the fifth there is no certainty; there is promise, but no certainty. Up to the fifth there is every possibility of falling back. And one of the greatest possibilities that has helped many people in India to fall back is, this sutra says, because\nSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE FONTANELLE...\nYou can create the inner heat; the flame starts moving upwards and it comes to the throat. Then there arises a great desire to tickle the throat with the tongue. Beware of it. In India they have devised great techniques for tickling it with the tongue. They have even cut the roots of the tongue so that the tongue becomes long and can easily move backwards – you will find many yogis doing that. The tongue can move backwards and it can tickle the fifth centre. That tickling is masturbatory because the sex energy has come there.\nJust as I told you, the fifth chakra, VISUDDHA, is male. When the male energy comes to the throat, your throat becomes almost a genital organ – of more superiority, of more finesse, than the genital organ. Just a little tickle with the tongue and you enjoy greatly. But that is masturbatory, and once you start doing that... And it is very, very great pleasure. Sex is nothing compared to it – remember it – sex is just nothing compared to it. Tickling with your own tongue... you can enjoy it so much. So in Yoga there are methods.\nSaraha is making it clear that no TANTRIKA should do that. It is a deception and a great failure because the energy has come up to the fifth, and now the desire arises to tickle it – that is the last desire.\nIf you can keep yourself alert and can move beyond that desire, then you will reach to the sixth centre, AJNA, otherwise you will start falling back. That is the last temptation. In fact. in Tantra that is the temptation which you can say that Jesus had when Satan comes and tempts him, or Buddha had when Mara comes and tempts him. This is the last temptation, the last effort of your desire-mind, the last effort of your dream world, the last effort of your ego before it is lost utterly. It makes a last effort to tempt you. And the temptation is really great: it is very difficult to avoid it. It is so pleasurable, infinitely more pleasurable than sex pleasure.\nWhen people think that sex pleasure is the ultimate, what to say about this pleasure? And it loses no energy. In sex you have to lose energy, you feel frustrated, tired, weak. But if you tickle your sex energy when it has come to the throat, there is no loss of energy. And you can go on tickling the whole day. That’s what Delgado has attained through mechanical devices.\nSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE FONTANELLE STROKE THE UVULA WITH THE TONGUE IN A SORT OF COITION AND CONFUSE\nTHAT WHICH FETTERS WITH THAT WHICH GIVES RELEASE...\nThis is again SAMSARA... falling back into SAMSARA...\n... AND CONFUSE\nTHAT WHICH FETTERS WITH THAT WHICH GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL THEMSELVES YOGIS.\nBut they are not – they have missed. In fact, the right word for them is YOGABRASHTA, ‘one who has fallen from Yoga.’\nThe fifth centre is the most dangerous centre. You cannot tickle any other centre – that is the danger of it. You cannot tickle SWADHISTAN, you cannot tickle MANIPURA, you cannot tickle ANAHATA. They are beyond you: there is no way to reach them and tickle them. You cannot tickle the third eye. The only point which can be tickled is VISUDDHA, your throat centre, because it is available. The mouth is open it is available. And the easiest way is to turn your tongue backwards and tickle it.\nIn Yoga treatises you will find it described as something great. It is not. Beware of it.\nThis is the inner map of Tantra alchemy. The energy can start moving at any time; you just have to bring to your love-making a little meditation, a little inwardness. Tantra is not against lovemaking, remember. Let it be repeated again and again. It is all for it, but not just for it. It is the first rung of the ladder, a seven-runged ladder.\nMan is a ladder. The first rung is sex and the seventh rung is SAHASRAR – SAMADHI. The first rung joins you with SAMSARA, the world, and the seventh rung joins you with NIRVANA, the beyond. With the first rung, you move in a vicious circle of birth and death again and again; it is repetitive. With the seventh rung, you go beyond birth and death. Life eternal is yours... the Kingdom of God.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9977","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_2/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_2/>The Tantra Vision, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 The Tantra Map</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9977 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Tantra_Vision_Vol_2/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ULTIMATELY REAL –</p><p>LIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A
WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS. THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN
THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO</p><p>PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.</p><p><br></p><p>SUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN FROM CELESTIAL
SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO VICE. AS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER</p><p>MAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN BLAZING FIRE</p><p><br></p><p>CREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE,</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>TAKES THIS THROUGH WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.</p><p>SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE
FONTANELLE</p><p>STROKE THE UVULA, WITH THE TONGUE IN A SORT OF COITION AND
CONFUSE</p><p>THAT WHICH FETTERS WITH WHAT GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL
THEMSELVES YOGIS.</p><p>Tantra is freedom: freedom from all mind-constructs, from all
mind-games; freedom from all structures; freedom from the other. Tantra
is a space to be. Tantra is liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is not a religion in the ordinary sense – religion again is a
mind game; religion gives you a certain pattern. A Christian has a
certain pattern, so has the Hindu, so has the Muslim Religion gives you
a certain style, a discipline. Tantra takes all disciplines away.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is no discipline, when there is no enforced order, a
totally different kind of order arises in you. What Lao Tzu calls Tao,
what Buddha calls DHARMA – that arises in you. That is not anything done
by you; it happens to you. Tantra simply creates space for it to happen.
It does not even invite, it does not wait; it simply creates a space.
And when the space is ready, the whole flows in.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a very beautiful story, a very ancient one.</p><p><br></p><p>In a province, no rain had fallen for a long time. Everything was
dried up. At last the citizens decided to fetch the rainmaker. A
deputation was sent to see him in the distant town where he lived with
the urgent request to come as soon as possible and make rain for their
parched fields.</p><p><br></p><p>The rainmaker, a wise old man, promised to do so on condition that he
be provided with a solitary little cottage in the open country where he
could withdraw by himself for three days. No food or drink would be
required, then he would see what could be done. His requests were
met.</p><p><br></p><p>On the evening of the third day abundant rain fell and, full
of.praise, a grateful crowd made a pilgrimage to his house and exclaimed
‘How did you do it? Tell us.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘It was quite simple’ the rainmaker answered. ‘For three days all I
have done is to put myself in order. For I know that once I am in order,
then the world will be in order, and the drought must yield place to the
rain.’</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says: If you are in order, then the whole world is in order
for you. When you are in harmony, then the whole existence is in harmony
for you. When you are in disorder, then the whole world is</p><p>disorder. And the order has not to be a false one, it has not to be a
forced one. When you force some order upon yourself, you simply become
split; deep down the disorder continues.</p><p><br></p><p>You can observe it: if you are an angry person, you can force your
anger, you can repress it deep down in the unconscious, but it is not
going to disappear. Maybe you become completely unaware of it, but it is
there – and you know that it is there. It is running underneath you, it
is in the dark basement of your being, but it is there. On top of it you
can sit smiling, but you know it can erupt at any moment. And your smile
cannot be very deep, and your smile cannot be true, and your smile will
be just an effort that you will be making against yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who forces an order from the outside remains in disorder.
Tantra says there is another kind of order: You don’t impose any order,
you don’t impose any discipline; you simply drop all structures, you
simply become natural and spontaneous. It is the greatest step a man can
be asked to take. It will need great courage because the society will
not like it; the society will be dead against it. The society wants a
certain order. If you follow the society, the society is happy with you.
If you go a little bit astray here and there, the society is very angry.
And the mob is mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is a rebellion. I don’t call it revolutionary because it has
no politics in it. And I don’t call it revolutionary because it has no
plans to change the world: it has no plans to change the state and the
society. It is rebellious, it is individual rebellion. It is one
individual slipping out of the structures and the slavery. But the
moment you slip out of the slavery, you come to feel another kind of
existence around you which you have never felt before – as if you were
living with a blindfold and suddenly the blindfold has become loose,
your eyes have opened, and you can see a totally different world.</p><p><br></p><p>This blindfold is what you call your mind; your thinking, your
prejudices, your knowledge, your scriptures – they all make the thick
layer of a blindfold. They are keeping you blind, they are keeping you
dull, they are keeping you unalive. Tantra wants you to be alive – as
alive as the trees, as alive as the rivers, as alive as the sun and the
moon. That is your birthright. You don’t gain anything by losing it; you
lose all. And if everything is to be lost in gaining it, nothing is
lost. Even a single moment of utter freedom is enough to satisfy. And a
long life of a hundred years, yoked like a slave, is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>To be in the world of Tantra needs courage: it is adventurous. Up to
now, only a few people have been able to move on that path. But the
future is very hopeful. Tantra will become more and more important. Man
is understanding more and more what slavery is. And man is understanding
also that no political revolution has proved revolutionary.</p><p><br></p><p>All political revolutions finally turn into anti-revolutions. Once
they are in power they become anti- revolutionary. Power IS
anti-revolutionary. So there is a built-in mechanism in power. Give
anybody power and he becomes anti-revolutionary. Power creates its own
world. So, up to now, there have been many revolutions in the world and
all have failed, utterly failed – no revolution has helped. Now man is
becoming aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra gives a different perspective. It is not revolutionary, it is
rebellious. Rebellion means individual. You can rebel alone, you need
not organize a party for it. You can rebel alone, on your own. It is not
a fight against society, remember, it is just going beyond society. It
is not anti-social, it is asocial; it has nothing to do with society. It
is not against slavery, it is for freedom – freedom to be.</p><p>Just look at your life. Are you a free man? You are not: there are a
thousand and one bondages around you. You may not look at them – it is
very embarrassing, you may not recognize them – it hurts, but it doesn’t
change the situation: you are a slave. To move into the dimension of
Tantra you will have to recognize your slavery. It is very deep-rooted.
It has to be dropped. And being aware of it helps you to drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go on pacifying yourself, don’t go on consoling yourself, don’t
go on saying ‘Everything is okay.’ It is not; nothing is okay, your
whole life is just a nightmare. Have a look at it! There is no poetry,
and no song, and no dance, and no love, and no prayer. There is no
celebration. Joy? – is just a word in the dictionary. Bliss? – yes, you
have heard about it, but you have not known anything about it. God? – in
the temples, in the churches. Yes, people talk about it: those who talk,
they don’t know. Those who hear, they don’t know. All that is beautiful
seems to be meaningless; and all that is meaningless seems to be very,
very important.</p><p><br></p><p>A man goes on accumulating money and thinks that he is doing
something very significant. Human stupidity is infinite. Beware of it.
It will destroy your whole life. It has destroyed millions of people’s
lives down the ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Take hold of your awareness – that is the only possibility to get out
of stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter today’s sutras, something has to be understood about
the Tantra map of inner consciousness. I have told you a few things
about it – a few more things have to be told.</p><p><br></p><p>First: Tantra says that no man is just man and no woman is just
woman, each man is both man and woman, and so is each woman – woman and
man. Adam has Eve in him, and Eve has Adam in her. In fact, nobody is
just Adam and nobody is just Eve: we are Adam-Eves. This is one of the
greatest insights ever attained.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern depth psychology has become aware of it. They call it
bisexuality. But, for at least five thousand years, Tantra has known it,
preached it. It is one of the greatest discoveries of the world because
with this understanding you can move in your inner direction, otherwise
you cannot move in your inner direction. Why does a man fall in love
with a woman? – because he carries a woman inside him, otherwise he
would not fall in love. And why do you fall in love with a certain
woman? There are thousands of women. But why, suddenly, does a certain
woman become most important to you, as if all other women had
disappeared and that were the only woman in the world. Why? Why does a
certain man attract you? Why, at first sight, does something suddenly
click? Tantra says: You are carrying an image of a woman inside you, an
image of a man inside you. Each man is carrying a woman and each woman
is carrying a man. When somebody on the outside fits with your inner
image, you fall in love – that is the meaning of love.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t understand it. You simply shrug your shoulders – you say
‘It has happened.’ But there is a subtle mechanism in it. Why did it
happen with a certain woman? Why not with others? Your inner image fits
somehow. The outer woman is similar in a way. Something just hits your
inner image, you feel that ‘this is my woman’, or ‘this is my man’: this
feeling is what love is. But the outer woman is not going to satisfy,
because no outer woman is going to completely fit with your inner
woman.</p><p><br></p><p>The reality is not that way at all. Maybe she fits a little bitt –
here is an appeal, a magnetism, but it</p><p>will be worn out sooner or later. Soon you will recognize that there
are a thousand and one things that you don’t like in the woman. It will
take a bit of time to come to know about those things.</p><p><br></p><p>First you will be infatuated. First the similarity will be too much,
it will overwhelm you. But by and by you will see that there are a
thousand and one things – details of life – that don’t fit; that you are
aliens, strangers. Yes, you still love her, but the love has no more
infatuation; that romantic vision is disappearing. And she will also
recognize that something appeals in you, but your totality is not
appealing. That’s why each husband tries to change the wife and each
wife tries to change the husband. What are they trying to do? Why? Why
does a wife continuously try to change the husband? For what? She has
fallen in love with this man, then immediately she starts changing this
man. Now that she has become aware of the dissimilarities, she wants to
drop those dissimilarities. She wants to take a few chunks off this man,
so that he completely fits with her idea of a man. And the husband tries
also – not so hard, not so stubbornly as women try, because the husband
becomes tired very soon – the woman hopes longer.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman thinks ‘Today or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow – some
day I will change...’ It takes almost twenty, twenty-five years to
recognize the fact that you cannot change the other. By the age of
fifty, when the woman has passed her menopause and the man too, when
they are getting really old, then they become alert by and by that
nothing has changed. They have tried hard, they have tried every way...
the woman remains the same and the man remains the same. Nobody can
change anybody. This is a great experience to come to – a great
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why old people become more tolerant: they know that nothing
can be done. That’s why old people become more graceful: they know that
things are as they are. That’s why old people become more accepting.
Young people are very angry, nonaccepting. They want to change
everything. They want to make the world the way they would like it. They
struggle hard, but it has never happened; it cannot happen – it is not
in the nature of things.</p><p><br></p><p>The outer man can never fit with your inner man and the outer woman
can never be absolutely the same as your inner woman. That’s why love
gives pleasure and pain too. Love gives happiness and unhappiness too.
And, the unhappiness is much more than the happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>What does Tantra propose about it? What has to be done then?</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra says: There is no way to be satisfied with the outer; you will
have to move inward. You will have to find your inner woman and inner
man. You will have to atta.in to a sexual intercourse inside. That is a
great contribution.</p><p><br></p><p>How can it happen? Try to understand this map. I talked about seven
chakras, the Tantra yoga physiology. In man the MULADHAR is male and
SWADHISTAN, female. In woman the MULADHAR is female and SWADHISTAN,
male, and so on and so forth. In seven chakras, up to the sixth, the
duality remains; the seventh is non-dual.</p><p><br></p><p>There are three pairs inside you: MULADHAR-SWADHISTAN get married.
MANIPURA-ANAHATA have to get married. VISUDDHA-AJNA have to get
married.</p><p><br></p><p>When the energy moves outside, you need a woman outside. You have a
little glimpse for a moment, because the coition with a woman outside
cannot be permanent – it can be only momentary. For</p><p>a single moment you can lose yourself into each other. Again you are
thrown back to yourself, and thrown back with a vengeance. That’s why
after each love-making there is a certain frustration: you have failed
again, it didn’t happen the way you wanted it to happen. Yes, you
reached to a peak, but before you had even become aware of it, the
decline, the fall began. Before the peak was achieved... the valley.
Before you had met the woman or the man... and the separation. The
divorce comes with marriage so fast that it is frustrating. All lovers
are frustrated people. They hope much, they hope against their
experience; they hope again and again, but nothing can be done – you
cannot destroy the laws of reality. You have to understand those
laws.</p><p><br></p><p>The outer meeting can only be momentary, but the inner meeting can
become eternal. And the higher you move the more eternal it can
become.</p><p><br></p><p>The first, MULADHAR, in man is male. Even while making love to a
woman outside, Tantra- says, remember the inner. Make, love to the woman
outside, but remember the inner. Let your consciousness move inward –
forget the outer woman completely. In the moment of orgasm forget the
woman or the man completely. Close your eyes and be in, and let it be a
meditation. When energy is stirred, don’t miss this opportunity. That is
the moment when you can have a contact – an inward journey.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, it is difficult to look in, but in a love-moment, some
gap, you are not ordinary. In a love- moment you are at your maximum.
When orgasm happens, your whole body energy is throbbing with dance;
each cell, each fibre dancing in a rhythm, in a harmony that you don’t
know in ordinary life. This is the moment: this moment of harmony, use
it as a passage inward. While making love, become meditative, look
in.</p><p><br></p><p>A door opens at that moment. This is the Tantra experience. A door
opens in that moment, and Tantra says that you feel happy only because
that door opens and something of your inner bliss flows to you. It is
not coming from the outer woman, it is not coming from the outer man; it
is coming from your innermost core. The outer is just as excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra does not say that to make love to the outer is sin, it simply
says that it is not very far-going. It does not condemn it, it accepts
its naturalness. But it says that you can use that love wave to go far
inside. In that moment of thrill, things are not on the earth: you can
fly. Your arrow can lead the bow towards the target. You can become a
Saraha.</p><p><br></p><p>If, while making love you become meditative you become silent, you
start looking in, you close your eyes, you forget the outer man or woman
then it happens. The MULADHAR, your male centre inside, starts moving
towards the female centre – the female centre is SWADHISTAN – and there
is a coition, there is an intercourse inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it happens without your knowing it. Many sannyasins have
written me letters<span class=s4></span>I have</p><p>never answered before because it was not possible to answer, now I
can answer, you will be able to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>One sannyasin writes to me again and again, and he must be wondering
why I am not answering.… The map was not available up to now, now I am
giving you the map. Listening to me, he always feels as if he is going
into orgasm. His whole body starts throbbing, and he has the same
experience</p><p>as he has while making love to a woman. He becomes very puzzled –
naturally so. He loses track of what he was listening to, he forgets...
and the thrill is so much and the joy is so much that he is worried:
What is happening? What is this inside him?</p><p><br></p><p>This is happening: the MULADHAR is meeting with the SWADHISTAN, your
male centre is meeting with your female centre. That is the joy when you
move into meditation, when you move into prayer. This is the mechanism
of your inner celebration. And the moment MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN meet,
the energy is released. Just as when you love your woman energy is
released, when SWADHISTAN and MULADHAR meet, energy is released and that
energy hits the higher centre, MANIPURA.</p><p><br></p><p>MANIPURA is male, ANAHATA is female. Once you have become attuned to
the first meeting of your man and woman inside, one day the second
meeting suddenly happens. You have not to do anything about it just the
energy released from the first meeting creates the possibility for the
second meeting. And when energy is created by the second meeting, it
creates the possibility for the third meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>The third meeting is between VISUDDHA and AJNA. And when the third
meeting happens, the energy is created for the fourth, which is not a
meeting, which is not a union, but unity. SAHASRAR is alone, there is no
male-female. The Adam and Eve have disappeared into each other, totally,
utterly. Man has become the woman, the woman has become the man; all
division disappears. This is the absolute, the eternal meeting. This is
what Hindus call SATCHITANANDA. This is what Jesus calls ‘the Kingdom of
God’.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the number seven has been used by all the religions. Seven
days are symbolic, and the seventh day is the holiday, the holy day. Six
days God worked, and on the seventh day he rested. Six chakras you will
have to work in, the seventh is the state of great rest, utter rest,
absolute relaxation – you have come home.</p><p><br></p><p>With the seventh you disappear as part of duality; all polarities
disappear, all distinctions disappear. Night is no more night, and day
is no more day. Summer is no more summer, and winter is no more winter.
Matter is no more matter, and mind is no more mind – you have gone
beyond. This is the transcendental space Buddha calls NIRVANA.</p><p><br></p><p>These three meetings inside you and the achievement of the fourth
have another dimension too. I have talked to you many times about four
states: sleep, dream, waking, TURIYA. TURIYA means ‘the fourth’, ‘the
beyond’. These seven chakras, and the work through them, have a
correspondence with these four states also.</p><p><br></p><p>The first meeting between MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN IS like sleep. The
meeting happens, but you cannot be very aware of it. You will enjoy it,
you will feel a great freshness arising in you. You will feel great
rest, as if you have slept deeply; but you will not be able to see it
exactly – it is very dark. The man and woman have met inside you, but
they have met in the unconscious. The meeting was not in the daylight,
it was in the dark night. Yes, the result will be felt, the consequence
will be felt. You will suddenly feel a new energy in you, a new
radiance, a new glow. You will have an aura. Even others may start
feeling that you have a certainly quality of presence, a ‘vibe’. But you
will not be exactly alert to what is happening. So the first meeting is
like sleep.</p><p>The second meeting is like dream – when MANIPURA and ANAHATA meet,
your meeting with the inner woman is as if you have met in a dream. Yes,
you can remember a little bit of it. Just as in the morning you can
remember the dream that you had last night – a little bit here and
there, a few glimpses; maybe something has been forgotten, maybe the
whole is not remembered – but still you can remember. The second meeting
is like dream. You will become more aware of it. You will start feeling
that something is happening. You will start feeling that you are
changing, that a transformation is on the way, that you are no more the
old person. And with the second you will start becoming aware that your
interest in the outer woman is lessening. Your interest in the outer man
is not as infatuating as it used to be.</p><p><br></p><p>With the first also there will be a change, but you will not be aware
of it. With the first you may start thinking that you are no more
interested in YOUR woman, but you will not be able to understand that
you are not interested in ANY woman at all. You may think you are bored
with your woman and you will be more happy with some other woman; some
change will be good, a different climate will be good, a different
quality of woman will be good. This will be just a guess. With the
second you will start feeling that you are no longer interested in the
woman or the man, that your interest is turning inward’.</p><p><br></p><p>With the third you will become perfectly aware. It is like waking.
VISUDDHA meeting AJNA... you will become perfectly aware, the meeting is
happening in the daylight. Or you can say it in this way: the first
meeting happens in the dark middle of the night; the second meeting
happens in a twilight time between the day and the night; the third
meeting happens in full noon – you are fully alert, everything is clear.
Now you know you are finished with the outer. It does not mean that you
will leave your wife or your husband, it simply means that the
infatuation is no more; you will feel compassion. Certainly the woman
who has helped you so far is a great friend, the man who has brought you
so far is a great friend; you are grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>You will start being grateful and compassionate to each other. It is
always so when understanding arises – it brings compassion. If you leave
your wife and escape to the forest, that simply shows you are cruel and
compassion has not arisen. It can be only out of non-understanding, it
cannot be out of understanding. If you understand, you will have
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha became enlightened, the first thing he said to his
disciples was ‘I would like to go to Yashodhara and talk to her.’ His
wife...</p><p><br></p><p>Ananda was very much disturbed. He said ‘What is the point of your
going back to the palace and talking to your wife? You have left her.
Twelve years have passed.’ And Ananda was a little bit disturbed also,
because how can a Buddha think about his wife? Buddhas are not expected
to think that way.</p><p><br></p><p>When the others had left, Ananda said to Buddha ‘This is not good.
What will people think?’</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said ‘What will people think? I have to express my gratitude
to her, and I have to thank her for all the help she gave me. And I have
to give something of that which has happened to me – I owe that much to
her. I will have to go.’</p><p><br></p><p>He came back. He went to the palace. He saw his wife. Certainly
Yashodhara was mad! This man escaped one night without even saying
anything to her. She said to Buddha ’Couldn’t you have</p><p>trusted me? You could have said that you wanted to go, and I would
have been the last woman in the world to prevent you. Couldn’t you have
trusted me even that much?’ And she was crying. Twelve years of anger!
And this man had escaped like a thief in the middle of the night –
suddenly, without giving a single hint to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha apologized and he said ‘It was out of non-understanding. I was
ignorant, I was not aware. But now I am aware and I know – that’s why I
have come back. You have helped me tremendously. Forget those old
things, now there is no point in thinking about ’spilt milk’. Look at
me! Something great has happened. I have come home. And I felt my first
duty was towards you: to come, and to convey, and to share my experience
with you.’</p><p><br></p><p>The anger gone, the rage subsided, Yashodhara looked out through her
tears. ‘Yes, this man has changed tremendously.’ This was not the same
man she used to know. This was not the same man, not at all; this looked
like a great luminosity... She could almost see the aura, a light around
him. And he was so peaceful and so silent; he had almost disappeared.
His presence was almost absence. And then, in spite of herself, she
forgot what she was doing – she fell at his feet and she asked to be
initiated.</p><p><br></p><p>When you understand, there is bound to be compassion. That’s why I
don’t say to my sannyasins to leave their families. Be there.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath has written a poem about this incident when Buddha
comes. Yashodhara asked him one thing. ‘Just tell me one thing’ she
said. ‘Whatever you have attained... I can see you have attained,
whatsoever it is. I don’t know what it is – just tell me one thing: was
it not possible to attain it here in this house?’ And Buddha could not
say no. It was possible to attain it here in this house. Now he knew.
Because it has nothing to do with forest or with town, with family or
with ashram – it has nothing to do with any place; it has something to
do with your innermost core. It is available everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>First, you will start feeling that your interest in the other is
loosening. It will be a dim phenomenon, dark – looking through a dark
glass, looking through a very foggy morning. Second, things become a
little more clear, like a dream; the fog is not so much. Third, you are
fully awake. It has happened: the inner woman has met the inner man. The
biopolarity is no longer there, suddenly you are one. Schizophrenia has
disappeared; you are not split.</p><p><br></p><p>With this integration you become individual. Before that you are not
an individual, you are a crowd: you are a mob, you are many people, you
are multi-psychic. Suddenly you fall into order. That’s what this
ancient story says.</p><p><br></p><p>The man had asked for three days... If sometimes you look into these
small stories you will be wonderstruck; their symbols are great. The man
had asked for three days to sit silently. Why three days? Those are the
three points: in sleep, in dream, in waking, he wanted to put himself in
order. First it happens in sleep, then it happens in dream, then it
happens in waking. And when you are in order, the whole existence is in
order. When you are an individual – when your split has disappeared and
you are bridged together – then everything is bridged together. It will
look very paradoxical, but it has to be said: the individual is the
universal. When you have become individual, suddenly you see that you
are the universal. Up to now you have been thinking that you were
separate from existence. Now you cannot think that.</p><p>Adam and Eve have disappeared into each other. This is the goal that
everybody is trying to find in some way or other. Tantra is the surest
science for achieving it. This is the target.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things more:</p><p><br></p><p>I told you that the MULADHAR has to be relaxed, only then can the
energy move upward, inward. And ‘inward’ and ‘upward’ mean the same;
‘outward’ and ‘downward’ mean the same. Energy can move inward or upward
only when the MULADHAR is relaxed. So the first thing is to relax the
MULADHAR.</p><p><br></p><p>You are holding your sex centre very tightly. The society has made
you very much aware of the sex centre; it has made you obsessed with it,
so you are holding it tightly. You can simply watch. You are always
holding your genital organism very tightly, as if you are afraid that
something will go amiss if you relax. Your whole conditioning has been
to keep it uptight. Relax it, leave it to itself. Don’t be afraid: fear
creates tension. Drop the fear. Sex is beautiful; it is not a sin, it is
a virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you think in terms of its being a virtue, you will be able to
relax. I have talked about how to relax the MULADHAR before. And I have
talked about how to relax the SWADHISTAN; it is the death centre. Don’t
be afraid of death. These are the two fears which have been dominating
humanity: the fear of sex and the fear of death. Both fears are
dangerous; they have not allowed you to grow. Drop both the fears.</p><p><br></p><p>The third chakra is MANIPURA; it is loaded with negative emotions.
That’s why your stomach becomes disturbed – when you are emotionally
disturbed, MANIPURA is affected immediately. In all the languages of the
world we have expressions like Ll cannot stomach it.’ It is literally
true. Sometimes, when you cannot stomach a certain thing, you start
feeling nauseous; you would like to vomit. In fact, sometimes it happens
– a psychological vomit. Somebody has said something, and you CANNOT
stomach it; and suddenly you feel a nausea, vomit comes, and after
vomiting you feel very relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>In Yoga they have methods for it. The yogi has to drink enough water
in the morning – a bucketful of water with salt, the water has to be
lukewarm – and then he has to vomit it. It helps to relax the MANIPURA.
It is a great process, a great cleansing process.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised, now many modern therapies have become aware of
it – that vomiting helps. Action Analysis is aware of the fact that
vomiting helps. Primal Therapy is aware of the fact that vomiting helps.
It releases the MANIPURA. Tantra and Yoga have always been aware of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Negative emotions: anger, hatred, jealousy, and so on and so forth –
they all have been repressed; your MANIPURA is too loaded. Those
repressed emotions don’t allow the energy to go up; those repressed
emotions function like a rock: your passage is blocked. Encounter,
Gestalt and therapies like that, all function unknowingly on the
MANIPURA. They try to provoke your anger. they try to provoke your
jealousy, your greed; they provoke your aggression, your violence, so
that it bubbles up, surfaces. The society has done one thing: it has
trained you to repress all that is negative, and pretend all that is
positive. Now, both are dangerous. To pretend the positive is false –
hypocrisy, and to repress the negative is dangerous; it is poisonous, it
is poisoning your system.</p><p>Tantra says: Express the negative and allow the positive. If anger
comes, don’t repress it; if aggression comes, don’t repress it. Tantra
does not say: Go and kill a person. But Tantra says that there a
thousand and one ways to express the repressed emotions. You can go into
the garden and chop wood. Have you watched woodcutters? They look more
silent than anybody else. Have you watched hunters? Hunters are very
good people. The do a very dirty thing, but they are good people.
Something happens to them while they are hunting. Killing animals, their
anger, their aggression is dissolved. The so-called ‘nonviolent’ people
are the ugliest in the world. They are not good people, because they are
holding down a volcano. You cannot feel at ease with them. Something is
dangerously present there. You can feel it, you can touch it; it is
oozing out of them. You can just go into the forest and shout, scream –
Primal Therapy is just scream therapy, tantrum therapy. And Encounter
and Primal, Gestalt, are of tremendous help in relaxing the
MANIPURA.</p><p><br></p><p>Once MANIPURA IS relaxed, there arises a balance between the negative
and the positive. And when the negative and positive are balanced, the
passage is open; then the energy can move higher. MANIPURA is male. If
MANIPURA IS blocked, then energy cannot go upwards. It has to be
relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>Polarity Balancing can be of great help in bringing about the balance
between positive and negative. That’s why I am allowing all sorts of
methods from all over the world in this ashram. Anything that can be of
help has to be used, because man has been damaged so much that all
sources of help should be made available. You may not even be able to
understand why I am making available all the methods to you: Yoga,
Tantra, Tao; Sufi, Jain, Buddhist, Hindu; Gestalt, Psychodrama,
Encounter, Primal Therapy, Polarity Balancing, Rolfing, Structural
Integration – why I am making all these things available to you. You
have never heard of these things being done in any ashram anywhere in
the East at all. There is a reason for it. Man has been damaged so much
that all sources should be tapped. Help should be taken from every
source possible, only then there is hope – otherwise man is doomed.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth chakra is ANAHATA. Doubt is the problem with the fourth
chakra. If you are a doubting person, your fourth chakra will remain
unopened. Trust opens it. So anything that creates doubt destroys your
heart. It is the heart chakra: ANAHATA. Logic, logic-chopping,
argumentativeness, too much rationality, too much of Aristotle in you,
destroy ANAHATA. Philosophy, scepticism, destroy ANAHATA.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to open the ANAHATA you will have to be more trusting.
Poetry is more helpful than philosophy, and intuition is more helpful
than reasoning, and feeling is more helpful than thinking. So you will
have to shift from doubt to trust, only then does your ANAHATA become
open, your ANAHATA becomes capable of receiving the male energy from
MANIPURA. ANAHATA is female. With doubt it becomes dry; it cannot
receive the male energy. With trust it opens, with trust moisture is
released in that chakra and it can allow the penetration of the male
energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the fifth: VISUDDHA. Non-creativity, imitativeness, parroting,
monkeying – these are damaging.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a small anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>A schoolchild was asked ‘Ten copy-cats are sitting on a fence. One
jumped and went away. How many are left?’</p><p>And the child says ‘None.’</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher says ‘None? Only one has left!’ And the child says ‘They
are copy-cats.’ When one jumps, all jump.</p><p>VISUDDHA is destroyed by copying. Don’t be an imitator, don’t be just
a carbon copy. Don’t try to become a Buddha and don’t try to become a
Christ. Beware of books like Thomas a Kempis IMITATION OF CHRIST.
Beware. No imitation is going to help. VISUDDHA is destroyed by non-
creativity, limitation; and VISUDDHA IS helped by creativity,
expression, finding your own style of life, being courageous enough to
‘do your own thing’. Art, song, music, dance, inventiveness – all are
helpful. But be inventive – whatsoever you do, try to do it in a new
way. Try to bring some individuality into it, bring some authentic
signature. Even cleaning a floor, you can do it in your own way. Even
cooking food, you can do it in your own way. You can bring creativity to
everything that you do; it should be brought. In as much as you are
creative – good, VISUDDHA will open. And when VISUDDHA opens, then only
can the energy move into the AJNA, the third eye centre, the sixth
centre.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the process. First cleanse every centre, purify it, beware of
what damages it, and help it so that it becomes naturally functioning.
Blocks are removed... energy rushes.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the sixth is SAHASRAR, TURIYA, the one-thousand-petalled
lotus. You bloom. Yes, that’s exactly what it is. Man is a tree:
MULADHAR is the root and SAHASRAR is the blooming of it. The flower has
bloomed, your fragrance is released to the winds. That is the only
prayer; that is the only offering to the feet of the divine. Borrowed
flowers won’t do, stolen flowers from the trees won’t do; you have to
flower and offer your flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the sutras. The first sutra:</p><p>FOR THE DELIGHTS OF KISSING THE DELUDED CRAVE DECLARING IT TO BE THE
ULTIMATELY REAL –</p><p>LIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A
WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.</p><p>Kissing is symbolic – symbolic of any meeting between yin and yang,
between male and female, between Shiva and Shakti. Whether you are
holding hands with a woman – this is a kissing: hands kissing each
other, or you are touching her lips with your lips – that is kissing; or
your genital organs together – that, too, is a kiss. So the kiss is
symbolic in Tantra of all meetings of opposite polarities. Sometimes you
can kiss just by seeing a woman. If your eyes meet and touch each other
– there is a kiss; the meeting has happened.</p><p>FOR THE DELIGHTS OF KISSING THE DELUDED CRAVE DECLARING IT TO BE THE
ULTIMATELY REAL –</p><p>Saraha says that the deluded – the people who are not alert at all to
what they are doing – go on hankering for, missing, the other: man, the
woman; the woman, the man. They are continuously hankering to meet the
other. And the meeting never happens. The absurdity of it is this: that
you hanker and hanker, and desire and desire, and nothing but
frustration comes into your hands. Saraha says this is not the
ultimately real meeting. The ultimately real meeting is that which
happens in SAHASRAR. Once it has happened, it has happened forever. That
is real. The meeting that happens outside is unreal, momentary,
temporal, just a delusion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is...</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A
WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.</p><p>A beautiful simile. Saraha says that holding the hand of a woman
outside, while the woman inside is waiting to be yours and forever
yours, is just...</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A
WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS.</p><p>First: LEAVES HIS HOUSE... You are leaving your house, your innermost
core, in search of a woman outside... and the woman is within. You will
miss her wherever you go – you can go on running all over the earth and
chasing all sorts of women and men. It is a mirage, it is a rainbow
search – nothing comes into your hands. The woman is inside... and you
are leaving the house.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, STANDING AT THE DOOR... That too is symbolic. You are
always standing at the door, by the senses – those are doors. Eyes are
doors, hands are doors, genital organs are doors, ears are doors – these
are doors. We are always standing at the doors. Looking through the
eyes, hearing through the ears, trying to touch with the hands, a man
continuously remains at the doors and forgets how to go inside the
house. And then the absurdity of it – you don’t know what love is and
you ask a woman about the delights, about her experience. You think that
by listening to her experience you will become blissful. It is taking
the menu for the food.</p><p><br></p><p>Saraha is saying that first you go out of yourself – stand at the
door – and then you ask others what delight is, what life is, what joy
is, what God is. And God is waiting all the time within you. He resides
in you... and you are asking others. And do you think that by listening
to them you will come to any understanding?</p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN
ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS. SUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION
FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN</p><p>FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO VICE.</p><p><br></p><p>First: sex is not the ultimate in pleasure, it is just the beginning,
the alpha, the ABC of it; it is not the omega. Sex is not the ultimately
real, it is not the bliss supreme, but just an echo of it; SAHASRAR is
far away. When your sex centre feels a little happiness, it is just a
far-away echo of SAHASRAR. The closer you come to SAHASRAR, the more
happiness...</p><p><br></p><p>When you move from MULADHAR to SWADHISTAN, you feel more happy – the
first meeting of MULADHAR and SWADHISTAN is of great joy. Then the
second meeting is of even greater joy. Then the third meeting... You
cannot believe that more joy can be possible – but more is still
possible because you are still away, not very far, but still away from
SAHASRAR. SAHASRAR is just incredible. The bliss is so much that you are
no more, only bliss is. The bliss is so much that you cannot say ‘I am
blissful’, you simply know that you ARE bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>At the seventh you are just a tremor of joy. Naturally so. Joy
happens in SAHASRAR, and then it has to pass six layers – much is lost;
it is just an echo. Beware, don’t mistake the echo for the real. Yes
even in the echo something of the real is there. Find the thread of
reality in it. Catch hold of the thread, and start moving inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN
ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.</p><p><br></p><p>And because of this delusion that sex is the ultimate in pleasure, so
many artificial things have become very important. Money has become very
important, because you can purchase anything for money – you can
purchase sex... Power has become important, because through power you
can have as much sex as you want. A poor man cannot afford it. Kings
used to have thousands of wives – even in this twentieth century, the
Nizam of Hyderabad had five hundred wives. Naturally, one who has power
can have as much sex as he wants.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this delusion that sex is the ultimately real, thousands
of other problems have arisen: money, power, prestige.</p><p><br></p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS...</p><p><br></p><p>It is just imagination; it is just imagination that you are thinking
to be pleasure. It is an auto-hypnosis, an auto-suggestion. And once you
auto-suggest to yourself, it looks like pleasure. Just think: holding
the hand of a woman... and you feel so pleasurable. It is just an
auto-hypnosis, it is just an idea in the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES... Because of this idea, your bioenergy
is stirred. It is stirred sometimes even while looking at a PLAYBOY
picture – there is nobody, just lines and colours – and your energy can
be stirred. Sometimes, just an idea in the mind, and your energy can be
stirred. Energy follows imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS...</p><p><br></p><p>You can create dreams; you can project dreams onto the screen of
nothingness.</p><p>HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS.</p><p><br></p><p>If you watch the pathology of man you will be amazed. People have
such ideas that you cannot believe that this is happening. Some man
cannot make love to his woman unless he looks at pornography first – the
real-seems to be less real than the unreal. He becomes excited only
through the unreal. Have you not seen it again and again in your own
life – that the real seems to be less exciting than the unreal?</p><p><br></p><p>Just there is sitting Rushma. She has come from Nairobi. The other
day she asked ‘I hanker for you, Osho, so much in Nairobi. I dream about
you, I fantasize about you, and I have come from so far. And now my
heart is not fluttering that way. What has happened?’ Nothing has
happened. Just that we are more in love with the imaginary than with the
real. The unreal has become more real. So in Nairobi you have ‘your’
Osho – that is your imagination, I have nothing to do with it – that is
your idea. But when you come to me, I am here, and then suddenly your
imaginary ideas are no more relevant: You come with a dream in your
mind. My reality will destroy the dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember to change your consciousness from the imaginary to the real.
Always listen to the real. Unless you are very, very alert, you will
remain in the trap of the imaginary.</p><p><br></p><p>The imaginary seems to be very satisfying for many reasons: it is
under your control. You can have Osho’s nose as long as you want – in
you imagination. You can think whatsoever you want to think. Nobody can
hinder it, nobody can enter into your imagination; you are utterly free.
You can paint me as you want, you can imagine me, you can expect... you
can make whatsoever you want of me – you are free; the ego feels very
good.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why when a Master is dead he finds more disciples than while
he is alive. With a dead Master, disciples are completely at ease; with
a living Master, they are in difficulty. Buddha never had so many
disciples as he has now, after twenty-five centuries. Jesus had only
twelve disciples</p><p>– now, half of the earth. Just see the impact of the absent Master:
now Jesus is in your hands</p><p>– you can do whatsoever you want to do with him. He is no more alive;
he cannot destroy your dreams and imaginations. If the so-called
Christians had seen the real Jesus, their hearts would stop fluttering
immediately. Why? – because they would not believe; they have imagined
things. And Jesus is a real man. You could have found him in a pub,
drinking with friends and gossiping. Now this doesn’t look like the
‘only begotten son of God’, it looks very ordinary. Maybe he is just the
carpenter Joseph’s son. But once Jesus is gone, then he cannot interfere
with your imagination. Then you can picture and paint and create images
of him as you like.</p><p><br></p><p>Far away it is easier – the imagination has full power. The closer
you come to me, the less and less power will your imagination have. And
you will never be able to see me unless you drop your imagination. So is
the case with all other pleasures.</p><p>THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN
ARTIFICIAL RISE TO PLEASURES IN SO MANY WAYS. SUCH YOGIS FROM AFFLICTION
FAINT FOR THEY HAVE FALLEN FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, INVEIGLED INTO
VICE.</p><p>If you imagine too much, you will lose your celestial space.
Imagination is SAMSARA, imagination is your dream. If you dream too
much, you will lose the celestial space, you will lose your divinity;
you will not be a conscious being. Imagination will outweigh you, it
will overburden you; you will be lost in a fantasy. You can faint in
your fantasy and you can think that this is SAMADHI. There are people
who faint. and then they think they are in SAMADHI – Buddha has called
such SAMADHIS ‘wrong SAMADHIS’. So says Saraha: It is a wrong SAMADHI.
Imagining about God, going on into your imagination, feeding your
imagination, nurturing it more and more, fantasizing more and more – you
will faint, you will lose all consciousness; you will have beautiful
dreams of your own creation.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is falling from the celestial space. And Saraha says that
this is the only vice: to fall from your purity of awareness. What does
he mean by the ‘celestial space’? Space without any dreams. Dreaming is
the world; without dreaming you are in NIRVANA</p><p><br></p><p>AS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER MAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN
BLAZING FIRE</p><p>CREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, TAKES THIS THROUGH
WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.</p><p>In India, the Brahmins have been doing YAGNAS. They have been
offering rice and butter into the fire, the blazing fire, and imagining
that this offering is going to God. Sitting around a fire, fasting for
many days, doing certain rituals, certain mantras, repeating certain
scriptures, you can create a state of autohypnosis. You can be fooled by
yourself and you can think that you are reaching to God.</p><p><br></p><p>Saraha says: Those who really want to enter into God, they will have
to burn their inner fire – the outer fire won’t do. And those who really
want to attain, they will have to burn their own seeds of desire – rice
won’t do. And those who really want to attain, they will have to burn
their ego – butter won’t do. Butter is just the most essential part of
milk, the most purified part of milk. So is ego the most purified dream;
it is GHEE, purified butter. Offering GHEE to fire is not going to help.
You have to burn your inner fire.</p><p><br></p><p>And sexual energy moving upwards becomes fire. It becomes a flame. It
is fire! Even when it moves outwards, it gives birth to life; sex energy
is the most miraculous thing. It is through sex energy that life is
born. Life is fire: it is a function of fire. Without fire life could
not exist. Without the sun there would be no trees, no men, no birds, no
animals. It is transformed fire that becomes life.</p><p><br></p><p>While making love to a woman, the fire is going out. While moving
inward, the fire is going in. And when you throw your seeds of desire,
seeds of thought, seeds of ambition, seeds of greed into this fire, they
are burnt. And then, finally, you throw your ego – the most purified
dream – that too is burnt. This is real YAGNA, real ritual, real
sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>AS A BRAHMIN, WHO WITH RICE AND BUTTER MAKES A BURNT OFFERING IN
BLAZING FIRE</p><p>CREATING A VESSEL FOR NECTAR FROM CELESTIAL SPACE, TAKES THIS THROUGH
WISHFUL THINKING AS THE ULTIMATE.</p><p>And he thinks, through wishful thinking, that this is the ultimate.
The man who is making love to a woman and thinks that this is the
ultimate. is throwing into the outer fire in exactly the same way. He is
pouring into something outside. And so is the woman who thinks she is
making love or moving into a great space of bliss and benediction by
just making love to a man, just throwing out her fire.</p><p><br></p><p>The fire has to move inwards, then it gives a rebirth to you, it
rejuvenates you.</p><p><br></p><p>SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE
FONTANELLE STROKE THE UVULA WITH THE TONGUE IN A SORT OF COITION AND
CONFUSE</p><p>THAT WHICH FETTERS WITH WHAT GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL
THEMSELVES YOGIS.</p><p>And a very important thing: Just as I explained to you the map, you
have to remember that the VISUDDHA, the fifth CHAKRA, is in the throat.
VISUDDHA, the throat chakra, is the last point from which you can fall.
Up to that point there is a possibility of falling back. With the sixth
chakra – the third eye attained, there is no possibility of falling
back. You have gone beyond the point from which one can return. The
point of no return is the third eye. If you die at the third eye centre,
you will be born at the third eye centre. If you die at SAHASRAR, you
will not be born again. But if you are at the VISUDDHA, you will slip
back to the first, MULADHAR. In the next life you will have to start
from MULADHAR again.</p><p><br></p><p>So up to the fifth there is no certainty; there is promise, but no
certainty. Up to the fifth there is every possibility of falling back.
And one of the greatest possibilities that has helped many people in
India to fall back is, this sutra says, because</p><p><br></p><p>SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE
FONTANELLE...</p><p><br></p><p>You can create the inner heat; the flame starts moving upwards and it
comes to the throat. Then there arises a great desire to tickle the
throat with the tongue. Beware of it. In India they have devised great
techniques for tickling it with the tongue. They have even cut the roots
of the tongue so that the tongue becomes long and can easily move
backwards – you will find many yogis doing that. The tongue can move
backwards and it can tickle the fifth centre. That tickling is
masturbatory because the sex energy has come there.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as I told you, the fifth chakra, VISUDDHA, is male. When the
male energy comes to the throat, your throat becomes almost a genital
organ – of more superiority, of more finesse, than the genital organ.
Just a little tickle with the tongue and you enjoy greatly. But that is
masturbatory, and once you start doing that... And it is very, very
great pleasure. Sex is nothing compared to it – remember it – sex is
just nothing compared to it. Tickling with your own tongue... you can
enjoy it so much. So in Yoga there are methods.</p><p>Saraha is making it clear that no TANTRIKA should do that. It is a
deception and a great failure because the energy has come up to the
fifth, and now the desire arises to tickle it – that is the last
desire.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can keep yourself alert and can move beyond that desire, then
you will reach to the sixth centre, AJNA, otherwise you will start
falling back. That is the last temptation. In fact. in Tantra that is
the temptation which you can say that Jesus had when Satan comes and
tempts him, or Buddha had when Mara comes and tempts him. This is the
last temptation, the last effort of your desire-mind, the last effort of
your dream world, the last effort of your ego before it is lost utterly.
It makes a last effort to tempt you. And the temptation is really great:
it is very difficult to avoid it. It is so pleasurable, infinitely more
pleasurable than sex pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>When people think that sex pleasure is the ultimate, what to say
about this pleasure? And it loses no energy. In sex you have to lose
energy, you feel frustrated, tired, weak. But if you tickle your sex
energy when it has come to the throat, there is no loss of energy. And
you can go on tickling the whole day. That’s what Delgado has attained
through mechanical devices.</p><p><br></p><p>SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE KINDLED THE INNER HEAT AND RAISED IT TO THE

CONFUSE</p><p>THAT WHICH FETTERS WITH THAT WHICH GIVES RELEASE...</p><p><br></p><p>This is again SAMSARA... falling back into SAMSARA...</p><p><br></p><p>... AND CONFUSE</p><p><br></p><p>THAT WHICH FETTERS WITH THAT WHICH GIVES RELEASE, IN PRIDE WILL CALL
THEMSELVES YOGIS.</p><p>But they are not – they have missed. In fact, the right word for them
is YOGABRASHTA, ‘one who has fallen from Yoga.’</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth centre is the most dangerous centre. You cannot tickle any
other centre – that is the danger of it. You cannot tickle SWADHISTAN,
you cannot tickle MANIPURA, you cannot tickle ANAHATA. They are beyond
you: there is no way to reach them and tickle them. You cannot tickle
the third eye. The only point which can be tickled is VISUDDHA, your
throat centre, because it is available. The mouth is open it is
available. And the easiest way is to turn your tongue backwards and
tickle it.</p><p><br></p><p>In Yoga treatises you will find it described as something great. It
is not. Beware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the inner map of Tantra alchemy. The energy can start moving
at any time; you just have to bring to your love-making a little
meditation, a little inwardness. Tantra is not against lovemaking,
remember. Let it be repeated again and again. It is all for it, but not
just for it. It is the first rung of the ladder, a seven-runged
ladder.</p><p>Man is a ladder. The first rung is sex and the seventh rung is
SAHASRAR – SAMADHI. The first rung joins you with SAMSARA, the world,
and the seventh rung joins you with NIRVANA, the beyond. With the first
rung, you move in a vicious circle of birth and death again and again;
it is repetitive. With the seventh rung, you go beyond birth and death.
Life eternal is yours... the Kingdom of God.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

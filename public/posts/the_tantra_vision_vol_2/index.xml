The Tantra Map
1 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
FOR THE DELIGHTS OF KISSING THE DELUDED CRAVE DECLARING IT TO BE THE ULTIMATELY REAL –
LIKE A MAN WHO LEAVES HIS HOUSE AND STANDING AT THE DOOR ASKS (A WOMAN) FOR REPORTS OF SENSUAL DELIGHTS. THE STIRRING OF BIOTIC FORCES IN THE HOUSE OF NOTHINGNESS HAS GIVEN ARTIFICIAL RISE TO</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Just a remembrance
10 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER I LEAVE YOUR LECTURE I QUICKLY BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE IDEALS YOU PUT FORWARD IN YOUR LECTURE?
What are you talking about? Ideals? That’s exactly what I go on destroying. I am not putting any ideals before you. I am not giving you any fantasies about the future.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Freedom is a higher Value
2 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
THE LOVE IN ME IS DEPENDENT ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME I SEE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT BEING COMPLETE WITHIN. WHAT HAPPENS TO LOVE IF THERE IS NOTHING AND NOBODY TO RECOGNISE AND TASTE IT? WHO ARE YOU WITHOUT DISCIPLES?
The first thing: There are two kinds of love.</description>

Breaking the four Seals
3 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
AS HIGHER AWARENESS, THEY TEACH WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE WITHIN. WHAT FETTERS THEM THEY WILL CALL LIBERATION.
A GLASS TRINKET COLOURED GREEN, TO THEM IS A (PRICELESS) EMERALD, DELUDED, THEY KNOW NOT A GEM
FROM WHAT THEY THINK IT SHOULD BE.
THEY TAKE COPPER TO BE GOLD. BOUND BY DISCURSIVE THOUGHT THEY THINK THESE THOUGHTS TO HE ULTIMATE REALITY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Trust cannot be betrayed
4 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHY AM I ALWAYS INTERESTED IN MARRIED WOMEN?
There is nothing special about it, it is a very common disease which exists in almost epidemic proportions. But there are reasons to it.
Millions of people, both men and women, are more interested in the married person. First, the unmarried person shows that nobody has yet desired him or her; the married person shows that somebody has desired him.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
From Nothing to nothing
5 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
NONMEMORY IS CONVENTION’S TRUTH
AND MIND WHICH HAS BECOME NO-MIND (IS ULTIMATE TRUTH). THIS IS FULFILLMENT, THIS IS THE HIGHEST GOOD.
FRIENDS, OF THIS HIGHEST GOOD, BECOME AWARE. IN NONMEMORY IS MIND ABSORBED;
JUST THIS IS EMOTIONALITY PERFECT AND PURE.
IT IS UNPOLLUTED BY THE GOOD OR BAD OF WORLDLINESS</description>

I am enough alone
6 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY VOICE WHEN YOU SPEAK TO ME? WHAT IS THE GAME?
The question is from Somendra.
When you are really in communion with me, you cannot speak. When you are really listening to me, you will lose your voice because in that moment I am your voice.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Intelligence is Meditation
7 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
MIND, INTELLECT, AND THE FORMED CONTENTS OF THAT MIND ARE IT, SO TOO ARE THE WORLD AND ALL THAT SEEMS FROM IT TO DIFFER, ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE SENSED, AND THE PERCEIVER,
ALSO DULLNESS, AVERSION, DESIRE, AND ENLIGHTENMENT.
LIKE A LAMP THAT SHINES IN THE DARKNESS OF SPIRITUAL UNKNOWING, IT REMOVES OBSCURATIONS OF A MIND</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Love makes no shadow
8 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
YESTERDAY WHEN YOU SPOKE OF INTELLIGENCE BECOMING MEDITATION, THERE WAS SUCH A RUSH INSIDE, IT FELT AS IF MY HEART WOULD EXPLODE. IT WAS AS IF YOU HAD SAID SOMETHING I’D BEEN WAITING TO HEAR. CAN YOU ELABORATE?
The question is from Krishna Prem.
Intelligence is intrinsic to life.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
No-Mind is the Door
9 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall
ONCE IN THE REALM THAT’S FULL OF JOY THE SEEING MIND BECOMES ENRICHED
AND THEREBY FOR THIS AND THAT MOST USEFUL;
EVEN WHEN IT RUNS AFTER OBJECTS IT IS NOT ALIENATED FROM ITSELF. THE BUDS OF JOY AND PLEASURE
AND THE LEAVES OF GLORY GROW. IF NOTHING FLOWS OUT ANYWHERE THE BLISS UNSPEAKABLE WILL FRUIT.</description>

Ideals? That’s exactly what I go on destroying. I am not putting any ideals before you. I am not giving you any fantasies about the future. I am not giving you any future at all, because the future is a trick to postpone the present. It is a trick to avoid yourself, a way to escape from yourself.\nDesire is a deception, and ideals create desires. I am not giving you any ‘should’ or any ‘should not’ either positive or negative. I am simply telling you to drop all ideals and BE.\nBut I can understand your question. You make an ideal out of it. You start thinking ‘How should I be?’ You start thinking ‘What should I do to be?’ I am trying to take away the ideals and you make an ideal out of it – how to drop all ideals. You misunderstand me, you misinterpret me. You don’t hear what I am saying, you go on hearing what I am not saying at all. Listen more carefully.\nIt has always happened. We don’t know what Buddha said exactly, because the people who reported were people just like you. We don’t know what Jesus has said, because the people who reported were, again, people like you. The report certainly says what THEY HEARD, but it doesn’t say anything about what HE SAID. And these can be diametrically opposite things.\nI speak a totally different language. You reduce it to some other thing – to your language. You come in and you start interfering.\nYou ask: WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER I LEAVE YOUR LECTURE I QUICKLY BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF...?\nYou become disillusioned with yourself because you don’t know who you are, and you have a certain image of yourself. That image is not you, that image cannot be you – that image is d mind construction. You have created an image of yourself: you think this is what you are, and when you listen to me and I start pulling your legs, you become disillusioned. Your image is broken, your image is not left intact as it was.\nBut YOU are not broken. In fact, the image is not allowing you to have space, it is not allowing you to be. The image has to be thrown out so you can have enough space to grow. The image has become too huge, too powerful. It has taken over your whole house and you are living in the porch. It does not allow you to come in. And the image which you have made out of ideals goes on condemning you: the creation goes on condemning the creator.\nLook at the foolishness of it, the ridiculousness of it. You create an image – very beautiful, naturally, when you are creating you create a beautiful image – and then, because of that image, you start looking ugly in comparison. You create a very, very great image that you are a saint, and then you find yourself doing things which are not very saintly. Now you feel condemned. The image is yours, and against the image your act looks stinking.….\nWhat I am saying here, what Saraha is saying to the king is that the image has to be completely dropped. The moment you drop the image and you forget about the image, then what is right and what is wrong? Then who is a sinner and who is a saint? Then you don’t have anything to compare with. Then, suddenly, you are at ease. The comparison disappears... and the condemnation disappears. The comparison disappears... and the ego disappears – the ego of the sinner and the ego of the saint. Without the ideal there can exist no ego at all. It exists through the ideal, via the ideal. The ideal is a MUST for the ego.\nEither you think that you are a sinner – you create an ego, an identity, or you think you are a saint, then you create an ego. But both can only come into existence through the ideal. If the ideal is not there, who are you? Saint or sinner? Good or bad? Ugly or beautiful? Who are you? You are simply yourself, without any judgement, without any justification, without any condemnation. You are simply there in your reality: that’s what I am calling BEING.\nNow you must be becoming disillusioned again and again, because your grip on the image becomes a little loosened. Whenever your grip on the image is a little loosened, you become afraid.\nThe ideal is creating an illusion, and whenever I start taking the ideal away, you feel disillusioned. Be utterly disillusioned, and don’t create the illusion again – the illusion of the ideal. And then see how life attains to a sublime silence. Then see how tremendous acceptance arises, how great benediction simply surrounds you, for no reason at all. It is yours – just for the asking. You are not to do anything. You are acceptable to God as you are. This is my whole message, and this is whole of Tantra’s: YOU ARE ACCEPTED AS YOU ARE!\nBut you go on rejecting yourself. The ideal makes it possible for you to reject. The ideal makes it possible for you to be unkind to yourself, cruel, aggressive – to become a self-torturer.\nMy effort here is to help you to become sane. This idealism creates insanity. It has turned the whole earth into a madhouse. And you say:... I BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE IDEALS YOU PUT FORWARD IN YOUR LECTURE.\nWhat are you talking about? What ideals? I am not saying ‘You should do this.’ I am not saying ‘You should be like this.’ I am simply saying ‘Whatsoever you are, BE.’ I am trying to take all becoming from you. I am trying to help you see the point that you are already at home; you have never to go anywhere, and you have nowhere to go. It is already the case – God is showering on you SAMADHI is already the case. Wherever you are, you are in NIRVANA. This is enlightenment: this moment – with no ideals, with no desires, with nowhere to go; this moment – utterly relaxed in it, here-now, is the moment of God, the moment of truth.\nBut you listen to me and you start parroting. You listen to me and you start repeating words. You don’t follow the meaning; you follow the letter and not the spirit.\nI have heard...\nA certain tough, old sea captain bought a young parrot at a foreign port – being assured it was a marvelous learner – and hung it on the bridge. Coming back through the Bay of Biscay, a fearful black cloud came over, and the skipper remarked ‘It’s gone bloody dark at all once!’\nSoon after, the cloud burst in a dreadful torrent, and the captain said to the mate ‘It’s bloody hissing down!’ The storm got worse, the ship lurched and developed a leak, so that one of the men called up ‘What shall we do to be saved?’\nHe got the reply ‘Pump, you lousy shower! Pump, you poxed-up beggars, pump!’\nThe ship and all were lost; a wet, swearing, washed-up parrot alone survived, and after some adventures, finished up with a dear spinster, who was just expecting the vicar. As a precaution she threw a cloth over the cage, so that the vicar was greeted with ‘It’s bloody dark all at once!’ The lady was livid, and put the parrot immediately under the cold water tap, at which he shrieked ‘It’s bloody hissing down!’\n‘No, no, Miss Fantight! You mustn’t be so cruel to God’s creatures, rather bring him to church on the Sabbath, and expose him to good influences.’ This was done and the parrot behaved like an angel, even joining in the hymns. The vicar, beaming at his own success, rose to announce his text. ‘Brethren, today we ask: What shall we do to be saved?’ and down the aisles rang the parrot’s clear tones ‘Pump, you lousy shower! Pump, you poxed-up beggars, pump!’\nDon’t become parrots. You can repeat what I am saying, but that is not the point at all. Understand what I am saying. Repetition will create troubles for you. A slight change of tone, of emphasis, a slight change of a single comma, a full point, and all is lost. Listen to the meaning.\nAnd there are different ways of listening. One way is: listening from the mind then you memorise. And you have been taught how to listen through the mind, because all your schools, colleges,\nuniversities teach you how to cram. They give you a wrong notion: as if memory were knowledge. Memory is not knowledge; memory is simply parroting. You will know the letter, you will know the word, but it will be empty – inside there will be no significance, no meaning in it. And that word is dangerous which has no meaning in it.\nThere is another way to listen, and that is from the heart. Listen through the heart. Listen as if you were not listening to an argument, but to a song. Listen as if you were not listening to a philosophy, but to a poem. Listen as you listen to music. Watch me as you watch a dancer. Feel me as you feel a lover. Then the letter will be there, it will be used as a vehicle, but it will not be the real thing. The vehicle will be forgotten, and the meaning will enter into your heart and will remain there. And it will change your being, it will change your vision of life.\nQuestion 2\nHOW DID TANTRA GROW OUT OF BUDDHISM WHICH, AS FAR AS I KNOW, VIEWS SEX AS A HINDRANCE TO MEDITATION?\nIt is related to the first question.\nWhat Buddha said must have been misunderstood. Yes, he said that to go into meditation one has to go beyond sex. Now, the people who heard him thought he was against sex, naturally so – he said you have to go beyond sex. They started thinking ‘Sex must be a hindrance then, otherwise why do you have to go beyond sex?’ They started fighting with sex rather than going beyond it; their whole emphasis changed. They started fighting with sex, and Buddhism became one of the most ascetic religions of the world.\nCan’t you observe his tremendous grace in the statue of Buddha or in his pictures – can it come out of ascetism? Is it possible that this beautiful being, this graceful face, this love, this compassion can come out of ascetism? Ascetics are people who torture themselves; and when a person tortures himself he starts torturing others too with a vengeance. When a person is in misery himself, he cannot see anybody else being happy; he starts destroying others’ happiness too. That’s what your so-called MAHATMAS go on doing: they can’t see you happy, so whenever you are happy, they immediately come and say ‘There must be something wrong, a happy person means a sinner’\nYou can observe it in yourself also, because down the centuries your so-called MAHATMAS and saints have conditioned you to feel guilt whenever you feel happy. Whenever you are miserable, everything is okay. But if you are feeling great joy, you start feeling a little uneasiness – somehow it doesn’t seem to be right. Have you not watched it in yourself? From where does it come? Happiness... and not right? And misery is ‘okay.’\nSomething very antagonistic to life – very life-negative, very life-denying – has entered into the bloodstream of humanity. And it has come through those so-called ascetics. These ascetics are neurotic people: they are masochists, they torture themselves. Their only joy is in creating more and more misery.\nBuddha is not a masochist – cannot be. Buddha looks so beautiful, so joyful, so happy, so tremendously blissful. Those who were hearing him have misunderstood somewhere. Yes, he\nsays go beyond sex. One has to go beyond it because it is only the first rung of the ladder. But he is not saying go against it. Going beyond is not necessarily going against. In fact, the contrary is the case. If you go against sex you will never be able to go beyond it. Going beyond comes only through going through.\nYou have to understand sex, you have to befriend sex.\nSomething, somewhere, got misinterpreted. Saraha comes as a right interpretation of Buddha. And Saraha must have watched what a calamity had happened to thousands of people who were following Buddha: rather than going beyond sex, they had become obsessed with it. When you are continuously fighting with something you become obsessed with it.\nYou can watch it: a person who believes in fasting becomes obsessed with food. Mahatma Gandhi was obsessed with food, continuously thinking about food – what to eat and what not to eat. As if that seemed to be the only important thing in life – what to eat and what not to eat. Ordinary people are less obsessed; they are not thinking about it too much. Do a three-day fast, and think about what goes on in your mind. You will think about food continuously. Now, going beyond food is good, but fasting cannot be the way, because fasting creates an obsession with food. How can it be the way to go beyond it? If you really want to go beyond food, you have to eat rightly. You have to eat the right food, you have to eat it in a right way at the right time. You have to find out what suits your body, what is nourishing.\nYes, that will take you beyond food: you will never think about food. When the body is nourished, you don’t think about food. So many people think about food because in some way or other they are fasting. You will be surprised when I say that. You may be eating too much ice-cream – that is a sort of fast because it is not nourishing; you are simply throwing rotten things inside you. They don’t satisfy: they fill you but they don’t fulfil you. You feel stuffed but not contented.\nWrong food will create discontent, and your hunger will not be satisfied because hunger needs nourishment not food. Remember, hunger is for nourishment NOT for food! And hunger does not bother much about taste. The basic thing is whether it suits your body, whether it gives your body the needed energy. If it gives the needed energy then it is okay. If taste goes with right nourishment, you will be tremendously satisfied.\nAnd remember, I am not against taste, I am all for it. But just taste cannot be nourishing. And just food without taste is unintelligent, stupid. When you can have both, why not? An intelligent person will find nourishing food, tasteful food. It is not such a big problem. Man can go to the moon and cannot find a nourishing food for himself? Man has done miracles and cannot satisfy his hunger? This does not seem to be the right situation. No, man has not looked into it.\nThere are people who believe in fasts – they destroy the body. And then there are people who go on stuffing any rubbish – they destroy the body. Both are in the same boat: both are fasting, and both are continuously obsessed. One is obsessed through indulgence, the other is oppressed through repression. Just in the middle is transcendence.\nSo is the case with sex, and so is the case with everything in life.\nSaraha must have become aware that the people who said Buddha had said to go beyond sex, were not going beyond at all. Rather, they were becoming more and more obsessed with it and falling deeper into its mire.\nThere was a young nun who went to the Mother Superior in some distress, and after a great deal of beating about the bush, admitted she was pregnant.\n‘Who was it? Who was this wicked, wicked man?’ said the Mother Superior.\n‘Oh, Reverend Mother, I wouldn’t commit a carnal offence with a man!’ exclaimed the nun.\n‘Well, it wasn’t fathered by a woman, was it?’ said the Mother Superior, beginning to lose her temper. ‘No, indeed, Blessed Mother, but it was fathered by one of the Holy Angels.’ SIMPER, SIMPER. ‘Holy Angels what is this nonsense?’\n‘Yes, Blessed Mother, he came down to me in the middle of the night in my sleep, and when I asked who he was, he said “Saint Michael” and showed me his name on his vest to prove it.’\nOnce you are against something you will find some ways to get out of it. You will find some back door. Man is cunning. If you repress something, the cunning mind will find some other way. That’s why you dream about sex. Your saints dream too much about sex; they have to. In the day they can deny, but in the night... When they are conscious they can repress, but when they are asleep... then, in the dream, sex takes great, fantastic colours; it becomes psychedelic. And then in the morning they feel guilty, and because they feel guilty they repress more. And when they repress more, the next night they have an even more beautiful dream of sex – or horrible, according to them. It depends on how you interpret it whether it is beautiful or horrible.\nA ‘difficult’ schoolgirl of fifteen was sent to the psychologist, who asked her a number of very personal questions. He was sure that sex lay at the bottom of the trouble, and asked her ‘Do you suffer from sexy or erotic dreams?’\n‘Certainly not!’ ‘Are you sure?’\n‘Quite sure’ said the girl ‘in fact, I enjoy them.’\nIt depends on you whether you call them beautiful or horrible. In the night they are beautiful, in the morning they become horrible. In the night you enjoy them, in the morning you suffer. And there is a vicious circle created, and your so-called saint goes on moving in this vicious circle: the day he suffers, the night he enjoys, the day he suffers, the night he enjoys – and he is torn between these two.\nAnd if you look deep down into yourself you will find it easily. Whatsoever you repress will remain there, you cannot get rid of it. The repressed remains, only the expressed disappears. The\nexpressed evaporates, the repressed remains and not only remains, but it becomes more and more powerful. As time passes by, it becomes more and more powerful.\nSaraha must have looked at what had happened after two hundred years of Buddha – wrong interpretations, and people were almost obsessed with sex. Out of that obsession of the Buddhist monks and nuns, Tantra was born as a rebellion a rebellion against Buddhism, not against Buddha. Through that rebellion, Saraha brought Buddha’s spirit back. Yes, one has to transcend sex, but the transcendence happens through understanding.\nTantra believes in understanding. Understand a thing totally and you are free of its clutches. Anything not understood rightly will remain as a hangover.\nSo you are right. You ask: HOW DID TANTRA GROW OUT OF BUDDHISM WHICH, AS FAR\nAS I KNOW, VIEWS SEX AS A HINDRANCE TO MEDITATION? Precisely because of that. It is a rebellion against Buddhism, and it is for Buddha. It goes against the followers, but not against the Master. The followers were carrying the letter, and Saraha brings back the spirit.\nSaraha is a reincarnation of the same enlightenment as Buddha was. Saraha is a Buddha. Question 3\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN ‘THE HONEYMOON IS OVER’?\n‘The honeymoon is over’ means that the fantasy part of your love is finished. Honeymoon is a fantasy: it is a projection, it is not reality. It is projected dream. ‘The honeymoon is over’ means that the dream is over, and now starts the marriage. The higher the honeymoon, the greater will be the disillusionment. That’s why love-marriages don’t succeed. Marriages succeed, but not love- marriages.\nThe love-marriage cannot succeed. That failure is intrinsic to it. A love-marriage is a fantasy, and the fantasy cannot win over reality. There is only one way to remain in fantasy and to remain always in a honeymoon, and that is to never meet your beloved. Then it is possible: you can have it for your whole life – but never meet the beloved, never meet your lover.\nThe greatest lovers in history were those who were not allowed to meet: Laila and Majnun, Shiri and Farihad – these are the great lovers. They were not allowed: the society created so many obstacles that they remained always in a state of honeymoon. It is just like when food is there but you are not allowed to eat it, so the fantasy continues. If you are allowed to eat it, then the fantasy disappears.\nLove-marriage cannot succeed. What do I mean by ‘not succeed’? In the sense that people want it to succeed, it cannot succeed. Marriage is successful, but then there is no love. That’s why in the past all the societies of the world, out of experience, decided in favour of marriage and against love. Indian society is one of the most ancient societies of the world. It has existed for at least five thousand years, or more than that. Out of this long experience India decided for marriage without love – because a marriage without love can succeed. Because it has no honeymoon part in it, from the very beginning it is very realistic, down-to-earth. It does not allow any dreaming.\nIn India, the partners themselves are not allowed to choose. The boy is not allowed to choose the girl, the girl is not allowed to choose the boy; the parents choose. Naturally they are more down-to- earth, more experienced. And naturally, they cannot fall in love. They think of other things: finance, prestige, respectability, family. They think of thousands of things, but they don’t think of one thing – love. Love is not brought into the matter at all. They go to the astrologer; they ask the astrologer and inquire into everything but not love. Love has not to become an ingredient in it. Two unknown people – the man and the woman are put together by the parents, by the society – are left together. Naturally, when you live with a person, a sort of liking arises. But that liking is just like the liking you have for your sister; it is not love. Because you were born into a certain family, you have not chosen your sister, neither have you chosen your brother: they were not chosen by you. It was accidental that you were born to the same parents. So you have a certain liking. Living together for long, a thousand and one associations, and one starts liking – or disliking – but it is never love and never hate. It never goes to extremes, it is very balanced.\nThe same is the case with marriage, arranged marriage. The husband and wife live together and, by and by, they start feeling for each other.\nAnother thing the society does: the society does not allow any extramarital sex, so naturally the husband HAS to make love to the wife, and the wife HAS to make love to the husband. If you are allowed only one food to eat and no other food is allowed, how long can you wait? You have to eat it. This is the trick of the society. If extramarital sex were allowed, then there is every possibility that the husband may not want to make love to the wife, the wife may not like to make love to the husband. Just out of hunger, and with no other outlet, they start making love to each other. Out of desperation, they start becoming associated with each other. Then children are born... and more ties: religious, social ties. Then the children and the responsibility... and the family starts rolling.\nLove-marriage is bound to fail, because the love-marriage is a poetic phenomenon. You fall in love and you start dreaming about the woman or the man, and you reach to a peak, a climax of dreams. Those dreams continue until you meet the woman, until you meet the man. Then you come together, you become satisfied. Those dreams start disappearing. Now, for the first time, you start seeing the other as he or she IS.\nWhen you see your wife as she is, when you see your husband as he is, the honeymoon is over. This is the meaning of the phrase ‘the honeymoon is over’. And it does not happen only in marriage, it happens in many sorts of relationships. It happens here with me.\nYou come to me and you can have a honeymoon, you can start fantasizing about me. I have no part in it, I am not a party to it. It is something that you do all alone. But you start fantasizing, desiring: This is going to happen and that is going to happen, and Osho will do this and Osho will do that. Then, one day, the honeymoon will be over. In fact, I always like to wait till the honeymoon is over, then I start working, never before it, because I don’t want to become a party to your fantasies. I only start working when I see that now the honeymoon is over and you are back on the earth. Now something real can be done. In fact, I always like to give sannyas when the honeymoon is over. To give sannyas during the honeymoon is dangerous, very dangerous, because the moment the honeymoon is over, you will start feeling against me, you will start rebelling against sannyas, you will start reacting. It is better to wait.\nIn every relationship – in friendship, in a Master-disciple relationship – in any kind of relationship\nthere is a part which is of fantasy. That fantasy is just your mind: repressed desires are flying into dreams. In a better world, with more understanding, marriage will disappear, and with marriage will disappear the honeymoon too.\nNow listen.\nThere have been societies: for example, the Hindu society – it has killed the honeymoon by killing love, and only marriage exists. In America, they are killing marriage and saving love – the honeymoon and only the honeymoon exists, not marriage. It is disappearing.\nBut to me, both are deep down in conspiracy. The honeymoon can exist only if there is some repression, otherwise there is nothing to project. And if there is something to project, then love fails again and again. Then the social PUNDITS come in and they start making arrangements for marriage, because it fails. It drives people crazy, and does not help them to live their lives. It makes them suicidal. It makes them neurotic, schizophrenic, hysterical. So the social PUNDIT has to come in, the priest and the politician have to come in and arrange for marriage, because love is too dangerous. And that’s how the society has moved between these two polarities.\nSometimes, when people get fed up with marriage – as they have got fed up in America – they start thinking of love. When people get fed up with love as sooner or later they will find; they are already – then they start moving towards marriage. Both are polarities of the same game.\nTo me, a different kind of society is needed where marriage and romance disappear. Marriage disappears, because to make two people live together by legal enforcement is immoral. To force two people to live together when they don’t want to live together is against nature and against God.\nNinety-nine per cent of social diseases will disappear if people are not forced. Listen to this:\nA man went to his solicitor and said ‘I am very rich, so money is no object, but I want to be rid of my wife, who is a bitch, without being had for murder. So tell me what to do.’\n‘Buy her a strong horse and it may throw her.’\nA month later the man came back and said his wife was now the best horsewoman in the district... ‘Try’ said the lawyer ‘buying her a mini and send her up the mountains in it.’\nThe man did this, but she drove like Sterling Moss, putting in danger everybody but herself. The husband told the solicitor he was desperate...\n‘Then buy her a big Jaguar.’\nThe man was back in a week, delighted. ‘Name your fee’ he said ‘it worked.’ ‘What happened then?’\n‘Well, when she opened the cage door to feed the jaguar, it bit her bloody head off!’\nMarriage creates a thousand and one complexities and solves nothing. Yes, it succeeds – it succeeds in making people slaves. It succeeds in destroying people’s individuality. Don’t you see it all around? An unmarried man has a certain individuality, and a married man starts losing his individuality. He becomes more and more of a type. The unmarried woman has a joy, something flowing. The married woman becomes dull, uninterested, bored. This is ugly – to force people into boredom. People are here to be happy, people are here to enjoy and celebrate. This is ugly!\nMarriage has to go. But if you choose fantasy and love, you will again fall into the same trap of marriage. Because love never succeeds – never succeeds the way marriage succeeds financially, security-wise, for children, for society, for this and that. Love never succeeds as marriage succeeds.\nSo love is bound to create other kinds of troubles. And love exists because of repressed desires. When marriage disappears and desires are not repressed, love will disappear automatically.\nA real society of human beings will not know anything of marriage and will not know anything of the honeymoon. It will know only of joy, of sharing with people. As long as you can share, good; if you cannot share, good-bye. Marriage disappears, and with it disappears the ugly divorce. Marriage disappears, and with it disappears the fantasy of the honeymoon.\nWhen you are free to love, to meet, to be with people, the honeymoon will disappear. Laila and Majnun, and Shiri and Farihad, will not be possible – nobody is obstructing the way. You can meet any woman and you can meet any man. Whomsoever you desire and whosoever desires you – nobody else is barring the way. Then what is the need for fantasy? All kinds of food are available, and yet whatsoever is standing there is like a policeman or a magistrate or a priest and making you afraid and scared that if you eat this food you will go to hell. If you eat this food, only then can you go to heaven, and that food you don’t want to eat; and that food leads you to heaven, and the food that you want to eat leads you to hell. Anything that gives you joy leads to hell, and anything that makes you miserable leads to heaven. When nobody is standing in between you and your desires, when desire is free, there will be no repression.\nWithout repression the honeymoon will disappear. The honeymoon is a by-product: it exists with marriage. It is like bait. You go fishing, you use bait. Honeymoon is a bait: it takes you into marriage. That’s why women are very, very insistent about marriage – because they know. They are more down-to-earth, more empirical than men. Men have remained dreamers, they think of stars and moons. And women only laugh at their ridiculous desires. The woman knows – she is very down-to-earth-she knows that within ten, twelve, fifteen days, two to three weeks, the honeymoon will disappear. Then what? She insists on marriage.\nA man was asking his woman – he was in love -and he asked her in the night ‘Love or something?’ And the woman said ‘Marriage or nothing.’\nHe asked again ‘Love or something?’ And she said ‘Marriage or NOTHING.’\nLove is not reliable. It comes and goes; it is a whim, a mood. If love remains, that simply means repression is still there.\nThen, in a different society there will be joy. ‘Love’ will not be so important a word as ‘delight’, ‘celebration’. Two people want to share their energies; if they are both willing, then there will be no hindrance. There will be only one limitation, that if the other is not willing, then it is finished. Then it never starts. All other limitations should be dropped.\nAnd now science has made it possible for the problem of children to be very easily solved. In the old days people were not so fortunate. You are more fortunate. The problem of children can be solved. You can stay with a woman until the day you think ‘Now we have lived together long enough and my love, my joy with the woman goes on increasing, my joy with the man goes on increasing, and now there is no possibility of our becoming separate.’ You have found your soul-mate. The day you feel that, you can have children, otherwise there is no need to have children.\nAnd in a better society, children should belong to the communes. The family has to disappear. There should be communes of people: a commune of painters, where painters – painter men and painter women – live together and enjoy their togetherness; a commune of poets, a commune of carpenters, a commune of goldsmiths: communes of different kinds of people who live together, rather than families.\nThe family has been a calamity. It is better when many people live together who possess everything in common and who share their love with each other.\nBut there should not be any restriction. Love should never become a duty – only then is it joyful. The moment it becomes a duty, it is dead, heavyweight. And it creates a thousand and one problems which cannot be solved directly. That is the whole situation in the world. You can go to the psychoanalyst, you can come to a Master, you can meditate, you can do this and that – but your basic problem is not touched.\nYour basic problem remains somehow connected with your sex energy, and you go on tackling it somewhere else. You go on cutting the leaves, pruning the leaves, and you never cut the root. People are miserable because people are fed up with each other. People are sad because they don’t enjoy the company of each other. People are simply burdened: they are doing their duties, the love is not there.\nMarriage and the honeymoon both come in the same package; they both have to go. Then there can be a non-repressed humanity, a fully expressive humanity, a fully expressive human being who knows nothing except joy, and who decides according to joy. Joy should become the criterion: that’s what Tantra is all about. Joy should become the criterion.\nQuestion 4\nI LOVE MA PREM SAVYA, I WANT HER TO BE WITH ME UNTIL I DIE. IS THIS A GOOD LAST DESIRE?\nThe question is from Prem Aniket.\nThe first thing: no desire is the last if you are still living. No desire is the last desire if you are still living. Who knows about the next moment? And how can you manage to know the next moment’?\nHow long you have known Savya? A few weeks. Before those few weeks, you had not even dreamt about her. If this can happen, this can happen again. After three weeks, you may meet another woman. Until you are dead no desire is the last desire. Each desire creates another desire: desire is a continuum. Only two things, death or enlightenment, stop desires. And certainly neither of them has happened yet, Aniket; neither death has happened nor enlightenment.\nIt is good to understand desire. Each desire brings in new desires. One desire creates ten desires. It is just like out of one small seed comes a big tree, thousands of branches, and millions of leaves. Out of one desire, the seed, many desires arise.\nYou cannot say anything about the future – you should not say – the future remains open. This is one of the greatest efforts of man – ridiculous, but man goes on making it. One: he wants to reform the past which cannot be done. Whatsoever has happened has happened, there is no way to redo it; you cannot even touch it here and there. You cannot make it better, you cannot make it worse. It is simply beyond you. It has happened, it has become actual; and that which has become cannot even be touched. The past is finished; it is complete the way it is. You cannot go back and you cannot rearrange it. It is good. Otherwise, if you could rearrange the past, if you could go back you would go mad.\nThen you would never come to the present again; the past is so long. It is good that the doors of the past are closed. But man, the stupid mind of man goes on thinking of reforming, reformulating, doing something here and there. Don’t you think about it sometimes: you had not said it, and you start thinking what would have been better; you had not done it – what would.have been better? And in your fantasy you try to say that and do that. But you are simply wasting time – now nothing can be done, it has slipped out of your hands.\nThe past cannot be reformed, and the future cannot be predicted. That too, man goes on doing – he wants to predict the future. The future is that which has not happened. The future remains open: openness is what the future is. The future is indeterminate; it is not actual, it is only probable. Nothing is certain about the future. There is no certainty about the future. But man is foolish. Again he goes to the astrologers, consults the I CHING, tarot cards, shadow readers. Man is so foolish that he tries to find ways somehow so that he can know beforehand what the future will be. But if you can know about it beforehand, it is already past, it is no longer the future. Only the past can be known, the future remains unknown.\nThat is the intrinsic quality of the future – unknownness. All is possible and nothing is certain – that’s what future is. All has happened, nothing more can happen – that’s what past is. And the present is just a passage from the actual to the potential, from the closed to the open, from the dead to the alive.\nNow, you ask: IS THIS A GOOD LAST DESIRE?\nYou would like that it should be your last desire, but then you would have to commit suicide, either actually or metaphorically. You will have to commit suicide if you want it to be your last desire. Either\ngo and jump in front of a train, or into the sea, or into an abyss – actually commit suicide – then you can have this as the last desire. Or psychologically commit suicide, which is what many have done. Don’t look at any other woman again. Close your eyes, become afraid. Cling to whomsoever you love and don’t go here, there, astray. Don’t even think, don’t even dream... that is psychological suicide. But in both ways you will not be able to live, because you will not have any future to live. It you really want to live and you want to live, in fact, that’s what you are asking: you want to live with Savya – to live you have to be alive.\nDon’t think in terms of ‘the last desire’. And why, why would you like it to be the last? Why can’t you share your energies some day with some other women? Why be so miserly? Why be so inhuman? Are not other women as divine as Savya? Has not God. appeared in many, many forms, millions of forms around you? Why cling to one form? Why this clinging?\nThis clinging comes out of repression, because you have repressed your desires. Then one day you find a woman who is loving towards you and you cling. You are afraid to lose her, because you know all those long nights when you were alone. If now this woman goes, again you will be alone. Now this woman is afraid of her loneliness herself; she clings to you. She is afraid that some day you may move towards somebody else; you may not look towards her, and she will be left alone. ’Long have been those nights of loneliness, now no more. We have found each other. We should cling to each other. We should possess each other and we should guard each other, so nobody goes anywhere.\nBut out of this guarding look what has happened: people are bored. You want a lover not a guard; you want a beloved not a jailer. You want to flow, not to be imprisoned. Look at the contradictory desire: you want to live and love, but whatsoever you do disturbs your love, destroys your love, creates hindrances to the flow. You want to love and live, and you want to be joyously alive, but whatsoever you do goes against it, is against it.\nWhy should this be the last desire? I am not saying that this should not be the last desire, remember, don’t misunderstand me. I am not saying THIS should not be the last desire. I am saying simply saying, WHY should it be the last desire? If it happens that you remain together, if it happens that you never find a more beautiful woman, a more loving woman – good, you are fortunate. If it happens that Savya never finds another man who is more loving, more alive than you – fortunate. But if she finds a more loving man who can make her more joyful, who can bring her to greater peaks of ecstasy, then what? Should she cling to you? Then she is going against herself. Why should she cling to you?\nAnd if she clings to you, she will never be able to forgive you, because it will be because of you she had to miss that ecstatic man; she will always be angry with you. That’s why wives are angry, husbands are angry. That anger has a natural base to it. The anger is not about mundane things; it is not about the tea not being hot enough, it is not that. Who bothers, when you love a woman, whether the tea is hot or not’? When love is hot everything is hot. When love has gone cold everything seems cold. It is not that your slippers were not there where they should be when you get up. When you love a woman who bothers?\nBut when love disappears, that heat disappears. Then you are angry, and the anger is such that you cannot say it and the society does not allow it. The anger is such that you cannot be true about it. Maybe you have repressed it so deeply that you don’t even become aware of it, you are\nnot even conscious of it – that you are angry because now, because of THIS woman, other women have become unavailable to you. Because this woman goes on surrounding you, and is constantly watching you. Because this man goes on watching you and does not allow you to move and have your life in your own way, the way you want it now.\nYour past promises have become prisons. Then you are angry; and the anger has nothing to do with anything in particular, it is a general anger. So you cannot even say where it is, why it is, how it is! Then it jumps on any excuses – the tea is not hot, the food is not as you would like it to be.\nThis clinging creates anger, and we are not here to be unnecessarily in anger. Why? For what? For what purpose? If Savya meets some beautiful person and suddenly feels that now she has found the right person, then what should she do? She should cling to you? She should not betray you?\nThese words are ugly...’betray’. In fact, if she remains with you she is betraying her own being. If she remains with you she is betraying her love, she is betraying her joy, she is betraying God. Now God has called from another door; she is betraying God. And she will never be able to love you anymore that is not possible; God has called from somewhere else. Some other eyes have become the doors and windows. Some other form has become alive and attractive. What can she do now? She can avoid seeing that person, but how will she be able to forgive YOU? Now anger will start erupting. Now she will be angry for no reason at all, and the anger will destroy your love. It has already flown.\nRemember, love is a breeze. Just see... no breeze right now. the trees are silent. What can they do? They cannot create the breeze. Whenever it comes, it comes. When it comes, they will dance with joy. When it has gone, it has gone. They have to wait.\nLove is like a breeze. When it comes, it comes. Who knows from what direction, from what person, from whom?\nThis is the Tantra liberation. Tantra is a dangerous philosophy, it is a dangerous religion. It has not yet been tried on a larger scale – only a few individuals, far and few between. And they have suffered very much, because the society does not allow... The society thinks: This is absolute sin. But Tantra says: To live with a woman with whom your love flow has ceased, with whom you are no longer joyful, is sin. It is rape to make love to a woman you don’t love. It is rape to make love to a man you don’t love; it is prostitution.\nThis is the Tantra attitude about life. Tantra believes in joy because Tantra says: Joy is God. Remain true to joy and sacrifice everything to joy. Let joy be the only God, and sacrifice everything – whatsoever is needed. Remain flowing.\nYou say :I LOVE MA PREM SAVYA, I WANT HER TO BE WITH ME UNTIL I DIE...\nAre you thinking to die very soon? Who knows how long you may live? Why are you thinking about the future in the first place? To think about the future is to miss the present. You think that you are thinking great things. You have read such things by foolish poets. Poets are almost always foolish; they don’t have a real experience of life, they only dream.\nNow look, you think this is great love – that you want to live with her until you die. This is not great love, you are afraid. In fact, right now you are not enjoying it, that’s why you are spreading into the\nfuture. Right now you are missing it, so you want to have it anyhow. Maybe not today, then tomorrow, the day after tomorrow – that’s why the fear arises. You would like to be with her for your whole life, so that somehow you can manage.\nBut why not now? If it can ever be had, it can be had right now. You don’t know how to live right now, so you think about the future. And time is a great illusion. Only NOW exists. Tomorrow, again it will be today. The day after tomorrow, again it will be today. After one year, it will be today. It will always be today. God is always in the present. If you want to live, live right now. Why think of the future? Let your love be so intense, like a flame, that it burns you totally right now.\nAnd now you are thinking ‘until I die...’\nWho can say? At least I am not going to say anything about it, because I would like you to remain free. And I would like Savya also to be free. Meet as two free individuals, meet as two freedoms. And let the meeting be there while the freedom lasts. When your meeting starts corrupting freedom, separate – the time has come to say good-bye. Feel grateful for the days that you lived with the woman or with the man. Feel tremendously grateful that those days were made available to you through the other. Feel grateful for all that experience. But what can you do? With tears in your eyes, with gratitude, with love, with friendship, with compassion – separate. The breeze is no longer blowing this way. What can you do? Feel helpless, but become separate. Don t cling, otherwise you will destroy each other.\nIf you really love the other person, the moment love has disappeared, you will make the other free. At least this much love is due... to make the other free, so that somewhere else, in some other pasture, love can flower and bloom. At least this much you can do for the other, that the love – if it has disappeared between you – can flower and bloom somewhere else with somebody else. Love is God – it is irrelevant where it happens, between whom it happens – between A and B, or C and D, or E and G. It is irrelevant where it happens.\nIf it happens, it is good. The world has become so loveless because we cling to people when love stops. The world will be so full of love if people don’t cling and remain free.\nBe free in your love. Meet out of freedom, and when the freedom is destroyed, let that be an indication that love has disappeared. Because love cannot destroy freedom: love and freedom are two names for the same thing. Love cannot destroy freedom. If freedom is being destroyed, then something else is pretending to be love – jealousy, hatred, domination, safety, security, prestige, social respectability: something else has come in. Before it enters and corrupts you and poisons you too much, escape from it.\nQuestion 5\nOSHO, I WANT TO TAKE SANNYAS, AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT FOR YEARS. BUT I AM AFRAID I MAY GET INTO SOME TROUBLE BECAUSE OF IT. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nI can only promise that you will get into troubles. I cannot say that you will not get into troubles. It is a device to create chaos in your life.\nBut there are two kinds of troubles: destructive troubles and creative troubles. Avoid destructive troubles, because they simply destroy. There are creative troubles which create, which bring you to a higher plane of consciousness.\nTroubles you have enough already. Certainly I am not going to add any more troubles of that kind. It happened...\nThere was a woman in a railway carriage who was joined by a man who had with him a crowd of dirty and ill-behaved kids. Before they had gone very far, he gave one of his kids a fearful belting.\n‘Look here’ said the woman ‘you stop beating that child or I’ll get you into trouble.’ ‘You’ll do what?’\n‘I said: I’ll get you into trouble!’ the woman shouted.\n‘Listen, lady, my wife has run off with a black man, taking every penny I’ve got; I’m on my way to leave these kids with a relative who drinks; the girl in the corner is fifteen and eight months pregnant, that kid over there has messed his pants, the baby has thrown the flask out of the window, and the one I’ve just beaten has swallowed our tickets. For being off work, I’ve had the sack! Did you say you were going to get me into trouble – what more trouble?’\nNo, I am not going to put you into more trouble of the same kind you have been living in your whole life. I will introduce new kinds of troubles into your life. Be courageous. And you have waited long. You say you have been thinking about it for years?\nThere was this football match between the mice and the insects. At half-time the score was six all, and at the end, it was eleven-ten to the mice. So the insects went to the centipede’s cave and said ‘Why haven’t you been at the match?’\n‘I’ve been putting my boots on’ said the centipede.\nHow long will you be putting your boots on? Soon the match will be over! Please do things faster. Question 6\nOSHO, CAN’T I TAKE THE JUMP MYSELF, ALONE? IS A MASTER ABSOLUTELY NEEDED?\nTwo fellows, Pete and Dave, are working on the scaffolding. There’s a man comes past looking for new acts for the Varieties, and he’s just under the building, when all of a sudden he sees Pete doing a triple somersault off the top of the scaffolding, followed by a backflip, another double somersault, and landing on his feet.\nThe fellow on the ground thinks that’s tremendous, so he goes up to Pete and says ‘Would you like to come and do an act for me?’\n‘Yes, all right.’\n‘How much do you want for it?’ ‘A hundred pounds.’\n‘A hundred pounds?’\n‘Well there’s fifty for me, and fifty for Dave who hit me on the foot with a hammer.’\nAlone, you will not be able to go. You will need a Master to hit you. The journey is so unfamiliar, the journey is into an abyss. If somebody really pushes you hard, you are not going to take the jump. You will have to be hammered.\nQuestion 7\nWHAT IS NIRVANA?\nThis story is about NIRVANA... this ancient Buddhist story.\nAn exceptionally beautiful young woman, Enyadatta, enjoyed nothing quite as much as gazing at herself in the mirror. She was a little crazy, as all human beings are. When she looked into her mirror one morning, the figure in the glass had no head. Enyadatta became hysterical and rushed around yelling ‘My head is gone, where is my head? Who has my head? I shall die if I don’t find it!’\nEven though everyone assured Enyadatta that her head was on her shoulders, she refused to believe them. Every time she looked in the mirror, her head wasn’t there, so she continued her frenzied search, shouting and crying for help. Fearing for her sanity, Enyadatta’s friends and relatives dragged her home and tied her to a pillar so she wouldn’t hurt herself.\nEnyadatta’s friends continued to reassure that her head was still on her shoulders and slowly she began to wonder whether they might not be telling the truth. Suddenly one of her friends gave her a sharp clout on the head. She cried out in pain, and her friend exclaimed ‘That’s your head! There it is!’ Enyadatta immediately realised that she had somehow deluded herself into thinking she had no head, when, in fact, she always had it.\nSo it is with NIRVANA.\nYou have never been out of it. You have never been away from it. It is in you; you are in it. It is already the case, you have just to become a little more alert. You need a clout on the head.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"9345","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_2/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_2/>The Tantra Vision, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Just a remembrance</h1><div class=post-meta>44 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9345 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Tantra_Vision_Vol_2/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark9>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>10</span></p><p><br></p><p>Just a remembrance</p><p><br></p><p>10 May 1977 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER I LEAVE YOUR LECTURE I QUICKLY BECOME
DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE IDEALS
YOU PUT FORWARD IN YOUR LECTURE?</p><p><br></p><p>What are you talking about? Ideals? That’s exactly what I go on
destroying. I am not putting any ideals before you. I am not giving you
any fantasies about the future. I am not giving you any future at all,
because the future is a trick to postpone the present. It is a trick to
avoid yourself, a way to escape from yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Desire is a deception, and ideals create desires. I am not giving you
any ‘should’ or any ‘should not’ either positive or negative. I am
simply telling you to drop all ideals and BE.</p><p><br></p><p>But I can understand your question. You make an ideal out of it. You
start thinking ‘How should I be?’ You start thinking ‘What should I do
to be?’ I am trying to take away the ideals and you make an ideal out of
it – how to drop all ideals. You misunderstand me, you misinterpret me.
You don’t hear what I am saying, you go on hearing what I am not saying
at all. Listen more carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>It has always happened. We don’t know what Buddha said exactly,
because the people who reported were people just like you. We don’t know
what Jesus has said, because the people who reported were, again, people
like you. The report certainly says what THEY HEARD, but it doesn’t say
anything about what HE SAID. And these can be diametrically opposite
things.</p><p>I speak a totally different language. You reduce it to some other
thing – to your language. You come in and you start interfering.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER I LEAVE YOUR LECTURE I QUICKLY
BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF...?</p><p><br></p><p>You become disillusioned with yourself because you don’t know who you
are, and you have a certain image of yourself. That image is not you,
that image cannot be you – that image is d mind construction. You have
created an image of yourself: you think this is what you are, and when
you listen to me and I start pulling your legs, you become
disillusioned. Your image is broken, your image is not left intact as it
was.</p><p><br></p><p>But YOU are not broken. In fact, the image is not allowing you to
have space, it is not allowing you to be. The image has to be thrown out
so you can have enough space to grow. The image has become too huge, too
powerful. It has taken over your whole house and you are living in the
porch. It does not allow you to come in. And the image which you have
made out of ideals goes on condemning you: the creation goes on
condemning the creator.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the foolishness of it, the ridiculousness of it. You create
an image – very beautiful, naturally, when you are creating you create a
beautiful image – and then, because of that image, you start looking
ugly in comparison. You create a very, very great image that you are a
saint, and then you find yourself doing things which are not very
saintly. Now you feel condemned. The image is yours, and against the
image your act looks stinking.….</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying here, what Saraha is saying to the king is that the
image has to be completely dropped. The moment you drop the image and
you forget about the image, then what is right and what is wrong? Then
who is a sinner and who is a saint? Then you don’t have anything to
compare with. Then, suddenly, you are at ease. The comparison
disappears... and the condemnation disappears. The comparison
disappears... and the ego disappears – the ego of the sinner and the ego
of the saint. Without the ideal there can exist no ego at all. It exists
through the ideal, via the ideal. The ideal is a MUST for the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Either you think that you are a sinner – you create an ego, an
identity, or you think you are a saint, then you create an ego. But both
can only come into existence through the ideal. If the ideal is not
there, who are you? Saint or sinner? Good or bad? Ugly or beautiful? Who
are you? You are simply yourself, without any judgement, without any
justification, without any condemnation. You are simply there in your
reality: that’s what I am calling BEING.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you must be becoming disillusioned again and again, because your
grip on the image becomes a little loosened. Whenever your grip on the
image is a little loosened, you become afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>The ideal is creating an illusion, and whenever I start taking the
ideal away, you feel disillusioned. Be utterly disillusioned, and don’t
create the illusion again – the illusion of the ideal. And then see how
life attains to a sublime silence. Then see how tremendous acceptance
arises, how great benediction simply surrounds you, for no reason at
all. It is yours – just for the asking. You are not to do anything. You
are acceptable to God as you are. This is my whole message, and this is
whole of Tantra’s: YOU ARE ACCEPTED AS YOU ARE!</p><p>But you go on rejecting yourself. The ideal makes it possible for you
to reject. The ideal makes it possible for you to be unkind to yourself,
cruel, aggressive – to become a self-torturer.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here is to help you to become sane. This idealism creates
insanity. It has turned the whole earth into a madhouse. And you say:...
I BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE
IDEALS YOU PUT FORWARD IN YOUR LECTURE.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you talking about? What ideals? I am not saying ‘You should
do this.’ I am not saying ‘You should be like this.’ I am simply saying
‘Whatsoever you are, BE.’ I am trying to take all becoming from you. I
am trying to help you see the point that you are already at home; you
have never to go anywhere, and you have nowhere to go. It is already the
case – God is showering on you SAMADHI is already the case. Wherever you
are, you are in NIRVANA. This is enlightenment: this moment – with no
ideals, with no desires, with nowhere to go; this moment – utterly
relaxed in it, here-now, is the moment of God, the moment of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But you listen to me and you start parroting. You listen to me and
you start repeating words. You don’t follow the meaning; you follow the
letter and not the spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>A certain tough, old sea captain bought a young parrot at a foreign
port – being assured it was a marvelous learner – and hung it on the
bridge. Coming back through the Bay of Biscay, a fearful black cloud
came over, and the skipper remarked ‘It’s gone bloody dark at all
once!’</p><p><br></p><p>Soon after, the cloud burst in a dreadful torrent, and the captain
said to the mate ‘It’s bloody hissing down!’ The storm got worse, the
ship lurched and developed a leak, so that one of the men called up
‘What shall we do to be saved?’</p><p><br></p><p>He got the reply ‘Pump, you lousy shower! Pump, you poxed-up beggars,
pump!’</p><p><br></p><p>The ship and all were lost; a wet, swearing, washed-up parrot alone
survived, and after some adventures, finished up with a dear spinster,
who was just expecting the vicar. As a precaution she threw a cloth over
the cage, so that the vicar was greeted with ‘It’s bloody dark all at
once!’ The lady was livid, and put the parrot immediately under the cold
water tap, at which he shrieked ‘It’s bloody hissing down!’</p><p><br></p><p>‘No, no, Miss Fantight! You mustn’t be so cruel to God’s creatures,
rather bring him to church on the Sabbath, and expose him to good
influences.’ This was done and the parrot behaved like an angel, even
joining in the hymns. The vicar, beaming at his own success, rose to
announce his text. ‘Brethren, today we ask: What shall we do to be
saved?’ and down the aisles rang the parrot’s clear tones ‘Pump, you
lousy shower! Pump, you poxed-up beggars, pump!’</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t become parrots. You can repeat what I am saying, but that is
not the point at all. Understand what I am saying. Repetition will
create troubles for you. A slight change of tone, of emphasis, a slight
change of a single comma, a full point, and all is lost. Listen to the
meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are different ways of listening. One way is: listening from
the mind then you memorise. And you have been taught how to listen
through the mind, because all your schools, colleges,</p><p>universities teach you how to cram. They give you a wrong notion: as
if memory were knowledge. Memory is not knowledge; memory is simply
parroting. You will know the letter, you will know the word, but it will
be empty – inside there will be no significance, no meaning in it. And
that word is dangerous which has no meaning in it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is another way to listen, and that is from the heart. Listen
through the heart. Listen as if you were not listening to an argument,
but to a song. Listen as if you were not listening to a philosophy, but
to a poem. Listen as you listen to music. Watch me as you watch a
dancer. Feel me as you feel a lover. Then the letter will be there, it
will be used as a vehicle, but it will not be the real thing. The
vehicle will be forgotten, and the meaning will enter into your heart
and will remain there. And it will change your being, it will change
your vision of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>HOW DID TANTRA GROW OUT OF BUDDHISM WHICH, AS FAR AS I KNOW, VIEWS
SEX AS A HINDRANCE TO MEDITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>It is related to the first question.</p><p><br></p><p>What Buddha said must have been misunderstood. Yes, he said that to
go into meditation one has to go beyond sex. Now, the people who heard
him thought he was against sex, naturally so – he said you have to go
beyond sex. They started thinking ‘Sex must be a hindrance then,
otherwise why do you have to go beyond sex?’ They started fighting with
sex rather than going beyond it; their whole emphasis changed. They
started fighting with sex, and Buddhism became one of the most ascetic
religions of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you observe his tremendous grace in the statue of Buddha or in
his pictures – can it come out of ascetism? Is it possible that this
beautiful being, this graceful face, this love, this compassion can come
out of ascetism? Ascetics are people who torture themselves; and when a
person tortures himself he starts torturing others too with a vengeance.
When a person is in misery himself, he cannot see anybody else being
happy; he starts destroying others’ happiness too. That’s what your
so-called MAHATMAS go on doing: they can’t see you happy, so whenever
you are happy, they immediately come and say ‘There must be something
wrong, a happy person means a sinner’</p><p><br></p><p>You can observe it in yourself also, because down the centuries your
so-called MAHATMAS and saints have conditioned you to feel guilt
whenever you feel happy. Whenever you are miserable, everything is okay.
But if you are feeling great joy, you start feeling a little uneasiness
– somehow it doesn’t seem to be right. Have you not watched it in
yourself? From where does it come? Happiness... and not right? And
misery is ‘okay.’</p><p><br></p><p>Something very antagonistic to life – very life-negative, very
life-denying – has entered into the bloodstream of humanity. And it has
come through those so-called ascetics. These ascetics are neurotic
people: they are masochists, they torture themselves. Their only joy is
in creating more and more misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is not a masochist – cannot be. Buddha looks so beautiful, so
joyful, so happy, so tremendously blissful. Those who were hearing him
have misunderstood somewhere. Yes, he</p><p>says go beyond sex. One has to go beyond it because it is only the
first rung of the ladder. But he is not saying go against it. Going
beyond is not necessarily going against. In fact, the contrary is the
case. If you go against sex you will never be able to go beyond it.
Going beyond comes only through going through.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand sex, you have to befriend sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Something, somewhere, got misinterpreted. Saraha comes as a right
interpretation of Buddha. And Saraha must have watched what a calamity
had happened to thousands of people who were following Buddha: rather
than going beyond sex, they had become obsessed with it. When you are
continuously fighting with something you become obsessed with it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can watch it: a person who believes in fasting becomes obsessed
with food. Mahatma Gandhi was obsessed with food, continuously thinking
about food – what to eat and what not to eat. As if that seemed to be
the only important thing in life – what to eat and what not to eat.
Ordinary people are less obsessed; they are not thinking about it too
much. Do a three-day fast, and think about what goes on in your mind.
You will think about food continuously. Now, going beyond food is good,
but fasting cannot be the way, because fasting creates an obsession with
food. How can it be the way to go beyond it? If you really want to go
beyond food, you have to eat rightly. You have to eat the right food,
you have to eat it in a right way at the right time. You have to find
out what suits your body, what is nourishing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that will take you beyond food: you will never think about food.
When the body is nourished, you don’t think about food. So many people
think about food because in some way or other they are fasting. You will
be surprised when I say that. You may be eating too much ice-cream –
that is a sort of fast because it is not nourishing; you are simply
throwing rotten things inside you. They don’t satisfy: they fill you but
they don’t fulfil you. You feel stuffed but not contented.</p><p><br></p><p>Wrong food will create discontent, and your hunger will not be
satisfied because hunger needs nourishment not food. Remember, hunger is
for nourishment NOT for food! And hunger does not bother much about
taste. The basic thing is whether it suits your body, whether it gives
your body the needed energy. If it gives the needed energy then it is
okay. If taste goes with right nourishment, you will be tremendously
satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, I am not against taste, I am all for it. But just taste
cannot be nourishing. And just food without taste is unintelligent,
stupid. When you can have both, why not? An intelligent person will find
nourishing food, tasteful food. It is not such a big problem. Man can go
to the moon and cannot find a nourishing food for himself? Man has done
miracles and cannot satisfy his hunger? This does not seem to be the
right situation. No, man has not looked into it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who believe in fasts – they destroy the body. And
then there are people who go on stuffing any rubbish – they destroy the
body. Both are in the same boat: both are fasting, and both are
continuously obsessed. One is obsessed through indulgence, the other is
oppressed through repression. Just in the middle is transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>So is the case with sex, and so is the case with everything in
life.</p><p>Saraha must have become aware that the people who said Buddha had
said to go beyond sex, were not going beyond at all. Rather, they were
becoming more and more obsessed with it and falling deeper into its
mire.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a young nun who went to the Mother Superior in some
distress, and after a great deal of beating about the bush, admitted she
was pregnant.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Who was it? Who was this wicked, wicked man?’ said the Mother
Superior.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Oh, Reverend Mother, I wouldn’t commit a carnal offence with a man!’
exclaimed the nun.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Well, it wasn’t fathered by a woman, was it?’ said the Mother
Superior, beginning to lose her temper. ‘No, indeed, Blessed Mother, but
it was fathered by one of the Holy Angels.’ SIMPER, SIMPER. ‘Holy Angels
what is this nonsense?’</p><p>‘Yes, Blessed Mother, he came down to me in the middle of the night
in my sleep, and when I asked who he was, he said “Saint Michael” and
showed me his name on his vest to prove it.’</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are against something you will find some ways to get out of
it. You will find some back door. Man is cunning. If you repress
something, the cunning mind will find some other way. That’s why you
dream about sex. Your saints dream too much about sex; they have to. In
the day they can deny, but in the night... When they are conscious they
can repress, but when they are asleep... then, in the dream, sex takes
great, fantastic colours; it becomes psychedelic. And then in the
morning they feel guilty, and because they feel guilty they repress
more. And when they repress more, the next night they have an even more
beautiful dream of sex – or horrible, according to them. It depends on
how you interpret it whether it is beautiful or horrible.</p><p><br></p><p>A ‘difficult’ schoolgirl of fifteen was sent to the psychologist, who
asked her a number of very personal questions. He was sure that sex lay
at the bottom of the trouble, and asked her ‘Do you suffer from sexy or
erotic dreams?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Certainly not!’ ‘Are you sure?’</p><p>‘Quite sure’ said the girl ‘in fact, I enjoy them.’</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you whether you call them beautiful or horrible. In the
night they are beautiful, in the morning they become horrible. In the
night you enjoy them, in the morning you suffer. And there is a vicious
circle created, and your so-called saint goes on moving in this vicious
circle: the day he suffers, the night he enjoys, the day he suffers, the
night he enjoys – and he is torn between these two.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you look deep down into yourself you will find it easily.
Whatsoever you repress will remain there, you cannot get rid of it. The
repressed remains, only the expressed disappears. The</p><p>expressed evaporates, the repressed remains and not only remains, but
it becomes more and more powerful. As time passes by, it becomes more
and more powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>Saraha must have looked at what had happened after two hundred years
of Buddha – wrong interpretations, and people were almost obsessed with
sex. Out of that obsession of the Buddhist monks and nuns, Tantra was
born as a rebellion a rebellion against Buddhism, not against Buddha.
Through that rebellion, Saraha brought Buddha’s spirit back. Yes, one
has to transcend sex, but the transcendence happens through
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra believes in understanding. Understand a thing totally and you
are free of its clutches. Anything not understood rightly will remain as
a hangover.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are right. You ask: HOW DID TANTRA GROW OUT OF BUDDHISM WHICH,
AS FAR</p><p>AS I KNOW, VIEWS SEX AS A HINDRANCE TO MEDITATION? Precisely because
of that. It is a rebellion against Buddhism, and it is for Buddha. It
goes against the followers, but not against the Master. The followers
were carrying the letter, and Saraha brings back the spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Saraha is a reincarnation of the same enlightenment as Buddha was.
Saraha is a Buddha. Question 3</p><p>WHAT DOES IT MEAN ‘THE HONEYMOON IS OVER’?</p><p><br></p><p>‘The honeymoon is over’ means that the fantasy part of your love is
finished. Honeymoon is a fantasy: it is a projection, it is not reality.
It is projected dream. ‘The honeymoon is over’ means that the dream is
over, and now starts the marriage. The higher the honeymoon, the greater
will be the disillusionment. That’s why love-marriages don’t succeed.
Marriages succeed, but not love- marriages.</p><p><br></p><p>The love-marriage cannot succeed. That failure is intrinsic to it. A
love-marriage is a fantasy, and the fantasy cannot win over reality.
There is only one way to remain in fantasy and to remain always in a
honeymoon, and that is to never meet your beloved. Then it is possible:
you can have it for your whole life – but never meet the beloved, never
meet your lover.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest lovers in history were those who were not allowed to
meet: Laila and Majnun, Shiri and Farihad – these are the great lovers.
They were not allowed: the society created so many obstacles that they
remained always in a state of honeymoon. It is just like when food is
there but you are not allowed to eat it, so the fantasy continues. If
you are allowed to eat it, then the fantasy disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Love-marriage cannot succeed. What do I mean by ‘not succeed’? In the
sense that people want it to succeed, it cannot succeed. Marriage is
successful, but then there is no love. That’s why in the past all the
societies of the world, out of experience, decided in favour of marriage
and against love. Indian society is one of the most ancient societies of
the world. It has existed for at least five thousand years, or more than
that. Out of this long experience India decided for marriage without
love – because a marriage without love can succeed. Because it has no
honeymoon part in it, from the very beginning it is very realistic,
down-to-earth. It does not allow any dreaming.</p><p>In India, the partners themselves are not allowed to choose. The boy
is not allowed to choose the girl, the girl is not allowed to choose the
boy; the parents choose. Naturally they are more down-to- earth, more
experienced. And naturally, they cannot fall in love. They think of
other things: finance, prestige, respectability, family. They think of
thousands of things, but they don’t think of one thing – love. Love is
not brought into the matter at all. They go to the astrologer; they ask
the astrologer and inquire into everything but not love. Love has not to
become an ingredient in it. Two unknown people – the man and the woman
are put together by the parents, by the society – are left together.
Naturally, when you live with a person, a sort of liking arises. But
that liking is just like the liking you have for your sister; it is not
love. Because you were born into a certain family, you have not chosen
your sister, neither have you chosen your brother: they were not chosen
by you. It was accidental that you were born to the same parents. So you
have a certain liking. Living together for long, a thousand and one
associations, and one starts liking – or disliking – but it is never
love and never hate. It never goes to extremes, it is very balanced.</p><p>The same is the case with marriage, arranged marriage. The husband
and wife live together and, by and by, they start feeling for each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing the society does: the society does not allow any
extramarital sex, so naturally the husband HAS to make love to the wife,
and the wife HAS to make love to the husband. If you are allowed only
one food to eat and no other food is allowed, how long can you wait? You
have to eat it. This is the trick of the society. If extramarital sex
were allowed, then there is every possibility that the husband may not
want to make love to the wife, the wife may not like to make love to the
husband. Just out of hunger, and with no other outlet, they start making
love to each other. Out of desperation, they start becoming associated
with each other. Then children are born... and more ties: religious,
social ties. Then the children and the responsibility... and the family
starts rolling.</p><p><br></p><p>Love-marriage is bound to fail, because the love-marriage is a poetic
phenomenon. You fall in love and you start dreaming about the woman or
the man, and you reach to a peak, a climax of dreams. Those dreams
continue until you meet the woman, until you meet the man. Then you come
together, you become satisfied. Those dreams start disappearing. Now,
for the first time, you start seeing the other as he or she IS.</p><p><br></p><p>When you see your wife as she is, when you see your husband as he is,
the honeymoon is over. This is the meaning of the phrase ‘the honeymoon
is over’. And it does not happen only in marriage, it happens in many
sorts of relationships. It happens here with me.</p><p><br></p><p>You come to me and you can have a honeymoon, you can start
fantasizing about me. I have no part in it, I am not a party to it. It
is something that you do all alone. But you start fantasizing, desiring:
This is going to happen and that is going to happen, and Osho will do
this and Osho will do that. Then, one day, the honeymoon will be over.
In fact, I always like to wait till the honeymoon is over, then I start
working, never before it, because I don’t want to become a party to your
fantasies. I only start working when I see that now the honeymoon is
over and you are back on the earth. Now something real can be done. In
fact, I always like to give sannyas when the honeymoon is over. To give
sannyas during the honeymoon is dangerous, very dangerous, because the
moment the honeymoon is over, you will start feeling against me, you
will start rebelling against sannyas, you will start reacting. It is
better to wait.</p><p>In every relationship – in friendship, in a Master-disciple
relationship – in any kind of relationship</p><p>there is a part which is of fantasy. That fantasy is just your mind:
repressed desires are flying into dreams. In a better world, with more
understanding, marriage will disappear, and with marriage will disappear
the honeymoon too.</p><p><br></p><p>Now listen.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been societies: for example, the Hindu society – it has
killed the honeymoon by killing love, and only marriage exists. In
America, they are killing marriage and saving love – the honeymoon and
only the honeymoon exists, not marriage. It is disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>But to me, both are deep down in conspiracy. The honeymoon can exist
only if there is some repression, otherwise there is nothing to project.
And if there is something to project, then love fails again and again.
Then the social PUNDITS come in and they start making arrangements for
marriage, because it fails. It drives people crazy, and does not help
them to live their lives. It makes them suicidal. It makes them
neurotic, schizophrenic, hysterical. So the social PUNDIT has to come
in, the priest and the politician have to come in and arrange for
marriage, because love is too dangerous. And that’s how the society has
moved between these two polarities.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, when people get fed up with marriage – as they have got
fed up in America – they start thinking of love. When people get fed up
with love as sooner or later they will find; they are already – then
they start moving towards marriage. Both are polarities of the same
game.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, a different kind of society is needed where marriage and
romance disappear. Marriage disappears, because to make two people live
together by legal enforcement is immoral. To force two people to live
together when they don’t want to live together is against nature and
against God.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety-nine per cent of social diseases will disappear if people are
not forced. Listen to this:</p><p>A man went to his solicitor and said ‘I am very rich, so money is no
object, but I want to be rid of my wife, who is a bitch, without being
had for murder. So tell me what to do.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Buy her a strong horse and it may throw her.’</p><p><br></p><p>A month later the man came back and said his wife was now the best
horsewoman in the district... ‘Try’ said the lawyer ‘buying her a mini
and send her up the mountains in it.’</p><p>The man did this, but she drove like Sterling Moss, putting in danger
everybody but herself. The husband told the solicitor he was
desperate...</p><p><br></p><p>‘Then buy her a big Jaguar.’</p><p><br></p><p>The man was back in a week, delighted. ‘Name your fee’ he said ‘it
worked.’ ‘What happened then?’</p><p>‘Well, when she opened the cage door to feed the jaguar, it bit her
bloody head off!’</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage creates a thousand and one complexities and solves nothing.
Yes, it succeeds – it succeeds in making people slaves. It succeeds in
destroying people’s individuality. Don’t you see it all around? An
unmarried man has a certain individuality, and a married man starts
losing his individuality. He becomes more and more of a type. The
unmarried woman has a joy, something flowing. The married woman becomes
dull, uninterested, bored. This is ugly – to force people into boredom.
People are here to be happy, people are here to enjoy and celebrate.
This is ugly!</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage has to go. But if you choose fantasy and love, you will
again fall into the same trap of marriage. Because love never succeeds –
never succeeds the way marriage succeeds financially, security-wise, for
children, for society, for this and that. Love never succeeds as
marriage succeeds.</p><p><br></p><p>So love is bound to create other kinds of troubles. And love exists
because of repressed desires. When marriage disappears and desires are
not repressed, love will disappear automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>A real society of human beings will not know anything of marriage and
will not know anything of the honeymoon. It will know only of joy, of
sharing with people. As long as you can share, good; if you cannot
share, good-bye. Marriage disappears, and with it disappears the ugly
divorce. Marriage disappears, and with it disappears the fantasy of the
honeymoon.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are free to love, to meet, to be with people, the honeymoon
will disappear. Laila and Majnun, and Shiri and Farihad, will not be
possible – nobody is obstructing the way. You can meet any woman and you
can meet any man. Whomsoever you desire and whosoever desires you –
nobody else is barring the way. Then what is the need for fantasy? All
kinds of food are available, and yet whatsoever is standing there is
like a policeman or a magistrate or a priest and making you afraid and
scared that if you eat this food you will go to hell. If you eat this
food, only then can you go to heaven, and that food you don’t want to
eat; and that food leads you to heaven, and the food that you want to
eat leads you to hell. Anything that gives you joy leads to hell, and
anything that makes you miserable leads to heaven. When nobody is
standing in between you and your desires, when desire is free, there
will be no repression.</p><p><br></p><p>Without repression the honeymoon will disappear. The honeymoon is a
by-product: it exists with marriage. It is like bait. You go fishing,
you use bait. Honeymoon is a bait: it takes you into marriage. That’s
why women are very, very insistent about marriage – because they know.
They are more down-to-earth, more empirical than men. Men have remained
dreamers, they think of stars and moons. And women only laugh at their
ridiculous desires. The woman knows – she is very down-to-earth-she
knows that within ten, twelve, fifteen days, two to three weeks, the
honeymoon will disappear. Then what? She insists on marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was asking his woman – he was in love -and he asked her in the
night ‘Love or something?’ And the woman said ‘Marriage or nothing.’</p><p>He asked again ‘Love or something?’ And she said ‘Marriage or
NOTHING.’</p><p>Love is not reliable. It comes and goes; it is a whim, a mood. If
love remains, that simply means repression is still there.</p><p><br></p><p>Then, in a different society there will be joy. ‘Love’ will not be so
important a word as ‘delight’, ‘celebration’. Two people want to share
their energies; if they are both willing, then there will be no
hindrance. There will be only one limitation, that if the other is not
willing, then it is finished. Then it never starts. All other
limitations should be dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>And now science has made it possible for the problem of children to
be very easily solved. In the old days people were not so fortunate. You
are more fortunate. The problem of children can be solved. You can stay
with a woman until the day you think ‘Now we have lived together long
enough and my love, my joy with the woman goes on increasing, my joy
with the man goes on increasing, and now there is no possibility of our
becoming separate.’ You have found your soul-mate. The day you feel
that, you can have children, otherwise there is no need to have
children.</p><p><br></p><p>And in a better society, children should belong to the communes. The
family has to disappear. There should be communes of people: a commune
of painters, where painters – painter men and painter women – live
together and enjoy their togetherness; a commune of poets, a commune of
carpenters, a commune of goldsmiths: communes of different kinds of
people who live together, rather than families.</p><p><br></p><p>The family has been a calamity. It is better when many people live
together who possess everything in common and who share their love with
each other.</p><p><br></p><p>But there should not be any restriction. Love should never become a
duty – only then is it joyful. The moment it becomes a duty, it is dead,
heavyweight. And it creates a thousand and one problems which cannot be
solved directly. That is the whole situation in the world. You can go to
the psychoanalyst, you can come to a Master, you can meditate, you can
do this and that – but your basic problem is not touched.</p><p><br></p><p>Your basic problem remains somehow connected with your sex energy,
and you go on tackling it somewhere else. You go on cutting the leaves,
pruning the leaves, and you never cut the root. People are miserable
because people are fed up with each other. People are sad because they
don’t enjoy the company of each other. People are simply burdened: they
are doing their duties, the love is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage and the honeymoon both come in the same package; they both
have to go. Then there can be a non-repressed humanity, a fully
expressive humanity, a fully expressive human being who knows nothing
except joy, and who decides according to joy. Joy should become the
criterion: that’s what Tantra is all about. Joy should become the
criterion.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE MA PREM SAVYA, I WANT HER TO BE WITH ME UNTIL I DIE. IS THIS A
GOOD LAST DESIRE?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Prem Aniket.</p><p>The first thing: no desire is the last if you are still living. No
desire is the last desire if you are still living. Who knows about the
next moment? And how can you manage to know the next moment’?</p><p><br></p><p>How long you have known Savya? A few weeks. Before those few weeks,
you had not even dreamt about her. If this can happen, this can happen
again. After three weeks, you may meet another woman. Until you are dead
no desire is the last desire. Each desire creates another desire: desire
is a continuum. Only two things, death or enlightenment, stop desires.
And certainly neither of them has happened yet, Aniket; neither death
has happened nor enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to understand desire. Each desire brings in new desires.
One desire creates ten desires. It is just like out of one small seed
comes a big tree, thousands of branches, and millions of leaves. Out of
one desire, the seed, many desires arise.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot say anything about the future – you should not say – the
future remains open. This is one of the greatest efforts of man –
ridiculous, but man goes on making it. One: he wants to reform the past
which cannot be done. Whatsoever has happened has happened, there is no
way to redo it; you cannot even touch it here and there. You cannot make
it better, you cannot make it worse. It is simply beyond you. It has
happened, it has become actual; and that which has become cannot even be
touched. The past is finished; it is complete the way it is. You cannot
go back and you cannot rearrange it. It is good. Otherwise, if you could
rearrange the past, if you could go back you would go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you would never come to the present again; the past is so long.
It is good that the doors of the past are closed. But man, the stupid
mind of man goes on thinking of reforming, reformulating, doing
something here and there. Don’t you think about it sometimes: you had
not said it, and you start thinking what would have been better; you had
not done it – what would.have been better? And in your fantasy you try
to say that and do that. But you are simply wasting time – now nothing
can be done, it has slipped out of your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>The past cannot be reformed, and the future cannot be predicted. That
too, man goes on doing – he wants to predict the future. The future is
that which has not happened. The future remains open: openness is what
the future is. The future is indeterminate; it is not actual, it is only
probable. Nothing is certain about the future. There is no certainty
about the future. But man is foolish. Again he goes to the astrologers,
consults the I CHING, tarot cards, shadow readers. Man is so foolish
that he tries to find ways somehow so that he can know beforehand what
the future will be. But if you can know about it beforehand, it is
already past, it is no longer the future. Only the past can be known,
the future remains unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the intrinsic quality of the future – unknownness. All is
possible and nothing is certain – that’s what future is. All has
happened, nothing more can happen – that’s what past is. And the present
is just a passage from the actual to the potential, from the closed to
the open, from the dead to the alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you ask: IS THIS A GOOD LAST DESIRE?</p><p><br></p><p>You would like that it should be your last desire, but then you would
have to commit suicide, either actually or metaphorically. You will have
to commit suicide if you want it to be your last desire. Either</p><p>go and jump in front of a train, or into the sea, or into an abyss –
actually commit suicide – then you can have this as the last desire. Or
psychologically commit suicide, which is what many have done. Don’t look
at any other woman again. Close your eyes, become afraid. Cling to
whomsoever you love and don’t go here, there, astray. Don’t even think,
don’t even dream... that is psychological suicide. But in both ways you
will not be able to live, because you will not have any future to live.
It you really want to live and you want to live, in fact, that’s what
you are asking: you want to live with Savya – to live you have to be
alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think in terms of ‘the last desire’. And why, why would you
like it to be the last? Why can’t you share your energies some day with
some other women? Why be so miserly? Why be so inhuman? Are not other
women as divine as Savya? Has not God. appeared in many, many forms,
millions of forms around you? Why cling to one form? Why this
clinging?</p><p><br></p><p>This clinging comes out of repression, because you have repressed
your desires. Then one day you find a woman who is loving towards you
and you cling. You are afraid to lose her, because you know all those
long nights when you were alone. If now this woman goes, again you will
be alone. Now this woman is afraid of her loneliness herself; she clings
to you. She is afraid that some day you may move towards somebody else;
you may not look towards her, and she will be left alone. ’Long have
been those nights of loneliness, now no more. We have found each other.
We should cling to each other. We should possess each other and we
should guard each other, so nobody goes anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>But out of this guarding look what has happened: people are bored.
You want a lover not a guard; you want a beloved not a jailer. You want
to flow, not to be imprisoned. Look at the contradictory desire: you
want to live and love, but whatsoever you do disturbs your love,
destroys your love, creates hindrances to the flow. You want to love and
live, and you want to be joyously alive, but whatsoever you do goes
against it, is against it.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should this be the last desire? I am not saying that this should
not be the last desire, remember, don’t misunderstand me. I am not
saying THIS should not be the last desire. I am saying simply saying,
WHY should it be the last desire? If it happens that you remain
together, if it happens that you never find a more beautiful woman, a
more loving woman – good, you are fortunate. If it happens that Savya
never finds another man who is more loving, more alive than you –
fortunate. But if she finds a more loving man who can make her more
joyful, who can bring her to greater peaks of ecstasy, then what? Should
she cling to you? Then she is going against herself. Why should she
cling to you?</p><p><br></p><p>And if she clings to you, she will never be able to forgive you,
because it will be because of you she had to miss that ecstatic man; she
will always be angry with you. That’s why wives are angry, husbands are
angry. That anger has a natural base to it. The anger is not about
mundane things; it is not about the tea not being hot enough, it is not
that. Who bothers, when you love a woman, whether the tea is hot or
not’? When love is hot everything is hot. When love has gone cold
everything seems cold. It is not that your slippers were not there where
they should be when you get up. When you love a woman who bothers?</p><p><br></p><p>But when love disappears, that heat disappears. Then you are angry,
and the anger is such that you cannot say it and the society does not
allow it. The anger is such that you cannot be true about it. Maybe you
have repressed it so deeply that you don’t even become aware of it, you
are</p><p>not even conscious of it – that you are angry because now, because of
THIS woman, other women have become unavailable to you. Because this
woman goes on surrounding you, and is constantly watching you. Because
this man goes on watching you and does not allow you to move and have
your life in your own way, the way you want it now.</p><p><br></p><p>Your past promises have become prisons. Then you are angry; and the
anger has nothing to do with anything in particular, it is a general
anger. So you cannot even say where it is, why it is, how it is! Then it
jumps on any excuses – the tea is not hot, the food is not as you would
like it to be.</p><p><br></p><p>This clinging creates anger, and we are not here to be unnecessarily
in anger. Why? For what? For what purpose? If Savya meets some beautiful
person and suddenly feels that now she has found the right person, then
what should she do? She should cling to you? She should not betray
you?</p><p><br></p><p>These words are ugly...’betray’. In fact, if she remains with you she
is betraying her own being. If she remains with you she is betraying her
love, she is betraying her joy, she is betraying God. Now God has called
from another door; she is betraying God. And she will never be able to
love you anymore that is not possible; God has called from somewhere
else. Some other eyes have become the doors and windows. Some other form
has become alive and attractive. What can she do now? She can avoid
seeing that person, but how will she be able to forgive YOU? Now anger
will start erupting. Now she will be angry for no reason at all, and the
anger will destroy your love. It has already flown.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, love is a breeze. Just see... no breeze right now. the
trees are silent. What can they do? They cannot create the breeze.
Whenever it comes, it comes. When it comes, they will dance with joy.
When it has gone, it has gone. They have to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is like a breeze. When it comes, it comes. Who knows from what
direction, from what person, from whom?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the Tantra liberation. Tantra is a dangerous philosophy, it
is a dangerous religion. It has not yet been tried on a larger scale –
only a few individuals, far and few between. And they have suffered very
much, because the society does not allow... The society thinks: This is
absolute sin. But Tantra says: To live with a woman with whom your love
flow has ceased, with whom you are no longer joyful, is sin. It is rape
to make love to a woman you don’t love. It is rape to make love to a man
you don’t love; it is prostitution.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the Tantra attitude about life. Tantra believes in joy
because Tantra says: Joy is God. Remain true to joy and sacrifice
everything to joy. Let joy be the only God, and sacrifice everything –
whatsoever is needed. Remain flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>You say :I LOVE MA PREM SAVYA, I WANT HER TO BE WITH ME UNTIL I
DIE...</p><p><br></p><p>Are you thinking to die very soon? Who knows how long you may live?
Why are you thinking about the future in the first place? To think about
the future is to miss the present. You think that you are thinking great
things. You have read such things by foolish poets. Poets are almost
always foolish; they don’t have a real experience of life, they only
dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Now look, you think this is great love – that you want to live with
her until you die. This is not great love, you are afraid. In fact,
right now you are not enjoying it, that’s why you are spreading into
the</p><p>future. Right now you are missing it, so you want to have it anyhow.
Maybe not today, then tomorrow, the day after tomorrow – that’s why the
fear arises. You would like to be with her for your whole life, so that
somehow you can manage.</p><p><br></p><p>But why not now? If it can ever be had, it can be had right now. You
don’t know how to live right now, so you think about the future. And
time is a great illusion. Only NOW exists. Tomorrow, again it will be
today. The day after tomorrow, again it will be today. After one year,
it will be today. It will always be today. God is always in the present.
If you want to live, live right now. Why think of the future? Let your
love be so intense, like a flame, that it burns you totally right
now.</p><p><br></p><p>And now you are thinking ‘until I die...’</p><p><br></p><p>Who can say? At least I am not going to say anything about it,
because I would like you to remain free. And I would like Savya also to
be free. Meet as two free individuals, meet as two freedoms. And let the
meeting be there while the freedom lasts. When your meeting starts
corrupting freedom, separate – the time has come to say good-bye. Feel
grateful for the days that you lived with the woman or with the man.
Feel tremendously grateful that those days were made available to you
through the other. Feel grateful for all that experience. But what can
you do? With tears in your eyes, with gratitude, with love, with
friendship, with compassion – separate. The breeze is no longer blowing
this way. What can you do? Feel helpless, but become separate. Don t
cling, otherwise you will destroy each other.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really love the other person, the moment love has disappeared,
you will make the other free. At least this much love is due... to make
the other free, so that somewhere else, in some other pasture, love can
flower and bloom. At least this much you can do for the other, that the
love – if it has disappeared between you – can flower and bloom
somewhere else with somebody else. Love is God – it is irrelevant where
it happens, between whom it happens – between A and B, or C and D, or E
and G. It is irrelevant where it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>If it happens, it is good. The world has become so loveless because
we cling to people when love stops. The world will be so full of love if
people don’t cling and remain free.</p><p><br></p><p>Be free in your love. Meet out of freedom, and when the freedom is
destroyed, let that be an indication that love has disappeared. Because
love cannot destroy freedom: love and freedom are two names for the same
thing. Love cannot destroy freedom. If freedom is being destroyed, then
something else is pretending to be love – jealousy, hatred, domination,
safety, security, prestige, social respectability: something else has
come in. Before it enters and corrupts you and poisons you too much,
escape from it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I WANT TO TAKE SANNYAS, AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT FOR
YEARS. BUT I AM AFRAID I MAY GET INTO SOME TROUBLE BECAUSE OF IT. WHAT
SHOULD I DO?</p><p><br></p><p>I can only promise that you will get into troubles. I cannot say that
you will not get into troubles. It is a device to create chaos in your
life.</p><p>But there are two kinds of troubles: destructive troubles and
creative troubles. Avoid destructive troubles, because they simply
destroy. There are creative troubles which create, which bring you to a
higher plane of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Troubles you have enough already. Certainly I am not going to add any
more troubles of that kind. It happened...</p><p>There was a woman in a railway carriage who was joined by a man who
had with him a crowd of dirty and ill-behaved kids. Before they had gone
very far, he gave one of his kids a fearful belting.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Look here’ said the woman ‘you stop beating that child or I’ll get
you into trouble.’ ‘You’ll do what?’</p><p>‘I said: I’ll get you into trouble!’ the woman shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Listen, lady, my wife has run off with a black man, taking every
penny I’ve got; I’m on my way to leave these kids with a relative who
drinks; the girl in the corner is fifteen and eight months pregnant,
that kid over there has messed his pants, the baby has thrown the flask
out of the window, and the one I’ve just beaten has swallowed our
tickets. For being off work, I’ve had the sack! Did you say you were
going to get me into trouble – what more trouble?’</p><p><br></p><p>No, I am not going to put you into more trouble of the same kind you
have been living in your whole life. I will introduce new kinds of
troubles into your life. Be courageous. And you have waited long. You
say you have been thinking about it for years?</p><p><br></p><p>There was this football match between the mice and the insects. At
half-time the score was six all, and at the end, it was eleven-ten to
the mice. So the insects went to the centipede’s cave and said ‘Why
haven’t you been at the match?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I’ve been putting my boots on’ said the centipede.</p><p><br></p><p>How long will you be putting your boots on? Soon the match will be
over! Please do things faster. Question 6</p><p>OSHO, CAN’T I TAKE THE JUMP MYSELF, ALONE? IS A MASTER ABSOLUTELY
NEEDED?</p><p><br></p><p>Two fellows, Pete and Dave, are working on the scaffolding. There’s a
man comes past looking for new acts for the Varieties, and he’s just
under the building, when all of a sudden he sees Pete doing a triple
somersault off the top of the scaffolding, followed by a backflip,
another double somersault, and landing on his feet.</p><p><br></p><p>The fellow on the ground thinks that’s tremendous, so he goes up to
Pete and says ‘Would you like to come and do an act for me?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Yes, all right.’</p><p>‘How much do you want for it?’ ‘A hundred pounds.’</p><p>‘A hundred pounds?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Well there’s fifty for me, and fifty for Dave who hit me on the foot
with a hammer.’</p><p><br></p><p>Alone, you will not be able to go. You will need a Master to hit you.
The journey is so unfamiliar, the journey is into an abyss. If somebody
really pushes you hard, you are not going to take the jump. You will
have to be hammered.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS NIRVANA?</p><p><br></p><p>This story is about NIRVANA... this ancient Buddhist story.</p><p><br></p><p>An exceptionally beautiful young woman, Enyadatta, enjoyed nothing
quite as much as gazing at herself in the mirror. She was a little
crazy, as all human beings are. When she looked into her mirror one
morning, the figure in the glass had no head. Enyadatta became
hysterical and rushed around yelling ‘My head is gone, where is my head?
Who has my head? I shall die if I don’t find it!’</p><p><br></p><p>Even though everyone assured Enyadatta that her head was on her
shoulders, she refused to believe them. Every time she looked in the
mirror, her head wasn’t there, so she continued her frenzied search,
shouting and crying for help. Fearing for her sanity, Enyadatta’s
friends and relatives dragged her home and tied her to a pillar so she
wouldn’t hurt herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Enyadatta’s friends continued to reassure that her head was still on
her shoulders and slowly she began to wonder whether they might not be
telling the truth. Suddenly one of her friends gave her a sharp clout on
the head. She cried out in pain, and her friend exclaimed ‘That’s your
head! There it is!’ Enyadatta immediately realised that she had somehow
deluded herself into thinking she had no head, when, in fact, she always
had it.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is with NIRVANA.</p><p><br></p><p>You have never been out of it. You have never been away from it. It
is in you; you are in it. It is already the case, you have just to
become a little more alert. You need a clout on the head.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebel/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Jesus is not a christian</span>

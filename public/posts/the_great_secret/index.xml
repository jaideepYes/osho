‌CHAPTER 1
Tales of love untellable
11 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall LOVE’S NOT GROWN IN GARDENS; LOVE’S NOT SOLD AT MARKET.
HE WHO WANTS IT, KING OR COMMONER,
GIVES HIS HEAD AND TAKES IT.
STUDYING GREAT BOOKS MANY HAVE DIED. NONE EVER BECOME LEARNED.
TWO LETTERS AND A HALF IN LOVE, WHO STUDIES THEM IS LEARNING. NARROW IS THE LANE OF LOVE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Come what may, allow
20 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall STOP WAVERING, MAD MIND! COME WHAT MAY, ALLOW IT!
THE SATI IS READY FOR THE FIRE OF DEATH.
DANCE IN ECSTASY, BEYOND ALL DOUBTS. DROP GREED, ATTACHMENT, FANCIES.
DO THE BRAVE FEAR DEATH?
DOES THE SATI CLING TO HER BODY? SOCIETY, SCRIPTURE, FAMILY PRESTIGE – THE HANGMAN’S NOOSE AT THE NECK. MOVE ON THE PATH AND RETURN MIDWAY – HA!</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Tell, and still its hidden
12 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall KNOWLEDGE OF INNER EXPERIENCE MANY COME ASKING FOR.
STRUCK DUMB SAVOURING THE SWEET,
WHOSE MOUTH WILL TELL THE TASTE? THE SIGN OF THE DUMB
ONLY THE DUMB UNDERSTAND. LIKEWISE, THE JOY OF A SAGE ONLY A SAGE KNOWS.
NOT OF WRITTEN WORDS BUT OF EXPERIENCING:
WHEN THE BRIDE MEETS HIS EMBRACE THE GUESTS ALL FADE AWAY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
And I’m drunk with boundless youth
13 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
O BLESSED WOMEN, SING THE WEDDING SONGS! I’VE COME HOME WITH LORD RAM, MY BELOVED. BODY, MIND, THE FIVE ELEMENTS,
ALL LOVED AND OFFERED IN WELCOME. RAM HAS COME TO LIVE WITH ME
AND I’M DRUNK WITH BOUNDLESS YOUTH. THE BODY A POOL OF VEDAS
BRAHMA HIMSELF RECITES!</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
14 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall DYING, DYING, ALL GO ON DYING. NONE DIE A PROPER DEATH. KABIR MET WITH DEATH,
NEVER TO DIE AGAIN.
DYING, DYING, ALL GO ON DYING WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT. ONLY MINE’S AN ARTFUL DEATH. THE REST DIE AND ROT.
DIE YOU MUST, SO DIE!
ALL WHIRLPOOLS FALL AWAY. SUCH IS DEATH. SO WHY DIE HUNDREDS OF TIMES A DAY?</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
15 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ONE WHO WALKS ALONE
CONFUSED, CHOOSING FOR AND AGAINST, THE WHOLE WORLD GOES ASTRAY. CHOICELESS AND CELEBRATING GOD;
HE IS A TRUE SADHU.
PEOPLE ALL BOUND TOGETHER AS DONKEY TIED TO DONKEY. WHO HAS INNER VISION,
HE’S AUTHENTIC MAN. ONE WHO WALKS ALONE, HE ALONE FINDS TRUTH. HEART ABSORBED IN LOVE
NEVER AGAIN COMES BACK.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
16 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall SADHU, WHO’S KIDDING WHO? THE FORMLESS IN FORMS,
AND FORMS WITHIN THE FORMLESS,
SO WHY WANDER AWAY
THEY SAY, “HE’S FOREVER YOUNG, IMMORTAL”. BUT THE INVISIBLE REMAINS UNEXPRESSED NO FAMILY, NO CHARACTER, NO COLOR,
YET PERMEATING EVERY BEING.
SOME SAY, “HE’S IN EACH ATOM AND THE WHOLE COSMOS;” OTHERS SAY, “HE HAS NO BEGINNING OR END.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
17 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
SADHU, CONSIDER THIS:
RIDE IN A BOAT AND DROWN MIDSTREAM; HELPLESS, GET ACROSS.
REACH THE TOWN BY SOME BACK WAY; GET LOOTED ON THE HIGHWAY.
BY ONE ROPE ALL GET TIED, BOTH THE BOUND AND THE FREE.
ENTER YOUR TEMPLE; BE BATHED FROM ALL SIDES. WHO REMAINS WITHOUT STAYS DRY.
CHOP OFF THE HEAD FOR ETERNAL JOY; AN UNCHOPPED HEAD IS SUFFERING.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Why go to others?
18 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall
I’M IN A MUDDLE.
YOU RESOLVE IT, BHAGWAN. WHEN YOU ARE MINE,
WHY GO TO OTHERS? IS MIND GREATER THAN WHAT’S MINDING MIND? IS RAM GREATER THAN HE WHO KNOWS RAM?
IS BRAHMA GREATER THAN WHAT HE AROSE FROM?
ARE THE VEDAS GREATER THAN THEIR VERY SOURCE?
SAYS KABIR:
I’M SO CONFUSED.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Relax in joy
19 January 1975 am in Buddha Hall LORD OF DEATH TURNS INTO RAM. MISERY GONE, I RELAX IN JOY.
FOE REVERSED BECOMES A FRIEND;
FIENDS ARE SEEN AS GENTLE MEN. NOW, FOR ME, ALL IS BLESSED.
KNOWING BHAGWAN, SILENCE DESCENDS. A MILLION PROBLEMS IN THE BODY
TURN INTO JOYFUL, SIMPLE SAMADHI.
A RECOGNIZING DEEP WITHIN MY HEART: DISEASE NO MORE AFFECTS ME.</description>

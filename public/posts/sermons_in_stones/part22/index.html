YOU ARE A PERFECT MASTER. HOW IS IT THAT WESTERN AND EASTERN PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZING YOU? DO THESE HUMAN SCIENTISTS FEEL JEALOUS AND OFFENDED BY YOU? PLEASE COMMENT.\nThere are many things to be understood.\nFirst, the psychology that prevails all over the world is Western psychology. Eastern psychology has been completely forgotten. Even in Eastern universities, everything is from the West – borrowed, second-hand – particularly with psychology.\nBut the East has devoted thousands of years to human consciousness and it has come to very basic realizations about human evolution. To ignore Eastern psychology is to ignore man’s future and his evolution. Because nature has completed its work. Nature cannot go beyond man; it has come to its ultimate production. Now, the whole burden of evolution is on human shoulders.\nBut unfortunately, Western psychology is materialistic, which means it denies man a soul, a spirit, a being which is immortal beyond this framework of your body.\nThis happened because of a natural historical coincidence. All the sciences are about matter. Physics is about the most interior constituents of matter – so is chemistry, so is the whole panorama\n304\nof human scientific endeavor. Psychology is in wrong company. All these sciences are studying objects. Psychology’s world is the subjectivity of man, not the objects around him.\nBut because in these three hundred years sciences have been developing on a materialist basis... and they have been succeeding, the very word scientific has become prestigious. Just to say that something is “scientific” is enough to say that is right. Once you hear the word scientific, you have already agreed, there is no question of argument anymore. If science has established something, then there is no need to doubt it. The scientists themselves have doubted enough and have tried from every possible angle; if they have come to a conclusion, it must be so.\nIn the midst of scientific progress, psychology was born. Naturally, it chose to be part of scientific growth.\nAnother thing has been happening for three hundred years: Christianity has been behaving with scientists and science in a very crude, primitive, superstitious, illogical, violent way. And because science went on succeeding in spite of the opposition of the religions, the religions lost their prestige, their credit, and science became the only rightful search for truth. In such an atmosphere, psychology was born.\nEverybody was trying to prove that whatever he was doing was scientific; unless it was scientific, it would not be accepted by humanity at large.\nAnd you can see the dichotomy in the very name of psychology. Psychology means the science of the soul. But the scientific attitude is to deny the existence of the soul, because there is no possibility of catching hold of it. There is no possibility of dissecting it, no possibility of taking it into the lab and doing all kinds of experiments before they can say yes, there is something like the soul, which is immortal. Because it is invisible. All forces are invisible, all energies are invisible. Energies and forces are known not by themselves, because they are not visible. They are known by their effects, because the effects are visible.\nNobody knows what electricity is – not even Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered it. But everybody knows how to switch it on, how to switch it off. Electricity, as energy, is not visible. You are seeing the light but the light is not electricity, it is an effect of its presence. We infer that electricity must be there because the light is on.\nAnd there is enough evidence that the soul must be there in man because there are so many effects indicating towards it. Without a soul, man is a machine. But have you ever heard of machines revolting? going through a communist revolution? – machines throwing away one government, creating another government? No, machines are not concerned. They are not even prejudiced. They will work perfectly under communism, they will work perfectly under capitalism... to them, there is no question because there is no consciousness. A machine cannot say: “I cannot do this because this is immoral, criminal.” If machines could do that, there would be no war – because no weapon will agree with your politicians.\nIf the atom bomb had been asked whether it wanted to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the bomb would have laughed: “Why should I destroy? They have done no harm to me. In fact, I don’t know those people; there is no reason at all for me to destroy them. And I refuse to be a slave in an act which is irrational.”\nMachines don’t think, don’t have consciousness, don’t have a heart, don’t feel.\nIt is certain that man is not a machine because he has qualities which machines don’t have. Those qualities are indicative of a certain mysterious phenomenon inside, at the very center of our being – a flame of light, a flame of awareness. But science will accept it only if your consciousness can be put into their test tubes, if they can play around with your consciousness. But this, by the very nature of consciousness, is impossible.\nPsychology accepted a very stupid definition: that it is a science. If I am allowed to rename it – and I have the right because I have renamed more people than anybody has ever done in the whole of history! so renaming is something which I have been doing continuously for years – I would call it parapsychology. In the East, it has been parapsychology: psychology of the beyond. And man has so much space beyond himself – the whole universe – that to give him a definition, to say that he is just matter, is to reduce him to the lowest denominator. Only his body is matter, the house in which he lives.\nHe is not the body and he is not the mind: he is beyond both.\nWestern psychologists, thinkers and philosophers are very well acquainted with my thinking, but strangely enough, very few of them seem to have guts to stand against the vested interests.\nOne of my sannyasins, a world-famous economist, received the Nobel prize three years ago and naturally, when he received the Nobel prize and the honor, the first idea in his mind was: “Will it ever be possible for these people to understand Osho and recognize him?”\nHe asked the president of the Nobel Prize Committee... and now that he is a Nobel prize winner he can propose anybody’s name – only a member of the Nobel committee can propose a name. So he asked the president: “You have also been reading Osho, why is everybody silent about this man? We should take the matter in hand. His books should be considered for a Nobel prize.”\nThe president of the committee said, “Say it in such a way that nobody else hears – at least, his name should not be heard by anybody. I love the man. I know you love the man, and I know a few more people love him; but it is almost impossible for the committee to decide to give him a Nobel prize because this committee consists of people who have already brought names given by their governments.\n“Osho has no government. On the contrary, all the governments are against him; all the religions are against him. And these people here cannot gather enough courage to be against the religions and against the governments, to go against the rich people who are dominating and to propose Osho’s name. But I would suggest you not get into trouble, because there will be international pressure not to give him the Nobel prize. I have received a few suggestions to give him the Nobel prize but I have received a hundred times more letters saying, ‘Be alert! This man should not get the award!’ And I don’t want to get involved in a worldwide controversy.\n“The moment you offer this man’s name there will be a worldwide controversy about it. I am a non- controversial man.” All politicians are non-controversial. They cannot afford to be controversial. It needs a lion’s heart, and your politicians are simply rats.\nThere must also be some jealousy involved in it, because I am the only man, with the whole world against him, homelessThey can manage to crucify me. And in fact, I belong to the category of\npeople who have been crucified. I don’t belong to the Nobel prize winners. My prize can be only like the poison to Socrates, crucifixion to Jesus, death to Al-Hillaj Mansoor – those are my rewards.\nSo they are unnecessarily jealous. Even if they decide to give me the Nobel prize, I refuse it beforehand – in advance. I don’t want to take any chances. I don’t have any respect for your rewards or your prizes.\nI was a student in the university, participating in an all-India debate – almost fifty universities were participating. Knowing that I cannot speak very loudly, that if there are ten thousand people, I cannot reach them, they played a trick: they removed the microphone. At least one thing became certain: I am not going to get the first prize. Because only the first two or three rows in front of me could hear me, and the judges were sitting behind – they would not be able to hear a single word. The mike was there. When I arrived it was being used – the president, the vice-chancellor of that university, were speaking.\nAnd then they started whispering to each other.\nI was sitting just behind them. I figured out that they are thinking to remove the mike so that at least I could not get the first prize. Anybody else could get it, that did not matter.\nThey had put my name first, so I said, “I am not interested in any prize, so include me out!” And I took the mike and I said, “I will use my time to talk to the students and to the staff. You need not be worried, just cancel my name on your list of people who are going to win the prize. I think now there is no problem for you if I use the mike.”\nI used the mike. I reached every judge and every person and in the end I said: “This was a conspiracy, because I speak slowly. I am not a street orator. I would ask you – the ten thousand people: students, professors, invited guests – what do you want? Should I remain on the list or should I drop the idea of the prize?”\nThey all raised their hands saying, “You should remain on the list.” And the whole thing turned completely upside down because only I used the mike and nobody else used the mike, so the judges could not hear anybody.\nOne judge told me: “This has been so hilarious! What they wanted turned out just the opposite. We were very happy that you managed well.\nWe wanted to hear you; we have come to hear you – not to hear all these childish debaters.”\nThe same is the situation with awards all over the world: childish people, for reasons of politics, are getting Nobel prizes. These people may be famous intellectually but they are not people of genius. They are not people who have love in their hearts, justice, fairness. There is jealousy, and it takes such stupid forms that you cannot believe it.\nOne man has written a letter to the German parliament that I am a hidden Catholic and in fact, I am working to spread Christianity, Catholicism. Now even Christ must have laughed, although he is\nnot a fellow who would even smile, but at this point he must have laughed. Because I am a hidden Catholic, I should not be allowed in Germany. This is the intelligentsia! But because I have been against our so-called intelligentsia too, the problem has become more complicated.\nI am all for intelligence and not at all for intellect and I make a very clear-cut distinction between the two. Intellect is part of the mind – you can go on becoming bigger and bigger and more and more knowledgeable by accumulating information: you will be thought a great intellectual. These are the people who constitute our intelligentsia. All that they know is borrowed.\nIntelligence arises only when meditation has blossomed. It is the fragrance of your silence – the song of your silence. It is a totally different thing because its source is different.\nIntellect functions as part of the mind, intelligence functions when mind stops functioning.\nIntelligent people around the world are with me and that’s what counts. I don’t care about the crowd. My only concern is about those few people who have intelligence enough to enter deeper into their being, because as they open up more and more inside they start changing on the outside. One day, suddenly there is an awakened being and all his actions are full of the light, of the beauty, of the truth of what he has attained within himself.\nThey are with me. They have been coming from all over the world. All the governments are preventing them, but whenever there is something valuable, something so valuable that all those powerful people look like pygmies in comparison, they are naturally afraid. They would not like me to exist.\nBut now it is too late. If they do any harm to me they will destroy their own society, their own economic structure; they will destroy their own prestige, their own credibility. And they will not harm my cause, they will help it immensely.\nI don’t want their Nobel prizes – just a small crucifixion will do. I would have preferred an electric chair but to carry an electric chair to the place does not suit me. And it is less dramatic too. A wooden cross is far more dramatic.\nThey are full of jealousy on every point because none of them has been able to answer all my criticisms of the past and its history. They are irritated also because they cannot find any way to somehow put a stop to my increasing number of friends and increasing number of enemies. Both are mine; they both relate to me. Without me, both would be at a loss. Somebody would lose a friend, somebody would lose an enemy – the whole world would be at a loss.\nBut my people are going to change the whole situation – not by any effort, but just by living the way I have been showing you. You are going to be my ultimate witnesses. Whether I was right or wrong will be decided by your actions, by your being.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SEEM TO MIXING TOGETHER ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS. IT’S LIKE PUZZLE PIECES, WHERE ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER PERFECTLY IN THE END. IS THIS ONE EXAMPLE OF THE ONENESS OF ALL?\nThe truth is, with numbers, at the most I can remember up to three. After that, I don’t know what number comes.\nSecondly, all the questions that I choose have a certain coherence, a certain inner unity. It may not be apparent to you.\nWhen I speak, if I go into one question in absolute detail, then I cannot deal with another question on that day. One question will be enough for two and a half hours. So I have my way; I introduce the first question, answer its essential points; then I take the second question, answer its essential points, and if there is any point there that can emphasize something in the first question, I bring in the first question again. And it is not done in any systematic way because I have not prepared it. It is just my sensitivity and my spontaneity. I simply go with whatever response arises in me.\nSo my answer to five questions is like a spiral: I may come to the first question many times but in the end, all those five questions and the answers given to them will make a whole answer. Perhaps those five questions were five aspects of one question that you are not aware of. Because in fact, there is only one question. We can ask millions of questions but the answer is one – there is no way to have many answers.\nBecause the basic question is one, hence the basic answer is one – the remaining is just play.\nYes, they will all fit like a puzzle in a deep harmony – but while I am answering you, I’m more concerned with you than with your question. I am more concerned with the answer than with the questions. I am more concerned to bring all the questions to a certain synthesis so that the one answer can be acceptable.\nAnd these problems are there: I cannot remember. I try my best... up to three I somehow manage. By that time, it is enough. Then I start using the wrong numbers. My memory is not very good.\nSo while I am answering a question – and your questions are not simply one question. Each of your questions can be divided into three or four or five questions. So I start answering one – by the time I have answered it, I have forgotten the other three or four. Rather than waiting for them to come back, I proceed to the second question.\nSometimes, while answering the second question, I start remembering what has been left incomplete in the first, so I have to complete it in the second. By that time, I have forgotten what the second question was all about. So I wait – perhaps in the third question, when I am answering it – some word, some sentence, some story, may remind me.\nIt has been working perfectly well.\nSo you get all the answers – even those which are not visible on the surface. But this is not a prepared sermon. This is not a lecture in a university. I know professors who have been using the\nnotes that they have taken in class when they were students. They have been using the same notes in teaching for thirty years. So much water has gone down the Ganges in thirty years, but they are not aware.\nI also feel it’s really amazing that by the end, slowly slowly, everything that has been forgotten anywhere comes to my mind, and I say okay to Maneesha only when I feel okay.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nSITTING WITH YOU, EVERY CELL IN MY BODY STARTS DANCING AND SINGING ‘HE IS HERE! HE IS HERE!’ AND I FEEL HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING. AND THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY, MY DEEP LONGING AND THE FULFILLMENT OF IT TOUCH EACH OTHER AND SOMETHING VERY DEEP IN ME STARTS RELAXING. STILL NOW, AFTER BEING A SANNYASIN FOR FOUR YEARS, I SOMETIMES CAN ALMOST NOT BELIEVE IT – THAT THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING, THAT THIS IS NOT A DREAM AND THAT NOW, TODAY, I REALLY SIT AT THE FEET OF MY MASTER AND MY HEART IS OVERFLOWING, TEARS AND LAUGHING MELT TOGETHER. BELOVED OSHO, I DO NOT KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU OR ANY OTHER MASTER, BUT I KNOW I HAVE BEEN WAITING, WAITING FOR SO LONG. IF SOMEBODY HAS BEEN WITH A MASTER, CAN HE FALL BACK AGAIN IN DARKNESS, LIKE I WAS IN BEFORE TAKING SANNYAS? THANK YOU, BELOVED MASTER AND FRIEND. EVERY DAY YOU ARE STILL HERE IS A GIFT FOR ME.\nThe first thing: Anything achieved in any life as far as conscious growth is concerned, remains with you. And whenever you start the search again, you will start from the point where you had stopped in some past life.\nBut it depends on a very subtle point – whether you have achieved something or just believed that you have achieved. If you have just believed, it is not going to be with you in the next life. You will have to start from scratch.\nAs far as you are concerned, because you feel this tremendous quality of waiting, that you have been waiting and waiting and waiting for long, that means you have never been with a master in the past but you have been a seeker, a long time seeker in the past. But you were seeking on your own, a lonely wanderer in search of the miraculous. Because you were not with any master, not with any school where many people were working together for their inner consolidation, you don’t have any memory of such a thing. You have only one feeling, of waiting. That shows that for many lives you have been waiting.\nAnd perhaps the time has come and now you may not need to wait anymore because I am ready to give you that which you have been seeking – whether you know or not. You may not know exactly, precisely what you are seeking, but one thing is certain: that you are incomplete, you are hollow, you are utterly, negatively empty. This much is certain: that you are not complete and entire. Hence, you are waiting for something to make you whole.\nThat time has come.\nYour love, your gratitude, your trust in me shows that unknowingly, you were searching for a master who does not belong to the old but belongs to the future.\nEvery intelligent person is searching for the master who belongs to the future. Idiots are searching for masters in the past. The more ancient they are the more valuable they are thought to be.\nNow you can relax. It may have taken many lives to come to me – now remember, going away from me will take even many more lives. So it is better now to settle. Wandering is good, but only to a limit. You have wandered enough. It is time to retire from this wandering.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nIT IS SAID “IF YOU MEET A MAN ON A HIGHER LEVEL OF BEING THAN YOUR OWN, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HIM.” THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND US SEEMS SO INFINITE. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, OSHO?\nIt is true. If you meet a man of a higher development in consciousness, you will not be able to understand the man; communication will be almost impossible. But you are saying and seeing only one side of the phenomenon.\nYou will not be able to understand a man of higher consciousness but he will understand you – more than you understand yourself. He has passed through the same stages that you are passing. He’s well-acquainted with the whole territory and he is standing on a high place from where he can see far and wide.\nOn your part, if you can understand only this much – that understanding will be difficult because his consciousness is higher – then your question will be: “First raise my consciousness so that I am at a point from where communication is possible.” You will not ask other questions because his answers will not make sense to you. The only question you can ask is: “I am here, ready. Give me a lift!” And this can be done.\nThis is actually what is being done here.\nYour meditations, my sittings with you, your own individual efforts – all together are creating only a higher consciousness in you. And whether you understand me or not is immaterial – I understand you perfectly well.\nYou may be blind, I am not. And I am holding your hand tight – so you may not be able to find the door yourself, but just don’t try to escape!\nAllow me to hold your hand. I will take you out of the door into the open.\nThe greatest problem is not that you don’t understand what comes from a higher consciousness. The greater problem is, you think that if you cannot understand him that means he is talking nonsense. You have closed the doors. The sun has come even up to your door – you close the door in the very face of the sun.\nThe sun will come again tomorrow morning. People like me don’t get tired because you have not been listening, you have been closing the door, you have been rejecting. The person with the higher consciousness understands it – that these are all childish ways of protecting one’s ego. He is not going to be angry with you.\nIn these thirty years, I must have passed millions of people – talked about their problems, given them every help they wanted for their further growth: instructions, disciplines. But while the person was listening, I was also aware to what category the person belongs: Is he listening or is he just being polite, and deep down he thinks he knows everything? He need not bother about meditation. He need not think about changing his lifestyle so that the new consciousness becomes easier to grow.\nWith the old lifestyle it is difficult, it is almost like a rose bush growing in stones and rocks. Once in a while it happens, but that is not the rule – that is the exception. And you should always remember the rule, not the exception.\nI can see while I am talking to you whether you are closed. If I see that somehow your closed doors can be opened, that perhaps you can be persuaded – if not for spiritual growth then for something else; perhaps for a tantra group... just get caught in the net, then I will see – once you are caught things go on becoming easier.\nThere is a point of no return. And you all have to remember when that point comes in your life that you cannot go away from me, that it has become impossible. That even if I leave the body, it will not make any difference.\nYou have found your master, and the master has found his disciple. And this is the greatest discovery there is.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nMY FATHER SAYS THAT YOU CANNOT BE AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON BECAUSE YOU TELL SO MANY DIRTY JOKES. DO YOU HAVE A JOKE TO TELL MY DAD?\nYour father is right. That’s why I have gone beyond enlightenment – now I can tell dirty jokes. Just because of enlightenment, I am not going to leave telling dirty jokes. But tell your father that to an enlightened man no joke is dirty. Either it is meaningful or meaningless, but no joke is dirty.\nWhy have jokes been called dirty? Just small things, but they carry so much past history. Because man’s body below the belt is dirty. It is a stupid idea, because your whole body functions as a single unit, it is not divided anywhere. Your blood is circulating continually, twenty-four hours a day. The blood that was in the brain is now in the feet. In the brain, it was not dirty. In the feet, my God! And it is the same blood!\nBecause sex has become condemned by religions, any joke that has any relationship with sex has become dirty. It is their attitude about sex that makes the joke dirty. Otherwise, ask your father what is dirty in it. Ask him to pinpoint it.\nAnd the greatest miracle in the world is that your father could give birth to you. Perhaps he has given birth to many others. He can make love but a joke about love becomes dirty. The action is perfectly alright, your father doing all kinds of gymnastics is right. Without those gymnastics you would not be here, but a joke about it is wrong.\nWhat kind of society are we living in? There seems to be no rationality.\nA young boy went to the bathroom in the night. He had to pass through his parents’ room and the boy saw the mother was performing fellatio on the father – look up in the dictionary what fellatio is, because I will not tell you the meaning – and the boy came out of the room scratching his head and saying, “These people sent me to the doctor because I was sucking my thumb!”\nAnd these are the people – in the morning they will be in church, all holy. But an innocent joke will be condemned as dirty.\nWhy are so many jokes related to sex? Why have they become dirty? Because sex has been suppressed and condemned. This condemnation and this continuous repression has made everything related to sex, dirty. But the whole condemnation is wrong.\nAnd your father must have suppressed his sexual instincts, because in my books, he found only dirty jokes! He could not find any method of meditation? He could not find something that could give him more maturity, more integrity, more individuality?\nIt happened that Dr. Johnson wrote a very exhaustive dictionary of the English language. Of the old dictionaries, his is the best. The book was published and on the second day – it had just been in the stores for one day – on the second day, three old women, seventy, seventy-five, eighty, they reached Johnson’s house and they said, “So you are the fellow who has written that dirty dictionary!”\nHe said, “Dirty? What do you mean by dirty dictionary? Everybody is praising it, saying that it is the best dictionary!”\nThe women said, “Those people don’t know what is inside. There are three words which are dirty!” A twelve-hundred-page dictionaryThose three old women did a great search – the whole night it\nseems – and they found only three words!\nDr. Johnson said, “It seems you were looking only for these words. There are thousands of words in that dictionary, how did you manage to find these three words? Unless you were looking for them, there is no other possibility.”\nBut why should a seventy, eighty-year-old woman look for some dirty word, some obscene word? It gives some kind of satisfaction. Even when old people become unable to experience love in the biological sense, still the urge is there. But that urge starts expressing itself in condemnation. So you remain holy, pure and you can condemn. But your very interest in it shows something deeper about your mind.\nA joke for your fatherespecially for your father!\nAn old man went to a doctor and he said, “Do something! Give me some injections to make me sexually powerful.”\nThe doctor said, “Pop, how you old are?” He said, “I’m only ninety.”\nThe doctor said, “Ninety?” He said, “Okay, let me first examine you. Show me your sexual organs.” The old man took out his tongue and one finger.\nThe doctor said, “What is the matter? This tongue and this finger?”\nHe said, “Yes, doctor. These have been my sexual organs for forty years.” So tell your father that before such a condition comes, enjoy a little!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5216","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/>Sermons in Stones</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">22 The greatest discovery there is</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5216 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sermons_in_Stones/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

YOU HAVE THE KNOW-HOW TO TRANSFORM IT. YOU ARE A PERFECT MASTER. HOW IS
IT THAT WESTERN AND EASTERN PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZING YOU? DO
THESE HUMAN SCIENTISTS FEEL JEALOUS AND OFFENDED BY YOU? PLEASE
COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many things to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the psychology that prevails all over the world is Western
psychology. Eastern psychology has been completely forgotten. Even in
Eastern universities, everything is from the West – borrowed,
second-hand – particularly with psychology.</p><p><br></p><p>But the East has devoted thousands of years to human consciousness
and it has come to very basic realizations about human evolution. To
ignore Eastern psychology is to ignore man’s future and his evolution.
Because nature has completed its work. Nature cannot go beyond man; it
has come to its ultimate production. Now, the whole burden of evolution
is on human shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>But unfortunately, Western psychology is materialistic, which means
it denies man a soul, a spirit, a being which is immortal beyond this
framework of your body.</p><p><br></p><p>This happened because of a natural historical coincidence. All the
sciences are about matter. Physics is about the most interior
constituents of matter – so is chemistry, so is the whole panorama</p><p><br></p><p>304</p><p>of human scientific endeavor. Psychology is in wrong company. All
these sciences are studying objects. Psychology’s world is the
subjectivity of man, not the objects around him.</p><p><br></p><p>But because in these three hundred years sciences have been
developing on a materialist basis... and they have been succeeding, the
very word scientific has become prestigious. Just to say that something
is “scientific” is enough to say that is right. Once you hear the word
scientific, you have already agreed, there is no question of argument
anymore. If science has established something, then there is no need to
doubt it. The scientists themselves have doubted enough and have tried
from every possible angle; if they have come to a conclusion, it must be
so.</p><p><br></p><p>In the midst of scientific progress, psychology was born. Naturally,
it chose to be part of scientific growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing has been happening for three hundred years:
Christianity has been behaving with scientists and science in a very
crude, primitive, superstitious, illogical, violent way. And because
science went on succeeding in spite of the opposition of the religions,
the religions lost their prestige, their credit, and science became the
only rightful search for truth. In such an atmosphere, psychology was
born.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody was trying to prove that whatever he was doing was
scientific; unless it was scientific, it would not be accepted by
humanity at large.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can see the dichotomy in the very name of psychology.
Psychology means the science of the soul. But the scientific attitude is
to deny the existence of the soul, because there is no possibility of
catching hold of it. There is no possibility of dissecting it, no
possibility of taking it into the lab and doing all kinds of experiments
before they can say yes, there is something like the soul, which is
immortal. Because it is invisible. All forces are invisible, all
energies are invisible. Energies and forces are known not by themselves,
because they are not visible. They are known by their effects, because
the effects are visible.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody knows what electricity is – not even Thomas Alva Edison, who
discovered it. But everybody knows how to switch it on, how to switch it
off. Electricity, as energy, is not visible. You are seeing the light
but the light is not electricity, it is an effect of its presence. We
infer that electricity must be there because the light is on.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is enough evidence that the soul must be there in man
because there are so many effects indicating towards it. Without a soul,
man is a machine. But have you ever heard of machines revolting? going
through a communist revolution? – machines throwing away one government,
creating another government? No, machines are not concerned. They are
not even prejudiced. They will work perfectly under communism, they will
work perfectly under capitalism... to them, there is no question because
there is no consciousness. A machine cannot say: “I cannot do this
because this is immoral, criminal.” If machines could do that, there
would be no war – because no weapon will agree with your
politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>If the atom bomb had been asked whether it wanted to destroy
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the bomb would have laughed: “Why should I
destroy? They have done no harm to me. In fact, I don’t know those
people; there is no reason at all for me to destroy them. And I refuse
to be a slave in an act which is irrational.”</p><p>Machines don’t think, don’t have consciousness, don’t have a heart,
don’t feel.</p><p><br></p><p>It is certain that man is not a machine because he has qualities
which machines don’t have. Those qualities are indicative of a certain
mysterious phenomenon inside, at the very center of our being – a flame
of light, a flame of awareness. But science will accept it only if your
consciousness can be put into their test tubes, if they can play around
with your consciousness. But this, by the very nature of consciousness,
is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychology accepted a very stupid definition: that it is a science.
If I am allowed to rename it – and I have the right because I have
renamed more people than anybody has ever done in the whole of history!
so renaming is something which I have been doing continuously for years
– I would call it parapsychology. In the East, it has been
parapsychology: psychology of the beyond. And man has so much space
beyond himself – the whole universe – that to give him a definition, to
say that he is just matter, is to reduce him to the lowest denominator.
Only his body is matter, the house in which he lives.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not the body and he is not the mind: he is beyond both.</p><p><br></p><p>Western psychologists, thinkers and philosophers are very well
acquainted with my thinking, but strangely enough, very few of them seem
to have guts to stand against the vested interests.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my sannyasins, a world-famous economist, received the Nobel
prize three years ago and naturally, when he received the Nobel prize
and the honor, the first idea in his mind was: “Will it ever be possible
for these people to understand Osho and recognize him?”</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the president of the Nobel Prize Committee... and now that
he is a Nobel prize winner he can propose anybody’s name – only a member
of the Nobel committee can propose a name. So he asked the president:
“You have also been reading Osho, why is everybody silent about this
man? We should take the matter in hand. His books should be considered
for a Nobel prize.”</p><p><br></p><p>The president of the committee said, “Say it in such a way that
nobody else hears – at least, his name should not be heard by anybody. I
love the man. I know you love the man, and I know a few more people love
him; but it is almost impossible for the committee to decide to give him
a Nobel prize because this committee consists of people who have already
brought names given by their governments.</p><p><br></p><p>“Osho has no government. On the contrary, all the governments are
against him; all the religions are against him. And these people here
cannot gather enough courage to be against the religions and against the
governments, to go against the rich people who are dominating and to
propose Osho’s name. But I would suggest you not get into trouble,
because there will be international pressure not to give him the Nobel
prize. I have received a few suggestions to give him the Nobel prize but
I have received a hundred times more letters saying, ‘Be alert! This man
should not get the award!’ And I don’t want to get involved in a
worldwide controversy.</p><p><br></p><p>“The moment you offer this man’s name there will be a worldwide
controversy about it. I am a non- controversial man.” All politicians
are non-controversial. They cannot afford to be controversial. It needs
a lion’s heart, and your politicians are simply rats.</p><p>There must also be some jealousy involved in it, because I am the
only man, with the whole world against him, homeless<span class=s4></span>They can manage to crucify me. And in fact, I belong
to the category of</p><p>people who have been crucified. I don’t belong to the Nobel prize
winners. My prize can be only like the poison to Socrates, crucifixion
to Jesus, death to Al-Hillaj Mansoor – those are my rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>So they are unnecessarily jealous. Even if they decide to give me the
Nobel prize, I refuse it beforehand – in advance. I don’t want to take
any chances. I don’t have any respect for your rewards or your
prizes.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a student in the university, participating in an all-India
debate – almost fifty universities were participating. Knowing that I
cannot speak very loudly, that if there are ten thousand people, I
cannot reach them, they played a trick: they removed the microphone. At
least one thing became certain: I am not going to get the first prize.
Because only the first two or three rows in front of me could hear me,
and the judges were sitting behind – they would not be able to hear a
single word. The mike was there. When I arrived it was being used – the
president, the vice-chancellor of that university, were speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>And then they started whispering to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I was sitting just behind them. I figured out that they are thinking
to remove the mike so that at least I could not get the first prize.
Anybody else could get it, that did not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>They had put my name first, so I said, “I am not interested in any
prize, so include me out!” And I took the mike and I said, “I will use
my time to talk to the students and to the staff. You need not be
worried, just cancel my name on your list of people who are going to win
the prize. I think now there is no problem for you if I use the
mike.”</p><p><br></p><p>I used the mike. I reached every judge and every person and in the
end I said: “This was a conspiracy, because I speak slowly. I am not a
street orator. I would ask you – the ten thousand people: students,
professors, invited guests – what do you want? Should I remain on the
list or should I drop the idea of the prize?”</p><p><br></p><p>They all raised their hands saying, “You should remain on the list.”
And the whole thing turned completely upside down because only I used
the mike and nobody else used the mike, so the judges could not hear
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>One judge told me: “This has been so hilarious! What they wanted
turned out just the opposite. We were very happy that you managed
well.</p><p><br></p><p>We wanted to hear you; we have come to hear you – not to hear all
these childish debaters.”</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the situation with awards all over the world: childish
people, for reasons of politics, are getting Nobel prizes. These people
may be famous intellectually but they are not people of genius. They are
not people who have love in their hearts, justice, fairness. There is
jealousy, and it takes such stupid forms that you cannot believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>One man has written a letter to the German parliament that I am a
hidden Catholic and in fact, I am working to spread Christianity,
Catholicism. Now even Christ must have laughed, although he is</p><p>not a fellow who would even smile, but at this point he must have
laughed. Because I am a hidden Catholic, I should not be allowed in
Germany. This is the intelligentsia! But because I have been against our
so-called intelligentsia too, the problem has become more
complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>I am all for intelligence and not at all for intellect and I make a
very clear-cut distinction between the two. Intellect is part of the
mind – you can go on becoming bigger and bigger and more and more
knowledgeable by accumulating information: you will be thought a great
intellectual. These are the people who constitute our intelligentsia.
All that they know is borrowed.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence arises only when meditation has blossomed. It is the
fragrance of your silence – the song of your silence. It is a totally
different thing because its source is different.</p><p><br></p><p>Intellect functions as part of the mind, intelligence functions when
mind stops functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligent people around the world are with me and that’s what
counts. I don’t care about the crowd. My only concern is about those few
people who have intelligence enough to enter deeper into their being,
because as they open up more and more inside they start changing on the
outside. One day, suddenly there is an awakened being and all his
actions are full of the light, of the beauty, of the truth of what he
has attained within himself.</p><p><br></p><p>They are with me. They have been coming from all over the world. All
the governments are preventing them, but whenever there is something
valuable, something so valuable that all those powerful people look like
pygmies in comparison, they are naturally afraid. They would not like me
to exist.</p><p><br></p><p>But now it is too late. If they do any harm to me they will destroy
their own society, their own economic structure; they will destroy their
own prestige, their own credibility. And they will not harm my cause,
they will help it immensely.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want their Nobel prizes – just a small crucifixion will do. I
would have preferred an electric chair but to carry an electric chair to
the place does not suit me. And it is less dramatic too. A wooden cross
is far more dramatic.</p><p><br></p><p>They are full of jealousy on every point because none of them has
been able to answer all my criticisms of the past and its history. They
are irritated also because they cannot find any way to somehow put a
stop to my increasing number of friends and increasing number of
enemies. Both are mine; they both relate to me. Without me, both would
be at a loss. Somebody would lose a friend, somebody would lose an enemy
– the whole world would be at a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>But my people are going to change the whole situation – not by any
effort, but just by living the way I have been showing you. You are
going to be my ultimate witnesses. Whether I was right or wrong will be
decided by your actions, by your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SEEM TO MIXING TOGETHER ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS. IT’S LIKE PUZZLE
PIECES, WHERE ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER PERFECTLY IN THE END. IS THIS
ONE EXAMPLE OF THE ONENESS OF ALL?</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is, with numbers, at the most I can remember up to three.
After that, I don’t know what number comes.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, all the questions that I choose have a certain coherence, a
certain inner unity. It may not be apparent to you.</p><p><br></p><p>When I speak, if I go into one question in absolute detail, then I
cannot deal with another question on that day. One question will be
enough for two and a half hours. So I have my way; I introduce the first
question, answer its essential points; then I take the second question,
answer its essential points, and if there is any point there that can
emphasize something in the first question, I bring in the first question
again. And it is not done in any systematic way because I have not
prepared it. It is just my sensitivity and my spontaneity. I simply go
with whatever response arises in me.</p><p><br></p><p>So my answer to five questions is like a spiral: I may come to the
first question many times but in the end, all those five questions and
the answers given to them will make a whole answer. Perhaps those five
questions were five aspects of one question that you are not aware of.
Because in fact, there is only one question. We can ask millions of
questions but the answer is one – there is no way to have many
answers.</p><p><br></p><p>Because the basic question is one, hence the basic answer is one –
the remaining is just play.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, they will all fit like a puzzle in a deep harmony – but while I
am answering you, I’m more concerned with you than with your question. I
am more concerned with the answer than with the questions. I am more
concerned to bring all the questions to a certain synthesis so that the
one answer can be acceptable.</p><p><br></p><p>And these problems are there: I cannot remember. I try my best... up
to three I somehow manage. By that time, it is enough. Then I start
using the wrong numbers. My memory is not very good.</p><p><br></p><p>So while I am answering a question – and your questions are not
simply one question. Each of your questions can be divided into three or
four or five questions. So I start answering one – by the time I have
answered it, I have forgotten the other three or four. Rather than
waiting for them to come back, I proceed to the second question.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, while answering the second question, I start remembering
what has been left incomplete in the first, so I have to complete it in
the second. By that time, I have forgotten what the second question was
all about. So I wait – perhaps in the third question, when I am
answering it – some word, some sentence, some story, may remind me.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been working perfectly well.</p><p><br></p><p>So you get all the answers – even those which are not visible on the
surface. But this is not a prepared sermon. This is not a lecture in a
university. I know professors who have been using the</p><p>notes that they have taken in class when they were students. They
have been using the same notes in teaching for thirty years. So much
water has gone down the Ganges in thirty years, but they are not
aware.</p><p><br></p><p>I also feel it’s really amazing that by the end, slowly slowly,
everything that has been forgotten anywhere comes to my mind, and I say
okay to Maneesha only when I feel okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SITTING WITH YOU, EVERY CELL IN MY BODY STARTS DANCING AND SINGING
‘HE IS HERE! HE IS HERE!’ AND I FEEL HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING. AND
THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY, MY DEEP LONGING AND THE FULFILLMENT OF IT TOUCH EACH
OTHER AND SOMETHING VERY DEEP IN ME STARTS RELAXING. STILL NOW, AFTER
BEING A SANNYASIN FOR FOUR YEARS, I SOMETIMES CAN ALMOST NOT BELIEVE IT
– THAT THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING, THAT THIS IS NOT A DREAM AND THAT NOW,
TODAY, I REALLY SIT AT THE FEET OF MY MASTER AND MY HEART IS
OVERFLOWING, TEARS AND LAUGHING MELT TOGETHER. BELOVED OSHO, I DO NOT
KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU OR ANY OTHER MASTER, BUT I KNOW I HAVE BEEN
WAITING, WAITING FOR SO LONG. IF SOMEBODY HAS BEEN WITH A MASTER, CAN HE
FALL BACK AGAIN IN DARKNESS, LIKE I WAS IN BEFORE TAKING SANNYAS? THANK
YOU, BELOVED MASTER AND FRIEND. EVERY DAY YOU ARE STILL HERE IS A GIFT
FOR ME.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: Anything achieved in any life as far as conscious
growth is concerned, remains with you. And whenever you start the search
again, you will start from the point where you had stopped in some past
life.</p><p><br></p><p>But it depends on a very subtle point – whether you have achieved
something or just believed that you have achieved. If you have just
believed, it is not going to be with you in the next life. You will have
to start from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as you are concerned, because you feel this tremendous quality
of waiting, that you have been waiting and waiting and waiting for long,
that means you have never been with a master in the past but you have
been a seeker, a long time seeker in the past. But you were seeking on
your own, a lonely wanderer in search of the miraculous. Because you
were not with any master, not with any school where many people were
working together for their inner consolidation, you don’t have any
memory of such a thing. You have only one feeling, of waiting. That
shows that for many lives you have been waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>And perhaps the time has come and now you may not need to wait
anymore because I am ready to give you that which you have been seeking
– whether you know or not. You may not know exactly, precisely what you
are seeking, but one thing is certain: that you are incomplete, you are
hollow, you are utterly, negatively empty. This much is certain: that
you are not complete and entire. Hence, you are waiting for something to
make you whole.</p><p><br></p><p>That time has come.</p><p>Your love, your gratitude, your trust in me shows that unknowingly,
you were searching for a master who does not belong to the old but
belongs to the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Every intelligent person is searching for the master who belongs to
the future. Idiots are searching for masters in the past. The more
ancient they are the more valuable they are thought to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you can relax. It may have taken many lives to come to me – now
remember, going away from me will take even many more lives. So it is
better now to settle. Wandering is good, but only to a limit. You have
wandered enough. It is time to retire from this wandering.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IT IS SAID “IF YOU MEET A MAN ON A HIGHER LEVEL OF BEING THAN YOUR
OWN, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HIM.” THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND US SEEMS
SO INFINITE. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, OSHO?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true. If you meet a man of a higher development in
consciousness, you will not be able to understand the man; communication
will be almost impossible. But you are saying and seeing only one side
of the phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not be able to understand a man of higher consciousness but
he will understand you – more than you understand yourself. He has
passed through the same stages that you are passing. He’s
well-acquainted with the whole territory and he is standing on a high
place from where he can see far and wide.</p><p><br></p><p>On your part, if you can understand only this much – that
understanding will be difficult because his consciousness is higher –
then your question will be: “First raise my consciousness so that I am
at a point from where communication is possible.” You will not ask other
questions because his answers will not make sense to you. The only
question you can ask is: “I am here, ready. Give me a lift!” And this
can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>This is actually what is being done here.</p><p><br></p><p>Your meditations, my sittings with you, your own individual efforts –
all together are creating only a higher consciousness in you. And
whether you understand me or not is immaterial – I understand you
perfectly well.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be blind, I am not. And I am holding your hand tight – so you
may not be able to find the door yourself, but just don’t try to
escape!</p><p><br></p><p>Allow me to hold your hand. I will take you out of the door into the
open.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest problem is not that you don’t understand what comes from
a higher consciousness. The greater problem is, you think that if you
cannot understand him that means he is talking nonsense. You have closed
the doors. The sun has come even up to your door – you close the door in
the very face of the sun.</p><p>The sun will come again tomorrow morning. People like me don’t get
tired because you have not been listening, you have been closing the
door, you have been rejecting. The person with the higher consciousness
understands it – that these are all childish ways of protecting one’s
ego. He is not going to be angry with you.</p><p><br></p><p>In these thirty years, I must have passed millions of people – talked
about their problems, given them every help they wanted for their
further growth: instructions, disciplines. But while the person was
listening, I was also aware to what category the person belongs: Is he
listening or is he just being polite, and deep down he thinks he knows
everything? He need not bother about meditation. He need not think about
changing his lifestyle so that the new consciousness becomes easier to
grow.</p><p><br></p><p>With the old lifestyle it is difficult, it is almost like a rose bush
growing in stones and rocks. Once in a while it happens, but that is not
the rule – that is the exception. And you should always remember the
rule, not the exception.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see while I am talking to you whether you are closed. If I see
that somehow your closed doors can be opened, that perhaps you can be
persuaded – if not for spiritual growth then for something else; perhaps
for a tantra group... just get caught in the net, then I will see – once
you are caught things go on becoming easier.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a point of no return. And you all have to remember when that
point comes in your life that you cannot go away from me, that it has
become impossible. That even if I leave the body, it will not make any
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>You have found your master, and the master has found his disciple.
And this is the greatest discovery there is.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MY FATHER SAYS THAT YOU CANNOT BE AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON BECAUSE YOU
TELL SO MANY DIRTY JOKES. DO YOU HAVE A JOKE TO TELL MY DAD?</p><p><br></p><p>Your father is right. That’s why I have gone beyond enlightenment –
now I can tell dirty jokes. Just because of enlightenment, I am not
going to leave telling dirty jokes. But tell your father that to an
enlightened man no joke is dirty. Either it is meaningful or
meaningless, but no joke is dirty.</p><p><br></p><p>Why have jokes been called dirty? Just small things, but they carry
so much past history. Because man’s body below the belt is dirty. It is
a stupid idea, because your whole body functions as a single unit, it is
not divided anywhere. Your blood is circulating continually, twenty-four
hours a day. The blood that was in the brain is now in the feet. In the
brain, it was not dirty. In the feet, my God! And it is the same
blood!</p><p><br></p><p>Because sex has become condemned by religions, any joke that has any
relationship with sex has become dirty. It is their attitude about sex
that makes the joke dirty. Otherwise, ask your father what is dirty in
it. Ask him to pinpoint it.</p><p>And the greatest miracle in the world is that your father could give
birth to you. Perhaps he has given birth to many others. He can make
love but a joke about love becomes dirty. The action is perfectly
alright, your father doing all kinds of gymnastics is right. Without
those gymnastics you would not be here, but a joke about it is
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of society are we living in? There seems to be no
rationality.</p><p><br></p><p>A young boy went to the bathroom in the night. He had to pass through
his parents’ room and the boy saw the mother was performing fellatio on
the father – look up in the dictionary what fellatio is, because I will
not tell you the meaning – and the boy came out of the room scratching
his head and saying, “These people sent me to the doctor because I was
sucking my thumb!”</p><p><br></p><p>And these are the people – in the morning they will be in church, all
holy. But an innocent joke will be condemned as dirty.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are so many jokes related to sex? Why have they become dirty?
Because sex has been suppressed and condemned. This condemnation and
this continuous repression has made everything related to sex, dirty.
But the whole condemnation is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>And your father must have suppressed his sexual instincts, because in
my books, he found only dirty jokes! He could not find any method of
meditation? He could not find something that could give him more
maturity, more integrity, more individuality?</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that Dr. Johnson wrote a very exhaustive dictionary of
the English language. Of the old dictionaries, his is the best. The book
was published and on the second day – it had just been in the stores for
one day – on the second day, three old women, seventy, seventy-five,
eighty, they reached Johnson’s house and they said, “So you are the
fellow who has written that dirty dictionary!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Dirty? What do you mean by dirty dictionary? Everybody is
praising it, saying that it is the best dictionary!”</p><p>The women said, “Those people don’t know what is inside. There are
three words which are dirty!” A twelve-hundred-page dictionary<span class=s4></span>Those three old women did a great search – the whole
night it</p><p>seems – and they found only three words!</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Johnson said, “It seems you were looking only for these words.
There are thousands of words in that dictionary, how did you manage to
find these three words? Unless you were looking for them, there is no
other possibility.”</p><p><br></p><p>But why should a seventy, eighty-year-old woman look for some dirty
word, some obscene word? It gives some kind of satisfaction. Even when
old people become unable to experience love in the biological sense,
still the urge is there. But that urge starts expressing itself in
condemnation. So you remain holy, pure and you can condemn. But your
very interest in it shows something deeper about your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>A joke for your father<span class=s4></span>especially for your
father!</p><p>An old man went to a doctor and he said, “Do something! Give me some
injections to make me sexually powerful.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor said, “Pop, how you old are?” He said, “I’m only
ninety.”</p><p>The doctor said, “Ninety?” He said, “Okay, let me first examine you.
Show me your sexual organs.” The old man took out his tongue and one
finger.</p><p>The doctor said, “What is the matter? This tongue and this
finger?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, doctor. These have been my sexual organs for forty
years.” So tell your father that before such a condition comes, enjoy a
little!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

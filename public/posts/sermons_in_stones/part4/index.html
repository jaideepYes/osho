I REALIZED THEN THAT GRATITUDE IS SOMETHING THAT WE USUALLY FEEL ALMOST BURDENED WITH, AND SO WE SEEK TO FIND AN OUTLET FOR IT SO THAT WE ARE RELIEVED OF A DEBT. AS THE DISCIPLE CAN’T EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE – AND WHAT WOULD THE MASTER DO WITH IT ANYWAY? – IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT COULD BECOME A KIND OF QUALITY IN SOMEONE THAT COULD TRANSFORM THEM. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nManeesha, the path of the mystic is the path of growing qualities, of transforming the quantitative into the qualitative. For example, love can be a quantity – and as love is understood in the world of sleeping people, it is a quantity; hence, it is followed by jealousy.\nIf I love you, you are in continuous fear that I may start loving somebody else too.\nAnd with the love divided, you will not be getting the same quantity you were getting before.\nJealousy is nothing but an expression that love is still a quantity in your mind: shared, it becomes less; shared with many people, you are getting less and less. Hence a monopoly is needed, so that you can have the whole lot of it.\nAnd both of the lovers – because of this stupid idea – are suspicious, are always spying on each other. If your husband sees you laughing with somebody else, even that is enough to create a quarrel, a conflict, a fight. Your laughter is his monopoly. You cannot smile anywhere else, you cannot be joyful with somebody else; you are confined to an imprisonment. And the same way you are confined, you are jailed, in return you are creating a jail for your jailer. All lovers are functioning as jailers to each other.\nHence, love promises so many roses but brings only thorns, promises stars but brings only wounds.\nThe awakened person, the person who is conscious of his acts, of himself, transforms every quantity into quality. His love becomes lovingness. He is a loving person.\nNow, lovingness is not a quantity, it is a quality. It is not confined to somebody, it has nothing to do with the other, it has something to do with yourself. Your heart is overflowing with a loving energy; everybody is invited ... whoever is receptive.\nThe same is true about other ingredients of your consciousness.\nGratitude is also one of the most important things in the interior world of man. But always remember the distinction: if gratitude is a quantity, then you are going to become burdened with it because quantity is material, and matter has weight; you need to be unburdened.\nAnd when I said there is no way to show your gratitude to the master, naturally a problem arises: what you are going to do with this burden? You will be crushed under it. It may turn sour.\nBut gratitude can be transformed into gratefulness. Gratefulness has nothing to do with quantity; it is a quality. You are simply grateful – not only to the master, because the idea of being grateful only to the master is again a hangover of your old ideas of monopoly. The master is to free you; the master is to destroy all limits that confine you, imprison you.\nIf you are grateful, you are grateful to the earth, you are grateful to the sky, you are grateful to the stars, you are grateful to the ocean, you are grateful to the whole of existence.\nThis is the only way not to feel burdened.\nGratitude is transformed from matter into energy. Matter is like stone – heavy and hard. The moment it is transformed into quality, it becomes just an energy, a radiant energy. And energy can never be kept confined – its life is in the flow from one end of eternity to the other end; this whole universe is its space.\nA single man can fill the whole universe with his gratefulness, with his lovingness, with his friendliness, and there will be no burden on him. In fact, the greater the transformation from quantity to quality, the lighter you will feel. A moment comes when you have transformed all that is material in you. In the immaterial you are freed of weight – then gravitation does not work on you.\nThen you have wings and the whole sky is yours. And there are skies beyond skies, and they are all yours.\nLove for the master, gratitude to the master should bring freedom to you.\nAnd that is possible only if you start changing nouns into verbs. Existence really consists of verbs. Nouns are fictions created by man.\nIn existence, there is nothing which is a noun. You say this is a tree, but have you ever thought? – while you are saying this is a tree, the tree is bringing new leaves, old leaves are falling; new flowers are blossoming, old flowers are disappearing. It is not a dead thing; hence, it cannot be a noun. It is a living entity, it is changing constantly.\nThe word ‘tree’ gives a false idea, as if there is something unchanging. It will be better to call it a ‘treeing’ – because the tree is continuously moving. The river is ‘rivering’ – it is a movement, it is not stale, it is not dead. In other words, the existence does not consist of dead matter, it consists of living energy.\nThere is nothing permanent except change. If you can, with awareness, change your burdens into wings, your treasures into fragrances, you will be unburdened and the whole of existence will be more beautiful, will be more graceful, will be more blissful and a benediction to you. It will go on showering flowers on you. You have fulfilled your destiny – the whole existence rejoices.\nThere are beautiful stories ... I will call them stories because there is no way to prove that they are facts. I would love to think of them as facts.\nIt is said that wherever Gautam Buddha moved, even if trees were out of season they suddenly became green, full of flowers, foliage. People used to know that Buddha had passed this way just by looking at the trees on the side of the road – because the whole forest would be naked, barren, no leaves, no flowers; it was not the season.\nIt looks like a fiction. But in a deeper sense, it is a reality. Perhaps visibly the trees had not become green with flowers and foliage, but invisibly the trees felt as if the spring had come. When a man has reached the highest peak of consciousness, it is not an individual achievement. In him, the whole universe has achieved its deepest longing. It is natural that the whole existence should rejoice and dance and sing.\nJust remember: even things which are beautiful and good can become a burden, and the moment they become a burden you can even start taking revenge on the person.\nGreat masters have been betrayed, and they have been betrayed by their great disciples – not by their ordinary disciples, but by those who were very close to them.\nIt is tremendously interesting to go into the psychology of it. What happened to Judas? He was very close to Jesus. He was the most intelligent of Jesus’ disciples, he was the only one who was educated, and the only one with a very sharp intellect. What happened to him?\nOn the surface, the facts are very simple: He betrayed; he betrayed because Jesus’ enemies offered him thirty pieces of silver.\nThis is sheer nonsense. A man with the qualities of Judas cannot betray a master of the quality of Jesus just for thirty pieces of silver. There must be much more to it. Perhaps Jesus was becoming a burden.\nJesus was giving him so much love, and there was no way to return it. Jesus was giving him so much insight into existence, and there was no way to show his gratitude. Jesus was doing everything that a master should do for his spiritual growth.\nBut one should always remember that the person who is being benefitted is also an individual. He cannot go on taking because deep down it is humiliating, it is a spiritual insult. And there is only so much one can tolerate. The same thing which was so sweet and so beautiful can turn into its very opposite, can become a poison.\nIt was just to unburden himself that Judas betrayed Jesus.\nAnd I say it with certain authority: When he saw what he had done to a man who has always been nothing but love, nothing but compassion, who was always ready to give everything; when he saw the crucifixion and the torture and he realized what he had done, within twenty-four hours he hanged himself from a tree and killed himself.\nChristians don’t talk about the suicide of Judas. But the whole secret is in the suicide of Judas – not in the crucifixion of Jesus.\nJudas crucifying himself – and all those thirty silver pieces, he had thrown on the ground – indicates something deeper than historical fact, something concerned more with the inner world. At a certain point, he became so burdened that he became angry at Jesus.\nHe was a disciple: he had loved Jesus his whole life and he was grateful to Jesus.\nBut neither did Jesus tell him nor did he inquire how to transform love when it becomes a burden, gratefulness when it becomes a burden, how to avoid the danger of all those beautiful feelings turning into poison. But when he saw Jesus being crucified, suddenly all anger disappeared. Instead of anger there was only repentance – and not ordinary repentance; he threw down those thirty silver pieces and committed suicide.\nHis suicide is so significant.\nAnd the Christians’ silence about his suicide is also significant: they don’t want to bring it in because to bring it in they will have to go deeper than the superficial facts of history. History consists only of daily newspapers, collected, just superficial. It does not give insight. And if it was only the case with Jesus one could think that it may have been an exception. It is not so. It has been happening with almost every great master. Seeing that it happened with Mahavira, it happened with Gautam Buddha, I started thinking that there seems to be something much more than the mere fact that some important disciple betrays the master – but why?\nMy understanding is that it is because the science of the relationship between the master and the disciple has not yet been completely discovered. This is one of the basic contributions that I would like to make to the science: that a master has to be aware not to burden the disciple to such an extent that what was beautiful starts becoming humiliating, insulting.\nI am reminded.…\nI had a friend who was a great politician. He was the education minister, with great longings to one day go even higher, to the highest post in the country.\nHe was also a very rich man. Once in a while, whenever I was not traveling, he would come to me to ask about peace, silence, relaxation. And I told him, “Unless you drop your ambitions, you cannot be at peace and you cannot be silent and you cannot relax – because in a competitive world where you are not the only one who is trying to become the prime minister of the country, if you are relaxing and others are not relaxing, you have lost the game. Those who are able to remain tense and go on rushing, speeding, who are almost mad, will not even stop to rest unless they have reached to the very peak.” He said, “This is very difficult. I cannot drop the ambition, I have come so far – now the goal is only two steps away. Once I have reached the goal, I will renounce politics and I will sit with you and meditate, and do whatsoever you say. But before that, if I can have a little peace of mind, a little silence in the heart, a little relaxation, I can compete more efficiently.” I said, “That is a contradiction.\n” Again and again it was the same thing. I told him, “I will never change my position, and I think you are not going to change your position – why waste time? Don’t you have any other problem?” He said, “I have so many problems. One problem particularly I came today to ask you about...” And his problem was that he was a very generous man, but very proud. He was not born into the family which he had become the head of – he was adopted. He was born a poor man, and suddenly he became one of the richest men in the country. All his relatives were poor. He made all those relatives rich – gave them factories, gave them shops, gave them as much money as possible because he had so much.\nHe said to me, “The problem is nobody loves me. I have been giving to everybody – my friends, my family, even strangers have come to me and I have never said no to anything. But nobody loves me. I don’t see in their eyes any respect towards me and I am puzzled. I have done everything – nobody would have done what I have done.\n” I said, “I want to ask you one question: Have you allowed those people to do something for you?”\nHe said, “I am a very proud man. I would rather die, but I will not beg. And in fact there is no need; I have everything. They cannot do anything for me, I don’t need it.\n” I said, “The problem is very clear: they are disrespectful, they are unloving, unfriendly, because you have burdened them; you have in a very subtle way humiliated them. You are the man who can help, who can give millions of rupees to people and who does not need anything in return.\n” I said, “That is hurting their pride. I know your friends, I know the relatives you have supported and you have made rich. And I know that they are full of anger, rage and hatred for you. You have done\neverything good for them, but you don’t understand human psychology. You do a few small things\n... you need not ask them for big things, but you can ask them for something: ‘I love your roses. One day can you send a few roses to me?’ And all their anger will disappear. You have many cars. Those people have cars because you have given them money. There is no need for you, but once in a while you can just phone them and say, ‘I need your car; can you send the car?’ You have your own guest houses, you don’t need any help from anybody, but once in while you can ask a friend: ‘If your guest house is available, one of my friends is coming and I would like you to take care of him – just do this much kindness for me.’\nAnd you can change the whole atmosphere around you; then they are equal to you. Right now you have reduced them to such a state – you are so high, so beyond their reach – they are just like insects crawling on the earth.\n” He said, “I never thought about it in this way.” And after ten years, he met me in a train and he told me, “You were right. I started asking for small things, which don’t mean anything, and they have all changed. Now there is no anger, no hatred, no humiliation; they feel equal to me because they know they have also done something for me. It is not only me who is always doing things for them; they have also been doing things for me. It may be just bringing me a few roses from their garden.”\nThe relationship between the master and the disciple is a very subtle one. And in the past, it has not been understood why great masters have been betrayed. If this understanding becomes part of the relationship in the future, no master will be betrayed; there will be no reason. But the master has to understand that the disciple is also a human being – and this game should not be a one-way traffic where the master goes on giving and the disciple has just to receive it. The master should be capable – whether he needs it or not; perhaps he does not need it – just to give the disciple an idea that he can do something for the master.\nIf Judas could have done something for Jesus, there would have been no crucifixion.\nSo your question is signficant. Transform your gratitude in gratefulness – and not towards the master only; the master is only a door. Beyond the door is the whole existence.\nDon’t cling to the master – because the master is only the frame of the door; he allows you an opening into existence, he is not a wall. But remember that you are not to become attached to the frame; you have to go beyond the frame. There is no need to betray.\nJust go beyond.\nAnd let every experience in you become an expanding energy phenomenon, a resonance – not like a stone, solid and heavy, but with no weight ... just spreading all over space, with no limits.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE STRANGE THING IS THAT ALL DISCOVERIES COME OUT OF THE BLUE; THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION IS ALWAYS MADE AFTERWARDS, AND THEN IN THE LECTURE\nTHE SCIENTIST USUALLY PRESENTS HIS DISCOVERY, WHICH IS NOT HIS, AS IF IT FOLLOWED FROM HIS THEORY – WHICH WAS INVENTED AFTERWARDS; HENCE, THE LIE.\nTHIS DRIVE TO FRAME EVERYTHING, BEING TRAINED AS A SCIENTIST, IS PRETTY STRONG IN ME. BUT STILL, THE MIRACLE CAN NEVER BE EXPLAINED AWAY. IT HAPPENED – WHAT MORE PROOF? HOW TO ALLOW TO BE MORE AND MORE IN THE MIRACULOUS, TO BE IN THE MIRACLE ALL THE TIME?\nIt is true that all scientific discoveries come to the scientist out of the blue. It is not his effort, but on the contrary his no-effort, allowing existence to reveal its secrets to him.\nThis is not new.\nThe East has known it for at least five thousand years.\nLao Tzu has even given it a name: ‘effortless effort’, ‘action without action’. And he was trying to explain that whatever man has come to know is not through effort, although there is much effort involved; hence there is great misunderstanding.\nI will give you an example that will help.\nFor six years Gautam Buddha continuously did everything that was supposed to make him enlightened, and he was such a sincere seeker.…\nHe lived with many masters. With ordinary people – insincere seekers, halfhearted seekers – even the bogus masters can go on pretending that they are authentic.\nBut it was not possible with Gautam Buddha.\nThe masters themselves confessed to him, “Forgive me, you are such a sincere seeker. I can always say to others that, ‘You are not doing it wholeheartedly,’ but you are doing it so wholeheartedly that it simply proves that I don’t know how one achieves enlightenment – I am not enlightened. With others it is okay, because they never do anything wholeheartedly, and I can always tell them that it is because they are not working that they are not achieving – and the question of my enlightenment does not arise, I remain enlightened. But with you it is impossible. To lie to you is inhuman. You simply go to some other master.”\nHe went to all the known famous masters, and the result was the same.\nThe last master said to him, “You have worked enough, you have done everything that is possible for human beings, nothing more can be done. Now you just retire into the forest. You have renounced the world, now renounce this spiritual effort. Forget all about enlightenment. And I know you are capable – if you can forget all about your kingdom, you can forget all about this enlightenment. Just relax, deep in the forest.”\nHe moved to the forest.\nAnd the first night, relaxing under a bodhi tree near Bodh Gaya by the side of a small river, Niranjana, on a full-moon night, he became enlightened. He was not doing anything for enlightenment. The enlightenment came out of the blue.\nBut don’t think that you can go and catch the train to Bodh Gaya, on a full-moon night lie down by the side of the tree near the Niranjana river and wait for enlightenment. Nothing will happen. Those six years of tremendous effort did not produce enlightenment, but those six years produced so much relaxation that enlightenment became possible.\nEnlightenment is not caused by effort. By effort, relaxation is caused. You have done so much that you simply give up. But without doing it you cannot give up. So in the Buddhist religion there is a problem. There are sects who think that Buddha’s enlightened happened because of six years of effort: those six years preceded, enlightenment followed. To the ordinary logic it seems so.\nOnly one school, Zen, has been very extraordinary in its insight. It says it was not caused by six years of effort; but six years of effort have caused relaxation – and relaxation simply opens you up to the unknown, to the unknowable.\nEnlightenment is not an effect of six years’ effort, but without those six years’ effort there would have been no enlightenment either.\nYou have to understand the subtlety of it.\nThe whole day you work, and then you have a good sleep in the night.\nEmperors cannot sleep. And it is very illogical, because the whole day long they are resting – it is logical that the person who is practicing rest the whole day long should rest deeper in the night than you, who have been working the whole day, tiring yourself ... your practice is not for relaxation, your practice is against it.\nBut life is not logic, fortunately. Otherwise the person who has been working hard the whole day will have to work hard the whole night too. In his whole life he will not get any rest, because his training and his discipline will become more and more mature and more and more ripened.\nIt is good that life has a dynamic, a dialectics.\nAll day you have been making great effort – you have earned relaxation. You need relaxation, you have worked hard.\nNature is compassionate.\nThe emperor has been resting the whole day, he does not need any sleep at night. Nature does not care whether he is an emperor or a beggar.\nThe dialectics of life is that the people who make great effort for enlightenment will not achieve by their effort. One day they will have to give it all up, and in that moment of relaxation something opens up – you are not the doer, something happens to you.\nAnd the same is true about scientific discoveries – the law is the same. A scientist works for years on a certain project, and then one day he has done everything that he could possibly think of; he drops the whole idea. And suddenly a window opens, and what he was searching for with such great effort is made available to him without any effort at all.\nIn fact, there are deep reasons in it: whenever you are making effort you become tense; when you are tense, your mind becomes narrow. And you are so ambitious, so desirous, so much in a hurry to get something, that you are almost a chaos.\nAnd to know anything – either scientific or religious – you need to be a silent, peaceful awareness, not doing anything, not even desiring anything, not even looking for anything.\nBut all the time before, when you have been looking and not finding, has created a certain seed in you. In this relaxed moment, that seed starts becoming a sprout. It happened in Madame Curie’s case – which is the most famous example. She was the first woman to achieve the Nobel prize.\nShe had been working for three years on a particular mathematical problem. She tried from every direction, from every angle, but nothing happened – the problem seemed to be insoluble.\nAnd one night she was working late, up to two o’clock, and finally gave up the whole thing, thinking “I have wasted three years, I could have discovered many other things. This idiotic problem is stubborn – just like me. I am stubborn too, but now I drop out of this fight.” She closed the notebook in which she was working, went to sleep, and in the morning... She was alone in the room, and the room was locked from inside. And anyway, even if it was not locked, nobody could have done it ... if Madame Curie was not able to do it in three years. She went to her table and she found a piece of paper just on top of her notebook, under the paperweight, with the solution to the problem.\nShe could not believe it.\nHer husband was not at home; he had gone for a weekend with his friends. No servant would have been capable of doing it. Moreover, the room was locked from inside.\nThen she looked more minutely; the handwriting was her own.\nThen slowly she remembered that she had had a dream that she was working on the problem and she had solved it. Perhaps in sleep she got up and wrote down the answer which had come in her dream – not to forget it in the morning.\nThis has been happening to almost all great scientists.\nSo you are right that the scientist has no right to say, “This is my discovery.” In a way, it is not his discovery; in a way, it is existence that has chosen him to be a vehicle. Existence has not chosen anybody else to be a vehicle; he has been chosen because he has been working so hard that he had come to the point where relaxation is possible – complete and total relaxation. In that total relaxation, existence opens its secrets. Understanding this, you can see many implications: that in this way science and religion are exactly the same.\nTheir objects may be different – science may be looking outward, religion may be looking inward – but the discovery either of science or of religion happens in the same kind of state, the totally relaxed mind. Or to use the mystic word, a state of no-mind – because when the mind is completely relaxed there is no mind, the window opens.\nMind is the block. And once the mind is no more, you start seeing things that were always there in front of you but your eyes were covered with thick layers of thought. You were not able to see. You are asking how one can live in this miraculous, in this unknowable continuously.\nThe moment you ask how, you are asking for a technique, and no technique is possible – all techniques are efforts. So any technique will do, just do it so wholeheartedly that you come to a point where you drop it – because the real thing is to drop it. There are one hundred and twelve methods of meditation.\nBut the real thing is not the meditation; the real thing is that after all those one hundred and twelve methods the same thing happens. You have done it exhaustively. You have staked everything and now – seeing that you don’t have any more energy, any more desire – you relax. All efforts are dropped, all techniques forgotten.\nIn this innocence, the miraculous is yours.\nYou are part of it; you have been always part of it. The unknowable is not something separate from you, it is your heartbeat. Your heartbeat has a synchronicity with the heartbeat of the whole universe.\nBut let me remind you again: first you have to do everything that is possible for you – not holding anything back, not thinking that anyway finally you are going to drop it so why put so much energy into it? No, you have to be madly in it, as if effort is going to give you the truth. Only then one day – tired, exhausted, finished with effort – you relax.\nYou don’t know ... that depth of relaxation will depend on the depth of your effort. If the effort was a hundred percent total, then the relaxation will be a hundred percent total; and with the total relaxation you have moved into the miraculous, into the unknowable.\nThen it is your world.\nThen you breathe in it, you live in it.\nThis is what we have called the ultimate realization – enlightenment. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I CAME TO YOU YEARS AGO, YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU WHEN I FELT SOMETHING – I WASN’T SURE WHAT – IN MY ENERGY, BECAUSE YOU HAD WORK FOR ME TO DO. YOU SAID I WOULD KNOW IT WHEN IT WAS RIGHT.\nNOW I FEEL SO FULL OF YOU.\nTHESE PAST MONTHS WORKING IN THE WORLD, NOTHING HAS MEANT ANYTHING TO ME EXCEPT THE TIMES I’VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. AND IN THOSE TIMES I WAS SO FULL AND CLEAR I DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS ME.\nNOW I’M JUST HERE FOR TWO WEEKS – BUT I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY THING I CAN DO WITH MY LIFE IS YOUR WORK.\nI JUST DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS.\nCAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA BEFORE I GO?\nThe way things are happening to you is so beautiful and natural that it is better you should not interfere in it.\nIf I give you any idea, you will start interfering in it. It is happening on its own.\nJust go with it, with the stream – never against the stream.\nThe watercourse way is my whole philosophy. Just go with the stream in a deep let-go, with all my blessings.\nI will not give you any idea. Existence will take care of it. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nACCORDING TO GEORGE GURDJIEFF, NEARLY ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE NUMBER ONE, NUMBER TWO, OR NUMBER THREE. VERY FEW CAN BE CALLED MAN NUMBER FOUR, AND ONLY A GAUTAM BUDDHA, MAN NUMBER SEVEN.\nI SOMEHOW HAVE THE SUSPICION THAT YOU DON’T FIT IN THESE CATEGORIES, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAW OF SEVEN, MORE THAN NUMBER SEVEN IS NOT POSSIBLE.\nBELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER?\nMy number is zero. So whenever you want to channel with me, remember zero! Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD MEDITATION SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A SCIENCE, AND OTHER TIMES AS AN ART; ON OCCASION YOU HAVE EVEN CALLED IT A KNACK. PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nMeditation is such a mystery that it can be called a science, an art, a knack, without any contradiction.\nFrom one point of view it is a science because there is a clearcut technique that has to be done. There are no exceptions to it, it is almost like a scientific law.\nBut from a different point of view it can also be said to be an art.\nScience is an extension of the mind – it is mathematics, it is logic, it is rational. Meditation belongs to the heart, not to the mind – it is not logic; it is closer to love.\nIt is not like other scientific activities, but more like music, poetry, painting, dancing; hence, it can be called an art.\nBut meditation is such a great mystery that calling it ‘science’ and ‘art’ does not exhaust it.\nIt is a knack – either you get it or you don’t get it. A knack is not a science, it cannot be taught. A knack is not an art. A knack is the most mysterious thing in human understanding.\nFor example, you may have come across peopleSomebody has the knack of becoming a friend\nimmediately; just meeting him in the bus for a few moments and you suddenly feel as if you have known each other forever, perhaps for many lives. And you cannot pinpoint what is going on, because you have just seen the man for the first time.\nI have a friend. He is a doctor in philosophy. He has never earned a single cent in his life, but he lives like a king. He has a certain knack that anybody becomes his friend; he just has to look at you and you are his friend – and you feel as if you have been his friend forever. He has lived on borrowed money – which he never returns because he cannot, there is no way to return it, but nobody feels hurt about it. Even though he has borrowed money from you and he has never returned it, he has the nerve to ask you again – and you will give it! The man is so lovely, so beautiful, that to ask money from him simply doesn’t seem right. And he never feels embarrassed, he never avoids people he owes money to.\nI have asked him many times, “How long will you continue in this way?”\nHe said, “How long? The population goes on growing – even if I live a million years, I will always have people to give me money.”\nAnd the beauty is that you give him money and you feel honored that he asked you, not anybody else. Now what will you call it? – art? science? It is simply a knack.\nHe travels without a ticket, he has never purchased a ticket. I have been traveling with him many times. And he will say, “Why are you wasting money on tickets? Let the ticket checker come; after\nall, he is a human being.” And once the ticket checker comes, he is caught into this man’s net. He offers him a cigarette, and they are chit-chatting, and they start playing cards, and the ticket checker completely forgets why he has come. And now it is too late to ask for the ticket – they have become so friendly to each other that the ticket checker asks him, “Can I help you in any way?”\nHe says, “You have to – because I have lost my ticket!” He said, “Don’t be worried. I will be there at the gate.”\nHe lives in friends’ houses. He has no house of his own. He moves from one city to another city, but he knows all kinds of tricks with playing cards, chess, tennis, all kinds of nonsense things in which people are interested. And he is a genius. In chess you cannot win against him, in cards you cannot win.\nAnd he is such a happy person that people like for him to come to them even if he is going to take their money, even if he is going to take their car and never return – still people like him, because he is simply likeable. It is not on any conditions that he is liked, it is just his whole personality.\nOnce he was staying with me. And just next door used to live another professor who was Indian, married to an American woman. The American woman was also a professor at the university. I spent the day at the university, so he started making friendships in the neighborhood. The American woman got into his net, and her husband also became very friendly.\nThings came to such point that the professor’s wife wanted to leave with my friend. But he said, “It will be very difficult. I have no house, no shelter anywhere. I don’t know where I will be tomorrow morning. You will be in difficulty with me, and I love you so much that I will not create such a difficulty for you. And I love your husband too; I cannot disturb his life.”\nBut the professor was so enchanted by him that he said, “If you want, you can take my wife.”\nI told him, “Don’t be stupid. You can take cars, that is okay; you can take people’s tape recorders, that is okay; you can take their cameras, that is okay. But if you start taking people’s wives, you will be in great trouble. So make it a point this is the limit. Don’t go beyond this limit.”\nHe said, “You are right. Rationally I also think that this is right. But isn’t it worth trying once? When the husband is ready”\nI said, “Any husband will be ready! You are an idiot. It is not because of your charm, every husband will be ready. How many wives can you manage? You don’t have any money. And remember, you cannot bring any woman into my house.”\nHe said, “That’s not right, because that’s what I was thinking – I will leave this woman here. Another womanI will get caught and I will leave her here. You can have disciples!”\nI said, “I – these kinds of disciples are of no use to me.”\nA knack is something mysterious, just a few people can do it.\nI know a man who can make his ear lobes move. I have not found another who can move his ear lobes. Now what do you call it? – science or what? Because I have asked doctors, “What do you say about ear lobes?”\nThey say, “It is impossible.”\nBut I brought my friend to one doctor and, I told him, “Show this doctor”\nAnd the doctor said, “My God! He moves his ear lobes very easily, without any trouble.”\nIn fact, ear lobes have no biological possibility of movement, you have no control over them – you try. You don’t have any control. They are your ear lobes, but you don’t have any control. But I know one man who manages. And I have asked him, “How do you manage?” He said, “I don’t know. Just from the very beginning I have been doing it.”\nIt is absolutely impossible, physically impossible – because to move those lobes you need a certain nervous system to control them, and the nerve system is not there. The lobe is just flesh. Meditation, in the last resort, is a knack too.\nThat’s why for thousands of years people have been meditating, teaching, but very few people have achieved heights in meditation, and very few people have even tried.\nAnd the vast majority of humanity has not even bothered to think about it. It is somethinga seed\nyou are born with.\nIf you don’t have the seed, a master can go on showering all his bliss on you, still nothing will happen in you.\nAnd if the seed is there, just the presence of the master, just the way he looks into your eyes, and something of tremendous importance happens in you – a revolution that you cannot explain to anybody.\nIt is one of the difficulties for all meditators that they cannot explain to their friends, their families, what they are doing. Because the majority of humanity is not interested in it at all. And those who are not interested in it at all simply think about people who are interested, that something is loose in their heads, something is wrong.\nSitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself – but in the first place, why should you bother about the grass? Basho’s beautiful haiku will look absurd to them. Grass is going to grow by itself whether you sit silently or not, why waste your time? – grass is going to grow by itself. Let the spring come – spring comes by itself, grass grows by itself. Why are you wasting your time? – do something else meanwhile.\nIf a man has not something in his heart already – a small seed – then it is impossible for him. He can learn the technique, he can learn the art.\nBut if the knack is missing he is not going to succeed.\nSo thousands of people start meditation, but very few – so few that they can be counted on ten fingers – ever achieve to enlightenment. And unless meditation becomes enlightenment, you have simply wasted your time.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6843","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/>Sermons in Stones</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 The mystery of the knack</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6843 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sermons_in_Stones/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IS THE ONLY WAY A DISCIPLE CAN EXPRESS GRATITUDE TO HER MASTER, I HEARD
YOU SAY THAT NOTHING COULD EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE. I REALIZED THEN THAT
GRATITUDE IS SOMETHING THAT WE USUALLY FEEL ALMOST BURDENED WITH, AND SO
WE SEEK TO FIND AN OUTLET FOR IT SO THAT WE ARE RELIEVED OF A DEBT. AS
THE DISCIPLE CAN’T EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE – AND WHAT WOULD THE MASTER DO
WITH IT ANYWAY? – IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT COULD BECOME A KIND OF QUALITY
IN SOMEONE THAT COULD TRANSFORM THEM. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the path of the mystic is the path of growing qualities, of
transforming the quantitative into the qualitative. For example, love
can be a quantity – and as love is understood in the world of sleeping
people, it is a quantity; hence, it is followed by jealousy.</p><p><br></p><p>If I love you, you are in continuous fear that I may start loving
somebody else too.</p><p><br></p><p>And with the love divided, you will not be getting the same quantity
you were getting before.</p><p><br></p><p>Jealousy is nothing but an expression that love is still a quantity
in your mind: shared, it becomes less; shared with many people, you are
getting less and less. Hence a monopoly is needed, so that you can have
the whole lot of it.</p><p>And both of the lovers – because of this stupid idea – are
suspicious, are always spying on each other. If your husband sees you
laughing with somebody else, even that is enough to create a quarrel, a
conflict, a fight. Your laughter is his monopoly. You cannot smile
anywhere else, you cannot be joyful with somebody else; you are confined
to an imprisonment. And the same way you are confined, you are jailed,
in return you are creating a jail for your jailer. All lovers are
functioning as jailers to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, love promises so many roses but brings only thorns, promises
stars but brings only wounds.</p><p><br></p><p>The awakened person, the person who is conscious of his acts, of
himself, transforms every quantity into quality. His love becomes
lovingness. He is a loving person.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, lovingness is not a quantity, it is a quality. It is not
confined to somebody, it has nothing to do with the other, it has
something to do with yourself. Your heart is overflowing with a loving
energy; everybody is invited ... whoever is receptive.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about other ingredients of your consciousness.</p><p>Gratitude is also one of the most important things in the interior
world of man. But always remember the distinction: if gratitude is a
quantity, then you are going to become burdened with it because quantity
is material, and matter has weight; you need to be unburdened.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I said there is no way to show your gratitude to the master,
naturally a problem arises: what you are going to do with this burden?
You will be crushed under it. It may turn sour.</p><p><br></p><p>But gratitude can be transformed into gratefulness. Gratefulness has
nothing to do with quantity; it is a quality. You are simply grateful –
not only to the master, because the idea of being grateful only to the
master is again a hangover of your old ideas of monopoly. The master is
to free you; the master is to destroy all limits that confine you,
imprison you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are grateful, you are grateful to the earth, you are grateful
to the sky, you are grateful to the stars, you are grateful to the
ocean, you are grateful to the whole of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only way not to feel burdened.</p><p><br></p><p>Gratitude is transformed from matter into energy. Matter is like
stone – heavy and hard. The moment it is transformed into quality, it
becomes just an energy, a radiant energy. And energy can never be kept
confined – its life is in the flow from one end of eternity to the other
end; this whole universe is its space.</p><p><br></p><p>A single man can fill the whole universe with his gratefulness, with
his lovingness, with his friendliness, and there will be no burden on
him. In fact, the greater the transformation from quantity to quality,
the lighter you will feel. A moment comes when you have transformed all
that is material in you. In the immaterial you are freed of weight –
then gravitation does not work on you.</p><p>Then you have wings and the whole sky is yours. And there are skies
beyond skies, and they are all yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Love for the master, gratitude to the master should bring freedom to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is possible only if you start changing nouns into verbs.
Existence really consists of verbs. Nouns are fictions created by
man.</p><p>In existence, there is nothing which is a noun. You say this is a
tree, but have you ever thought? – while you are saying this is a tree,
the tree is bringing new leaves, old leaves are falling; new flowers are
blossoming, old flowers are disappearing. It is not a dead thing; hence,
it cannot be a noun. It is a living entity, it is changing
constantly.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘tree’ gives a false idea, as if there is something
unchanging. It will be better to call it a ‘treeing’ – because the tree
is continuously moving. The river is ‘rivering’ – it is a movement, it
is not stale, it is not dead. In other words, the existence does not
consist of dead matter, it consists of living energy.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing permanent except change. If you can, with awareness,
change your burdens into wings, your treasures into fragrances, you will
be unburdened and the whole of existence will be more beautiful, will be
more graceful, will be more blissful and a benediction to you. It will
go on showering flowers on you. You have fulfilled your destiny – the
whole existence rejoices.</p><p><br></p><p>There are beautiful stories ... I will call them stories because
there is no way to prove that they are facts. I would love to think of
them as facts.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that wherever Gautam Buddha moved, even if trees were out
of season they suddenly became green, full of flowers, foliage. People
used to know that Buddha had passed this way just by looking at the
trees on the side of the road – because the whole forest would be naked,
barren, no leaves, no flowers; it was not the season.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks like a fiction. But in a deeper sense, it is a reality.
Perhaps visibly the trees had not become green with flowers and foliage,
but invisibly the trees felt as if the spring had come. When a man has
reached the highest peak of consciousness, it is not an individual
achievement. In him, the whole universe has achieved its deepest
longing. It is natural that the whole existence should rejoice and dance
and sing.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remember: even things which are beautiful and good can become a
burden, and the moment they become a burden you can even start taking
revenge on the person.</p><p><br></p><p>Great masters have been betrayed, and they have been betrayed by
their great disciples – not by their ordinary disciples, but by those
who were very close to them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is tremendously interesting to go into the psychology of it. What
happened to Judas? He was very close to Jesus. He was the most
intelligent of Jesus’ disciples, he was the only one who was educated,
and the only one with a very sharp intellect. What happened to him?</p><p>On the surface, the facts are very simple: He betrayed; he betrayed
because Jesus’ enemies offered him thirty pieces of silver.</p><p><br></p><p>This is sheer nonsense. A man with the qualities of Judas cannot
betray a master of the quality of Jesus just for thirty pieces of
silver. There must be much more to it. Perhaps Jesus was becoming a
burden.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was giving him so much love, and there was no way to return it.
Jesus was giving him so much insight into existence, and there was no
way to show his gratitude. Jesus was doing everything that a master
should do for his spiritual growth.</p><p><br></p><p>But one should always remember that the person who is being
benefitted is also an individual. He cannot go on taking because deep
down it is humiliating, it is a spiritual insult. And there is only so
much one can tolerate. The same thing which was so sweet and so
beautiful can turn into its very opposite, can become a poison.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just to unburden himself that Judas betrayed Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say it with certain authority: When he saw what he had done to
a man who has always been nothing but love, nothing but compassion, who
was always ready to give everything; when he saw the crucifixion and the
torture and he realized what he had done, within twenty-four hours he
hanged himself from a tree and killed himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians don’t talk about the suicide of Judas. But the whole
secret is in the suicide of Judas – not in the crucifixion of Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>Judas crucifying himself – and all those thirty silver pieces, he had
thrown on the ground – indicates something deeper than historical fact,
something concerned more with the inner world. At a certain point, he
became so burdened that he became angry at Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a disciple: he had loved Jesus his whole life and he was
grateful to Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>But neither did Jesus tell him nor did he inquire how to transform
love when it becomes a burden, gratefulness when it becomes a burden,
how to avoid the danger of all those beautiful feelings turning into
poison. But when he saw Jesus being crucified, suddenly all anger
disappeared. Instead of anger there was only repentance – and not
ordinary repentance; he threw down those thirty silver pieces and
committed suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>His suicide is so significant.</p><p><br></p><p>And the Christians’ silence about his suicide is also significant:
they don’t want to bring it in because to bring it in they will have to
go deeper than the superficial facts of history. History consists only
of daily newspapers, collected, just superficial. It does not give
insight. And if it was only the case with Jesus one could think that it
may have been an exception. It is not so. It has been happening with
almost every great master. Seeing that it happened with Mahavira, it
happened with Gautam Buddha, I started thinking that there seems to be
something much more than the mere fact that some important disciple
betrays the master – but why?</p><p>My understanding is that it is because the science of the
relationship between the master and the disciple has not yet been
completely discovered. This is one of the basic contributions that I
would like to make to the science: that a master has to be aware not to
burden the disciple to such an extent that what was beautiful starts
becoming humiliating, insulting.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded.…</p><p><br></p><p>I had a friend who was a great politician. He was the education
minister, with great longings to one day go even higher, to the highest
post in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>He was also a very rich man. Once in a while, whenever I was not
traveling, he would come to me to ask about peace, silence, relaxation.
And I told him, “Unless you drop your ambitions, you cannot be at peace
and you cannot be silent and you cannot relax – because in a competitive
world where you are not the only one who is trying to become the prime
minister of the country, if you are relaxing and others are not
relaxing, you have lost the game. Those who are able to remain tense and
go on rushing, speeding, who are almost mad, will not even stop to rest
unless they have reached to the very peak.” He said, “This is very
difficult. I cannot drop the ambition, I have come so far – now the goal
is only two steps away. Once I have reached the goal, I will renounce
politics and I will sit with you and meditate, and do whatsoever you
say. But before that, if I can have a little peace of mind, a little
silence in the heart, a little relaxation, I can compete more
efficiently.” I said, “That is a contradiction.</p><p><br></p><p>” Again and again it was the same thing. I told him, “I will never
change my position, and I think you are not going to change your
position – why waste time? Don’t you have any other problem?” He said,
“I have so many problems. One problem particularly I came today to ask
you about...” And his problem was that he was a very generous man, but
very proud. He was not born into the family which he had become the head
of – he was adopted. He was born a poor man, and suddenly he became one
of the richest men in the country. All his relatives were poor. He made
all those relatives rich – gave them factories, gave them shops, gave
them as much money as possible because he had so much.</p><p><br></p><p>He said to me, “The problem is nobody loves me. I have been giving to
everybody – my friends, my family, even strangers have come to me and I
have never said no to anything. But nobody loves me. I don’t see in
their eyes any respect towards me and I am puzzled. I have done
everything – nobody would have done what I have done.</p><p><br></p><p>” I said, “I want to ask you one question: Have you allowed those
people to do something for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am a very proud man. I would rather die, but I will not
beg. And in fact there is no need; I have everything. They cannot do
anything for me, I don’t need it.</p><p><br></p><p>” I said, “The problem is very clear: they are disrespectful, they
are unloving, unfriendly, because you have burdened them; you have in a
very subtle way humiliated them. You are the man who can help, who can
give millions of rupees to people and who does not need anything in
return.</p><p><br></p><p>” I said, “That is hurting their pride. I know your friends, I know
the relatives you have supported and you have made rich. And I know that
they are full of anger, rage and hatred for you. You have done</p><p>everything good for them, but you don’t understand human psychology.
You do a few small things</p><p>... you need not ask them for big things, but you can ask them for
something: ‘I love your roses. One day can you send a few roses to me?’
And all their anger will disappear. You have many cars. Those people
have cars because you have given them money. There is no need for you,
but once in a while you can just phone them and say, ‘I need your car;
can you send the car?’ You have your own guest houses, you don’t need
any help from anybody, but once in while you can ask a friend: ‘If your
guest house is available, one of my friends is coming and I would like
you to take care of him – just do this much kindness for me.’</p><p><br></p><p>And you can change the whole atmosphere around you; then they are
equal to you. Right now you have reduced them to such a state – you are
so high, so beyond their reach – they are just like insects crawling on
the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>” He said, “I never thought about it in this way.” And after ten
years, he met me in a train and he told me, “You were right. I started
asking for small things, which don’t mean anything, and they have all
changed. Now there is no anger, no hatred, no humiliation; they feel
equal to me because they know they have also done something for me. It
is not only me who is always doing things for them; they have also been
doing things for me. It may be just bringing me a few roses from their
garden.”</p><p><br></p><p>The relationship between the master and the disciple is a very subtle
one. And in the past, it has not been understood why great masters have
been betrayed. If this understanding becomes part of the relationship in
the future, no master will be betrayed; there will be no reason. But the
master has to understand that the disciple is also a human being – and
this game should not be a one-way traffic where the master goes on
giving and the disciple has just to receive it. The master should be
capable – whether he needs it or not; perhaps he does not need it – just
to give the disciple an idea that he can do something for the
master.</p><p><br></p><p>If Judas could have done something for Jesus, there would have been
no crucifixion.</p><p><br></p><p>So your question is signficant. Transform your gratitude in
gratefulness – and not towards the master only; the master is only a
door. Beyond the door is the whole existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t cling to the master – because the master is only the frame of
the door; he allows you an opening into existence, he is not a wall. But
remember that you are not to become attached to the frame; you have to
go beyond the frame. There is no need to betray.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>And let every experience in you become an expanding energy
phenomenon, a resonance – not like a stone, solid and heavy, but with no
weight ... just spreading all over space, with no limits.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE STRANGE THING IS THAT ALL DISCOVERIES COME OUT OF THE BLUE; THE
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION IS ALWAYS MADE AFTERWARDS, AND THEN IN THE
LECTURE</p><p>THE SCIENTIST USUALLY PRESENTS HIS DISCOVERY, WHICH IS NOT HIS, AS IF
IT FOLLOWED FROM HIS THEORY – WHICH WAS INVENTED AFTERWARDS; HENCE, THE
LIE.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS DRIVE TO FRAME EVERYTHING, BEING TRAINED AS A SCIENTIST, IS
PRETTY STRONG IN ME. BUT STILL, THE MIRACLE CAN NEVER BE EXPLAINED AWAY.
IT HAPPENED – WHAT MORE PROOF? HOW TO ALLOW TO BE MORE AND MORE IN THE
MIRACULOUS, TO BE IN THE MIRACLE ALL THE TIME?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that all scientific discoveries come to the scientist out
of the blue. It is not his effort, but on the contrary his no-effort,
allowing existence to reveal its secrets to him.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not new.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has known it for at least five thousand years.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu has even given it a name: ‘effortless effort’, ‘action
without action’. And he was trying to explain that whatever man has come
to know is not through effort, although there is much effort involved;
hence there is great misunderstanding.</p><p><br></p><p>I will give you an example that will help.</p><p><br></p><p>For six years Gautam Buddha continuously did everything that was
supposed to make him enlightened, and he was such a sincere seeker.…</p><p><br></p><p>He lived with many masters. With ordinary people – insincere seekers,
halfhearted seekers – even the bogus masters can go on pretending that
they are authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was not possible with Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The masters themselves confessed to him, “Forgive me, you are such a
sincere seeker. I can always say to others that, ‘You are not doing it
wholeheartedly,’ but you are doing it so wholeheartedly that it simply
proves that I don’t know how one achieves enlightenment – I am not
enlightened. With others it is okay, because they never do anything
wholeheartedly, and I can always tell them that it is because they are
not working that they are not achieving – and the question of my
enlightenment does not arise, I remain enlightened. But with you it is
impossible. To lie to you is inhuman. You simply go to some other
master.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went to all the known famous masters, and the result was the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>The last master said to him, “You have worked enough, you have done
everything that is possible for human beings, nothing more can be done.
Now you just retire into the forest. You have renounced the world, now
renounce this spiritual effort. Forget all about enlightenment. And I
know you are capable – if you can forget all about your kingdom, you can
forget all about this enlightenment. Just relax, deep in the
forest.”</p><p><br></p><p>He moved to the forest.</p><p>And the first night, relaxing under a bodhi tree near Bodh Gaya by
the side of a small river, Niranjana, on a full-moon night, he became
enlightened. He was not doing anything for enlightenment. The
enlightenment came out of the blue.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t think that you can go and catch the train to Bodh Gaya, on
a full-moon night lie down by the side of the tree near the Niranjana
river and wait for enlightenment. Nothing will happen. Those six years
of tremendous effort did not produce enlightenment, but those six years
produced so much relaxation that enlightenment became possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not caused by effort. By effort, relaxation is
caused. You have done so much that you simply give up. But without doing
it you cannot give up. So in the Buddhist religion there is a problem.
There are sects who think that Buddha’s enlightened happened because of
six years of effort: those six years preceded, enlightenment followed.
To the ordinary logic it seems so.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one school, Zen, has been very extraordinary in its insight. It
says it was not caused by six years of effort; but six years of effort
have caused relaxation – and relaxation simply opens you up to the
unknown, to the unknowable.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not an effect of six years’ effort, but without
those six years’ effort there would have been no enlightenment
either.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand the subtlety of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole day you work, and then you have a good sleep in the
night.</p><p><br></p><p>Emperors cannot sleep. And it is very illogical, because the whole
day long they are resting – it is logical that the person who is
practicing rest the whole day long should rest deeper in the night than
you, who have been working the whole day, tiring yourself ... your
practice is not for relaxation, your practice is against it.</p><p><br></p><p>But life is not logic, fortunately. Otherwise the person who has been
working hard the whole day will have to work hard the whole night too.
In his whole life he will not get any rest, because his training and his
discipline will become more and more mature and more and more
ripened.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that life has a dynamic, a dialectics.</p><p><br></p><p>All day you have been making great effort – you have earned
relaxation. You need relaxation, you have worked hard.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature is compassionate.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor has been resting the whole day, he does not need any
sleep at night. Nature does not care whether he is an emperor or a
beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>The dialectics of life is that the people who make great effort for
enlightenment will not achieve by their effort. One day they will have
to give it all up, and in that moment of relaxation something opens up –
you are not the doer, something happens to you.</p><p>And the same is true about scientific discoveries – the law is the
same. A scientist works for years on a certain project, and then one day
he has done everything that he could possibly think of; he drops the
whole idea. And suddenly a window opens, and what he was searching for
with such great effort is made available to him without any effort at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there are deep reasons in it: whenever you are making effort
you become tense; when you are tense, your mind becomes narrow. And you
are so ambitious, so desirous, so much in a hurry to get something, that
you are almost a chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>And to know anything – either scientific or religious – you need to
be a silent, peaceful awareness, not doing anything, not even desiring
anything, not even looking for anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But all the time before, when you have been looking and not finding,
has created a certain seed in you. In this relaxed moment, that seed
starts becoming a sprout. It happened in Madame Curie’s case – which is
the most famous example. She was the first woman to achieve the Nobel
prize.</p><p><br></p><p>She had been working for three years on a particular mathematical
problem. She tried from every direction, from every angle, but nothing
happened – the problem seemed to be insoluble.</p><p><br></p><p>And one night she was working late, up to two o’clock, and finally
gave up the whole thing, thinking “I have wasted three years, I could
have discovered many other things. This idiotic problem is stubborn –
just like me. I am stubborn too, but now I drop out of this fight.” She
closed the notebook in which she was working, went to sleep, and in the
morning... She was alone in the room, and the room was locked from
inside. And anyway, even if it was not locked, nobody could have done it
... if Madame Curie was not able to do it in three years. She went to
her table and she found a piece of paper just on top of her notebook,
under the paperweight, with the solution to the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>She could not believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>Her husband was not at home; he had gone for a weekend with his
friends. No servant would have been capable of doing it. Moreover, the
room was locked from inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Then she looked more minutely; the handwriting was her own.</p><p><br></p><p>Then slowly she remembered that she had had a dream that she was
working on the problem and she had solved it. Perhaps in sleep she got
up and wrote down the answer which had come in her dream – not to forget
it in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been happening to almost all great scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are right that the scientist has no right to say, “This is my
discovery.” In a way, it is not his discovery; in a way, it is existence
that has chosen him to be a vehicle. Existence has not chosen anybody
else to be a vehicle; he has been chosen because he has been working so
hard that he had come to the point where relaxation is possible –
complete and total relaxation. In that total relaxation, existence opens
its secrets. Understanding this, you can see many implications: that in
this way science and religion are exactly the same.</p><p>Their objects may be different – science may be looking outward,
religion may be looking inward – but the discovery either of science or
of religion happens in the same kind of state, the totally relaxed mind.
Or to use the mystic word, a state of no-mind – because when the mind is
completely relaxed there is no mind, the window opens.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is the block. And once the mind is no more, you start seeing
things that were always there in front of you but your eyes were covered
with thick layers of thought. You were not able to see. You are asking
how one can live in this miraculous, in this unknowable
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you ask how, you are asking for a technique, and no
technique is possible – all techniques are efforts. So any technique
will do, just do it so wholeheartedly that you come to a point where you
drop it – because the real thing is to drop it. There are one hundred
and twelve methods of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>But the real thing is not the meditation; the real thing is that
after all those one hundred and twelve methods the same thing happens.
You have done it exhaustively. You have staked everything and now –
seeing that you don’t have any more energy, any more desire – you relax.
All efforts are dropped, all techniques forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>In this innocence, the miraculous is yours.</p><p><br></p><p>You are part of it; you have been always part of it. The unknowable
is not something separate from you, it is your heartbeat. Your heartbeat
has a synchronicity with the heartbeat of the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>But let me remind you again: first you have to do everything that is
possible for you – not holding anything back, not thinking that anyway
finally you are going to drop it so why put so much energy into it? No,
you have to be madly in it, as if effort is going to give you the truth.
Only then one day – tired, exhausted, finished with effort – you
relax.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know ... that depth of relaxation will depend on the depth
of your effort. If the effort was a hundred percent total, then the
relaxation will be a hundred percent total; and with the total
relaxation you have moved into the miraculous, into the unknowable.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it is your world.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you breathe in it, you live in it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what we have called the ultimate realization – enlightenment.
Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I CAME TO YOU YEARS AGO, YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU WHEN I FELT
SOMETHING – I WASN’T SURE WHAT – IN MY ENERGY, BECAUSE YOU HAD WORK FOR
ME TO DO. YOU SAID I WOULD KNOW IT WHEN IT WAS RIGHT.</p><p>NOW I FEEL SO FULL OF YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE PAST MONTHS WORKING IN THE WORLD, NOTHING HAS MEANT ANYTHING TO
ME EXCEPT THE TIMES I’VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. AND IN
THOSE TIMES I WAS SO FULL AND CLEAR I DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS ME.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW I’M JUST HERE FOR TWO WEEKS – BUT I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY THING I
CAN DO WITH MY LIFE IS YOUR WORK.</p><p><br></p><p>I JUST DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA BEFORE I GO?</p><p><br></p><p>The way things are happening to you is so beautiful and natural that
it is better you should not interfere in it.</p><p><br></p><p>If I give you any idea, you will start interfering in it. It is
happening on its own.</p><p>Just go with it, with the stream – never against the stream.</p><p><br></p><p>The watercourse way is my whole philosophy. Just go with the stream
in a deep let-go, with all my blessings.</p><p><br></p><p>I will not give you any idea. Existence will take care of it.
Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ACCORDING TO GEORGE GURDJIEFF, NEARLY ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE NUMBER
ONE, NUMBER TWO, OR NUMBER THREE. VERY FEW CAN BE CALLED MAN NUMBER
FOUR, AND ONLY A GAUTAM BUDDHA, MAN NUMBER SEVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>I SOMEHOW HAVE THE SUSPICION THAT YOU DON’T FIT IN THESE CATEGORIES,
BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAW OF SEVEN, MORE THAN NUMBER SEVEN IS NOT
POSSIBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER?</p><p><br></p><p>My number is zero. So whenever you want to channel with me, remember
zero! Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD MEDITATION SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A SCIENCE, AND OTHER
TIMES AS AN ART; ON OCCASION YOU HAVE EVEN CALLED IT A KNACK. PLEASE
EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is such a mystery that it can be called a science, an art,
a knack, without any contradiction.</p><p><br></p><p>From one point of view it is a science because there is a clearcut
technique that has to be done. There are no exceptions to it, it is
almost like a scientific law.</p><p><br></p><p>But from a different point of view it can also be said to be an
art.</p><p><br></p><p>Science is an extension of the mind – it is mathematics, it is logic,
it is rational. Meditation belongs to the heart, not to the mind – it is
not logic; it is closer to love.</p><p>It is not like other scientific activities, but more like music,
poetry, painting, dancing; hence, it can be called an art.</p><p><br></p><p>But meditation is such a great mystery that calling it ‘science’ and
‘art’ does not exhaust it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a knack – either you get it or you don’t get it. A knack is not
a science, it cannot be taught. A knack is not an art. A knack is the
most mysterious thing in human understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you may have come across people<span class=s4></span>Somebody has the knack of becoming a friend</p><p>immediately; just meeting him in the bus for a few moments and you
suddenly feel as if you have known each other forever, perhaps for many
lives. And you cannot pinpoint what is going on, because you have just
seen the man for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>I have a friend. He is a doctor in philosophy. He has never earned a
single cent in his life, but he lives like a king. He has a certain
knack that anybody becomes his friend; he just has to look at you and
you are his friend – and you feel as if you have been his friend
forever. He has lived on borrowed money – which he never returns because
he cannot, there is no way to return it, but nobody feels hurt about it.
Even though he has borrowed money from you and he has never returned it,
he has the nerve to ask you again – and you will give it! The man is so
lovely, so beautiful, that to ask money from him simply doesn’t seem
right. And he never feels embarrassed, he never avoids people he owes
money to.</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked him many times, “How long will you continue in this
way?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How long? The population goes on growing – even if I live a
million years, I will always have people to give me money.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the beauty is that you give him money and you feel honored that
he asked you, not anybody else. Now what will you call it? – art?
science? It is simply a knack.</p><p><br></p><p>He travels without a ticket, he has never purchased a ticket. I have
been traveling with him many times. And he will say, “Why are you
wasting money on tickets? Let the ticket checker come; after</p><p>all, he is a human being.” And once the ticket checker comes, he is
caught into this man’s net. He offers him a cigarette, and they are
chit-chatting, and they start playing cards, and the ticket checker
completely forgets why he has come. And now it is too late to ask for
the ticket – they have become so friendly to each other that the ticket
checker asks him, “Can I help you in any way?”</p><p><br></p><p>He says, “You have to – because I have lost my ticket!” He said,
“Don’t be worried. I will be there at the gate.”</p><p>He lives in friends’ houses. He has no house of his own. He moves
from one city to another city, but he knows all kinds of tricks with
playing cards, chess, tennis, all kinds of nonsense things in which
people are interested. And he is a genius. In chess you cannot win
against him, in cards you cannot win.</p><p><br></p><p>And he is such a happy person that people like for him to come to
them even if he is going to take their money, even if he is going to
take their car and never return – still people like him, because he is
simply likeable. It is not on any conditions that he is liked, it is
just his whole personality.</p><p><br></p><p>Once he was staying with me. And just next door used to live another
professor who was Indian, married to an American woman. The American
woman was also a professor at the university. I spent the day at the
university, so he started making friendships in the neighborhood. The
American woman got into his net, and her husband also became very
friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>Things came to such point that the professor’s wife wanted to leave
with my friend. But he said, “It will be very difficult. I have no
house, no shelter anywhere. I don’t know where I will be tomorrow
morning. You will be in difficulty with me, and I love you so much that
I will not create such a difficulty for you. And I love your husband
too; I cannot disturb his life.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the professor was so enchanted by him that he said, “If you want,
you can take my wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “Don’t be stupid. You can take cars, that is okay; you
can take people’s tape recorders, that is okay; you can take their
cameras, that is okay. But if you start taking people’s wives, you will
be in great trouble. So make it a point this is the limit. Don’t go
beyond this limit.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are right. Rationally I also think that this is right.
But isn’t it worth trying once? When the husband is ready<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Any husband will be ready! You are an idiot. It is not
because of your charm, every husband will be ready. How many wives can
you manage? You don’t have any money. And remember, you cannot bring any
woman into my house.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s not right, because that’s what I was thinking – I
will leave this woman here. Another woman<span class=s4></span>I will
get caught and I will leave her here. You can have disciples!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I – these kinds of disciples are of no use to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>A knack is something mysterious, just a few people can do it.</p><p>I know a man who can make his ear lobes move. I have not found
another who can move his ear lobes. Now what do you call it? – science
or what? Because I have asked doctors, “What do you say about ear
lobes?”</p><p><br></p><p>They say, “It is impossible.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I brought my friend to one doctor and, I told him, “Show this
doctor<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>And the doctor said, “My God! He moves his ear lobes very easily,
without any trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, ear lobes have no biological possibility of movement, you
have no control over them – you try. You don’t have any control. They
are your ear lobes, but you don’t have any control. But I know one man
who manages. And I have asked him, “How do you manage?” He said, “I
don’t know. Just from the very beginning I have been doing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely impossible, physically impossible – because to move
those lobes you need a certain nervous system to control them, and the
nerve system is not there. The lobe is just flesh. Meditation, in the
last resort, is a knack too.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why for thousands of years people have been meditating,
teaching, but very few people have achieved heights in meditation, and
very few people have even tried.</p><p><br></p><p>And the vast majority of humanity has not even bothered to think
about it. It is something<span class=s4></span>a seed</p><p>you are born with.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t have the seed, a master can go on showering all his
bliss on you, still nothing will happen in you.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the seed is there, just the presence of the master, just the
way he looks into your eyes, and something of tremendous importance
happens in you – a revolution that you cannot explain to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the difficulties for all meditators that they cannot
explain to their friends, their families, what they are doing. Because
the majority of humanity is not interested in it at all. And those who
are not interested in it at all simply think about people who are
interested, that something is loose in their heads, something is
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows
by itself – but in the first place, why should you bother about the
grass? Basho’s beautiful haiku will look absurd to them. Grass is going
to grow by itself whether you sit silently or not, why waste your time?
– grass is going to grow by itself. Let the spring come – spring comes
by itself, grass grows by itself. Why are you wasting your time? – do
something else meanwhile.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man has not something in his heart already – a small seed – then
it is impossible for him. He can learn the technique, he can learn the
art.</p><p>But if the knack is missing he is not going to succeed.</p><p>So thousands of people start meditation, but very few – so few that
they can be counted on ten fingers – ever achieve to enlightenment. And
unless meditation becomes enlightenment, you have simply wasted your
time.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

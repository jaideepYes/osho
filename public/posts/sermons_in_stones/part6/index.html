I LEFT MY MOTHER TWENTY YEARS, AND MY WIFE OVER FOUR YEARS AGO. WHY CAN’T I LET THEM GO?
One of the mysteries of life is the law of reverse returns. There are things which you cannot do.

WHY CAN’T I LET THEM GO?\nOne of the mysteries of life is the law of reverse returns. There are things which you cannot do. Although people have done them, although it is possible they may happen to you too, they are always happenings, they are never doings.\nIn fact the doer, the ego, is the barrier to the happening. Happening needs the innocent mind of a child who can still dream of fairies, who can still find treasures in colored stones, whose eyes are still not covered with the dust that we call knowledge. His ignorance is far more beautiful than the knowledge of a great scholar. Because ignorance is at least natural. At least it is yours; it does not make you a hypocrite, it is never insincere.\nI have been wondering and looking in thousands of scriptures and commentaries on scriptures but I have not found a single statement in five thousand years’ literature which shows some understanding about ignorance. In fact, they are all interested in knowledgeability; ignorance they want to destroy. They want to gain knowledge because knowledge will give them power – knowledge is power. Knowledge will give you prestige, money, respectability. Knowledge will fulfill many of your ambitions and desires.\nIgnorance cannot do anything for you, but it can allow something which is far more precious than knowledge can ever give to you. But its whole secret is in allowing, in patiently waiting – with a question mark in the heart, with a quest all over your being, a quest which is not partial, a total enquiry.\nIgnorance is the beginning of wisdom. Rightly understood, it is not something negative. It is simply a tabula rasa – a clean slate. Nothing is written on it. You have to write your own holy BIBLE, holy KORAN, holy GITA; you have to give birth.\nIgnorance is a womb.\nIt contains the quest for truth – and if you don’t fall victim to knowledgeability, ignorance is the right beginning.\nTo know absolutely that “I do not know,” is the first step of wisdom. You have known something of tremendous value: you have known your innocence, and in this innocence, the ego dies. The ego can live only with the false – it is the accumulation of the false. The ego is interested in knowledge – borrowed, third-hand, rotten ... but knowledge is cheap.\nTo know by experience is a risk. You may burn your fingers in the experiment.\nIn the experiment, you are dropping out of the crowd and moving alone in this vast universe and you don’t have any guide, any maps, any instructions. All that you have is a thirst.\nBut in the desert people say, and it is derived from thousands of years of experience, that when a man becomes so thirsty that he forgets everything.The fiery sun on his head, the fire in the sand,\nand he is all thirst; now it is not even a verbal thing in him. It is not that he is thinking, “I am feeling thirsty.”\nHe is thirst. Not that he is thinking about it, he is it.\nThe desert people all over the world have experienced a very strange phenomenon. Whenever somebody comes to such a state of thirst – and many times it happens in the desert – he suddenly becomes intuitive. He starts moving towards the place where he will find water. He has no map, he has no instructions. He has no way to move logically in any direction because in the desert all directions are the same, and there is no reason to choose one direction and not another.\nBut now there is no question of choice. There is no question of thinking, he is just thirst. And that thirst moves existentially towards the place where it can be quenched.\nWhen I came to know about this, I was surprised that no other mystic has taken note of the fact that the same is the situation of the seeker. Of course his desert is bigger, and his thirst is bigger too. The ordinary thirst is momentary; his thirst is eternal – but the basic principle is the same.\nWhen a man becomes so aflame, he starts movingI will not say he starts going in that direction;\nhe finds himself going towards a certain direction, having no other alternative. There is no reason to stop. And that’s how those who have reached, have reached.\nRemember one thing: that to get rid of the doer is the most essential thing if you want to taste another world – the world of happenings, where you are just a witness.\nThe law of reverse effect is: there are things which you can have but because you are trying to get them, you will not be able to get them. It is like when you want to fall asleep in the night. You try all kinds of tricks but you find that you cannot befool yourself – sleep is not coming. On the contrary, because of your tricks and because of all the things people have told you to do if you do not find sleep coming to you naturally – all those things keep you awake. Because to do them you have to be awake!\nSomebody is repeating a mantra – but to repeat a mantra, you have to be awake. Somebody is doing some breathing exercises from Yoga – but breath is so deeply involved in life that if you are using breathing in a certain way, with a certain rhythm, it will keep you alert, awake, fresh.\nSleep needs totally different things. If you want sleep to come, forget all about sleep; that is the first rule. Do something else. Get involved in something so deeply that you are not at all concerned with sleep and it will start coming. You will hear small footsteps, you will feel it is coming, but don’t pay any attention.\nSleep is a feminine energy. If you look at it – and here you come to a very significant point – the feminine energy functions in a totally different way than the male energy. The woman wants you to chase her. She does not want you simply to sit and wait for her to come. Even though the woman wants you, loves you, wants to be yours, first she will run away. She will not run very fast. She will run in such a way that you can catch her; she will give you every chance to catch hold of her.\nEvery feminine energy has the same quality. Sleep is feminine, you cannot catch hold of her. You have just to close your eyes and lie down and wait. She will come ... she is just in the other room.\nIn the same category are all great values: friendship, love, peace, silence, and ultimately the realization of your godliness – they all happen. You are not the doer.\nSo first, let this be settled in you: that there is a world of doings that is the outside world, the worldly world; and there is a world of happenings – the inner world, the otherworldly world. Certainly their principles are going to be diametrically opposite.\nI have seen people trying to relax. I have seen a book with the title, YOU MUST RELAX! “Must” will not allow you to relax! Relaxation is not something that you do, it is simply the absence of all your doings. In that absence is the greatest experience of life, and all great values will grow on their own accord.\nOf course, your ego will not be fulfilled. In fact, it will be dead by the time you have experienced a few things which only happen.\nYou have to choose between the ego and the world of happenings.\nThe ego can give you many things: misery, anger, sadness, despair, anguish ... and the line is long. It has its own treasures, if you are interested.\nThe absence of ego has also its own treasures. And the world of the ego and the world of egolessness are not very far away. They are neighbors.\nJust a very thin fence of thoughts divides them.\nIt is simply a question of understanding that there are things which cannot be done – so don’t do them, let them happen.\nYou just be a watcher. And once you have learned the knack of watching you will start growing up higher every moment towards the ultimate experience – of knowing oneself, realizing the nature of your consciousness ... because that opens the door of immortality.\nA meditator slowly slips from the world of mortality into the world of immortality. On this side, the world of doings, there is death. On the other side, in the dimension of happenings, there is no death.\nAnd unless you experience a clear vision of deathlessness, you will remain miserable, you will remain in despair. And because you live in the world of doings, that is the only art you know – and that art is preventing you from entering into a different dimension.\nSo you have to learn sometimes just to be a child, playing, jumping, dancing, singing, for no purpose at all. Once in a while just lying down on the lawn, or on the beach – doing nothing, lying down in such a way ... as if you are in your mother’s womb.\nIn fact, the scientists say that people feel good near the ocean because the child in the mother’s womb floats in a liquid which has the same proportion of chemicals, salts, as the ocean. And we are made eighty percent of water. It is a miracle! You just think once again ... you are eighty percent water – walking, running, going home! Just twenty percent, the skin, is functioning like a bag.\nYou feel fresh near the ocean – the same salty air, some forgotten memory.…\nScientists are now coming closer to the Eastern insight about human evolution. Now the latest researchers say that Charles Darwin is not right, man has not come as a growth from the monkeys. They are proposing that man was born as a fish, not as a monkey; in the very beginning he was born in the ocean. And because life needed all that the ocean contains, the mother’s womb has to contain everything just like the ocean. A pregnant woman becomes very much interested in salty things, because the child is asking for more and more salt. Salt is a necessity.…\nBut for nine months floating in the mother’s womb the child knows the eternity of relaxation – no tension, no business, no worries, no taxation.\nThe child simply is, just a pure isness – that is relaxation.\nBy the side of the ocean, lying in the sand, just move as if you are back in your mother’s womb. You are not to do anything. Just lie down and enjoy the wind, the roaring ocean ... and you will be surprised that the meditation that you have been trying to do for years and has not happened, is happening.\nOnce you know that there are things which need your support – not as a doer but just as a loving gardener looking at his rosebushes, waiting and trusting in existence ... the spring always comes and it will bring flowers.\nThe spring of your consciousness will also come, but you have to learn a simple secret – that of let-go.\nAnd the learning simply comes by trying to understand the nature of doing and the nature of non- doing.\nI was taken to a theological college to talk about Jesus, and after I had talked with the students, the vice-chancellor took me around ... it is the biggest Christian college in the whole of Asia which prepares missionaries. He took me around, and I could not believe what I saw. If Jesus had seen it the Jews would have been saved from crucifying him – he would have committed suicide himself!\nThe missionaries are being prepared ... on what sentence what kind of emphasis has to be given, what sentence has to be spoken loudly and what sentence has to be almost whispered, at what point you should beat the table.…\nI told the vice-chancellor, “You are destroying these people. Jesus never went to any theological college; he was not trained in the art of oratory. He is certainly one of the greatest orators the world has produced, and he does not know any art; he is uneducated. His power and the fire that his words carry are not coming out of a training, they are coming from his heart. In fact, he is not doing them, they are happening.”\nThe difference is very delicate and very difficult ... whether the person is making a gesture or the gesture has blossomed just like a flower. If you have to say something your hands will follow, because your hands are extensions of your mind. When the mind is trying to express something and finding it difficult, the hands add whatever they can contribute. And sometimes what words cannot say, the movement of the hand, the grace of the hand may say. The word may not reach its target but the heart may touch the hand extended towards you. Your eyes may catch the depth of the master.\nI told that vice-chancellor, “You are spoiling three thousand students every year – and you think you are preparing missionaries who are going to convert others into religion. You are not even able to convert these people! Because if their hearts are with you, then their gestures will automatically follow, then their emphasis on certain words, phrases or sometimes just silence...”\nA moment, a gap, one never knows ... what the moment is going to bring is absolutely unknown. Whatever you want to do, remember:\nDoing is material, worldly, mundane. There is nothing which can be called ‘spiritual doing’.\nSpirituality is a happening, it is bigger than you, you cannot do it. You can make a shelter of your house, but you cannot make the sky with all the stars.\nAll great values are like the sky – so vast and with so many stars and with so many mysteries. You can enter into this world of the miraculous if you drop yourself, leave yourself out of the temple.\nI am reminded of a very ancient story.…\nThere was a great sculptor in Rome. His statues were so highly praised that for the first time unanimously the critics said, “There is no more possibility of improvement.” He has said the last word; his statues look almost alive, as if just any moment the statue will come out of its place to greet you, to shake hands with you or give you a hug” – although I don’t think you will be ready! The hug may prove dangerous. But that was the appraisal from all over the world, that the man had come to the peak, and now there was nothing that could be added to the art.\nThen the man became old, as everybody has to become old, and he became afraid of death. As oldness started settling he started thinking what to do about death. Being a sculptor this idea came to his mind easily: “I can make a statue of myself.” And he had a beautiful round hall where hundreds of statues were standing and sitting. So he thought, “When death comes I will be standing somewhere inside the crowd of my statues; only I have to keep my breathing as slow as possible.” And that was possible, because people used to say that his statues seemed as if they were breathing. They were so alive that they would do something, they could not remain standing forever in that way.\nDeath came and was puzzled. The sculptor had made a few statues of himself and placed them among other statues. Death could not believe that ... she went around watching, looking, trying to find some sign but she failed. She said, “My God! He has done only one thing wrong...”\nAnd the artist forgot completely the situation and the scene and said, “What?”\nDeath said, “You cannot forget yourself. And that I could see even by your nose, but I did not disturb you. I simply went on looking around. I wanted to see whether you could remain silent. That would have been really going beyond death – but you could not forget your ego and you were feeling more and more satisfied. The more I was going ahead, looking like a failure ... I was seeing from the corner of my eye that you were looking more and more successful, certain that you had defeated death. I can be defeated but not by the ego.”\nThe egoless has no death to encounter. You are born – have you done anything? can you take any credit for being born? for having two eyes and not three? for having eyes at all? Otherwise the world would be dark – no colors, no light, no beauty. But all these things have happened to you. Birth happens to you, youth happens to you, love happens to you, old age happens to you, death happens to you – whatever is essential happens to you and whatever is non-essential is left for you to do.\nSo don’t waste your whole life in the non-essential.\nThat non-essential is also needed but remember that the essential has not to be forgotten.\nAnd you have not to do anything for it. You have just to be receptive, open, vulnerable, available ... so that if the call comes from the beyond you will be ready to say with your full heart, “Yes. I am coming.”\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI LISTENED TO THE TENDER SOUND OF A COOL WELL, BUBBLING WATER JUST FLOWING WITHOUT ANY EFFORT AND YET BUSY ... SUNRAYS DANCING TO THE MELODY, ETERNALLY FRESH. BUT THE ‘I’ FORGOT. ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE THIRST TO COME BACK AND BE THE WELL, SOMETIMES RECOGNIZED, SOMETIMES NOT. OSHO, IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE DONE? IS THE THIRST ENOUGH?\nThe thirst is enough.\nSo the question is not whether the thirst is enough or not, the question is whether the thirst is there or not. Because there can be a false thirst – and you know about the false thirst: you are not feeling thirsty and suddenly you see a bottle of Coca-Cola. Strangely enough you start feeling thirsty, and just a moment before you were not thinking of thirst at all.\nI used to live in one place ... just next door was the richest man’s house; it was a beautiful palace. And in India nobody bothers about it; it is taken for granted that people will urinate anywhere. The whole of mother earth is a toilet. So by the side of this man’s house there was a small street, very lonely and once in a while somebody would urinate there and he was very mad about it. In the morning he would be in the garden and if he saw somebody urinating there was going to be murder! So much trouble he would create for the man, and the police will come and.…\nOne day I was by the side of his fence and I said, “Why don’t you put small signboards around the house saying that urinating is prohibited?”\nHe said, “That’s good idea.”\nSo he made beautiful wooden signs – beautiful because they have to go with the beautiful marble – all around the house. And by the evening he came.…\nI said, “You must have come about those signboards that you have put up.” He said, “Yes, I have come about those. Where is your father?”\n“But,” I said, “my father has nothing to do with them. It was my suggestion, the whole credit goes to me.”\nHe said, “You keep quiet, just call your father.” So I called my father.\nHe said, “This boy is dangerous. He tricked me! Now my whole house is stinking of urine; all around the house you can find nothing but urine.”\nJust the human mind ... when you see a board: “You cannot urinate here” such a great desire arises! One can risk anything, but one cannot leave that place, it is hypnotic.\nThe functioning of the mind is such that no prohibition can ever be successful. Prohibition becomes provocation, it becomes a challenge and suddenly ... you were going on your way, thinking your thoughts, and suddenly this board makes you aware that you too have a bladder. And somebody telling you not to do something makes it attractive. It can become an obsession.\nDon’t create obsessions in your life. Live more playfully, less seriously.\nDon’t be rigid; these are the qualities of the dead. Be flexible. Grow a sense of humor so that you can remain protected from all kinds of dark nights, dark holes. Your sense of humor will protect you.\nAnd if once in a while you can have a deep laughter, from your very roots, it will give you a freshness, a new vitality, a new energy to move mountains.\nTen thousand years we have lived without understanding the subtle workings of the mind. Hence every religion says, “Don’t do this,” and creates the world that you see. This is the world created by people who have been telling you, “Don’t do this, don’t do that.” And those are the things which are being done!\nAnd the more emphasis there is on denial.Life reacts with a tremendous force against any denial,\nand you are caught in a very difficult crisis. If you follow life you cannot follow your holy scriptures, and that will create guilt in you – and to go on collecting guilt is like growing a spiritual cancer within yourself. If you follow these commandments in the scriptures you are going against your nature, against life itself. So there is not going to be any fulfillment, there is not going to be any joy; there is going to be only darkness, misery.\nSlowly, slowly you start feeling a kind of death happening to you, because life is not being allowed to live in its totality. Death is bound to fill the gaps where life has not been allowed to blossom.\nAnd every man is carrying within himself so many poisonous, life-negative ideas that everybody is in a limbo, just hanging in between. Neither can he do what life wants him to do – fully, completely, not holding anything back – nor he can repress. Because you are nature; and who is going to repress? You will have to divide yourself into two parts. You will have to create classes within yourself.\nThere are people who are thinking of creating a classless society – without knowing at all that inside, man as an individual is divided into classes.\nIn India, the brahmin is synonymous with the head and the sudra, the shoemakers and the poor manual laborers, are symbolized by the feet; the warriors are symbolized by the arms. And they have a hierarchy – the feet cannot become the head. So whatever you are, you cannot change, you cannot transform yourself. You have to accept your fate – this has been the teaching for thousands of years.\nAnd the result is this miserable humanity. This is the conclusion of all your religions and all your prophets and all your saviors. This is what they have done, this is how they have saved you.\nThey don’t seem around too much nowadays – perhaps they have saved you completely! They may have gone to save somebody else on some other planet, some other star.\nThese saviors existed because we wanted somebody else to do this work of spiritual growth for us: “Somebody else should do it.”\nNobody else can do it.\nIt is your freedom to be miserable or to be blissful, to remain in darkness or to live a life of light. This is the prerogative of human beings.\nThe saviors are cheating you. To say to somebody, “I am going to save you,” means that the person stops his search and becomes only a shadow. He follows you. And remember, existence does not accept carbon copies; it needs the original. You have to take the whole responsibility for your life.\nAnd it is not a burden. In fact, freedom can never be a burden. The moment you accept total responsibility, you become free to be whatever your nature demands, to be whatever your nature deserves. And only when you fulfill your destiny – alone – finding your path, risking everything for the search, then life is no more just vegetating. Then life is a song, a dance, a deep ecstasy.\nBut you have to drop the idea that anybody else can do it for you. You have to drop the idea that knowledge gathered from scriptures can do it. You have to be mature, you have to accept that “This is my life and only I can do something for it.”\nIn this way you become an individual.\nIn this way you become free from organizational religions, in this way you become free from any political, philosophical ideologies.\nIn this way you become innocent again.\nYour eyes are clean, have depth; your heart is ready to dance.\nAnd if you can forget yourself and start the dancing, start the singing.… And when I say forget yourself, don’t misunderstand me. Don’t start emphasizing the fact of forgetting yourself – that will spoil the whole thing. When I say forget yourself, I simply mean that when you are dancing, let the dance be there and the dancer dissolved into it. When you are singing then what is the need of the singer? Let the singer melt into the song, and each moment of life starts taking on the qualities of truth, of beauty, of blissfulness. You don’t have to go anywhere. And you don’t have to be anybody else, either. Wherever you are, whatever you are, exactly there – in silence, in peace – you can discover the very center of the universe.\nThat center exists in everyone. We are different only on the periphery; at the center we are one.\nThat’s why a person who has reached to his innermost core becomes a magnetic force – because he is now at the center and you are at the periphery. He has all the gravitation. If you just relax a little bit ... because you are clinging with the periphery. A little relaxation and you will be pulled in.\nAnd while you are slipping into the presence of the master, you will find that a dark shadow of your own, which we call the ego, is leaving you. As you are coming closer to the master, the ego is leaving you. The moment you have come and there is no barrier between you and the master, you will be surprised: for the first time you don’t have any weight. It is as if that ego was a mountain on you, and suddenly everything looks bright, fragrant, rosier.\nLife is simple.\nWe make it complex by doing things against nature.\nThere is only one religion, and that is nature. Allow nature to take you completely; allow yourself to be one with nature.\nAnything that goes against nature is against religion, is against spirituality, is against your ultimate welfare. So just listen to your nature – and your nature goes on telling you, but we are deaf.\nI have heard.… In Tibet, two Buddhist monks were passing through the marketplace. One monk was very greedy. In fact, because of his greed it was suggested he renounce the world and become a monk; otherwise, “Your future is going to be nothing but hell.”\nHe listened to many saints, tried many times, but again and again he thought about all the possessions he had collected, and he went on postponing. One day the master called him and said, “It is enough, because now I cannot wait; I am going to die tomorrow. Now you decide.”\nUnder such compulsion – it was almost blackmail – he got initiated, renounced the world. But that does not make any difference.\nThe greed is inside you, not in the things.\nSo now it became attached to new things. He started collecting other things, with new names. He started collecting ancient scriptures.…\nBoth monks were passing through the market where there was so much crowd and so much bargaining and so much noise ... and somebody’s coin fell and he heard the sound.\nHe said to the other monk, “Did you hear it? I just heard the sound of a coin falling on the road.”\nThe other monk said, “You are a miracle! In such a maddening crowd ... just the sound of a coin? You managed to hear it? You have to forgive me, I don’t have that much sensitivity.”\nThey both went to the master and told him about the incident. The master said, “It is not insensitivity on your part – he is too sensitive towards coins! Even in a market, the sound of a coin ... he knows no other music.”\nDon’t go against nature.\nListen silently – and whatever you have to do and whatever you have to be, all directions are within you.\nOnce in a while you may go wrong, you may commit a mistake. But they’re all part of natural life, and you will learn from them. Each learning is based on mistakes.\nBut one thing has to be certain: you have to be strong enough to take the whole responsibility of your life, for good or for bad. Act out of freedom, out of awareness; not out of dead principles and religions and books.\nTo me, fearlessness, courageousness is the foundational quality of a religious man. He will risk all, but he cannot go against his own insight. Whatever the consequences, he will follow his own insight. This is how he becomes stronger and stronger, more and more like steel, so that even fire cannot destroy him.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nENLIGHTENMENT SEEMS TO ME ALWAYS TO BE AN END, A DEATH, A KIND OF SUICIDE WHERE A COMEBACK IS NEVER POSSIBLE – NO MORE ADVENTURES, NO LOVERS, NO SUNSETS, NO DRAMAS, NO CANDLELIGHT DINNERS. WHAT CAN BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SENSELESS DRAMAS AND JOYS OF ALL MY SEARCHINGS? HOW IS IT AFTER DEATH FOR AN ENLIGHTENED MAN? IS IT NOT BORING FOR THE NEXT TEN THOUSAND YEARS? I FEEL SIMPLY A DEATH-FEAR.\nEnlightenment can be a very scary thing.\nIt can create a great paranoia in you. And your question is significant, because millions of people in the world never think about enlightenment, and the reason may be this deep-rooted fear. They have known a certain kind of life and they think this is the only life possible – that’s where they go wrong.\nThis is the lowest form of life that we are living. In fact, to call it life is not right, it is only birth. It is only a possibility. You can make a life out of it – life has to be created. And the misunderstanding is so old ... and people don’t want to drop it because it is so consoling to think that you are alive and you are enjoying everything and it is a beautiful drama.\nBut you have been through this drama many times.\nIt is the same drama. Small details change ... A is married to B instead of to C. One lives in this country, is born into another ... but goes through the same routine. The same misery will come, the same jealousy will come; all the games of ambition that people go on playing will be there – but you are not bored. You are not bored because each time you die your memory closes a door; otherwise you will go mad. Nature has an autonomous system: the moment a person dies his whole memory system of that life goes with him into the new life, but the door is closed.\nOne of Mahavira’s contributions to the world is his method of jati smaran. Jati smaran means the science of remembering your past lives. It was his absolute emphasis that nobody should become a sannyasin unless he goes through the remembrance of a few past lives. He was asked many times, “Why this insistence?” because nobody else insists on it.\nHe said, “Unless you look into your past lives, and you see that you have been doing the same thing again and again and again, and your hands are still empty, and you are again doing those same things”\nYou will become bored and you will start feeling that ‘I must be utterly unintelligent’ – but because each life is completely closed to you, you don’t know anything about your past. You don’t have any insight into your future.\nAll that you know is this small life, and in this small life you know two things: the misery and the pain of life, and ways and methods of forgetting that misery and pain. That you call your amusement, entertainment – going to a movie, to a circus. These are your ways to forget your life. There you became engaged for two or three hours in a different world.\nThe enlightened person is certainly difficult for you to conceive of.\nIt is just like if you smoke, you cannot conceive how millions of people go on without smoking. They must be missing! And the person who does not smoke is not missing anything except some nicotine, some poison that will kill you earlier than him. Otherwise, he is not missing anything. The person who is an alcoholic cannot believe that the whole world goes on without the bottle. He cannot live even a single day without the bottle. He feels pity for you: “Poor fellows, they don’t know that there is a way, through alcohol, to forget all the burdens of life.” But he cannot conceive of a life which has no burdens at all to forget.\nAnd that is your position. When you think about enlightenment, the problem is that you don’t understand that the man who is enlightened is no more an ego. You can insult him but you cannot hurt him; you can abuse him, you can condemn him, and there will be no change in his being. Even if you kill him he will remain the same.\nIt is difficult for you to understand how an enlightened man can remain without going to circuses, moviesand all kinds of stupidities are there. But so few enlightened people have existed that not\nmuch is known about them. And much is such that unless you experience it, you cannot understand it.\nFor the enlightened person, everything that is going on around him is a circus. There is no need for him to purchase a ticket – his problem is how to get out of the circus! He does not want to go to the movie, he wants to get out!\nBut wherever he goes.…\nJust think of Gautam Buddha in Bombay.…\nIt is not difficult to infer why these people have declined to happen. Why no more Gautam Buddhas, Mahaviras, Bodhidharmas, Zarathustras? Where have all these tremendously beautiful people disappeared to? Why are they not more available to us? Because humanity has grown so much – just in the proportion.In India there were only two million people in the time of Buddha. Now there\nare nine hundred million people in India. Just looking at the proportion, at least a dozen Buddhas are absolutely needed!\nBut that kind of person has disappeared – and he has disappeared because what you call life he has found to be nothing but slow death.\nAnd he has found the real life. Once a person finds the real life, why he should come back into a miserable world?\nBut your question is relevant. You feel afraid that sitting silently for thousands of years is going to be difficult.\nBut you don’t know that if you are silent, time stops. There are no more ten thousand years, ten million years, nothing. Just a simple now.\nWhen mind is silent, time disappears because mind is time.\nNow you are worried that in life there is so much drama, and the enlightened man ... what is he going to do for eternity?\nWhat drama you are talking about? One idiot slipping on a banana peel? And everybody starts laughing ... this is not compassionate. Even if that man is a banana, he has every right to slip on a banana peel. He is not harming anybody, just doing some special kind of yoga.\nBut why are you laughing?\nYour life is full of sadness and you are in search ... wherever there is a possibility to laugh, some sadness is thrown away, some burden is thrown away. Certainly, an enlightened person will not be laughing. There is no need. The laughter is needed because of your sadness, it is an antidote to sadness. The enlightened man is so blissful ... and remember, blissfulness is not happiness. That’s where things always become confused.\nHappiness is momentary: on both sides of happiness there is unhappiness.\nBlissfulness has no opposite to it, there is no such thing as “unblissfulness.” There is only blissfulness, and that blissfulness is not dependent on anybody else or anything outside the enlightened being himself.\nHis source of bliss is within his own being.\nHe is shining, radiating what he has experienced. And the more he shares it, the more it goes on growing.\nTime has no existence for him any more.\nHe lives in the moment. And he lives so totally and so intensely that there is no space for any sadness or any misery to enter.\nBut don’t decide anything before experiencing at least a little sample. Experience a little meditation and it will be the answer to your question. Because one day you will find that you are sitting silently and so joyful, for no reason at all.\nThe moment one becomes enlightened, one becomes blissfulness, one becomes benediction. Time and space both disappear. He becomes one with the whole.\nThen stars are within him, flowers are within him, skies upon skies are within him. Then birds on the wing are within him.\nRight now everything is outside you. Enlightenment brings everything inside you.\nIt spreads you far and wide, to infinities. Many such questions will arise, but don’t just intellectually think about them. Otherwise, you will be missing the real juice of life.\nExperiment.\nYour questions should come out of your experiments; then they will be existential and they will be of immense help for your growth.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6536","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/>Sermons in Stones</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 At the center we are one</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6536 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sermons_in_Stones/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

CAN’T I LET THEM GO?</p><p><br></p><p>One of the mysteries of life is the law of reverse returns. There are
things which you cannot do. Although people have done them, although it
is possible they may happen to you too, they are always happenings, they
are never doings.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact the doer, the ego, is the barrier to the happening. Happening
needs the innocent mind of a child who can still dream of fairies, who
can still find treasures in colored stones, whose eyes are still not
covered with the dust that we call knowledge. His ignorance is far more
beautiful than the knowledge of a great scholar. Because ignorance is at
least natural. At least it is yours; it does not make you a hypocrite,
it is never insincere.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been wondering and looking in thousands of scriptures and
commentaries on scriptures but I have not found a single statement in
five thousand years’ literature which shows some understanding about
ignorance. In fact, they are all interested in knowledgeability;
ignorance they want to destroy. They want to gain knowledge because
knowledge will give them power – knowledge is power. Knowledge will give
you prestige, money, respectability. Knowledge will fulfill many of your
ambitions and desires.</p><p>Ignorance cannot do anything for you, but it can allow something
which is far more precious than knowledge can ever give to you. But its
whole secret is in allowing, in patiently waiting – with a question mark
in the heart, with a quest all over your being, a quest which is not
partial, a total enquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignorance is the beginning of wisdom. Rightly understood, it is not
something negative. It is simply a tabula rasa – a clean slate. Nothing
is written on it. You have to write your own holy BIBLE, holy KORAN,
holy GITA; you have to give birth.</p><p><br></p><p>Ignorance is a womb.</p><p><br></p><p>It contains the quest for truth – and if you don’t fall victim to
knowledgeability, ignorance is the right beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>To know absolutely that “I do not know,” is the first step of wisdom.
You have known something of tremendous value: you have known your
innocence, and in this innocence, the ego dies. The ego can live only
with the false – it is the accumulation of the false. The ego is
interested in knowledge – borrowed, third-hand, rotten ... but knowledge
is cheap.</p><p><br></p><p>To know by experience is a risk. You may burn your fingers in the
experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>In the experiment, you are dropping out of the crowd and moving alone
in this vast universe and you don’t have any guide, any maps, any
instructions. All that you have is a thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the desert people say, and it is derived from thousands of
years of experience, that when a man becomes so thirsty that he forgets
everything.<span class=s4></span>The fiery sun on his head, the fire
in the sand,</p><p>and he is all thirst; now it is not even a verbal thing in him. It is
not that he is thinking, “I am feeling thirsty.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is thirst. Not that he is thinking about it, he is it.</p><p><br></p><p>The desert people all over the world have experienced a very strange
phenomenon. Whenever somebody comes to such a state of thirst – and many
times it happens in the desert – he suddenly becomes intuitive. He
starts moving towards the place where he will find water. He has no map,
he has no instructions. He has no way to move logically in any direction
because in the desert all directions are the same, and there is no
reason to choose one direction and not another.</p><p><br></p><p>But now there is no question of choice. There is no question of
thinking, he is just thirst. And that thirst moves existentially towards
the place where it can be quenched.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came to know about this, I was surprised that no other mystic
has taken note of the fact that the same is the situation of the seeker.
Of course his desert is bigger, and his thirst is bigger too. The
ordinary thirst is momentary; his thirst is eternal – but the basic
principle is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>When a man becomes so aflame, he starts moving<span class=s4></span>I will not say he starts going in that direction;</p><p>he finds himself going towards a certain direction, having no other
alternative. There is no reason to stop. And that’s how those who have
reached, have reached.</p><p>Remember one thing: that to get rid of the doer is the most essential
thing if you want to taste another world – the world of happenings,
where you are just a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>The law of reverse effect is: there are things which you can have but
because you are trying to get them, you will not be able to get them. It
is like when you want to fall asleep in the night. You try all kinds of
tricks but you find that you cannot befool yourself – sleep is not
coming. On the contrary, because of your tricks and because of all the
things people have told you to do if you do not find sleep coming to you
naturally – all those things keep you awake. Because to do them you have
to be awake!</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody is repeating a mantra – but to repeat a mantra, you have to
be awake. Somebody is doing some breathing exercises from Yoga – but
breath is so deeply involved in life that if you are using breathing in
a certain way, with a certain rhythm, it will keep you alert, awake,
fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep needs totally different things. If you want sleep to come,
forget all about sleep; that is the first rule. Do something else. Get
involved in something so deeply that you are not at all concerned with
sleep and it will start coming. You will hear small footsteps, you will
feel it is coming, but don’t pay any attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep is a feminine energy. If you look at it – and here you come to
a very significant point – the feminine energy functions in a totally
different way than the male energy. The woman wants you to chase her.
She does not want you simply to sit and wait for her to come. Even
though the woman wants you, loves you, wants to be yours, first she will
run away. She will not run very fast. She will run in such a way that
you can catch her; she will give you every chance to catch hold of
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Every feminine energy has the same quality. Sleep is feminine, you
cannot catch hold of her. You have just to close your eyes and lie down
and wait. She will come ... she is just in the other room.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same category are all great values: friendship, love, peace,
silence, and ultimately the realization of your godliness – they all
happen. You are not the doer.</p><p><br></p><p>So first, let this be settled in you: that there is a world of doings
that is the outside world, the worldly world; and there is a world of
happenings – the inner world, the otherworldly world. Certainly their
principles are going to be diametrically opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen people trying to relax. I have seen a book with the
title, YOU MUST RELAX! “Must” will not allow you to relax! Relaxation is
not something that you do, it is simply the absence of all your doings.
In that absence is the greatest experience of life, and all great values
will grow on their own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, your ego will not be fulfilled. In fact, it will be dead
by the time you have experienced a few things which only happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to choose between the ego and the world of happenings.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego can give you many things: misery, anger, sadness, despair,
anguish ... and the line is long. It has its own treasures, if you are
interested.</p><p>The absence of ego has also its own treasures. And the world of the
ego and the world of egolessness are not very far away. They are
neighbors.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a very thin fence of thoughts divides them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply a question of understanding that there are things which
cannot be done – so don’t do them, let them happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You just be a watcher. And once you have learned the knack of
watching you will start growing up higher every moment towards the
ultimate experience – of knowing oneself, realizing the nature of your
consciousness ... because that opens the door of immortality.</p><p><br></p><p>A meditator slowly slips from the world of mortality into the world
of immortality. On this side, the world of doings, there is death. On
the other side, in the dimension of happenings, there is no death.</p><p><br></p><p>And unless you experience a clear vision of deathlessness, you will
remain miserable, you will remain in despair. And because you live in
the world of doings, that is the only art you know – and that art is
preventing you from entering into a different dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>So you have to learn sometimes just to be a child, playing, jumping,
dancing, singing, for no purpose at all. Once in a while just lying down
on the lawn, or on the beach – doing nothing, lying down in such a way
... as if you are in your mother’s womb.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the scientists say that people feel good near the ocean
because the child in the mother’s womb floats in a liquid which has the
same proportion of chemicals, salts, as the ocean. And we are made
eighty percent of water. It is a miracle! You just think once again ...
you are eighty percent water – walking, running, going home! Just twenty
percent, the skin, is functioning like a bag.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel fresh near the ocean – the same salty air, some forgotten
memory.…</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists are now coming closer to the Eastern insight about human
evolution. Now the latest researchers say that Charles Darwin is not
right, man has not come as a growth from the monkeys. They are proposing
that man was born as a fish, not as a monkey; in the very beginning he
was born in the ocean. And because life needed all that the ocean
contains, the mother’s womb has to contain everything just like the
ocean. A pregnant woman becomes very much interested in salty things,
because the child is asking for more and more salt. Salt is a
necessity.…</p><p><br></p><p>But for nine months floating in the mother’s womb the child knows the
eternity of relaxation – no tension, no business, no worries, no
taxation.</p><p><br></p><p>The child simply is, just a pure isness – that is relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>By the side of the ocean, lying in the sand, just move as if you are
back in your mother’s womb. You are not to do anything. Just lie down
and enjoy the wind, the roaring ocean ... and you will be surprised that
the meditation that you have been trying to do for years and has not
happened, is happening.</p><p>Once you know that there are things which need your support – not as
a doer but just as a loving gardener looking at his rosebushes, waiting
and trusting in existence ... the spring always comes and it will bring
flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>The spring of your consciousness will also come, but you have to
learn a simple secret – that of let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>And the learning simply comes by trying to understand the nature of
doing and the nature of non- doing.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken to a theological college to talk about Jesus, and after I
had talked with the students, the vice-chancellor took me around ... it
is the biggest Christian college in the whole of Asia which prepares
missionaries. He took me around, and I could not believe what I saw. If
Jesus had seen it the Jews would have been saved from crucifying him –
he would have committed suicide himself!</p><p><br></p><p>The missionaries are being prepared ... on what sentence what kind of
emphasis has to be given, what sentence has to be spoken loudly and what
sentence has to be almost whispered, at what point you should beat the
table.…</p><p><br></p><p>I told the vice-chancellor, “You are destroying these people. Jesus
never went to any theological college; he was not trained in the art of
oratory. He is certainly one of the greatest orators the world has
produced, and he does not know any art; he is uneducated. His power and
the fire that his words carry are not coming out of a training, they are
coming from his heart. In fact, he is not doing them, they are
happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is very delicate and very difficult ... whether the
person is making a gesture or the gesture has blossomed just like a
flower. If you have to say something your hands will follow, because
your hands are extensions of your mind. When the mind is trying to
express something and finding it difficult, the hands add whatever they
can contribute. And sometimes what words cannot say, the movement of the
hand, the grace of the hand may say. The word may not reach its target
but the heart may touch the hand extended towards you. Your eyes may
catch the depth of the master.</p><p><br></p><p>I told that vice-chancellor, “You are spoiling three thousand
students every year – and you think you are preparing missionaries who
are going to convert others into religion. You are not even able to
convert these people! Because if their hearts are with you, then their
gestures will automatically follow, then their emphasis on certain
words, phrases or sometimes just silence...”</p><p><br></p><p>A moment, a gap, one never knows ... what the moment is going to
bring is absolutely unknown. Whatever you want to do, remember:</p><p>Doing is material, worldly, mundane. There is nothing which can be
called ‘spiritual doing’.</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality is a happening, it is bigger than you, you cannot do it.
You can make a shelter of your house, but you cannot make the sky with
all the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>All great values are like the sky – so vast and with so many stars
and with so many mysteries. You can enter into this world of the
miraculous if you drop yourself, leave yourself out of the temple.</p><p>I am reminded of a very ancient story.…</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great sculptor in Rome. His statues were so highly
praised that for the first time unanimously the critics said, “There is
no more possibility of improvement.” He has said the last word; his
statues look almost alive, as if just any moment the statue will come
out of its place to greet you, to shake hands with you or give you a
hug” – although I don’t think you will be ready! The hug may prove
dangerous. But that was the appraisal from all over the world, that the
man had come to the peak, and now there was nothing that could be added
to the art.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the man became old, as everybody has to become old, and he
became afraid of death. As oldness started settling he started thinking
what to do about death. Being a sculptor this idea came to his mind
easily: “I can make a statue of myself.” And he had a beautiful round
hall where hundreds of statues were standing and sitting. So he thought,
“When death comes I will be standing somewhere inside the crowd of my
statues; only I have to keep my breathing as slow as possible.” And that
was possible, because people used to say that his statues seemed as if
they were breathing. They were so alive that they would do something,
they could not remain standing forever in that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Death came and was puzzled. The sculptor had made a few statues of
himself and placed them among other statues. Death could not believe
that ... she went around watching, looking, trying to find some sign but
she failed. She said, “My God! He has done only one thing wrong...”</p><p><br></p><p>And the artist forgot completely the situation and the scene and
said, “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “You cannot forget yourself. And that I could see even by
your nose, but I did not disturb you. I simply went on looking around. I
wanted to see whether you could remain silent. That would have been
really going beyond death – but you could not forget your ego and you
were feeling more and more satisfied. The more I was going ahead,
looking like a failure ... I was seeing from the corner of my eye that
you were looking more and more successful, certain that you had defeated
death. I can be defeated but not by the ego.”</p><p><br></p><p>The egoless has no death to encounter. You are born – have you done
anything? can you take any credit for being born? for having two eyes
and not three? for having eyes at all? Otherwise the world would be dark
– no colors, no light, no beauty. But all these things have happened to
you. Birth happens to you, youth happens to you, love happens to you,
old age happens to you, death happens to you – whatever is essential
happens to you and whatever is non-essential is left for you to do.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t waste your whole life in the non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>That non-essential is also needed but remember that the essential has
not to be forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have not to do anything for it. You have just to be
receptive, open, vulnerable, available ... so that if the call comes
from the beyond you will be ready to say with your full heart, “Yes. I
am coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I LISTENED TO THE TENDER SOUND OF A COOL WELL, BUBBLING WATER JUST
FLOWING WITHOUT ANY EFFORT AND YET BUSY ... SUNRAYS DANCING TO THE
MELODY, ETERNALLY FRESH. BUT THE ‘I’ FORGOT. ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE
THIRST TO COME BACK AND BE THE WELL, SOMETIMES RECOGNIZED, SOMETIMES
NOT. OSHO, IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE DONE? IS THE THIRST ENOUGH?</p><p><br></p><p>The thirst is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>So the question is not whether the thirst is enough or not, the
question is whether the thirst is there or not. Because there can be a
false thirst – and you know about the false thirst: you are not feeling
thirsty and suddenly you see a bottle of Coca-Cola. Strangely enough you
start feeling thirsty, and just a moment before you were not thinking of
thirst at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live in one place ... just next door was the richest man’s
house; it was a beautiful palace. And in India nobody bothers about it;
it is taken for granted that people will urinate anywhere. The whole of
mother earth is a toilet. So by the side of this man’s house there was a
small street, very lonely and once in a while somebody would urinate
there and he was very mad about it. In the morning he would be in the
garden and if he saw somebody urinating there was going to be murder! So
much trouble he would create for the man, and the police will come
and.…</p><p><br></p><p>One day I was by the side of his fence and I said, “Why don’t you put
small signboards around the house saying that urinating is
prohibited?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s good idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he made beautiful wooden signs – beautiful because they have to go
with the beautiful marble – all around the house. And by the evening he
came.…</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You must have come about those signboards that you have put
up.” He said, “Yes, I have come about those. Where is your father?”</p><p>“But,” I said, “my father has nothing to do with them. It was my
suggestion, the whole credit goes to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You keep quiet, just call your father.” So I called my
father.</p><p>He said, “This boy is dangerous. He tricked me! Now my whole house is
stinking of urine; all around the house you can find nothing but
urine.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just the human mind ... when you see a board: “You cannot urinate
here” such a great desire arises! One can risk anything, but one cannot
leave that place, it is hypnotic.</p><p>The functioning of the mind is such that no prohibition can ever be
successful. Prohibition becomes provocation, it becomes a challenge and
suddenly ... you were going on your way, thinking your thoughts, and
suddenly this board makes you aware that you too have a bladder. And
somebody telling you not to do something makes it attractive. It can
become an obsession.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t create obsessions in your life. Live more playfully, less
seriously.</p><p>Don’t be rigid; these are the qualities of the dead. Be flexible.
Grow a sense of humor so that you can remain protected from all kinds of
dark nights, dark holes. Your sense of humor will protect you.</p><p><br></p><p>And if once in a while you can have a deep laughter, from your very
roots, it will give you a freshness, a new vitality, a new energy to
move mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten thousand years we have lived without understanding the subtle
workings of the mind. Hence every religion says, “Don’t do this,” and
creates the world that you see. This is the world created by people who
have been telling you, “Don’t do this, don’t do that.” And those are the
things which are being done!</p><p><br></p><p>And the more emphasis there is on denial.<span class=s4></span>Life
reacts with a tremendous force against any denial,</p><p>and you are caught in a very difficult crisis. If you follow life you
cannot follow your holy scriptures, and that will create guilt in you –
and to go on collecting guilt is like growing a spiritual cancer within
yourself. If you follow these commandments in the scriptures you are
going against your nature, against life itself. So there is not going to
be any fulfillment, there is not going to be any joy; there is going to
be only darkness, misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly you start feeling a kind of death happening to you,
because life is not being allowed to live in its totality. Death is
bound to fill the gaps where life has not been allowed to blossom.</p><p><br></p><p>And every man is carrying within himself so many poisonous,
life-negative ideas that everybody is in a limbo, just hanging in
between. Neither can he do what life wants him to do – fully,
completely, not holding anything back – nor he can repress. Because you
are nature; and who is going to repress? You will have to divide
yourself into two parts. You will have to create classes within
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who are thinking of creating a classless society –
without knowing at all that inside, man as an individual is divided into
classes.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the brahmin is synonymous with the head and the sudra, the
shoemakers and the poor manual laborers, are symbolized by the feet; the
warriors are symbolized by the arms. And they have a hierarchy – the
feet cannot become the head. So whatever you are, you cannot change, you
cannot transform yourself. You have to accept your fate – this has been
the teaching for thousands of years.</p><p><br></p><p>And the result is this miserable humanity. This is the conclusion of
all your religions and all your prophets and all your saviors. This is
what they have done, this is how they have saved you.</p><p>They don’t seem around too much nowadays – perhaps they have saved
you completely! They may have gone to save somebody else on some other
planet, some other star.</p><p><br></p><p>These saviors existed because we wanted somebody else to do this work
of spiritual growth for us: “Somebody else should do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody else can do it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is your freedom to be miserable or to be blissful, to remain in
darkness or to live a life of light. This is the prerogative of human
beings.</p><p><br></p><p>The saviors are cheating you. To say to somebody, “I am going to save
you,” means that the person stops his search and becomes only a shadow.
He follows you. And remember, existence does not accept carbon copies;
it needs the original. You have to take the whole responsibility for
your life.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not a burden. In fact, freedom can never be a burden. The
moment you accept total responsibility, you become free to be whatever
your nature demands, to be whatever your nature deserves. And only when
you fulfill your destiny – alone – finding your path, risking everything
for the search, then life is no more just vegetating. Then life is a
song, a dance, a deep ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to drop the idea that anybody else can do it for you.
You have to drop the idea that knowledge gathered from scriptures can do
it. You have to be mature, you have to accept that “This is my life and
only I can do something for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>In this way you become an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way you become free from organizational religions, in this
way you become free from any political, philosophical ideologies.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way you become innocent again.</p><p><br></p><p>Your eyes are clean, have depth; your heart is ready to dance.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you can forget yourself and start the dancing, start the
singing.… And when I say forget yourself, don’t misunderstand me. Don’t
start emphasizing the fact of forgetting yourself – that will spoil the
whole thing. When I say forget yourself, I simply mean that when you are
dancing, let the dance be there and the dancer dissolved into it. When
you are singing then what is the need of the singer? Let the singer melt
into the song, and each moment of life starts taking on the qualities of
truth, of beauty, of blissfulness. You don’t have to go anywhere. And
you don’t have to be anybody else, either. Wherever you are, whatever
you are, exactly there – in silence, in peace – you can discover the
very center of the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>That center exists in everyone. We are different only on the
periphery; at the center we are one.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why a person who has reached to his innermost core becomes a
magnetic force – because he is now at the center and you are at the
periphery. He has all the gravitation. If you just relax a little bit
... because you are clinging with the periphery. A little relaxation and
you will be pulled in.</p><p>And while you are slipping into the presence of the master, you will
find that a dark shadow of your own, which we call the ego, is leaving
you. As you are coming closer to the master, the ego is leaving you. The
moment you have come and there is no barrier between you and the master,
you will be surprised: for the first time you don’t have any weight. It
is as if that ego was a mountain on you, and suddenly everything looks
bright, fragrant, rosier.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is simple.</p><p><br></p><p>We make it complex by doing things against nature.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one religion, and that is nature. Allow nature to take
you completely; allow yourself to be one with nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything that goes against nature is against religion, is against
spirituality, is against your ultimate welfare. So just listen to your
nature – and your nature goes on telling you, but we are deaf.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.… In Tibet, two Buddhist monks were passing through the
marketplace. One monk was very greedy. In fact, because of his greed it
was suggested he renounce the world and become a monk; otherwise, “Your
future is going to be nothing but hell.”</p><p><br></p><p>He listened to many saints, tried many times, but again and again he
thought about all the possessions he had collected, and he went on
postponing. One day the master called him and said, “It is enough,
because now I cannot wait; I am going to die tomorrow. Now you
decide.”</p><p><br></p><p>Under such compulsion – it was almost blackmail – he got initiated,
renounced the world. But that does not make any difference.</p><p><br></p><p>The greed is inside you, not in the things.</p><p><br></p><p>So now it became attached to new things. He started collecting other
things, with new names. He started collecting ancient scriptures.…</p><p><br></p><p>Both monks were passing through the market where there was so much
crowd and so much bargaining and so much noise ... and somebody’s coin
fell and he heard the sound.</p><p><br></p><p>He said to the other monk, “Did you hear it? I just heard the sound
of a coin falling on the road.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other monk said, “You are a miracle! In such a maddening crowd
... just the sound of a coin? You managed to hear it? You have to
forgive me, I don’t have that much sensitivity.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both went to the master and told him about the incident. The
master said, “It is not insensitivity on your part – he is too sensitive
towards coins! Even in a market, the sound of a coin ... he knows no
other music.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go against nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen silently – and whatever you have to do and whatever you have
to be, all directions are within you.</p><p>Once in a while you may go wrong, you may commit a mistake. But
they’re all part of natural life, and you will learn from them. Each
learning is based on mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing has to be certain: you have to be strong enough to take
the whole responsibility of your life, for good or for bad. Act out of
freedom, out of awareness; not out of dead principles and religions and
books.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, fearlessness, courageousness is the foundational quality of a
religious man. He will risk all, but he cannot go against his own
insight. Whatever the consequences, he will follow his own insight. This
is how he becomes stronger and stronger, more and more like steel, so
that even fire cannot destroy him.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ENLIGHTENMENT SEEMS TO ME ALWAYS TO BE AN END, A DEATH, A KIND OF
SUICIDE WHERE A COMEBACK IS NEVER POSSIBLE – NO MORE ADVENTURES, NO
LOVERS, NO SUNSETS, NO DRAMAS, NO CANDLELIGHT DINNERS. WHAT CAN BE MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SENSELESS DRAMAS AND JOYS OF ALL MY SEARCHINGS? HOW
IS IT AFTER DEATH FOR AN ENLIGHTENED MAN? IS IT NOT BORING FOR THE NEXT
TEN THOUSAND YEARS? I FEEL SIMPLY A DEATH-FEAR.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment can be a very scary thing.</p><p><br></p><p>It can create a great paranoia in you. And your question is
significant, because millions of people in the world never think about
enlightenment, and the reason may be this deep-rooted fear. They have
known a certain kind of life and they think this is the only life
possible – that’s where they go wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the lowest form of life that we are living. In fact, to call
it life is not right, it is only birth. It is only a possibility. You
can make a life out of it – life has to be created. And the
misunderstanding is so old ... and people don’t want to drop it because
it is so consoling to think that you are alive and you are enjoying
everything and it is a beautiful drama.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have been through this drama many times.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same drama. Small details change ... A is married to B
instead of to C. One lives in this country, is born into another ... but
goes through the same routine. The same misery will come, the same
jealousy will come; all the games of ambition that people go on playing
will be there – but you are not bored. You are not bored because each
time you die your memory closes a door; otherwise you will go mad.
Nature has an autonomous system: the moment a person dies his whole
memory system of that life goes with him into the new life, but the door
is closed.</p><p><br></p><p>One of Mahavira’s contributions to the world is his method of jati
smaran. Jati smaran means the science of remembering your past lives. It
was his absolute emphasis that nobody should become a sannyasin unless
he goes through the remembrance of a few past lives. He was asked many
times, “Why this insistence?” because nobody else insists on it.</p><p>He said, “Unless you look into your past lives, and you see that you
have been doing the same thing again and again and again, and your hands
are still empty, and you are again doing those same things<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>You will become bored and you will start feeling that ‘I must be
utterly unintelligent’ – but because each life is completely closed to
you, you don’t know anything about your past. You don’t have any insight
into your future.</p><p><br></p><p>All that you know is this small life, and in this small life you know
two things: the misery and the pain of life, and ways and methods of
forgetting that misery and pain. That you call your amusement,
entertainment – going to a movie, to a circus. These are your ways to
forget your life. There you became engaged for two or three hours in a
different world.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened person is certainly difficult for you to conceive
of.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like if you smoke, you cannot conceive how millions of
people go on without smoking. They must be missing! And the person who
does not smoke is not missing anything except some nicotine, some poison
that will kill you earlier than him. Otherwise, he is not missing
anything. The person who is an alcoholic cannot believe that the whole
world goes on without the bottle. He cannot live even a single day
without the bottle. He feels pity for you: “Poor fellows, they don’t
know that there is a way, through alcohol, to forget all the burdens of
life.” But he cannot conceive of a life which has no burdens at all to
forget.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is your position. When you think about enlightenment, the
problem is that you don’t understand that the man who is enlightened is
no more an ego. You can insult him but you cannot hurt him; you can
abuse him, you can condemn him, and there will be no change in his
being. Even if you kill him he will remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult for you to understand how an enlightened man can
remain without going to circuses, movies<span class=s4></span>and all
kinds of stupidities are there. But so few enlightened people have
existed that not</p><p>much is known about them. And much is such that unless you experience
it, you cannot understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>For the enlightened person, everything that is going on around him is
a circus. There is no need for him to purchase a ticket – his problem is
how to get out of the circus! He does not want to go to the movie, he
wants to get out!</p><p><br></p><p>But wherever he goes.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of Gautam Buddha in Bombay.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is not difficult to infer why these people have declined to
happen. Why no more Gautam Buddhas, Mahaviras, Bodhidharmas,
Zarathustras? Where have all these tremendously beautiful people
disappeared to? Why are they not more available to us? Because humanity
has grown so much – just in the proportion.<span class=s4></span>In
India there were only two million people in the time of Buddha. Now
there</p><p>are nine hundred million people in India. Just looking at the
proportion, at least a dozen Buddhas are absolutely needed!</p><p>But that kind of person has disappeared – and he has disappeared
because what you call life he has found to be nothing but slow
death.</p><p><br></p><p>And he has found the real life. Once a person finds the real life,
why he should come back into a miserable world?</p><p><br></p><p>But your question is relevant. You feel afraid that sitting silently
for thousands of years is going to be difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t know that if you are silent, time stops. There are no
more ten thousand years, ten million years, nothing. Just a simple
now.</p><p><br></p><p>When mind is silent, time disappears because mind is time.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are worried that in life there is so much drama, and the
enlightened man ... what is he going to do for eternity?</p><p><br></p><p>What drama you are talking about? One idiot slipping on a banana
peel? And everybody starts laughing ... this is not compassionate. Even
if that man is a banana, he has every right to slip on a banana peel. He
is not harming anybody, just doing some special kind of yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>But why are you laughing?</p><p><br></p><p>Your life is full of sadness and you are in search ... wherever there
is a possibility to laugh, some sadness is thrown away, some burden is
thrown away. Certainly, an enlightened person will not be laughing.
There is no need. The laughter is needed because of your sadness, it is
an antidote to sadness. The enlightened man is so blissful ... and
remember, blissfulness is not happiness. That’s where things always
become confused.</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness is momentary: on both sides of happiness there is
unhappiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Blissfulness has no opposite to it, there is no such thing as
“unblissfulness.” There is only blissfulness, and that blissfulness is
not dependent on anybody else or anything outside the enlightened being
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>His source of bliss is within his own being.</p><p><br></p><p>He is shining, radiating what he has experienced. And the more he
shares it, the more it goes on growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Time has no existence for him any more.</p><p><br></p><p>He lives in the moment. And he lives so totally and so intensely that
there is no space for any sadness or any misery to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t decide anything before experiencing at least a little
sample. Experience a little meditation and it will be the answer to your
question. Because one day you will find that you are sitting silently
and so joyful, for no reason at all.</p><p>The moment one becomes enlightened, one becomes blissfulness, one
becomes benediction. Time and space both disappear. He becomes one with
the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Then stars are within him, flowers are within him, skies upon skies
are within him. Then birds on the wing are within him.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now everything is outside you. Enlightenment brings everything
inside you.</p><p>It spreads you far and wide, to infinities. Many such questions will
arise, but don’t just intellectually think about them. Otherwise, you
will be missing the real juice of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Your questions should come out of your experiments; then they will be
existential and they will be of immense help for your growth.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WHY DO WE TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED? WHY WILL WE, YOUR DISCIPLES, NOT RECOGNIZE YOU UNTIL YOUR CRUCIFIXION? WHEN YOU SAID THAT, IT WAS LIKE A SWORD THROUGH ME.\nSudha, the recognition of a master depends on your becoming more conscious, more aware, more alert. Coming out of your sleep, coming out of your dreams and thoughts, in an absolutely silent mind, the recognition happens – because the master is silence.\nThe master is awareness. The master is love.\nThe master is not a person but a presence. The person died the day enlightenment happened. After enlightenment, there is no person as such but only a presence, a light. You can recognize it only if you have some of the qualities: love, awareness, compassion, consciousness – just a small window. Not that you have to be perfectly awakened – then, certainly you will recognize, but then recognition is of no use. Recognition is of use when you are on the path moving towards the unknown, not knowing exactly whether there is something ahead of you or you just have fallen victim to some fallacious philosophy.\nThe recognition of the master will help you in spite of your doubts, in spite of your uncertainties, in spite of your ups and downs. The recognition of the master will keep you on the path because you know – it happens, and if it can happen to somebody else, there is no reason why it cannot happen to you.\nEvery human being has an equal possibility of becoming enlightened. That is true communism. Only enlightened people can be really communist. The unenlightened is always thinking himself superior to somebody, inferior to somebody. He is always struggling to go forward, to be the first in the race, to reach the highest glory on this earth of money, of power, of prestige.\nBut if you are not aware and alert, if you have not yet experienced the love that is no longer part of biology, then there is only one way you can recognize the master and that is when he is crucified.\nHis crucifixion is bound to wake you up, at least for a moment. And in that very moment will be the recognition – and a tremendous feeling of loss, because when the master was alive, you remained asleep. Now the master is no more, and because of his death... the shock is so much that it awakens you for a moment. But even that single moment is like when lightening suddenly happens on a dark night, and you see the whole scene.\nI know it hurts to think that the master you have loved can be crucified. But remember one thing which has not been discussed in the past two thousand years; even Christians have not discussed it, although their master was crucified. Neither in the Greek tradition after Socrates have his disciples ever conceived of what I am going to tell you:\nThe crucifixion of Jesus was not only the responsibility of the Jews. The real responsibility for his crucifixion was his disciples’.\nIt was very easy not to be caught by the Jews. Judea was such a small country; you could get out of Judea any moment. And Jews were not free people – they were in slavery under the Romans. They could not do anything directly. They had to persuade the Roman emperor, the Roman viceroy, and it was known almost all over Judea that if Jesus should go to Jerusalem for the Jewish holidays when people go on a holy pilgrimage, he would be crucified.\nIt was common knowledge. And there was no need for Jesus to go. Jews were not listening to him – what was the need? Jews were gathering and the rumor was that they would try to crucify him, they would put as much pressure as possible on the viceroy, Pontius Pilate. But if he is not there, nothing can be done. He insisted on going there.\nAnd I suspect that George Gurdjieff is right – that Judas simply performed the function of a devoted disciple; he was not the enemy of Jesus and he did not betray. It was Jesus himself who sent Judas to inform the enemies where he was. It must have been very difficult for Judas, but to follow the master, he went against himself. And Jesus was caught because of the information given by Judas.\nAnd I say that he must have done it against himself because as Jesus was crucified, suddenly he became aware of what he had done. Death is not a small matter. He had killed the man he loved, he had killed the man he worshipped. He was feeling so much repentance that within twenty-four hours he committed suicide.\nChristians don’t talk about why Judas committed suicide, why Jesus insisted against the will of his disciples to go on that ugly night to Jerusalem.\nAs far as I am concerned, my feeling is that his disciples were fast asleep – and Jesus had tried everything to wake them up and they would not wake up. Hence, he had chosen the last resort of a master. Perhaps his life cannot help. There is no harm in taking the chance – maybe what life has not been able to do and perform, death succeeds in doing.\nAnd it succeeded – the shock not only made an impact on the disciples but on sympathizers, on curiosity mongers, on people who were absolutely neutral, on people who had never thought about Jesus Christ. The crucifixion made everyone give a thought to this strange young man. Where do you think so many Christians have come from? Their basic number has come from the Jews.\nWhile Jesus was alive, not even a single rabbi – and Jerusalem was full of learned rabbis; it had the Jewish university, all the scholars were there – not a single scholar, not a single rabbi recognized him. Not a single man of reputation... because everybody was afraid. Just to be associated with Jesus’ name could be dangerous to you. But when he was crucified – and crucified in such a primitive and ugly way that it shocked the whole nation – even those who were in opposition felt that what had happened was not right. Because the man was innocent.\nHe may have been saying outrageous things but he had not done anything against any law, against any morality. And to reward him with crucifixion simply condemned the whole Judaic religion and tradition. Thousands of Jews who had never paid any attention to Jesus became Christians, and the basic number came from Judea.\nPerhaps the strategy of crucifixion worked. And for a man like Jesus, life and death don’t matter. What matters is that he has found something and he wants to share it – but it is so difficult to find somebody willing to share life’s greatest blessings and benedictions.\nSudha, it hurts but I have to tell you the truth. And you have to understand: It is not being told to somebody else, it is being told to you, to each person individually.\nIf you are not awake, then perhaps it is worth my being crucified. If that helps you to be more conscious, to be more loving, to be more alert, to be more integrated.…\nMy life and my death are both for you.\nFor a single purpose, I go on continuing breathing. I hope... it is time that man should become more conscious on a worldwide scale, because except for that, nothing can save humanity from the destruction of the third world war that is looming darker and darker every day on the horizon.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nMEHER BABA SPEAKS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENLIGHTENED MASTERS. ONE HE CALLS “MAN BECOMING GOD,” THE OTHER HE CALLS “GOD BECOMING MAN.” GAUTAM\nBUDDHA BELONGS TO THE FIRST – SLOWLY, THROUGH MANY LIVES, HE HAS FLOWERED INTO THE STATE OF BUDDHAHOOD. MEHER BABA ASSERTS THAT HE BELONGS TO THE SECOND, “GOD BECOMING MAN.” I HAVE NOT REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANS. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?\nThe question is difficult because there is a misunderstanding on the part of Meher Baba.\nIn India, there are two types of religions: Hinduism believes that God comes down and becomes man. They call it avatar – the very word avatar means descendence. Rama and Krishna, according to Hindu mythology, are gods in disguise. God is coming from above to be a man; that is the Hindu idea.\nIn India, there are other religions – Jainism, Buddhism – which have a totally different standpoint. God does not come down because there is no God above; God is sleeping within you. It has to be awakened. So man, slowly slowly, becomes more and more conscious and finally becomes God.\nGod is the transformed, purified consciousness of man.\nMeher Baba must have been in difficulty – which one to choose? He tried to console both types of people in India by making this statement that “God happens in two ways: First he descends and becomes a man and second, he ascends through man and blossoms, manifests himself.”\nI am not, even for a single moment, in favor of consoling anybody because all consolations are lies. And this is a consolation. The truth is, there is no God above, so the very question of him descending does not arise. Secondly, just for the sake of argument – if we accept the hypothesis that God is – what could be the purpose for him, to come down and become man? According to the same scriptures, God is omnipotent, all-powerful; omnipresent, present everywhere; omniscient, knowing past, present, future, all that has happened and all that is going to happen.\nGod knows everything. Then what is the purpose of him descending in a human form? Can’t he do something without becoming a man? Then his omnipotence is not omnipotence. That creates a great suspicion about his powers. Secondly, he has come in many reincarnations in Hinduism but humanity is living in a madhouse. What purpose has been served?\nGod has not been able to change anything. The world goes on and on into darker realms, into more miserable hells, into more meaningless patterns of life. What have the reincarnations of God done?\nThirdly, the reincarnations of God – if seen without any prejudice – do not look divine in any sense.\nFor example, Rama and his wife Sita, and his brother Laxmana, were sent to live beyond the boundaries of their kingdom for fourteen years. Because the father of Rama had four wives... and the youngest and the most beautiful wife certainly had power over the old man. She wanted her son... but her son was the youngest; there were four sons and her son was the youngest. But she wanted her son to be crowned and to succeed the old, dying father. She forced her husband to send Rama, at least for fourteen years, into the jungles.\nDasharatha, the father of Rama, must have been a very henpecked husband, a weakling. Rama was to succeed him; preparations were being made for his enthronement. But Dasharatha, almost dying, called Rama and said, “This is my last wish and I hope you are able to fulfill it.”\nRama promised, not knowing what the wish was. And the wish was that he should go outside the kingdom for fourteen years into the jungles, into the mountains. Dasharatha was so weak in his last moments... and Rama’s only quality was obedience, so he did not even ask why – “Why this punishment?”\nBut because he was going – and he was just ordered; I don’t think gods can be so docile, so obedient to things which are absolutely wrong – his wife insisted that she would come with him. They had just got married, they had been coming home from their marriage.\nNow Rama could not deny her. He tried to persuade her that life would be difficult in the jungles: “You have lived as a princess of a very great king, you don’t know the lifeFourteen years will be\ntoo long. You live in the palace and wait.”\nBut she refused. She said, “I am married to you, not to the palace. And if you can manage to live in the forest, don’t be worried about me. I will manage.”\nAnd then the second brother, Laxmana, would not agree with Rama or Sita that he need not come. He had also married at the same time as Rama; he was married to Sita’s younger sister.\nBut he loved Rama so much, he said, “I cannot live without him, I am coming.”\nIn the forest, as they woke up on the first day, Rama and Sita were standing outside the cottage and they saw a golden deer. Now, even an idiot knows deer are not made of gold. And Sita became very much interested in the deer and she asked Rama to go and hunt the deer: “Either living or dead, but you have to bring him to me.”\nAnd the strangest thing is that even Rama does not say to her that “Deer are not made of gold.” There is no mention of the fact. I cannot see Gautam Buddha being befooled by a deer, but Rama is befooled.\nBeing an incarnation of God, the mistake he is committing – it is perfectly good for human beings.… But even for intelligent human beings, it is not good; and God is behaving in the worst, most unintelligent way.\nIf you look at the life of Rama and dissect it, you will not find anything godly in it. He may be a great king, he may be an obedient son, but these are ordinary human qualities – nothing to do with God.\nOne day a brahmin came with the dead body of his son and said, “It has never happened that a young son has died before the death of his father. So something very serious is involved in it, you have to find the reason.”\nRama asked, “Do you have any idea?”\nThe brahmin said, “I know perfectly well what happened. I will tell my story, and then you can search and find out who caused the death of my son.” He said, “We were doing a Vedic ritual.”\nAnd the sudras, the untouchables, the poorest in India – they are one-fourth of the whole population. They are not allowed to read the VEDAS, the Hindu religious scriptures. They are not even allowed\nto listen. If somebody else is reading, they are not allowed to listen. And these brahmins were doing the ritual and a young, curious untouchable was hiding behind the bushes and listening to what was happening and he was caught red-handed.\nThe brahmin’s argument was that a sudra had heard the VEDA, and that’s why his son had died.\nDo you see any kind of connection between the two? – logical, illogical, any connection? Animals are hearing, dogs are hearing, birds are hearing, trees are hearing. But a sudra – an untouchable, a poor man – cannot hear.\nAnd the brahmin proposed that his act of hearing the VEDAS was the cause of the death of his son – this is absolutely unrelated. Why particularly his son? There were many brahmins in the ritual, but nobody else’s son had died. And in fact, if there was to be any punishment, the young sudra should have died. If it is something as Hindus think, a book written by God, it would have looked logical that the sudra should die, because he broke God’s law.\nThe son of the brahmin has not done anything at all. What is he being punished for? The father has also not done anything. The punishment should be pointing towards the sudra – if that is God’s law, then there is no question.\nBut Rama does not say a single thing to this irrelevant, idiotic, conclusion. On the contrary, he orders that the sudra be brought to his court. That poor man was brought and he said “I was listening because I wanted to hear something about God. I am also human. There is a desire for search in me.”\nBut the reincarnated God in Rama does not listen to the poor man. Instead of listening to his absolutely rational explanation, he orders that: “Such things should not happen in the country again.” To prevent it, this young man will have to suffer. Bring hot melted lead and pour it into his ears. That will be the punishment, because he heard with those ears the words prohibited to him.” Melted lead was poured into the ears of the sudra and he became deaf for his whole life.\nDo you think these acts are divine?\nI have been to many courts unnecessarily because whenever I would say anything about Rama, somebody’s heart would start having attacks; their religious feelings would be hurt. Their religious feelings are not hurt by the act of Rama. Their religious feelings are hurt but in a wrong situation; I am simply saying what is written in their scriptures.\nI cannot believe that Rama is an incarnation of God. And the same is the case with other incarnations. Their life proves that they have nothing to do with God.\nGautam Buddha, or Mahavira, or Bodhidharma, or Nagarjuna – these are evolving consciousnesses. They don’t believe there is a God. Their experience is that you have to create a god within you, you have to become a womb, and you have the potential to become a god. And looking at Gautam Buddha – just the way he sits, just the way he moves, just the way he speaks, or remains silent – gives valid evidence to anybody whose heart is open to understand that he has moved to the highest peak of consciousness.\nIn his small acts you can see that.\nChristians are very proud of the miracles of Jesus and they are most proud of one miracle: bringing Lazarus back to life. He had died. But nobody bothers that Lazarus died and remained dead for four days. Wherever he has been, in hell or in heaven, he must bring back some report. Four days is enough time – and seeing death, seeing beyond death, his consciousness must change. He cannot remain the same old person.\nBut he remains the same old person, nothing changes. So what is the miracle? And sooner or later, one day he has to die. So at the most his death is postponed a few years, but he will live these few years in unconsciousness, in violence, in hatred, in jealousy. And he will accumulate more sin. And you call it a miracle!\nNo, a miracle needs a more refined perspective of understanding.\nThe same situation arises in Gautam Buddha’s life; that’s why I have taken Lazarus’ case.\nOne woman comes crying madly – her only son has died. Her husband has died, her other three children have died and now this child was the only hope of her life; she was living for him. Otherwise, there was nothing for her to live for. She was asking in the village, “Do you know of any physician who can help?”\nThey said, “No physician can do anything once a person is dead but Gautam Buddha has arrived in town today. Perhaps his presence may trigger life again, perhaps his touch.You go directly to\nGautam Buddha; don’t waste time.”\nShe took the corpse of her son, went to Buddha, laid down the corpse at his feet and said, “My only son has died. You have taken my husband – I didn’t say anything, I did not complain. You have taken my three other children – I remained silent, I accepted it as my fate. But this is too much.”\nAnd for an Indian widow there is no life. She cannot go to celebrations, she cannot wear colored clothes, she has to shave her head. She has to live only in white clothes, doing all kinds of things the whole day long that nobody in the home is ready to do. Her life is simply the life of a slave.\nThat woman said to Gautam Buddha, “Either give life back to my son or kill me.”\nBuddha said, “Don’t be worried. I will bring your son back to life, but you have to do a small thing.” She said, “I will do anything, just tell me.”\nHe said, “You go into the town, inquire at a few houses. We need a few mustard seeds, but we need those mustard seeds from a house where nobody has ever died.”\nShe was in such misery, in such a mess. She could not see the point. She ran from house to house. They all said, “We are willing to give you as many mustard seeds as you want, because our whole village produces crops of mustard seed. We can bring bullock carts full of mustard seed if your son can be alive again, but our mustard seeds won’t work. You have not heard the condition well. The\ncondition is that nobody in the family should have died. We are sorry... so many people in our family have died.”\nBy evening it was clear that mustard seeds from a family where nobody had died could not be found. And slowly slowly, it became clear to the woman that death is a natural phenomenon. It happens to everybody in every family“Even if my child again becomes alive, he will have to die again. Asking\nfor his life is asking for another death, it is pointless. He cannot live forever.”\nShe came back almost a different woman and she told Buddha, “I could not find the mustard seeds. I was in such misery that I could not understand your strategy. I could have got the idea when you told me, because I know it is impossible to find a family where people have not died. Your father must have died, your grandfather must have died.it is impossible to find a family which has had no\nencounter with death. But now, I come with an understanding – I don’t want my son to be brought back to life, because he will have to die again. I want you to bless his future journey, so that he achieves what you have achieved.\n“Life is not significant. Life is significant only when you have attained the eternal light, the eternal being, the immortal continuity from the very beginning, if there has been any beginning – to the end, if there is going to be any end.\n“And for me,” she said, “initiate me. Because before I die, I want to know that my essential being is not going to die.”\nBuddha said, “Now this seems to be reasonable. You are an intelligent woman.” She was initiated and became one of the most important woman disciples of Gautam Buddha.\nNow, both cases are almost the same, but the way Gautam Buddha transforms the whole thing.… From death, he turns the mind of the woman towards immortal life. He has used the opportunity for a great transformation.\nRemember: God is the highest evolution of your consciousness. It is always man who becomes God. It is never God who becomes man. The idea of one God that is prevelent in Christianity, in Judaism, in Mohammedism, is childish.\nAccording to the Eastern mystics and seers, every being is potentially a god. And finally, when the whole garden comes to blossom, there will be millions of gods.\nThe very idea of one God is fascist, dictatorial, monopolistic. The idea of everybody being a god brings equality to existence; it is the finest democratic foundation. All other values are secondary. This simple fact, that everybody is a hidden god and is capable of realizing it any moment he decides, makes the whole world godly – and gives you an opportunity not to wait for some God or Godot, not to wait for some savior, messiah or messenger. Because there is no God; all these messengers are lying. They are not courageous enough to say, “This is what I am saying.” They are using the name of God – “It is God who is saying it.” They are simply the messengers, the vehicles.\nGautam Buddha is not a vehicle of anybody, Mahavira is not a vehicle of anybody. What they are saying is their own experience. That’s why they have a great authority. You will not find that authority\nin other theologians – their authority is borrowed from others. Nobody knows if those people had any experience or if they were also borrowing it.\nMeher Baba is trying to console this country’s mind, so he accepts both possibilities: either man can rise and become God, or God can come down and become man. But he is not aware of a simple fact: that man rising towards God has an evolutionary purpose, there is some meaning.\nGod descending and becoming a man – that is a fall! Why should this be done? And whatever your God wants to do, he can do without becoming a man. He could create the whole world without becoming a man; now, what is the need?\nOn the one hand, the religious people say, “Without God’s will, not even a single leaf on a tree can waver.” If this is the situation, then for all the sins and for all ugly things that go on happening – God is responsible. If even a leaf cannot move without his support, how can a man be murdered without his support? How can a woman be raped without his support? And what is the purpose for him to come here? Because he has not done anything. So many times, so many incarnations but humanity has not grown up, it has not been enhanced by their presence.\nSo Meher Baba is simply trying so that the Hindu masses will be satisfied with him. And in India, Jainas are very few – negligible, not even one-percent. The number of Buddhists is negligible; just forty years ago there was not a single Buddhist. Even in the temple of Bodhgaya where Gautam Buddha became enlightened, the priest is a brahmin, because there was no Buddhist even to be a priest in their holiest place. This is their holiest place, their Kaaba; Buddhists come from all over the world to worship there. And strangely enough, Buddha was continuously fighting against brahminism and the priest is a brahmin! And the priest is not only a brahmin today, he has been there for fifteen hundred years – the same family. Because for fifteen hundred years, Buddhism disappeared.\nSo there is no problem about satisfying the Jains and the Buddhists. This country is basically Hindu – and you must be made aware that Meher Baba was not a Hindu, he was a Parsee. And because he was a Parsee, he was condemned by the Parsees – just the natural lawSo the Parsees were\nnot ready to accept him. Now who is going to accept this man?\nJainas and Buddhists are out of the question. They are such small minorities, even if they accept him it is not going to make much difference. Moreover, it is not easy for them to accept him for the simple reason that he was proclaiming, “Up to now, God has sent only his messengers, but I myself am God.” Only Hindus might be persuaded to accept the idea that God has become man. Mohammedans cannot be persuaded, because even Hazrat Mohammed is not a reincarnation but only a messenger. Christians cannot be convinced; they have their God and they have the only begotten son of God, Jesus Christ. Whenever God needs, he sends his own son; that shows his concern.\nMeher Baba was in difficulty. He had to fall on the side of the Hindus, that was the only possibility. Parsees had renounced him and nobody else would accept him; only Hindus could give him scope. So he says, “There are two types. First – man becoming God; Gautam Buddha comes in that category. And second – God becoming man.” And he says, “I fall into the second category.”\nBut I say to you, there is no possibility of two categories.\nLife knows only evolution; it never goes backwards.\nAnd a god becoming a man is simply stupid. For what should God become man? What will be the purpose? All that he wants to do he can do from wherever he is. But he is nowhere – and that gives the chance to a few charlatans to proclaim that they are God, reincarnations of God.\nMeher Baba is certainly an enlightened person.\nBut every enlightened person finds himself in different situations. Meher Baba’s situation was very unique, because in the history of Parsees there is no such thing as enlightenment. The Parsees were very angry when he declared that he is God himself, because to Parsees, to Mohammedans, to Christians, this declaration that “I am God” hurts very much.\nThey want their God to remain as far away as possible, so they can go on doing whatsoever they are doing. God standing just there... and you were going to hit your husband with the pillow... it doesn’t look right. But he is standing there – that’s what millions of believers think, that he is everywhere present. So remember: when you are hitting, look around and hit some suspicious place where you think God might be, rather than hitting a poor husband!\nMeher Baba lived in a strange situation. Parsees were denying him, Jainas and Buddhists would not accept him; Mohammedans, Christians, Jews would deny him because he was saying he is the whole God, what to say about the only begotten son? The only possibility was that a few Hindus may gather around him, and that’s what happened. Finally, only a few Hindus were around him. And as he died, his movement died too. Because he could not manage to be a master. He remained a mystic. He tried, but as a master, he was a failure.\nAs a mystic, he succeeded. As far as he is concerned, he has arrived, but alone – no fellow travelers, no friends, no lovers. It has not been a celebrating procession of many enlightened people, moving with him into the universal life sources. He has moved alone.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI’M CONSTANTLY AMAZED AT HOW YOU USE YOUR MIND LIKE A COMPUTER – SUCH PURE AND SIMPLE GENIUS, IN FACT, SUPER-GENIUS. LAO TZU SAID HE WAS A MUDDLEHEAD, YET THE CLARITY OF GENIUS IS THERE ALSO. BELOVED OSHO, WHEN A PERSON BECOMES ENLIGHTENED, IS THE MIND SO FREE OF EGO THAT ONLY GENIUS IS LEFT? OR ARE SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENLIGHTENED MUDDLEHEADS?\nEnlightenment has nothing to do with mind.\nIn meditation, you bypass the mind. Meditation reaches with you to the highest peak – with all its silence, with all its flowers, with all its beauty. As you become enlightened, your mind drops all the rubbish it has carried for hundreds of lives; it is an autonomous happening.\nAs you become enlightened, the mind immediately drops all rubbish, that rubbish you were clinging to because you had no idea who you are. That rubbish had become your identity, and now you know your real identity; you don’t need that false burden on you. It simply falls naturally, on its own accord.\nYour mind becomes a simple, immensely powerful mechanism. But it remains now as a servant. Up to now it was the master; after enlightenment, it is a beautiful servant. And certainly, as you say, it is a computer.\nThe people who work with computers say that we have not yet been able to make a computer of the size of the human brain which is capable of containing so much information. Your brain has seven million cells, and each cell can contain millions of bits of information. The experts say that one percent can memorize all the books from all the libraries of the world – this is the capacity of your mind.\nBut in jealousy, in anger, in hate, in possessiveness – who has the time? Once you are enlightened, you can use the mind the way it is meant to be used, as a beautiful computer. And because you are enlightened, it is no longer clouded with sentiments and emotions; it is clean, a sky without any clouds.\nIts clarity is its genius. And every mind is a genius, there are no other kinds of minds in the world.\nSo there is no possibility of an enlightened man having a muddled head, an enlightened man having the mind of an idiot – that is impossible. The enlightenment is such a transforming force, it changes everything in you; particularly in the mind.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THE SINGING OF THE INDIAN SWAMI WHO SINGS BEFORE DISCOURSE. I FELT AS IF HE WERE PLAYING ME LIKE A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. I FELT LIKE A BIG EAR, JUST LISTENING. MOST OTHER MUSIC I HEAR BASICALLY AMOUNTS TO NOISE – IT’S ENTERTAINING, BUT IT DOESN’T TOUCH ME. WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIS MUSIC AND THE MUSIC OF ALL THOSE MUSICIANS WHO TOUCH SOMETHING INSIDE US, THAT HELPS US TO FLY?\nMusic is born out of deep experiences of meditation; it is a dimension of meditation. By meditating, you may be able to be touched by music, but the reverse is also true: If you are totally absorbed in music, your heart will be touched not only by music but by meditation too.\nMusic is sound. Meditation is soundlessness.\nThe highest music is where the sound does not destroy the soundless moments in between. As the musician becomes more and more refined, he can manage to create sound, and between two sounds he can give you an experience of soundlessness.\nThat soundlessness touches the heart.\nIn the East, music has always been part of meditation. Temples have been full of music and dance.\nAshok Bharti loves me. His music is just a communication of his love. He pours himself totally into it. The same is happening with the other sannyasin musician who is present today. They are not\njust technicians, they are not singing because they are paid. They are singing out of love, out of gratitude.\nTheir singing is just pure innocence. And their words are not just words – they mean it. And because they mean it, they can touch your heart, they can transform your heart.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF PERVERSION IN REGARD TO SEX?\nSarjano, perversion means your energy is not going in the natural way; the natural way has been blocked, suppressed, condemned. But the energy is there and collecting, it is bound to find some outlet. That outlet will not be natural. That outlet will be perversion.\nAnd the whole past of man is nothing else – from different directions, for different excuses you have been told to cut off your natural paths for energy and expression.\nMan is an intelligent being. Even unintelligent animals are bound to find some way. In the wild, no animals turn homosexual; there is no need because there is no priest. But man is so much conditioned against a few things – sex being the main one – that if he lives sex naturally, he feels guilty that he is going against God, against religion. If he prevents his natural expressions, then soon his energies start moving into perverted forms.\nJust the other day, I received the information that by the end of this century, there will be one billion people suffering from AIDS. And this is the lowest estimate. I don’t feel the number will be so low. The number, according to me, may be double.\nAIDS is the ultimate expression of perverted sexual energy. And the wonder is that you are surrounded with such dangerous things.… AIDS can destroy the whole planet, because we don’t have any medicine and the doctors and the scientists are openly saying that there seems to be no possibility, at least in the near future, to find a medicine. So once you have AIDS, your death is certain within six months to two years, and you cannot do anything except wait.\nA disease like AIDS has come through homosexuality. It is the ultimateAnd the perversion is\nnot condemned; on the contrary, in different ways it is supported because every religion believes in brahmacharya, in celibacy. Now those who believe in celibacy are standing in the queue – first they will be homosexuals, lesbians and sooner or later, they will receive the ultimate reward, the Nobel prize – AIDS.\nNow religions are responsible for it. But this is what I say, human insanity.…\nIn Texas, they have made a law against homosexuality. Now it is a crime in Texas; you can get five to ten years in jail. Texas is a backward state in America. Even I was surprised that one million homosexuals demonstrated against the legislature and these may not be all the homosexuals in the state of Texas. But one million homosexuals! And they made it clear to the government that\nby making homosexuality illegal, you cannot prevent it. You have made many things illegal in the past, and what have you prevented? Has theft disappeared? Has murder disappeared? Is rape something of the past?\nYou cannot stop it with your laws because you have never stopped anything with your laws. You are just befooling the masses, making a law so people feel the government is doing something. But they don’t see that what they are doing, they have been doing for ten thousand years, and things have gone from bad to worse.\nWhen I read about it, I had two ideas: one, that to make homosexuality a crime and not to make celibacy a crime.… Because these homosexuals are products of your religion. Your religion condemns sex so much... your monks, your nuns, you have put them almost in prisons. Now these one million homosexuals in Texas will go underground. Just now, they had their clubs, their discos, their restaurants; they were openly homosexual. Now you have made it a crime. They will go underground. When they were open and known, there was a possibility to check them medically, to help them in some way. If somebody had AIDS already, he could be isolated. Places could be made where only AIDS people would be living, working.\nNow, nobody is going to accept that he has AIDS – why should he go for an examination? This is the danger. A single person can spread the disease like wildfire because it not only transferred by sexual contact – that is something more than ordinary sexual diseases – it can be transferred by other means.\nBlood transfusion... now you don’t know whose blood is being transfused into you. And if the man whose blood is being transfused into you has AIDS, you will have it. It can be transferred even just by kissing because saliva carries the virus. Now for the first time, the Siberians have been proved right because they have never kissed in their whole history, and they always laughed when they came in contact with Christian missionaries, watching them kissing each other. They could not believe it. These people have come to teach religion to you and they don’t even know hygiene. Mixing each other’s saliva, playing with each other’s tongues – and these idiots have come to preach religion!\nIn Siberia, they have never kissed. It is a dirty habit... you just think about it. Siberians rub noses with each other – that is pure hygiene. And as far as love is concerned, it can be expressed in many waysBut repression is going to grow.\nIn one monastery in Europe, half of the monastery has just declared that they are homosexuals, so the monastery is now divided in two parts. They are fighting amongst themselves – the homosexuals and the non-homosexuals. I am saying non-homosexuals because I cannot say they are celibate. It is almost impossible to be celibate unless something is wrong with your body.\nI have heard that Stanley was a very healthy sperm and the whole day he used to do push-ups while all the other sperm were just relaxing. And they were puzzled: “What is wrong with this Stanley? The whole day, exercises, exercises.”\nFinally, one of these lazy people asked Stanley, “Please tell us what the secret is? Why are you exercising so much? The whole day, from the time you wake up till you go to sleep, you are exercising, doing this, doing that. What is the purpose?”\nHe said, “You don’t know? You guys are fools. Only one sperm is going to reach the woman’s egg. And next time when the release comes, I am Stanley, the one who is going to get to the egg. That is the purpose.”\nAnd one day suddenly they started feeling very hot and they all thought the time had come. Before they could have discussed among themselves what to do, they were released so suddenly... but they all saw Stanley far ahead. He was swimming so fast, they could not believe that one could swim so fast and then suddenly, Stanley turned back, screamed loudly, and said, “Go back, go back! It’s a blow job!”\nEven poor sperm are laughing at humanity.\nIf man is allowed to be simply natural, his life can give him immense joy, peace, silence, and finally the truth – but if his energies are perverted, then he goes round and round wasting himself.\nI have heard about an army officer who had been around the world, posted at different places – and naturally, the monks and the soldiers are in the same boat because you don’t allow soldiers their wives, their girlfriends.\nThis officer, Major Benson, was in Hong Kong and got into real trouble. He was going to prostitutes all over the world, but he was not aware of Chinese prostitutes. They are the most dangerous. He fell into the trap of a Chinese prostitute and seeing the situation, looking at the naked body of the prostitute, he felt that it was better to have a medical check-up: “This woman seems to be sick and one does not know what kind of sickness she is carrying.”\nSo he went to the American section of the city and found a doctor. The doctor examined him and said, “Nothing can be done. You need an immediate operation; your cock has to be removed.”\nThe man was shocked. He said, “My God!”\nThe doctor said, “You have so many diseases that in this one life, they cannot be cured.”\nHe came out dazed. He thought it would be better to have another opinion, so he went to another American doctor.\nHe checked him thoroughly and said, “I’m sorry, the first doctor was right. It is too late. Nothing can be done and if you don’t have the operation soon, even an operation may not help; the diseases may have spread all over your body. So don’t waste time. I can do the operation tomorrow.”\nHe said, “I will be coming tomorrow,” but he was not satisfied with the idea that he would have to live his whole life without a cock.\nSuddenly, he saw a Chinese doctor’s signboard. He thought, “Perhaps a Chinese doctor might be helpful.”\nHe went in. The doctor looked. The other doctors had spent hours in checking his whole body, this and that. The Chinese doctor just looked with a magnifying glass and said, “There is no need for any operation.”\nBenson was very happy. He said, “Really? Is there any hope?”\nHe said, “Every hope. First, you went to a Chinese woman – because these diseases you can get only from a Chinese prostitute. The second wrong thing you did was, you went to American doctors who are just after money, money, money – and money means you have to do something. Even if your cock disappears, they are not worried; they need money. An operation means money. You don’t be worried, there is no need of any operation.”\nBenson was very happy. He said, “Thank you!” He gave much money to him and the old man said, “Whenever there is any trouble, come to me, don’t go to American doctors. They are simply cheating people.”\nJust to have a final word from the doctor, he said, “So now I can go? There is no need?”\nHe said, “There is no need, I have told you. Just wait two or three weeks and the pecker will fall off by itself.”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7513","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/>Sermons in Stones</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16 Recognizing the Master</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7513 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sermons_in_Stones/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

GRANTED? WHY WILL WE, YOUR DISCIPLES, NOT RECOGNIZE YOU UNTIL YOUR
CRUCIFIXION? WHEN YOU SAID THAT, IT WAS LIKE A SWORD THROUGH ME.</p><p><br></p><p>Sudha, the recognition of a master depends on your becoming more
conscious, more aware, more alert. Coming out of your sleep, coming out
of your dreams and thoughts, in an absolutely silent mind, the
recognition happens – because the master is silence.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is awareness. The master is love.</p><p>The master is not a person but a presence. The person died the day
enlightenment happened. After enlightenment, there is no person as such
but only a presence, a light. You can recognize it only if you have some
of the qualities: love, awareness, compassion, consciousness – just a
small window. Not that you have to be perfectly awakened – then,
certainly you will recognize, but then recognition is of no use.
Recognition is of use when you are on the path moving towards the
unknown, not knowing exactly whether there is something ahead of you or
you just have fallen victim to some fallacious philosophy.</p><p>The recognition of the master will help you in spite of your doubts,
in spite of your uncertainties, in spite of your ups and downs. The
recognition of the master will keep you on the path because you know –
it happens, and if it can happen to somebody else, there is no reason
why it cannot happen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Every human being has an equal possibility of becoming enlightened.
That is true communism. Only enlightened people can be really communist.
The unenlightened is always thinking himself superior to somebody,
inferior to somebody. He is always struggling to go forward, to be the
first in the race, to reach the highest glory on this earth of money, of
power, of prestige.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are not aware and alert, if you have not yet experienced
the love that is no longer part of biology, then there is only one way
you can recognize the master and that is when he is crucified.</p><p><br></p><p>His crucifixion is bound to wake you up, at least for a moment. And
in that very moment will be the recognition – and a tremendous feeling
of loss, because when the master was alive, you remained asleep. Now the
master is no more, and because of his death... the shock is so much that
it awakens you for a moment. But even that single moment is like when
lightening suddenly happens on a dark night, and you see the whole
scene.</p><p><br></p><p>I know it hurts to think that the master you have loved can be
crucified. But remember one thing which has not been discussed in the
past two thousand years; even Christians have not discussed it, although
their master was crucified. Neither in the Greek tradition after
Socrates have his disciples ever conceived of what I am going to tell
you:</p><p><br></p><p>The crucifixion of Jesus was not only the responsibility of the Jews.
The real responsibility for his crucifixion was his disciples’.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very easy not to be caught by the Jews. Judea was such a small
country; you could get out of Judea any moment. And Jews were not free
people – they were in slavery under the Romans. They could not do
anything directly. They had to persuade the Roman emperor, the Roman
viceroy, and it was known almost all over Judea that if Jesus should go
to Jerusalem for the Jewish holidays when people go on a holy
pilgrimage, he would be crucified.</p><p><br></p><p>It was common knowledge. And there was no need for Jesus to go. Jews
were not listening to him – what was the need? Jews were gathering and
the rumor was that they would try to crucify him, they would put as much
pressure as possible on the viceroy, Pontius Pilate. But if he is not
there, nothing can be done. He insisted on going there.</p><p><br></p><p>And I suspect that George Gurdjieff is right – that Judas simply
performed the function of a devoted disciple; he was not the enemy of
Jesus and he did not betray. It was Jesus himself who sent Judas to
inform the enemies where he was. It must have been very difficult for
Judas, but to follow the master, he went against himself. And Jesus was
caught because of the information given by Judas.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say that he must have done it against himself because as Jesus
was crucified, suddenly he became aware of what he had done. Death is
not a small matter. He had killed the man he loved, he had killed the
man he worshipped. He was feeling so much repentance that within
twenty-four hours he committed suicide.</p><p>Christians don’t talk about why Judas committed suicide, why Jesus
insisted against the will of his disciples to go on that ugly night to
Jerusalem.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned, my feeling is that his disciples were fast
asleep – and Jesus had tried everything to wake them up and they would
not wake up. Hence, he had chosen the last resort of a master. Perhaps
his life cannot help. There is no harm in taking the chance – maybe what
life has not been able to do and perform, death succeeds in doing.</p><p><br></p><p>And it succeeded – the shock not only made an impact on the disciples
but on sympathizers, on curiosity mongers, on people who were absolutely
neutral, on people who had never thought about Jesus Christ. The
crucifixion made everyone give a thought to this strange young man.
Where do you think so many Christians have come from? Their basic number
has come from the Jews.</p><p><br></p><p>While Jesus was alive, not even a single rabbi – and Jerusalem was
full of learned rabbis; it had the Jewish university, all the scholars
were there – not a single scholar, not a single rabbi recognized him.
Not a single man of reputation... because everybody was afraid. Just to
be associated with Jesus’ name could be dangerous to you. But when he
was crucified – and crucified in such a primitive and ugly way that it
shocked the whole nation – even those who were in opposition felt that
what had happened was not right. Because the man was innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>He may have been saying outrageous things but he had not done
anything against any law, against any morality. And to reward him with
crucifixion simply condemned the whole Judaic religion and tradition.
Thousands of Jews who had never paid any attention to Jesus became
Christians, and the basic number came from Judea.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the strategy of crucifixion worked. And for a man like Jesus,
life and death don’t matter. What matters is that he has found something
and he wants to share it – but it is so difficult to find somebody
willing to share life’s greatest blessings and benedictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Sudha, it hurts but I have to tell you the truth. And you have to
understand: It is not being told to somebody else, it is being told to
you, to each person individually.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are not awake, then perhaps it is worth my being crucified. If
that helps you to be more conscious, to be more loving, to be more
alert, to be more integrated.…</p><p><br></p><p>My life and my death are both for you.</p><p><br></p><p>For a single purpose, I go on continuing breathing. I hope... it is
time that man should become more conscious on a worldwide scale, because
except for that, nothing can save humanity from the destruction of the
third world war that is looming darker and darker every day on the
horizon.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MEHER BABA SPEAKS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENLIGHTENED MASTERS.
ONE HE CALLS “MAN BECOMING GOD,” THE OTHER HE CALLS “GOD BECOMING MAN.”
GAUTAM</p><p>BUDDHA BELONGS TO THE FIRST – SLOWLY, THROUGH MANY LIVES, HE HAS
FLOWERED INTO THE STATE OF BUDDHAHOOD. MEHER BABA ASSERTS THAT HE
BELONGS TO THE SECOND, “GOD BECOMING MAN.” I HAVE NOT REALLY UNDERSTOOD
WHAT HE MEANS. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?</p><p>The question is difficult because there is a misunderstanding on the
part of Meher Baba.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, there are two types of religions: Hinduism believes that
God comes down and becomes man. They call it avatar – the very word
avatar means descendence. Rama and Krishna, according to Hindu
mythology, are gods in disguise. God is coming from above to be a man;
that is the Hindu idea.</p><p>In India, there are other religions – Jainism, Buddhism – which have
a totally different standpoint. God does not come down because there is
no God above; God is sleeping within you. It has to be awakened. So man,
slowly slowly, becomes more and more conscious and finally becomes
God.</p><p>God is the transformed, purified consciousness of man.</p><p><br></p><p>Meher Baba must have been in difficulty – which one to choose? He
tried to console both types of people in India by making this statement
that “God happens in two ways: First he descends and becomes a man and
second, he ascends through man and blossoms, manifests himself.”</p><p>I am not, even for a single moment, in favor of consoling anybody
because all consolations are lies. And this is a consolation. The truth
is, there is no God above, so the very question of him descending does
not arise. Secondly, just for the sake of argument – if we accept the
hypothesis that God is – what could be the purpose for him, to come down
and become man? According to the same scriptures, God is omnipotent,
all-powerful; omnipresent, present everywhere; omniscient, knowing past,
present, future, all that has happened and all that is going to
happen.</p><p>God knows everything. Then what is the purpose of him descending in a
human form? Can’t he do something without becoming a man? Then his
omnipotence is not omnipotence. That creates a great suspicion about his
powers. Secondly, he has come in many reincarnations in Hinduism but
humanity is living in a madhouse. What purpose has been served?</p><p>God has not been able to change anything. The world goes on and on
into darker realms, into more miserable hells, into more meaningless
patterns of life. What have the reincarnations of God done?</p><p>Thirdly, the reincarnations of God – if seen without any prejudice –
do not look divine in any sense.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Rama and his wife Sita, and his brother Laxmana, were
sent to live beyond the boundaries of their kingdom for fourteen years.
Because the father of Rama had four wives... and the youngest and the
most beautiful wife certainly had power over the old man. She wanted her
son... but her son was the youngest; there were four sons and her son
was the youngest. But she wanted her son to be crowned and to succeed
the old, dying father. She forced her husband to send Rama, at least for
fourteen years, into the jungles.</p><p>Dasharatha, the father of Rama, must have been a very henpecked
husband, a weakling. Rama was to succeed him; preparations were being
made for his enthronement. But Dasharatha, almost dying, called Rama and
said, “This is my last wish and I hope you are able to fulfill it.”</p><p>Rama promised, not knowing what the wish was. And the wish was that
he should go outside the kingdom for fourteen years into the jungles,
into the mountains. Dasharatha was so weak in his last moments... and
Rama’s only quality was obedience, so he did not even ask why – “Why
this punishment?”</p><p><br></p><p>But because he was going – and he was just ordered; I don’t think
gods can be so docile, so obedient to things which are absolutely wrong
– his wife insisted that she would come with him. They had just got
married, they had been coming home from their marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Rama could not deny her. He tried to persuade her that life would
be difficult in the jungles: “You have lived as a princess of a very
great king, you don’t know the life<span class=s4></span>Fourteen
years will be</p><p>too long. You live in the palace and wait.”</p><p><br></p><p>But she refused. She said, “I am married to you, not to the palace.
And if you can manage to live in the forest, don’t be worried about me.
I will manage.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then the second brother, Laxmana, would not agree with Rama or
Sita that he need not come. He had also married at the same time as
Rama; he was married to Sita’s younger sister.</p><p><br></p><p>But he loved Rama so much, he said, “I cannot live without him, I am
coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the forest, as they woke up on the first day, Rama and Sita were
standing outside the cottage and they saw a golden deer. Now, even an
idiot knows deer are not made of gold. And Sita became very much
interested in the deer and she asked Rama to go and hunt the deer:
“Either living or dead, but you have to bring him to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the strangest thing is that even Rama does not say to her that
“Deer are not made of gold.” There is no mention of the fact. I cannot
see Gautam Buddha being befooled by a deer, but Rama is befooled.</p><p><br></p><p>Being an incarnation of God, the mistake he is committing – it is
perfectly good for human beings.… But even for intelligent human beings,
it is not good; and God is behaving in the worst, most unintelligent
way.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at the life of Rama and dissect it, you will not find
anything godly in it. He may be a great king, he may be an obedient son,
but these are ordinary human qualities – nothing to do with God.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a brahmin came with the dead body of his son and said, “It
has never happened that a young son has died before the death of his
father. So something very serious is involved in it, you have to find
the reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rama asked, “Do you have any idea?”</p><p><br></p><p>The brahmin said, “I know perfectly well what happened. I will tell
my story, and then you can search and find out who caused the death of
my son.” He said, “We were doing a Vedic ritual.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>And the sudras, the untouchables, the poorest in India – they are
one-fourth of the whole population. They are not allowed to read the
VEDAS, the Hindu religious scriptures. They are not even allowed</p><p>to listen. If somebody else is reading, they are not allowed to
listen. And these brahmins were doing the ritual and a young, curious
untouchable was hiding behind the bushes and listening to what was
happening and he was caught red-handed.</p><p><br></p><p>The brahmin’s argument was that a sudra had heard the VEDA, and
that’s why his son had died.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see any kind of connection between the two? – logical,
illogical, any connection? Animals are hearing, dogs are hearing, birds
are hearing, trees are hearing. But a sudra – an untouchable, a poor man
– cannot hear.</p><p><br></p><p>And the brahmin proposed that his act of hearing the VEDAS was the
cause of the death of his son – this is absolutely unrelated. Why
particularly his son? There were many brahmins in the ritual, but nobody
else’s son had died. And in fact, if there was to be any punishment, the
young sudra should have died. If it is something as Hindus think, a book
written by God, it would have looked logical that the sudra should die,
because he broke God’s law.</p><p><br></p><p>The son of the brahmin has not done anything at all. What is he being
punished for? The father has also not done anything. The punishment
should be pointing towards the sudra – if that is God’s law, then there
is no question.</p><p><br></p><p>But Rama does not say a single thing to this irrelevant, idiotic,
conclusion. On the contrary, he orders that the sudra be brought to his
court. That poor man was brought and he said “I was listening because I
wanted to hear something about God. I am also human. There is a desire
for search in me.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the reincarnated God in Rama does not listen to the poor man.
Instead of listening to his absolutely rational explanation, he orders
that: “Such things should not happen in the country again.” To prevent
it, this young man will have to suffer. Bring hot melted lead and pour
it into his ears. That will be the punishment, because he heard with
those ears the words prohibited to him.” Melted lead was poured into the
ears of the sudra and he became deaf for his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think these acts are divine?</p><p><br></p><p>I have been to many courts unnecessarily because whenever I would say
anything about Rama, somebody’s heart would start having attacks; their
religious feelings would be hurt. Their religious feelings are not hurt
by the act of Rama. Their religious feelings are hurt but in a wrong
situation; I am simply saying what is written in their scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot believe that Rama is an incarnation of God. And the same is
the case with other incarnations. Their life proves that they have
nothing to do with God.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha, or Mahavira, or Bodhidharma, or Nagarjuna – these are
evolving consciousnesses. They don’t believe there is a God. Their
experience is that you have to create a god within you, you have to
become a womb, and you have the potential to become a god. And looking
at Gautam Buddha – just the way he sits, just the way he moves, just the
way he speaks, or remains silent – gives valid evidence to anybody whose
heart is open to understand that he has moved to the highest peak of
consciousness.</p><p>In his small acts you can see that.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians are very proud of the miracles of Jesus and they are most
proud of one miracle: bringing Lazarus back to life. He had died. But
nobody bothers that Lazarus died and remained dead for four days.
Wherever he has been, in hell or in heaven, he must bring back some
report. Four days is enough time – and seeing death, seeing beyond
death, his consciousness must change. He cannot remain the same old
person.</p><p><br></p><p>But he remains the same old person, nothing changes. So what is the
miracle? And sooner or later, one day he has to die. So at the most his
death is postponed a few years, but he will live these few years in
unconsciousness, in violence, in hatred, in jealousy. And he will
accumulate more sin. And you call it a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>No, a miracle needs a more refined perspective of understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>The same situation arises in Gautam Buddha’s life; that’s why I have
taken Lazarus’ case.</p><p><br></p><p>One woman comes crying madly – her only son has died. Her husband has
died, her other three children have died and now this child was the only
hope of her life; she was living for him. Otherwise, there was nothing
for her to live for. She was asking in the village, “Do you know of any
physician who can help?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “No physician can do anything once a person is dead but
Gautam Buddha has arrived in town today. Perhaps his presence may
trigger life again, perhaps his touch.<span class=s4></span>You go
directly to</p><p>Gautam Buddha; don’t waste time.”</p><p><br></p><p>She took the corpse of her son, went to Buddha, laid down the corpse
at his feet and said, “My only son has died. You have taken my husband –
I didn’t say anything, I did not complain. You have taken my three other
children – I remained silent, I accepted it as my fate. But this is too
much.”</p><p><br></p><p>And for an Indian widow there is no life. She cannot go to
celebrations, she cannot wear colored clothes, she has to shave her
head. She has to live only in white clothes, doing all kinds of things
the whole day long that nobody in the home is ready to do. Her life is
simply the life of a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>That woman said to Gautam Buddha, “Either give life back to my son or
kill me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Don’t be worried. I will bring your son back to life,
but you have to do a small thing.” She said, “I will do anything, just
tell me.”</p><p>He said, “You go into the town, inquire at a few houses. We need a
few mustard seeds, but we need those mustard seeds from a house where
nobody has ever died.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was in such misery, in such a mess. She could not see the point.
She ran from house to house. They all said, “We are willing to give you
as many mustard seeds as you want, because our whole village produces
crops of mustard seed. We can bring bullock carts full of mustard seed
if your son can be alive again, but our mustard seeds won’t work. You
have not heard the condition well. The</p><p>condition is that nobody in the family should have died. We are
sorry... so many people in our family have died.”</p><p><br></p><p>By evening it was clear that mustard seeds from a family where nobody
had died could not be found. And slowly slowly, it became clear to the
woman that death is a natural phenomenon. It happens to everybody in
every family<span class=s4></span>“Even if my child again becomes
alive, he will have to die again. Asking</p><p>for his life is asking for another death, it is pointless. He cannot
live forever.”</p><p><br></p><p>She came back almost a different woman and she told Buddha, “I could
not find the mustard seeds. I was in such misery that I could not
understand your strategy. I could have got the idea when you told me,
because I know it is impossible to find a family where people have not
died. Your father must have died, your grandfather must have died.<span class=s4></span>it is impossible to find a family which has had no</p><p>encounter with death. But now, I come with an understanding – I don’t
want my son to be brought back to life, because he will have to die
again. I want you to bless his future journey, so that he achieves what
you have achieved.</p><p><br></p><p>“Life is not significant. Life is significant only when you have
attained the eternal light, the eternal being, the immortal continuity
from the very beginning, if there has been any beginning – to the end,
if there is going to be any end.</p><p><br></p><p>“And for me,” she said, “initiate me. Because before I die, I want to
know that my essential being is not going to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Now this seems to be reasonable. You are an intelligent
woman.” She was initiated and became one of the most important woman
disciples of Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, both cases are almost the same, but the way Gautam Buddha
transforms the whole thing.… From death, he turns the mind of the woman
towards immortal life. He has used the opportunity for a great
transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember: God is the highest evolution of your consciousness. It is
always man who becomes God. It is never God who becomes man. The idea of
one God that is prevelent in Christianity, in Judaism, in Mohammedism,
is childish.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the Eastern mystics and seers, every being is
potentially a god. And finally, when the whole garden comes to blossom,
there will be millions of gods.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of one God is fascist, dictatorial, monopolistic. The
idea of everybody being a god brings equality to existence; it is the
finest democratic foundation. All other values are secondary. This
simple fact, that everybody is a hidden god and is capable of realizing
it any moment he decides, makes the whole world godly – and gives you an
opportunity not to wait for some God or Godot, not to wait for some
savior, messiah or messenger. Because there is no God; all these
messengers are lying. They are not courageous enough to say, “This is
what I am saying.” They are using the name of God – “It is God who is
saying it.” They are simply the messengers, the vehicles.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha is not a vehicle of anybody, Mahavira is not a vehicle
of anybody. What they are saying is their own experience. That’s why
they have a great authority. You will not find that authority</p><p>in other theologians – their authority is borrowed from others.
Nobody knows if those people had any experience or if they were also
borrowing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Meher Baba is trying to console this country’s mind, so he accepts
both possibilities: either man can rise and become God, or God can come
down and become man. But he is not aware of a simple fact: that man
rising towards God has an evolutionary purpose, there is some
meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>God descending and becoming a man – that is a fall! Why should this
be done? And whatever your God wants to do, he can do without becoming a
man. He could create the whole world without becoming a man; now, what
is the need?</p><p><br></p><p>On the one hand, the religious people say, “Without God’s will, not
even a single leaf on a tree can waver.” If this is the situation, then
for all the sins and for all ugly things that go on happening – God is
responsible. If even a leaf cannot move without his support, how can a
man be murdered without his support? How can a woman be raped without
his support? And what is the purpose for him to come here? Because he
has not done anything. So many times, so many incarnations but humanity
has not grown up, it has not been enhanced by their presence.</p><p><br></p><p>So Meher Baba is simply trying so that the Hindu masses will be
satisfied with him. And in India, Jainas are very few – negligible, not
even one-percent. The number of Buddhists is negligible; just forty
years ago there was not a single Buddhist. Even in the temple of
Bodhgaya where Gautam Buddha became enlightened, the priest is a
brahmin, because there was no Buddhist even to be a priest in their
holiest place. This is their holiest place, their Kaaba; Buddhists come
from all over the world to worship there. And strangely enough, Buddha
was continuously fighting against brahminism and the priest is a
brahmin! And the priest is not only a brahmin today, he has been there
for fifteen hundred years – the same family. Because for fifteen hundred
years, Buddhism disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no problem about satisfying the Jains and the Buddhists.
This country is basically Hindu – and you must be made aware that Meher
Baba was not a Hindu, he was a Parsee. And because he was a Parsee, he
was condemned by the Parsees – just the natural law<span class=s4></span>So the Parsees were</p><p>not ready to accept him. Now who is going to accept this man?</p><p><br></p><p>Jainas and Buddhists are out of the question. They are such small
minorities, even if they accept him it is not going to make much
difference. Moreover, it is not easy for them to accept him for the
simple reason that he was proclaiming, “Up to now, God has sent only his
messengers, but I myself am God.” Only Hindus might be persuaded to
accept the idea that God has become man. Mohammedans cannot be
persuaded, because even Hazrat Mohammed is not a reincarnation but only
a messenger. Christians cannot be convinced; they have their God and
they have the only begotten son of God, Jesus Christ. Whenever God
needs, he sends his own son; that shows his concern.</p><p><br></p><p>Meher Baba was in difficulty. He had to fall on the side of the
Hindus, that was the only possibility. Parsees had renounced him and
nobody else would accept him; only Hindus could give him scope. So he
says, “There are two types. First – man becoming God; Gautam Buddha
comes in that category. And second – God becoming man.” And he says, “I
fall into the second category.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I say to you, there is no possibility of two categories.</p><p>Life knows only evolution; it never goes backwards.</p><p><br></p><p>And a god becoming a man is simply stupid. For what should God become
man? What will be the purpose? All that he wants to do he can do from
wherever he is. But he is nowhere – and that gives the chance to a few
charlatans to proclaim that they are God, reincarnations of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Meher Baba is certainly an enlightened person.</p><p><br></p><p>But every enlightened person finds himself in different situations.
Meher Baba’s situation was very unique, because in the history of
Parsees there is no such thing as enlightenment. The Parsees were very
angry when he declared that he is God himself, because to Parsees, to
Mohammedans, to Christians, this declaration that “I am God” hurts very
much.</p><p>They want their God to remain as far away as possible, so they can go
on doing whatsoever they are doing. God standing just there... and you
were going to hit your husband with the pillow... it doesn’t look right.
But he is standing there – that’s what millions of believers think, that
he is everywhere present. So remember: when you are hitting, look around
and hit some suspicious place where you think God might be, rather than
hitting a poor husband!</p><p>Meher Baba lived in a strange situation. Parsees were denying him,
Jainas and Buddhists would not accept him; Mohammedans, Christians, Jews
would deny him because he was saying he is the whole God, what to say
about the only begotten son? The only possibility was that a few Hindus
may gather around him, and that’s what happened. Finally, only a few
Hindus were around him. And as he died, his movement died too. Because
he could not manage to be a master. He remained a mystic. He tried, but
as a master, he was a failure.</p><p>As a mystic, he succeeded. As far as he is concerned, he has arrived,
but alone – no fellow travelers, no friends, no lovers. It has not been
a celebrating procession of many enlightened people, moving with him
into the universal life sources. He has moved alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I’M CONSTANTLY AMAZED AT HOW YOU USE YOUR MIND LIKE A COMPUTER – SUCH
PURE AND SIMPLE GENIUS, IN FACT, SUPER-GENIUS. LAO TZU SAID HE WAS A
MUDDLEHEAD, YET THE CLARITY OF GENIUS IS THERE ALSO. BELOVED OSHO, WHEN
A PERSON BECOMES ENLIGHTENED, IS THE MIND SO FREE OF EGO THAT ONLY
GENIUS IS LEFT? OR ARE SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENLIGHTENED MUDDLEHEADS?</p><p>Enlightenment has nothing to do with mind.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, you bypass the mind. Meditation reaches with you to
the highest peak – with all its silence, with all its flowers, with all
its beauty. As you become enlightened, your mind drops all the rubbish
it has carried for hundreds of lives; it is an autonomous happening.</p><p><br></p><p>As you become enlightened, the mind immediately drops all rubbish,
that rubbish you were clinging to because you had no idea who you are.
That rubbish had become your identity, and now you know your real
identity; you don’t need that false burden on you. It simply falls
naturally, on its own accord.</p><p>Your mind becomes a simple, immensely powerful mechanism. But it
remains now as a servant. Up to now it was the master; after
enlightenment, it is a beautiful servant. And certainly, as you say, it
is a computer.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who work with computers say that we have not yet been able
to make a computer of the size of the human brain which is capable of
containing so much information. Your brain has seven million cells, and
each cell can contain millions of bits of information. The experts say
that one percent can memorize all the books from all the libraries of
the world – this is the capacity of your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>But in jealousy, in anger, in hate, in possessiveness – who has the
time? Once you are enlightened, you can use the mind the way it is meant
to be used, as a beautiful computer. And because you are enlightened, it
is no longer clouded with sentiments and emotions; it is clean, a sky
without any clouds.</p><p><br></p><p>Its clarity is its genius. And every mind is a genius, there are no
other kinds of minds in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no possibility of an enlightened man having a muddled
head, an enlightened man having the mind of an idiot – that is
impossible. The enlightenment is such a transforming force, it changes
everything in you; particularly in the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THE SINGING OF THE INDIAN
SWAMI WHO SINGS BEFORE DISCOURSE. I FELT AS IF HE WERE PLAYING ME LIKE A
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. I FELT LIKE A BIG EAR, JUST LISTENING. MOST OTHER
MUSIC I HEAR BASICALLY AMOUNTS TO NOISE – IT’S ENTERTAINING, BUT IT
DOESN’T TOUCH ME. WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIS MUSIC AND THE MUSIC OF ALL THOSE
MUSICIANS WHO TOUCH SOMETHING INSIDE US, THAT HELPS US TO FLY?</p><p><br></p><p>Music is born out of deep experiences of meditation; it is a
dimension of meditation. By meditating, you may be able to be touched by
music, but the reverse is also true: If you are totally absorbed in
music, your heart will be touched not only by music but by meditation
too.</p><p><br></p><p>Music is sound. Meditation is soundlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>The highest music is where the sound does not destroy the soundless
moments in between. As the musician becomes more and more refined, he
can manage to create sound, and between two sounds he can give you an
experience of soundlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>That soundlessness touches the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, music has always been part of meditation. Temples have
been full of music and dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Ashok Bharti loves me. His music is just a communication of his love.
He pours himself totally into it. The same is happening with the other
sannyasin musician who is present today. They are not</p><p>just technicians, they are not singing because they are paid. They
are singing out of love, out of gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Their singing is just pure innocence. And their words are not just
words – they mean it. And because they mean it, they can touch your
heart, they can transform your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF PERVERSION IN REGARD TO SEX?</p><p><br></p><p>Sarjano, perversion means your energy is not going in the natural
way; the natural way has been blocked, suppressed, condemned. But the
energy is there and collecting, it is bound to find some outlet. That
outlet will not be natural. That outlet will be perversion.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole past of man is nothing else – from different
directions, for different excuses you have been told to cut off your
natural paths for energy and expression.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is an intelligent being. Even unintelligent animals are bound to
find some way. In the wild, no animals turn homosexual; there is no need
because there is no priest. But man is so much conditioned against a few
things – sex being the main one – that if he lives sex naturally, he
feels guilty that he is going against God, against religion. If he
prevents his natural expressions, then soon his energies start moving
into perverted forms.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, I received the information that by the end of
this century, there will be one billion people suffering from AIDS. And
this is the lowest estimate. I don’t feel the number will be so low. The
number, according to me, may be double.</p><p><br></p><p>AIDS is the ultimate expression of perverted sexual energy. And the
wonder is that you are surrounded with such dangerous things.… AIDS can
destroy the whole planet, because we don’t have any medicine and the
doctors and the scientists are openly saying that there seems to be no
possibility, at least in the near future, to find a medicine. So once
you have AIDS, your death is certain within six months to two years, and
you cannot do anything except wait.</p><p><br></p><p>A disease like AIDS has come through homosexuality. It is the
ultimate<span class=s4></span>And the perversion is</p><p>not condemned; on the contrary, in different ways it is supported
because every religion believes in brahmacharya, in celibacy. Now those
who believe in celibacy are standing in the queue – first they will be
homosexuals, lesbians and sooner or later, they will receive the
ultimate reward, the Nobel prize – AIDS.</p><p><br></p><p>Now religions are responsible for it. But this is what I say, human
insanity.…</p><p><br></p><p>In Texas, they have made a law against homosexuality. Now it is a
crime in Texas; you can get five to ten years in jail. Texas is a
backward state in America. Even I was surprised that one million
homosexuals demonstrated against the legislature and these may not be
all the homosexuals in the state of Texas. But one million homosexuals!
And they made it clear to the government that</p><p>by making homosexuality illegal, you cannot prevent it. You have made
many things illegal in the past, and what have you prevented? Has theft
disappeared? Has murder disappeared? Is rape something of the past?</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot stop it with your laws because you have never stopped
anything with your laws. You are just befooling the masses, making a law
so people feel the government is doing something. But they don’t see
that what they are doing, they have been doing for ten thousand years,
and things have gone from bad to worse.</p><p><br></p><p>When I read about it, I had two ideas: one, that to make
homosexuality a crime and not to make celibacy a crime.… Because these
homosexuals are products of your religion. Your religion condemns sex so
much... your monks, your nuns, you have put them almost in prisons. Now
these one million homosexuals in Texas will go underground. Just now,
they had their clubs, their discos, their restaurants; they were openly
homosexual. Now you have made it a crime. They will go underground. When
they were open and known, there was a possibility to check them
medically, to help them in some way. If somebody had AIDS already, he
could be isolated. Places could be made where only AIDS people would be
living, working.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, nobody is going to accept that he has AIDS – why should he go
for an examination? This is the danger. A single person can spread the
disease like wildfire because it not only transferred by sexual contact
– that is something more than ordinary sexual diseases – it can be
transferred by other means.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood transfusion... now you don’t know whose blood is being
transfused into you. And if the man whose blood is being transfused into
you has AIDS, you will have it. It can be transferred even just by
kissing because saliva carries the virus. Now for the first time, the
Siberians have been proved right because they have never kissed in their
whole history, and they always laughed when they came in contact with
Christian missionaries, watching them kissing each other. They could not
believe it. These people have come to teach religion to you and they
don’t even know hygiene. Mixing each other’s saliva, playing with each
other’s tongues – and these idiots have come to preach religion!</p><p><br></p><p>In Siberia, they have never kissed. It is a dirty habit... you just
think about it. Siberians rub noses with each other – that is pure
hygiene. And as far as love is concerned, it can be expressed in many
ways<span class=s4></span>But repression is going to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>In one monastery in Europe, half of the monastery has just declared
that they are homosexuals, so the monastery is now divided in two parts.
They are fighting amongst themselves – the homosexuals and the
non-homosexuals. I am saying non-homosexuals because I cannot say they
are celibate. It is almost impossible to be celibate unless something is
wrong with your body.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Stanley was a very healthy sperm and the whole day
he used to do push-ups while all the other sperm were just relaxing. And
they were puzzled: “What is wrong with this Stanley? The whole day,
exercises, exercises.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, one of these lazy people asked Stanley, “Please tell us what
the secret is? Why are you exercising so much? The whole day, from the
time you wake up till you go to sleep, you are exercising, doing this,
doing that. What is the purpose?”</p><p>He said, “You don’t know? You guys are fools. Only one sperm is going
to reach the woman’s egg. And next time when the release comes, I am
Stanley, the one who is going to get to the egg. That is the
purpose.”</p><p><br></p><p>And one day suddenly they started feeling very hot and they all
thought the time had come. Before they could have discussed among
themselves what to do, they were released so suddenly... but they all
saw Stanley far ahead. He was swimming so fast, they could not believe
that one could swim so fast and then suddenly, Stanley turned back,
screamed loudly, and said, “Go back, go back! It’s a blow job!”</p><p><br></p><p>Even poor sperm are laughing at humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>If man is allowed to be simply natural, his life can give him immense
joy, peace, silence, and finally the truth – but if his energies are
perverted, then he goes round and round wasting himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about an army officer who had been around the world,
posted at different places – and naturally, the monks and the soldiers
are in the same boat because you don’t allow soldiers their wives, their
girlfriends.</p><p><br></p><p>This officer, Major Benson, was in Hong Kong and got into real
trouble. He was going to prostitutes all over the world, but he was not
aware of Chinese prostitutes. They are the most dangerous. He fell into
the trap of a Chinese prostitute and seeing the situation, looking at
the naked body of the prostitute, he felt that it was better to have a
medical check-up: “This woman seems to be sick and one does not know
what kind of sickness she is carrying.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went to the American section of the city and found a doctor.
The doctor examined him and said, “Nothing can be done. You need an
immediate operation; your cock has to be removed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was shocked. He said, “My God!”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor said, “You have so many diseases that in this one life,
they cannot be cured.”</p><p><br></p><p>He came out dazed. He thought it would be better to have another
opinion, so he went to another American doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>He checked him thoroughly and said, “I’m sorry, the first doctor was
right. It is too late. Nothing can be done and if you don’t have the
operation soon, even an operation may not help; the diseases may have
spread all over your body. So don’t waste time. I can do the operation
tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will be coming tomorrow,” but he was not satisfied with
the idea that he would have to live his whole life without a cock.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, he saw a Chinese doctor’s signboard. He thought, “Perhaps a
Chinese doctor might be helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went in. The doctor looked. The other doctors had spent hours in
checking his whole body, this and that. The Chinese doctor just looked
with a magnifying glass and said, “There is no need for any
operation.”</p><p>Benson was very happy. He said, “Really? Is there any hope?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Every hope. First, you went to a Chinese woman – because
these diseases you can get only from a Chinese prostitute. The second
wrong thing you did was, you went to American doctors who are just after
money, money, money – and money means you have to do something. Even if
your cock disappears, they are not worried; they need money. An
operation means money. You don’t be worried, there is no need of any
operation.”</p><p><br></p><p>Benson was very happy. He said, “Thank you!” He gave much money to

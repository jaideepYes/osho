IT IS LIKE LIVING IN MOONLIGHT – A MYSTERIOUS QUIET JOY, SO NOURISHING AND RESTFUL, BECOMING A WOMB CONNECTED WITH YOU IN A CIRCULAR FLOW OF ENERGY. AND JUST WHEN I FELT I COULD GO ON WAITING FOREVER AND EVER – WONDERING IF I WAS BECOMING TOO MUCH OF AN INDIAN! – YOU SHOWER ON US AGAIN THE GIFT OF YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE, THE GOLDEN BRIGHT SUNSHINE SETTING ME AFLAME AGAIN.\nBELOVED, BELOVED MASTER, CAN YOU EVER BE AS HAPPY WITH US AS WE ARE WITH YOU?\nPurna, the experience has been immensely valuable.\nOn the path of mystery, all objects are nothing but excuses – because you cannot wait without an object, without it being for something.\nThe moment waiting is for something, it is desire; it is not waiting. And by its very nature, desire goes on becoming narrower.\nYou love – the beginning of love is a wider experience, because love has not become desire yet. You have not started to take your beloved for granted. The calamity of marriage has not happened yet, you are still free to move in any direction. The other is not yet binding. The other is not yet a hell because there is no relationship yet. No promises are yet given, no decisions for tomorrow are yet taken. You are entirely satisfied with the moment.\nWhen you are in love, who cares about the future, about a life beyond death? When you are in love, life is here at the very center of your love, but only before you commit the common fallacy of humanity. You love somebody but the love is not defined yet, is not reduced to law – you have not been to the marriage registrar’s office, you have not been to any priest to destroy your love and give you a guarantee.\nYou have not asked for the guarantee yet – that’s why you are free.\nYou have not asked the other person to be a certain way and only then you will love. Your love is still unconditional, you love the person as he or she is. Your love is not yet possessive.\nBut soon that moment will come, and out of this beautiful experience of expansion of consciousness you will start being afraid to lose it.\nWho knows about tomorrow?\nThe woman may turn away, the man may not recognize you.\nBasically, we are strangers. And all that we know about each other is arbitrary – the name, the address, the face, the beauty – because all these will be changing.\nYour beloved may have the most beautiful eyes and tomorrow, blindness is possible. Unless you have learned to love as the other is, the beautiful beginning, the beautiful sunrise in your consciousness, will turn soon into a dark night of the soul.\nThe same things that you used to love now create anger, now create hatred. The same things that you used to appreciate are now nothing but nagging.The reception room was beautiful, and\nbecause of the beauty of the reception room you have entered a jail.\nBut this is not the only possibility, of lovingness turning into a narrow, ugly desire to dominate, to possess, to be jealous of. If this were all, no intelligent person would have tolerated life for a single moment. For the intelligent person, suicide would have been the only way out.\nBut it is not so – because there is an alternative.\nLove can become too much concentrated on the object, the beloved. And this is the misery; then you become dependent and nobody loves dependence.\nThe alternative is that love does not become addressed to a single person or a single object, but takes a diametrically opposite dimension – not towards the object but towards one’s own subjectivity.\nOne becomes love.\nIt is not a question of loving someone, of being in love with someone. It is simply a transformation of your consciousness: love is your fragrance. It has nothing to do with anybody else in the world.\nThat’s what happened, Purna, when you were waiting and waiting for me.\nA moment is bound to come – if you are silent, joyous, trusting – when waiting can become a depth in your soul. And because you are not waiting for something or someone, you are the waiting – a silent watchfulness. And because you are not concerned with anything particular, objective, then everything that happens feels as if you were waiting for this.\nAll the flowers bloom for you and all the stars shine for you. Because you have not attached yourself to a particular flower, you have simply become an opening, a loving, a waiting consciousness.\nThis is not only true about waiting; it is true about all spiritual qualities. Either the quality can move towards an object or it can move towards one’s own being. When there is no object, the energy is bound to move inwards – energy cannot remain without movement.\nEnergy is movement.\nWhen there is nothing outside, your own life forces turn inwards to the very source of your being. And this is what I call enlightenment.\nYou cannot desire enlightenment; you can only wait.\nYou are asking me if I love you in the same way, with the same intensity, with the same totality as you love me.\nIt will be difficult for you to understand: there is a love which is not the love that you have known.\nYour love, howsoever pure, carries something of biological unconsciousness in it. You are not totally free to love anybody.\nSuddenly one day you fall in love with a person.\nIt is not your action. It is something unconscious in you – your chemistry, your biology, your physiology. They are all conspiring and giving you the idea of love.\nI cannot love you in that sense.\nMy love cannot become a bondage to you in any way.\nAnd my love is qualitatively different: I love not because you are lovable; I love because I cannot help it. And it is not a question of loving someone. Just the way I breathe in and out, and my heart beats, love radiates on its own accord.\nIt is possible that you will see that I love someone more, someone lessBecause you always think\nin terms of quantity: more or less. And your conclusion has a certain validity, too. But you are not looking at things right side up; you are looking at things upside down.\nMy love is just like the light – it is neither more for somebody nor less for somebody. But still, for the blind man it will not exist. For the one who cannot see properly, it will be dim. And for one who can see with a clarity it will have a different intensity.\nIt is the same light, but it will depend how much you can receive. If you are totally open, you can receive it all.\nAnd because it is not a quantity – it is pure quality; hence indivisible – I can give you my whole heart without having any trouble in giving my whole heart to many other people. Because it is not mathematics, such that I have given the whole heart to one person and now what am I doing? – I am finished!\nThat is not my experience.\nI have always given my whole heart, because I am lazy. Who bothers to cut one’s own heart into pieces? And then to give in a miserly way, pieces... and those pieces will be dead.\nThe heart is alive only in its totality, in its organic unity. But the trouble is in your wrong conditioning.\nI can give to the whole world, to each single individual, my whole heart – and still my whole heart remains with me to be given to any newcomer. Because newcomers are always coming!\nYou may not be able to understand many things about what the situation is when you are love. For example, when you are love, your love cannot be hot. And in this world, people want hot love. Hot dogs to eat and hot love to enjoy, and their paradise is complete!\nMy love is neither hot nor cold. It is cool.\nUnless you become very calm and cool, you will not be able to understand it. You have known only the hot love – and remember, the danger with the hot love is that sooner or later it is going to become cool. Everything hot is bound to become cool sooner or later, and the final end is that it will become cold. You cannot prevent it, it is a natural process.\nSo each hot love turns into hot hate. But you are accustomed to hot – either friendship or enmity, but it has to be hot. You are so insensitive that unless something is very hot you cannot feel it. Hence, your question.\nMy love is cool.\nTo understand it, you will have come to the same temperature.\nAnd cool love is not only love, it is much more. Because of its coolness, it is meditation, it is silence, it is serenity, it is tranquillity, it is centering. It is not a small phenomenon.\nI love you more than you can ever be loved.\nBut my love and your experience of love are so different that you will have to change gear. This is what happened while you were waiting. You waited one day, two days, three daysAnd I was\nsending messages: “Within one or two days I will be starting.” You know I am crazy, I have my own\nways of working.\nI would not have started speaking. It is because of Darshan, Bhadra and Hansa. I was not seeing people for the simple reason that I find it impossible to say no to anything. And when Hansa recited a small piece of Urdu poetry, which means “I don’t have any complaint. As it is, I am happy; I don’t have any complaint. But life without you is not life at all.”\nIt was impossible to say no.\nSo I said to them, “Inform my people that I will start speaking today. Rather than saying no to you, I can stop again!” I have my ways – and this time I will not allow Bhadra, Hansa and Darshan to see me!\nBut this is significant to understand: whether I am speaking or not speaking, whether I am seeing you or not seeing you, if you can be here feeling the invisible presence, that is more than can be expected of human beings. And that is the golden key.\nAnd in what situation you will wake up nobody knows. Everybody is asleep for different reasons and needs different situations to wake up.\nPerhaps it helped Purna greatly. She was waiting one day, the next dayNaturally when you have\nto wait too long, waiting becomes not an excitement but a settled state. She settled with waiting. She forgot even what she was waiting for. This is the moment when energy starts turning inwards. And to shower in your own energy is the greatest ecstatic experience available to man.\nBut the second part of her question... she will have to learn a little more, to experience a little more about love – object-less love; love not as a relationship but as a state of being. Then she will be surprised: it is cool, not hot. It is non-possessive, it is non-jealous, it has no conscious or unconscious desire to dominate the other.\nTrue love is not a beggar; it does not ask you to “love me.”\nTrue love shares its whole being, its whole joy, all the songs, all the flowers, all the stars. It is a celebration. And you are not obliged – true love is always obliged that you participated in the celebration, that “You allowed my love an entry into your being,” that “You trusted me so much that I am grateful.”\nI know you love me.\nBut I would like you to rise higher, because right now you are just walking on the ground, the lowest rung of the ladder. And you have the capacity to take off into the sky – sky beyond skies. You can reach to the very climax of existence and its beauty, its truth, its eternity, its deathlessness.\nWhat has happened to you, Purna, continue it in other realms, in other directions.\nIn love, drop the object.\nIn meditation, don’t meditate upon somebody or something – drop the object.\nAll over the world, whenever you tell people to meditate, they immediately ask, “On what?” because verbally, meditation is action, activity.\nOn what has one to meditate?\nMeditation begins only when there is nothing to meditate upon, when there is simply consciousness – you are aware – but you are not concentrating on anything.\nConcentration is a kind of imprisonment. And all our educational programs around the world are teaching people to concentrate.\nA man like Adolf Hitler creates concentration camps to kill people – his concentration camps are crude and primitive. All the religions have created concentration camps for you, but they are psychological. They have created a certain prison inside your mind. You cannot go out of it because wherever you go, it is always within you. You cannot run; howsoever fast you run, it is always with you.\nA Sufi story is.…\nA man was very much afraid of darkness; he had a paranoia. He was also afraid of aloneness – these two things are always found together. The man who is afraid of darkness will necessarily be afraid of aloneness, and vice-versa. Because darkness gives you a feeling of aloneness in a vast universe. It may be populated with nine hundred billion people, but in darkness you are alone.\nAs you start a revolution in you, transforming love from objects and pouring it into your own source, you will be absolutely mystified – coming to know that you have so much love that you can bless the whole world.\nBut your love will be more like compassion, cool, more like friendliness. Your love will be free from its biological, hormonal, chemical past. For the first time it will be beyond matter. For the first time you will not be forced by some blind forces in nature – you will decide.\nAnd when you have so much to give, and when you discover that the more you give, the more you have it, then love is no longer a relationship but a pure sharing, with no desire of gaining anything in return.\nLove has gone beyond the world of the marketplace; it is no longer business. It is for the first time pure play, leela.\nBut about the second part of your question: your love is certainly hotter. And you know, I don’t like heat! You can see... two air conditioners!\nYou will have to experience a higher and more refined, more purified energy. Only then you can understand whether I love you more or you love me more. Right now it can be said that you love me\nmore. My love is simply love – neither more nor less. I cannot figure out how to love less. I have tried! – but I am ashamed to say to you that I have failed continuously for my whole life. I have not been able to love less and neither can I love more. ‘More’ and ‘less’ are words that don’t belong to the spiritual realm. They belong to the world of matter.\nThe English word ‘matter’ is from a Sanskrit root, matra. It means “that which can be measured.” From the same root, matra comes the French word metre.\nThat which can be measured is not my love.\nThat which cannot be measured, that which cannot be more or less, that which is just for you to share.… Because this whole existence is made of the stuff called love. As you understand your reality, you have understood in miniature the reality of the whole existence – it is made of the matter called love.\nWe are living in an ocean of love, unaware.\nBut there are ways to grow and become aware of the tremendous ecstasies that are possible to you. Just loving a single person you feel so happy... just think of yourself becoming love. The whole existence becomes your beloved – the trees dancing in the wind and the sun, the clouds moving in the sky, a beautiful sunset.Once you understand that you are part, an intrinsic part of this loving\nexistence, this constantly rejoicing existence, you will drop all boundaries and all limitations on your love, on your intelligence.\nYou will be reborn – reborn as a Gautam Buddha, a fully awakened consciousness. Your experience has directed you towards a right source.\nJust follow it – with ease, with relaxedness. And much more, so much more that you cannot imagine, is going to shower on youroses and roses and roses.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE SAID RECENTLY THAT A SANNYASIN HAS NO NATIONALITY ANYMORE. DO YOU SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT AGE? SINCE I HAVE BEEN A SANNYASIN, I HAVE FELT AGELESS. I AM SIXTY-TWO AND YOUNG PEOPLE ACCEPT ME AS ONE OF THEM. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nMeditation is a transformation of your whole being. You are no more part of a crowd, no more a cog in the wheel. You have taken your responsibility on your own shoulders; you have become a free individual.\nNationality will disappear, because these are all arbitrary lines, man-made – and their existence is ugly, because their existence shows that man is not mature yet. Otherwise, what is the need to have so many nations, and every nation having great armiesPeople are dying in poverty and seventy\npercent of the national income all over the world goes to the military. Humanity is living on only thirty percent, and the army gets everything better – naturally, because they have sold their lives and they are being prepared for death, either to kill or to be killed.\nThis seems so useless. Why should there be wars? Why should there be violence? And why should nations continue after five thousand years of experience shows that they are cancerous, destructive?\nThe man of meditation is bound to be a citizen of the world.\nHe is not going to be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. Because he can contact existence himself; there is no need of any mediator, no need of any priest, holy book, church. All these religions have been creating nothing but bloodshed, burning living human beings and doing all kinds of ugly acts against innocent humanity.\nAs you become more silent, as your eyes become more clear, as the smoke that surrounds you disappears, then religions, nations, discriminations between black and white, discriminations between men and women – all are going to disappear.\nAnd it is right that you are feeling ageless. Meditation starts taking you beyond time because it is going to take you beyond death.\nYou will be surprised that in Sanskrit there is only one word for both death and time. It is kal. Kal also means tomorrow – tomorrow there is only death and nothing else; life is today.\nAs you become peaceful.… Your tensions are your weight. When the tensions are not there, you become weightless.\nAnd the consciousness which is your reality has no time-space limitation. Your body grows from childhood to youth to old age to death – these changes are happening only to the body. These are the changes of the furniture in the house... painting the house, changing its architecture. But the man who lives in the house – the master of the house – is unaffected by all these things.\nConsciousness is the master. Your body is only the house.\nSo the moment you enter meditation you have touched within yourself something of the universal – which has no age, which has no limitation either of time or space.\nThis is not only happening to you. I receive many letters from older sannyasins saying that they are feeling so young, and they don’t see any generation gap. They mix with sannyasins and not for a moment does the idea come that they are eighty years old and these are twenty year-old kids. But they communicate and nobody thinks that it is a little strange.\nOne woman sannyasin from Scotland wrote to me, “Now, Osho it is going too far!” She is seventy- eight, and now she is running after butterflies! And the whole village thinks she has gone mad because she is continuously laughing and enjoying and the village cannot believe it. Because they\nhave seen her, always miserable... they cannot believe what has happened to her. She is behaving like a small child.\nShe asked me, “What to do? Should I try to behave in the old way?”\nI said, “You can try, but you cannot succeed. So don’t waste your time, just go after the butterflies. And why bother about the idiots of the village? You enjoy yourself.”\nMeditation is not something mental.\nMeditation is something concerned with your being.\nJust plugging into it a little... and suddenly everything is different. The body will go in its own way, but you will know that you are not the body. People will die, but you will know that death is impossible. Your own death will come – but meditation prepares you for death so that you can go dancing and singing into the ultimate silence, leaving the form behind and disappearing into the formless.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nMANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE DRUG ECSTASY. I HEARD YOU SAY ONCE THAT A LIE IS SWEET IN THE BEGINNING AND BITTER IN THE END. AND TRUTH IS BITTER IN THE BEGINNING AND SWEET IN THE END. I HAVE BEEN MEDITATING, BUT I DON’T HAVE THE EXPERIENCES PEOPLE REPORT FROM THE DRUG ECSTASY. IS THE DRUG LIKE THE LIE AND MEDITATION, THE TRUTH? – OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY HELP ME?\nEcstasy can create a chemical change for the time being. It can make you feel a great well-being, more intensity in life, more color in the world. But this is only going to last for few hours and then you will again be back with a thump on the ground, and now life will look even more miserable, because now you have something to compare it with.\nDrugs like Ecstasy cannot reach your consciousness. They can only reach your mind. They have nothing parallel to meditation.\nMeditation reaches your consciousness. It is a state of no-mind. And drugs like Ecstasy reach only to the mind, and give you a euphoria, beautiful dreams, fantasies which appear to be real. So when people tell you that they have experienced so many beautiful things, you feel sad. You have been meditating and you have not felt anything and these people are feeling things through an ordinary, chemical drug.\nTheir experiences will not happen to you.\nThe path of the drug and the path of meditation are totally different.\nOn the path of meditation, you will experience silence; you will experience a joy without any reason; you will experience immense light, a luminosity arising from your very center – as if you have become\na star. But these things only happen in the beginning part of meditation. As meditation grows, all experiences start going.\nThe ultimate in meditation is a state of no experience.\nJust pure nothingness – because that is the source of existence and that is the place where existence goes again and again to renew itself.\nNow we have on experimental grounds the conclusion that has been reached in the East by many mystics, that just as everything in existence moves in a circle – stars, sun, the moon, the earth, everything moves in a circle – everything that is born, dies. Earths are born and then they die. Of course, they have a long life. This earth has been here for four million years. But this is not a long life; it is still a child. Four million years means nothing because the sun is almost ten million years old and our sun is not very old; it is one of the youngest in the universe.\nThere are suns which are so old and so far away that when I came to know about it, it was really shocking. There are suns so far away that they will never know that the earth existed – for the simple reason that when the earth was born four million years ago, the rays that started moving towards the earth from those faraway suns have not yet reached. The distance is so great. By the time they reach, the earth will be finished.\nSo if somebody from that star were trying to find about the earth, he would miss it completely because it would be lost between two rays. If he were taking a photograph, no image would appear on his film – just emptiness.\nIn this vast universe, the Eastern mystics have come to realize that even the whole universe goes into death once in a while. Planets die, suns die, stars die – every day new stars are born, new planets are born. Whole solar systems have disappeared, not leaving even a trace behind, and new solar systems have appeared. They say, and I agree with them, that the whole universe dies. Then there is darkness; everything has gone to sleep. And again there will be dawn; again planets will be born, stars will be born – a new cycle of creation. Millions of cycles of creation have happened and they will go on happening.\nYour consciousness belongs to the eternal which never dies. At the most, it goes into sleep when the whole universe dies, and comes back in the morning awake, fresh – a new world is beginning.\nJust remember one thing: that for all the secrets of life, meditation is the only key. So go deeper into meditation and don’t be bothered about experiences. Just look at those people who are taking Ecstasy. I don’t think it is a dangerous drug, but look at those people. Do you see the light of the eyes of Gautam Buddha? Do you see in their gestures the grace of a Krishna? Do you see something in their life that has changed because of their experiences?\nNothing has changed. They have become more sad, more miserable. Now the only hankering is to get the drug – they can remain hungry, but the drug is needed. They are deceiving themselves.\nThe only criterion for a right method is that it should transform your life. You will become more peaceful, more loving, more intelligent, more aware. Your life should show it – only then is what you\nare doing right. If by taking a drug you enjoy dreams, I will not say don’t enjoy dreams because I am always for totality – enjoy totally! But you don’t know anything about meditation. At least, don’t disturb the meditators. You are disturbed.Soon you will get fed up. Those same scenes which\nwere psychedelic in the beginning will start becoming ordinary. And what are you going to gain?\nYour ignorance remains the same, your cruelty remains the same, your anger, your violence, your jealousies remain the same.\nMeditation is a science of transforming the qualities of life. It is not just to give you a little consolation or a little entertainment. It is to transform you so that you can become part of the universal circus. It is so hilarious; you just have to be clear enough to see it. Just watch any man and you will be surprised: the world is full of hilarious people, but nobody is taking note. Otherwise you need not go and waste your money – just sit by the side of the road and watch the show.\nDon’t be bothered by any experiences that people who are taking drugs will tell you about. Meditation is not concerned with experiences but with the experiencer. Experiences are outside things. Meditation is concerned with you, not what happens to you, not what you seeA beautiful rose –\ncertainly under the influence of a drug it will look more beautiful, more radiant but still, what is the use? You remain the same person. Your heart does not open its petals, you are as dead as before. Except for meditation there is no way. Drugs can give you hallucinations, illusory experiences.…\nI am not in any way against anything. My whole approach is to use everything in such a way that it can become a nourishment to life, an evolution to consciousness. I am not against drugs either. It is such a foolishness on the part of governments all over the world that alcohol is not condemned, although alcohol is more dangerous than any of the drugs.\nThis is how you can see that you are being dominated by fools. Alcohol is allowed, and drugs.… Many of them are harmless, but thousands of people and particularly young men and women are in jails because they were taking drugs that the governments decided should not be taken.\nIt is strange that the government does not ask the medical colleges to investigate whether they are harmful or not, and if some drug is harmful, but gives a beautiful experience – illusory, hallucinatory, but at least something in this world which is just like a desert... If some drug has some harmful effects, medical science is advanced enough to remove those harmful effects. Drugs can be purified to such an extent that anybody can take them and have the experience. Because no government has the right to prevent anybody from having any experience. He is not harming anybody.…\nThe function of the government should be to take care of people. There are so many medical colleges around the world – do research, find something which gives beautiful experiences to people, nourishment to the body, health to the mind. And you will be surprised at why I am saying this. I am saying this because if good, harmless drugs are made available and people are allowed to take them, these people are soon going to be fed up with the drugs and their experiences.\nSooner or later they are going to move towards meditation – there is no other way.\nWe will have used the drugs. Without harming the person we will have managed it so that the drug has given him some experience and now he wants something more which the drug cannot give.\nAnd in fact, as you take a drug every day its impact goes on declining. Every day you have to add more quantity. But finally, every drug becomes useless, your body becomes immune to it.\nI have been with people who have taken all sorts of drugs but they are not drug-addicted people; they are following an ancient path which has used drugs. And then the moment comes when drugs don’t affect them at all. You can give them as much quantity as possible, and nothing happens to them.\nIn their monasteries they have dangerous serpents, particularly cobras. If you are bitten by a cobra you are finished. And these people allow the cobra to bite on their tongues! In the beginning they have psychedelic experiences, and now the cobra poison cannot kill them... they are full of poison.\nThe strangest thing is that the cobra dies because the poor cobra has never come across such a man – so full of poisons! The cobra has a small gland in his mouth, that is all – the rest of his body is without any poison. In China, the cobra is a delicacy – just cut the head and you have a beautiful vegetable.\nThe people I was talking about soon get immune to cobra poison too, and that is their test. Then their master allows them initiation. Now nothing can create hallucination in them.\nSo drugs have been used in the East for centuries as a help to meditation. Now they have destroyed all possibility in the man that any poison, any drug can create illusion. His consciousness is far stronger now. No poison can kill him, no poison can make him even unconscious – he remains alert and conscious.\nAs far as I am concerned these people were doing the right thing and it will be good if rather than behaving fascistically, we allow our people to have the experience if they want – but give it in such a way that soon it can indicate to them the path leading towards some meditation.\nI am not against drugs. I am not against anything, because everything can be used in the right way and everything can be used in a wrong way. Poison can be medicine and medicine can be poison, it all depends.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5577","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/sermons_in_stones/>Sermons in Stones</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 In love, drop the object</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5577 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Sermons_in_Stones/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WAITING ANYMORE FOR SOMETHING – IT SIMPLY BECAME JUST WAITING.
DISCOVERING THE BEAUTY AND SWEETNESS OF IT WAS SO PRECIOUS. WAITING
NEEDS NO PATIENCE. IT IS LIKE LIVING IN MOONLIGHT – A MYSTERIOUS QUIET
JOY, SO NOURISHING AND RESTFUL, BECOMING A WOMB CONNECTED WITH YOU IN A
CIRCULAR FLOW OF ENERGY. AND JUST WHEN I FELT I COULD GO ON WAITING
FOREVER AND EVER – WONDERING IF I WAS BECOMING TOO MUCH OF AN INDIAN! –
YOU SHOWER ON US AGAIN THE GIFT OF YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE, THE GOLDEN
BRIGHT SUNSHINE SETTING ME AFLAME AGAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED, BELOVED MASTER, CAN YOU EVER BE AS HAPPY WITH US AS WE ARE
WITH YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>Purna, the experience has been immensely valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of mystery, all objects are nothing but excuses – because
you cannot wait without an object, without it being for something.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment waiting is for something, it is desire; it is not waiting.
And by its very nature, desire goes on becoming narrower.</p><p>You love – the beginning of love is a wider experience, because love
has not become desire yet. You have not started to take your beloved for
granted. The calamity of marriage has not happened yet, you are still
free to move in any direction. The other is not yet binding. The other
is not yet a hell because there is no relationship yet. No promises are
yet given, no decisions for tomorrow are yet taken. You are entirely
satisfied with the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are in love, who cares about the future, about a life beyond
death? When you are in love, life is here at the very center of your
love, but only before you commit the common fallacy of humanity. You
love somebody but the love is not defined yet, is not reduced to law –
you have not been to the marriage registrar’s office, you have not been
to any priest to destroy your love and give you a guarantee.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not asked for the guarantee yet – that’s why you are
free.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not asked the other person to be a certain way and only then
you will love. Your love is still unconditional, you love the person as
he or she is. Your love is not yet possessive.</p><p><br></p><p>But soon that moment will come, and out of this beautiful experience
of expansion of consciousness you will start being afraid to lose
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Who knows about tomorrow?</p><p><br></p><p>The woman may turn away, the man may not recognize you.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, we are strangers. And all that we know about each other is
arbitrary – the name, the address, the face, the beauty – because all
these will be changing.</p><p><br></p><p>Your beloved may have the most beautiful eyes and tomorrow, blindness
is possible. Unless you have learned to love as the other is, the
beautiful beginning, the beautiful sunrise in your consciousness, will
turn soon into a dark night of the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>The same things that you used to love now create anger, now create
hatred. The same things that you used to appreciate are now nothing but
nagging.<span class=s4></span>The reception room was beautiful,
and</p><p>because of the beauty of the reception room you have entered a
jail.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not the only possibility, of lovingness turning into a
narrow, ugly desire to dominate, to possess, to be jealous of. If this
were all, no intelligent person would have tolerated life for a single
moment. For the intelligent person, suicide would have been the only way
out.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not so – because there is an alternative.</p><p><br></p><p>Love can become too much concentrated on the object, the beloved. And
this is the misery; then you become dependent and nobody loves
dependence.</p><p><br></p><p>The alternative is that love does not become addressed to a single
person or a single object, but takes a diametrically opposite dimension
– not towards the object but towards one’s own subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>One becomes love.</p><p>It is not a question of loving someone, of being in love with
someone. It is simply a transformation of your consciousness: love is
your fragrance. It has nothing to do with anybody else in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happened, Purna, when you were waiting and waiting for
me.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment is bound to come – if you are silent, joyous, trusting –
when waiting can become a depth in your soul. And because you are not
waiting for something or someone, you are the waiting – a silent
watchfulness. And because you are not concerned with anything
particular, objective, then everything that happens feels as if you were
waiting for this.</p><p><br></p><p>All the flowers bloom for you and all the stars shine for you.
Because you have not attached yourself to a particular flower, you have
simply become an opening, a loving, a waiting consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not only true about waiting; it is true about all spiritual
qualities. Either the quality can move towards an object or it can move
towards one’s own being. When there is no object, the energy is bound to
move inwards – energy cannot remain without movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Energy is movement.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is nothing outside, your own life forces turn inwards to
the very source of your being. And this is what I call
enlightenment.</p><p>You cannot desire enlightenment; you can only wait.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me if I love you in the same way, with the same
intensity, with the same totality as you love me.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be difficult for you to understand: there is a love which is
not the love that you have known.</p><p><br></p><p>Your love, howsoever pure, carries something of biological
unconsciousness in it. You are not totally free to love anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly one day you fall in love with a person.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not your action. It is something unconscious in you – your
chemistry, your biology, your physiology. They are all conspiring and
giving you the idea of love.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot love you in that sense.</p><p><br></p><p>My love cannot become a bondage to you in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>And my love is qualitatively different: I love not because you are
lovable; I love because I cannot help it. And it is not a question of
loving someone. Just the way I breathe in and out, and my heart beats,
love radiates on its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that you will see that I love someone more, someone
less<span class=s4></span>Because you always think</p><p>in terms of quantity: more or less. And your conclusion has a certain
validity, too. But you are not looking at things right side up; you are
looking at things upside down.</p><p>My love is just like the light – it is neither more for somebody nor
less for somebody. But still, for the blind man it will not exist. For
the one who cannot see properly, it will be dim. And for one who can see
with a clarity it will have a different intensity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same light, but it will depend how much you can receive. If
you are totally open, you can receive it all.</p><p>And because it is not a quantity – it is pure quality; hence
indivisible – I can give you my whole heart without having any trouble
in giving my whole heart to many other people. Because it is not
mathematics, such that I have given the whole heart to one person and
now what am I doing? – I am finished!</p><p><br></p><p>That is not my experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always given my whole heart, because I am lazy. Who bothers to
cut one’s own heart into pieces? And then to give in a miserly way,
pieces... and those pieces will be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is alive only in its totality, in its organic unity. But
the trouble is in your wrong conditioning.</p><p>I can give to the whole world, to each single individual, my whole
heart – and still my whole heart remains with me to be given to any
newcomer. Because newcomers are always coming!</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be able to understand many things about what the
situation is when you are love. For example, when you are love, your
love cannot be hot. And in this world, people want hot love. Hot dogs to
eat and hot love to enjoy, and their paradise is complete!</p><p><br></p><p>My love is neither hot nor cold. It is cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you become very calm and cool, you will not be able to
understand it. You have known only the hot love – and remember, the
danger with the hot love is that sooner or later it is going to become
cool. Everything hot is bound to become cool sooner or later, and the
final end is that it will become cold. You cannot prevent it, it is a
natural process.</p><p><br></p><p>So each hot love turns into hot hate. But you are accustomed to hot –
either friendship or enmity, but it has to be hot. You are so
insensitive that unless something is very hot you cannot feel it. Hence,
your question.</p><p><br></p><p>My love is cool.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand it, you will have come to the same temperature.</p><p><br></p><p>And cool love is not only love, it is much more. Because of its
coolness, it is meditation, it is silence, it is serenity, it is
tranquillity, it is centering. It is not a small phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>I love you more than you can ever be loved.</p><p>But my love and your experience of love are so different that you
will have to change gear. This is what happened while you were waiting.
You waited one day, two days, three days<span class=s4></span>And I
was</p><p>sending messages: “Within one or two days I will be starting.<span class=s4></span>” You know I am crazy, I have my own</p><p>ways of working.</p><p><br></p><p>I would not have started speaking. It is because of Darshan, Bhadra
and Hansa. I was not seeing people for the simple reason that I find it
impossible to say no to anything. And when Hansa recited a small piece
of Urdu poetry, which means “I don’t have any complaint. As it is, I am
happy; I don’t have any complaint. But life without you is not life at
all.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>It was impossible to say no.</p><p><br></p><p>So I said to them, “Inform my people that I will start speaking
today. Rather than saying no to you, I can stop again!” I have my ways –
and this time I will not allow Bhadra, Hansa and Darshan to see me!</p><p><br></p><p>But this is significant to understand: whether I am speaking or not
speaking, whether I am seeing you or not seeing you, if you can be here
feeling the invisible presence, that is more than can be expected of
human beings. And that is the golden key.</p><p><br></p><p>And in what situation you will wake up nobody knows. Everybody is
asleep for different reasons and needs different situations to wake
up.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it helped Purna greatly. She was waiting one day, the next
day<span class=s4></span>Naturally when you have</p><p>to wait too long, waiting becomes not an excitement but a settled
state. She settled with waiting. She forgot even what she was waiting
for. This is the moment when energy starts turning inwards. And to
shower in your own energy is the greatest ecstatic experience available
to man.</p><p><br></p><p>But the second part of her question... she will have to learn a
little more, to experience a little more about love – object-less love;
love not as a relationship but as a state of being. Then she will be
surprised: it is cool, not hot. It is non-possessive, it is non-jealous,
it has no conscious or unconscious desire to dominate the other.</p><p><br></p><p>True love is not a beggar; it does not ask you to “love me.”</p><p><br></p><p>True love shares its whole being, its whole joy, all the songs, all
the flowers, all the stars. It is a celebration. And you are not obliged
– true love is always obliged that you participated in the celebration,
that “You allowed my love an entry into your being,” that “You trusted
me so much that I am grateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>I know you love me.</p><p><br></p><p>But I would like you to rise higher, because right now you are just
walking on the ground, the lowest rung of the ladder. And you have the
capacity to take off into the sky – sky beyond skies. You can reach to
the very climax of existence and its beauty, its truth, its eternity,
its deathlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>What has happened to you, Purna, continue it in other realms, in
other directions.</p><p>In love, drop the object.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, don’t meditate upon somebody or something – drop the
object.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world, whenever you tell people to meditate, they
immediately ask, “On what?” because verbally, meditation is action,
activity.</p><p><br></p><p>On what has one to meditate?</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation begins only when there is nothing to meditate upon, when
there is simply consciousness – you are aware – but you are not
concentrating on anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Concentration is a kind of imprisonment. And all our educational
programs around the world are teaching people to concentrate.</p><p><br></p><p>A man like Adolf Hitler creates concentration camps to kill people –
his concentration camps are crude and primitive. All the religions have
created concentration camps for you, but they are psychological. They
have created a certain prison inside your mind. You cannot go out of it
because wherever you go, it is always within you. You cannot run;
howsoever fast you run, it is always with you.</p><p><br></p><p>A Sufi story is.…</p><p><br></p><p>A man was very much afraid of darkness; he had a paranoia. He was
also afraid of aloneness – these two things are always found together.
The man who is afraid of darkness will necessarily be afraid of
aloneness, and vice-versa. Because darkness gives you a feeling of
aloneness in a vast universe. It may be populated with nine hundred
billion people, but in darkness you are alone.</p><p><br></p><p>As you start a revolution in you, transforming love from objects and
pouring it into your own source, you will be absolutely mystified –
coming to know that you have so much love that you can bless the whole
world.</p><p><br></p><p>But your love will be more like compassion, cool, more like
friendliness. Your love will be free from its biological, hormonal,
chemical past. For the first time it will be beyond matter. For the
first time you will not be forced by some blind forces in nature – you
will decide.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you have so much to give, and when you discover that the
more you give, the more you have it, then love is no longer a
relationship but a pure sharing, with no desire of gaining anything in
return.</p><p><br></p><p>Love has gone beyond the world of the marketplace; it is no longer
business. It is for the first time pure play, leela.</p><p><br></p><p>But about the second part of your question: your love is certainly
hotter. And you know, I don’t like heat! You can see... two air
conditioners!</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to experience a higher and more refined, more purified
energy. Only then you can understand whether I love you more or you love
me more. Right now it can be said that you love me</p><p>more. My love is simply love – neither more nor less. I cannot figure
out how to love less. I have tried! – but I am ashamed to say to you
that I have failed continuously for my whole life. I have not been able
to love less and neither can I love more. ‘More’ and ‘less’ are words
that don’t belong to the spiritual realm. They belong to the world of
matter.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘matter’ is from a Sanskrit root, matra. It means
“that which can be measured.” From the same root, matra comes the French
word metre.</p><p><br></p><p>That which can be measured is not my love.</p><p><br></p><p>That which cannot be measured, that which cannot be more or less,
that which is just for you to share.… Because this whole existence is
made of the stuff called love. As you understand your reality, you have
understood in miniature the reality of the whole existence – it is made
of the matter called love.</p><p><br></p><p>We are living in an ocean of love, unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are ways to grow and become aware of the tremendous
ecstasies that are possible to you. Just loving a single person you feel
so happy... just think of yourself becoming love. The whole existence
becomes your beloved – the trees dancing in the wind and the sun, the
clouds moving in the sky, a beautiful sunset.<span class=s4></span>Once you understand that you are part, an intrinsic
part of this loving</p><p>existence, this constantly rejoicing existence, you will drop all
boundaries and all limitations on your love, on your intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be reborn – reborn as a Gautam Buddha, a fully awakened
consciousness. Your experience has directed you towards a right
source.</p><p>Just follow it – with ease, with relaxedness. And much more, so much
more that you cannot imagine, is going to shower on you<span class=s4></span>roses and roses and roses.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU HAVE SAID RECENTLY THAT A SANNYASIN HAS NO NATIONALITY ANYMORE.
DO YOU SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT AGE? SINCE I HAVE BEEN A SANNYASIN, I
HAVE FELT AGELESS. I AM SIXTY-TWO AND YOUNG PEOPLE ACCEPT ME AS ONE OF
THEM. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a transformation of your whole being. You are no more
part of a crowd, no more a cog in the wheel. You have taken your
responsibility on your own shoulders; you have become a free
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Nationality will disappear, because these are all arbitrary lines,
man-made – and their existence is ugly, because their existence shows
that man is not mature yet. Otherwise, what is the need to have so many
nations, and every nation having great armies<span class=s4></span>People are dying in poverty and seventy</p><p>percent of the national income all over the world goes to the
military. Humanity is living on only thirty percent, and the army gets
everything better – naturally, because they have sold their lives and
they are being prepared for death, either to kill or to be killed.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems so useless. Why should there be wars? Why should there be
violence? And why should nations continue after five thousand years of
experience shows that they are cancerous, destructive?</p><p><br></p><p>The man of meditation is bound to be a citizen of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not going to be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. Because
he can contact existence himself; there is no need of any mediator, no
need of any priest, holy book, church. All these religions have been
creating nothing but bloodshed, burning living human beings and doing
all kinds of ugly acts against innocent humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>As you become more silent, as your eyes become more clear, as the
smoke that surrounds you disappears, then religions, nations,
discriminations between black and white, discriminations between men and
women – all are going to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is right that you are feeling ageless. Meditation starts
taking you beyond time because it is going to take you beyond death.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that in Sanskrit there is only one word for
both death and time. It is kal. Kal also means tomorrow – tomorrow there
is only death and nothing else; life is today.</p><p><br></p><p>As you become peaceful.… Your tensions are your weight. When the
tensions are not there, you become weightless.</p><p><br></p><p>And the consciousness which is your reality has no time-space
limitation. Your body grows from childhood to youth to old age to death
– these changes are happening only to the body. These are the changes of
the furniture in the house... painting the house, changing its
architecture. But the man who lives in the house – the master of the
house – is unaffected by all these things.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciousness is the master. Your body is only the house.</p><p>So the moment you enter meditation you have touched within yourself
something of the universal – which has no age, which has no limitation
either of time or space.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not only happening to you. I receive many letters from older
sannyasins saying that they are feeling so young, and they don’t see any
generation gap. They mix with sannyasins and not for a moment does the
idea come that they are eighty years old and these are twenty year-old
kids. But they communicate and nobody thinks that it is a little
strange.</p><p><br></p><p>One woman sannyasin from Scotland wrote to me, “Now, Osho it is going
too far!” She is seventy- eight, and now she is running after
butterflies! And the whole village thinks she has gone mad because she
is continuously laughing and enjoying and the village cannot believe it.
Because they</p><p>have seen her, always miserable... they cannot believe what has
happened to her. She is behaving like a small child.</p><p><br></p><p>She asked me, “What to do? Should I try to behave in the old
way?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can try, but you cannot succeed. So don’t waste your
time, just go after the butterflies. And why bother about the idiots of
the village? You enjoy yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is not something mental.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is something concerned with your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Just plugging into it a little... and suddenly everything is
different. The body will go in its own way, but you will know that you
are not the body. People will die, but you will know that death is
impossible. Your own death will come – but meditation prepares you for
death so that you can go dancing and singing into the ultimate silence,
leaving the form behind and disappearing into the formless.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE DRUG ECSTASY. I HEARD YOU SAY
ONCE THAT A LIE IS SWEET IN THE BEGINNING AND BITTER IN THE END. AND
TRUTH IS BITTER IN THE BEGINNING AND SWEET IN THE END. I HAVE BEEN
MEDITATING, BUT I DON’T HAVE THE EXPERIENCES PEOPLE REPORT FROM THE DRUG
ECSTASY. IS THE DRUG LIKE THE LIE AND MEDITATION, THE TRUTH? – OR AM I
MISSING SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY HELP ME?</p><p><br></p><p>Ecstasy can create a chemical change for the time being. It can make
you feel a great well-being, more intensity in life, more color in the
world. But this is only going to last for few hours and then you will
again be back with a thump on the ground, and now life will look even
more miserable, because now you have something to compare it with.</p><p><br></p><p>Drugs like Ecstasy cannot reach your consciousness. They can only
reach your mind. They have nothing parallel to meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation reaches your consciousness. It is a state of no-mind. And
drugs like Ecstasy reach only to the mind, and give you a euphoria,
beautiful dreams, fantasies which appear to be real. So when people tell
you that they have experienced so many beautiful things, you feel sad.
You have been meditating and you have not felt anything and these people
are feeling things through an ordinary, chemical drug.</p><p><br></p><p>Their experiences will not happen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The path of the drug and the path of meditation are totally
different.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of meditation, you will experience silence; you will
experience a joy without any reason; you will experience immense light,
a luminosity arising from your very center – as if you have become</p><p>a star. But these things only happen in the beginning part of
meditation. As meditation grows, all experiences start going.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate in meditation is a state of no experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Just pure nothingness – because that is the source of existence and
that is the place where existence goes again and again to renew
itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we have on experimental grounds the conclusion that has been
reached in the East by many mystics, that just as everything in
existence moves in a circle – stars, sun, the moon, the earth,
everything moves in a circle – everything that is born, dies. Earths are
born and then they die. Of course, they have a long life. This earth has
been here for four million years. But this is not a long life; it is
still a child. Four million years means nothing because the sun is
almost ten million years old and our sun is not very old; it is one of
the youngest in the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>There are suns which are so old and so far away that when I came to
know about it, it was really shocking. There are suns so far away that
they will never know that the earth existed – for the simple reason that
when the earth was born four million years ago, the rays that started
moving towards the earth from those faraway suns have not yet reached.
The distance is so great. By the time they reach, the earth will be
finished.</p><p><br></p><p>So if somebody from that star were trying to find about the earth, he
would miss it completely because it would be lost between two rays. If
he were taking a photograph, no image would appear on his film – just
emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>In this vast universe, the Eastern mystics have come to realize that
even the whole universe goes into death once in a while. Planets die,
suns die, stars die – every day new stars are born, new planets are
born. Whole solar systems have disappeared, not leaving even a trace
behind, and new solar systems have appeared. They say, and I agree with
them, that the whole universe dies. Then there is darkness; everything
has gone to sleep. And again there will be dawn; again planets will be
born, stars will be born – a new cycle of creation. Millions of cycles
of creation have happened and they will go on happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Your consciousness belongs to the eternal which never dies. At the
most, it goes into sleep when the whole universe dies, and comes back in
the morning awake, fresh – a new world is beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remember one thing: that for all the secrets of life, meditation
is the only key. So go deeper into meditation and don’t be bothered
about experiences. Just look at those people who are taking Ecstasy. I
don’t think it is a dangerous drug, but look at those people. Do you see
the light of the eyes of Gautam Buddha? Do you see in their gestures the
grace of a Krishna? Do you see something in their life that has changed
because of their experiences?</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing has changed. They have become more sad, more miserable. Now
the only hankering is to get the drug – they can remain hungry, but the
drug is needed. They are deceiving themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The only criterion for a right method is that it should transform
your life. You will become more peaceful, more loving, more intelligent,
more aware. Your life should show it – only then is what you</p><p>are doing right. If by taking a drug you enjoy dreams, I will not say
don’t enjoy dreams because I am always for totality – enjoy totally! But
you don’t know anything about meditation. At least, don’t disturb the
meditators. You are disturbed.<span class=s4></span>Soon you will get
fed up. Those same scenes which</p><p>were psychedelic in the beginning will start becoming ordinary. And
what are you going to gain?</p><p><br></p><p>Your ignorance remains the same, your cruelty remains the same, your
anger, your violence, your jealousies remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a science of transforming the qualities of life. It is
not just to give you a little consolation or a little entertainment. It
is to transform you so that you can become part of the universal circus.
It is so hilarious; you just have to be clear enough to see it. Just
watch any man and you will be surprised: the world is full of hilarious
people, but nobody is taking note. Otherwise you need not go and waste
your money – just sit by the side of the road and watch the show.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be bothered by any experiences that people who are taking drugs
will tell you about. Meditation is not concerned with experiences but
with the experiencer. Experiences are outside things. Meditation is
concerned with you, not what happens to you, not what you see<span class=s4></span>A beautiful rose –</p><p>certainly under the influence of a drug it will look more beautiful,
more radiant but still, what is the use? You remain the same person.
Your heart does not open its petals, you are as dead as before. Except
for meditation there is no way. Drugs can give you hallucinations,
illusory experiences.…</p><p><br></p><p>I am not in any way against anything. My whole approach is to use
everything in such a way that it can become a nourishment to life, an
evolution to consciousness. I am not against drugs either. It is such a
foolishness on the part of governments all over the world that alcohol
is not condemned, although alcohol is more dangerous than any of the
drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how you can see that you are being dominated by fools.
Alcohol is allowed, and drugs.… Many of them are harmless, but thousands
of people and particularly young men and women are in jails because they
were taking drugs that the governments decided should not be taken.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that the government does not ask the medical colleges
to investigate whether they are harmful or not, and if some drug is
harmful, but gives a beautiful experience – illusory, hallucinatory, but
at least something in this world which is just like a desert... If some
drug has some harmful effects, medical science is advanced enough to
remove those harmful effects. Drugs can be purified to such an extent
that anybody can take them and have the experience. Because no
government has the right to prevent anybody from having any experience.
He is not harming anybody.…</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the government should be to take care of people.
There are so many medical colleges around the world – do research, find
something which gives beautiful experiences to people, nourishment to
the body, health to the mind. And you will be surprised at why I am
saying this. I am saying this because if good, harmless drugs are made
available and people are allowed to take them, these people are soon
going to be fed up with the drugs and their experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later they are going to move towards meditation – there is
no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>We will have used the drugs. Without harming the person we will have
managed it so that the drug has given him some experience and now he
wants something more which the drug cannot give.</p><p>And in fact, as you take a drug every day its impact goes on
declining. Every day you have to add more quantity. But finally, every
drug becomes useless, your body becomes immune to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been with people who have taken all sorts of drugs but they
are not drug-addicted people; they are following an ancient path which
has used drugs. And then the moment comes when drugs don’t affect them
at all. You can give them as much quantity as possible, and nothing
happens to them.</p><p><br></p><p>In their monasteries they have dangerous serpents, particularly
cobras. If you are bitten by a cobra you are finished. And these people
allow the cobra to bite on their tongues! In the beginning they have
psychedelic experiences, and now the cobra poison cannot kill them...
they are full of poison.</p><p><br></p><p>The strangest thing is that the cobra dies because the poor cobra has
never come across such a man – so full of poisons! The cobra has a small
gland in his mouth, that is all – the rest of his body is without any
poison. In China, the cobra is a delicacy – just cut the head and you
have a beautiful vegetable.</p><p><br></p><p>The people I was talking about soon get immune to cobra poison too,
and that is their test. Then their master allows them initiation. Now
nothing can create hallucination in them.</p><p><br></p><p>So drugs have been used in the East for centuries as a help to
meditation. Now they have destroyed all possibility in the man that any
poison, any drug can create illusion. His consciousness is far stronger
now. No poison can kill him, no poison can make him even unconscious –
he remains alert and conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I am concerned these people were doing the right thing and
it will be good if rather than behaving fascistically, we allow our
people to have the experience if they want – but give it in such a way
that soon it can indicate to them the path leading towards some
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not against drugs. I am not against anything, because everything
can be used in the right way and everything can be used in a wrong way.
Poison can be medicine and medicine can be poison, it all depends.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

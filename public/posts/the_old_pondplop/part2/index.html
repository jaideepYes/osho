It is for reference purposes only.]\nTruth is not something that one can think about, it has to be been. It needs a different kind of seeing --\nhence the symbol of the third eye. Not that the third eye exists physiologically somewhere -- it is only a metaphor. These two eyes are not enough, these two eyes can see only the material, the visible, the measurable. A different insight into reality is needed which can see the hidden,, which can see the centre, not only the circumference.\nHence in the East we call philosophy 'darshan'. Darshan means exactly what 'satyam' means the act of seeing.\nThe philosopher thinks about truth, the mystic sees it. And one can think for millions of lives; still, it will go about and about, round and round -- it will never touch the centre. It is like a blind man thinking about light or a deaf man thinking about music, they cannot even begin -- and whatsoever they think is going to be basically false. It is impossible for them to come to a conclusion. Hence philosophy has not arrived at any conclusions at all, it only creates new problems. The old problems remain and the new are created, and all the so- called answers that philosophy gives only trigger many more questions. The\nfoliage of philosophy has become very thick but it has not solved any real problem. man remains as ignorant as ever.\nSannyas means we will be trying a different approach, not through thinking but through seeing. And meditation is the art of creating a new faculty of seeing. It helps you to become more clear, more silent, more transparent. And the deeper your transparency, your clarity, the deeper you can enter into reality -- in the same proportion. If you can touch your own centre, you become immediately capable of touching the centre of the whole universe. And that penetration brings immense freedom, immense bliss, and abundant life.\nRuth also means beauty, a vision of beauty. The person who is capable of seeing in a different way than the ordinary becomes aware of a tremendous beauty that always surrounds you; but your eyes are closed. it is showering on you, each moment, but because we are not vulnerable, we are closed, hence we become almost oblivious to the beauty of existence.\nOnce you can see, then the first experience if of truth, and the second experience is of the good, and the ultimate experience is of beauty.\nWe have two trinities in the Eastern mystic symbology. One is satyam, shivam, sunderam -- truth, good, beauty, the other is satchitananda: sat -- truth, chit -- consciousness, ananda -- bliss. But both start with the truth.\nTruth is the door and then, on the second step, you experience good, virtue, real authentic morality on the one hand and on the other hand you experience consciousness- Consciousness and goodness are two 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\naspects of the same coin. And as you go deeper or higher -- which are the same -\n- then you come across, on the one hand, beauty, on the other hand, bliss. Beauty and bliss are again two aspects of the same phenomenon.\nSo, in all, these two trinities give you five things, not six, because truth is the common ground for both.\nOnce you know the truth you become capable of knowing four ultimate values, the good, and simultaneously, consciousness, awakening, awareness, beauty, and simultaneously, bliss, joy, celebration.\nAnd if these five things can happen, then nothing more is needed, life is fulfilled, one has arrived at this source and at the goal.\nJesus says in one of his most pregnant statements, Truth brings liberation. But it is only half the truth that he is saying, the other half has to be remembered, because people have forgotten the other half completely. Truth liberates, but the truth has to be your own -- only then does it liberate. If it is somebody else's then it creates new bondages. The truth of Jesus liberates Jesus, but becomes a bondage for all Christians. The truth of Buddha brings freedom to him, but to those who are blind followers, imitators, for them it creates only beautiful chains.\nSo one has to be very alert not to borrow truth. Borrowed truth brings slavery. Truth has to be discovered, it has to be yours. Nobody else's will go. Neither roses can give it to you, nor Jesus, nor Mahavira, nor Buddha.\nNobody can give it to you, it is not a commodity which can be transferred or given hence the function of the master is not to give you the truth but only devices to discover it within yourself.\nThe moment it is discovered all chains disappear, suddenly all walls have evaporated, there is no prison at all. And a great laughter arises in one's innermost core because that moment one realises that the prison was just an idea, a dream, a nightmare.\nTruth comes like light and all nightmares and all dreams and all darknesses disappear. And to live in truth is the only way to live. All other ways are only ways to die.\nThe person who is not living his truth is simply living unnecessarily. He is a burden to himself and a burden to the earth, he is a curse to himself and a curse to others. The person who finds his truth and starts living it is a blessing to himself and a blessing to the whole universe.\nMan lives in lies because he is not conscious, and unless he becomes conscious he can only go on changing his lies. He can become a Christian from being a\nHindu or can become a Mohammedan from being a Christian or can become a Buddhist from being a Mohammedan or can become a communist from being a Buddhist, but he is simply changing his lies.\nOne gets bored with the old lies, no one wants to change them and for a few days one feels excited, because one has found new models of lies, the latest models of lies. But it is only a honeymoon, soon one finds the chains are the same. The shape may be different, the make may be different, but the slavery is the same. Whether you are in a church or in a temple or in a mosque -- it makes no difference at all. These are different prisons and people go on changing from one prison to another.\nSo it is not a question of changing your beliefs. It is a question of changing your consciousness -- that's what sannyas is all about. I don't give you anything to believe, I don't give you any consolation, I don't give you any rationalisation. I am not at all interested in replacing your old ideology with a new one, because that will be beautiful only for a few days, beautiful only because it is new, not because it is really beautiful.\nSometimes the new bondage can be more dangerous than the old, because the old bondage is bound to have many loopholes and the new bondage is going to be more technically efficient. The new bondage is bound to have fewer loopholes. From an old Indian prison you can escape very easily, but from a German concentration camp it is impossibles it is more scientific, more technically developed. It is almost impossible. I have never heard of anybody who has been able to escape from a Russian prison. It cannot happen. Even the walls have ears!\nIn Russia you cannot talk sincerely, authentically, even with your husband or wife -- you cannot open your heart. Nobody knows who is a spy. Your husband is a member of the Communist party, your wife a member of the women's section of the Communist party. Even your kids belong to the children's Communist party. One cannot even talk truly before the kids, because they will report, they are being taught to report, to spy.\nIn Russia there is no possibility of any revolution. Every precaution has been taken.\nSo sometimes the new ideology may appear good in the beginning but it is\nbound to prove far more 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndangerous in the end -- hence I am totally against giving you any belief. On the contrary, I have to take away all beliefs. I can help you to be more conscious -- and that is the only true help, this true love and the true compassion.\nIf you can become more conscious, more aware, then truth is not far away. It is within you -- a conscious person is bound to find it, it is inevitable. And the moment truth is found all is found.\nA man lives without knowing his truth, his meaning, lives in utter futility, from one failure to another failure. He dies without ever really being born. He dies in the womb, millions of people are dying in the womb -- not physically but psychologically.\nThe function of the master is to give you a new birth, and it can only be of consciousness. You have to come out of your psychological bondage, your mental slavery. You have to drop all kinds of beliefs, superstitions, theories, hypotheses, assumptions, prejudices, you have to be utterly clean, empty. And in that nothingness you will discover your spiritual virginity -- and that is the truth. The purity of it is incalculable, the innocence of it is beyond praise.\nAnd life takes wings the moment one his discovered one's truth. Then the whole sky is yours -- even the sky is not the limit.\nThe truth is vast, so vast that it can contain contradictions. It is so vast that it contains everything, from the smallest blade of grass to the biggest star -- it contains all.\nAnd man can enter into this ocean very simply, just one small condition has to be fulfilled, one has to drop one's ego, the idea that 'I'm separate.' That's the only fallacy that keeps people away from God, away from truth, away from love, away from bliss. That's the only fallacy that creates hell and misery.\nAnd it is good is one can become aware from this age, if one can become aware from one's childhood, then much can be saved, much unnecessary trouble can be saved. One need not go through all kinds of stupidities. One can find a short-cut. There is no necessity that everybody should behave like a fool.\nAnd it is easier for a child to drop the ego, because the child is still learning. Every child is born without an ego, then he has to learn it. He force him to learn, we tell him 'You are separate, you are special, you are this, you are that,' and the child certainly starts accepting the beliefs of the parents, of the teachers. And they are all saying 'You have to be very special, extraordinary, you have to top the class in the school. In the college, in the university; you have to become famous.' So the child starts thinking 'I have to be ambitious,'\nand ambition breeds the ego. Competition breeds the ego and ego brings misery. And you can see that everywhere all people are miserable.\nOnly once in a while they smile, and that smile is also phony, just on the lips. It is not coming from their heart, it cannot come from their heart -- they have lost track of their heart long before. They don't know where it is. They smile just to ba polite, to be formal, but there is no joy, there is no dance in their life. And life can be a great ecstasy. It is our birthright to be ecstatic.\nLife should burst forth into thousands of flowers, roses and roses. Life should become a beautiful song, a dance. And it can all happen by a simple method: don't think yourself separate from the universe, know that we are one with the whole, we come from the whole and one day we will go back to the whole.\nI call that whole the ocean and we are just small dewdrops. If the dewdrop slips into the ocean it becomes the ocean -- and that is the moment of bliss, ecstasy.\nGold has been an ancient symbol in alchemy, it represents the highest peak of consciousness, the most precious in man. Ordinarily man lives a very meaningless, valueless life, but this whole meaninglessness can be transformed into a great golden aura. One just needs a certain chemical process, a bridge, to transform all that is ordinary, mundane, into something sacred.\nAnd meditation does exactly that, as you become more and more silent, you start seeing great miracles happening in your inner being, you start seeing stones turning into diamonds, the baser metal turning into gold. And suddenly you know now that you have found the key to the infinite treasure of your being. And\nthat treasure of your being is what I call the truth.\nTo me truth is not some dry philosophical concept it is a lived experience. It is not dry like a desert, it is not empty, it is not abstract. It is overflowing, it is like a garden full of flowers and trees and greenery and springs and birds and songs and sun and the wind and the rain. It contains the totality of existence.\nSo by truth I mean your true being, your authentic reality. It is there but only in the seed. Meditation becomes a soil for the seed and then the seed starts growing. And the seed sprouting is a great miracle.\nThe seed looks so dead, so dry. If you cut it there is nothing in it, but out of that nothingness millions of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nflowers are possible. They say that a single seed can make the whole earth green\n-- that much potential. And the same is true about man, each man contains flowers of consciousness, truth, love, beauty, but they are only in a seed, We have not given them the right soil where the seed can die and the imprisoned splendour in the seed can become revealed.\nTruth is not a thought, it is an experience. We are thirsty for truth, so just information about truth is not going to quench the thirst -- we need real water, living water. Unless we drink, the thirst is going to remain.\nwe can forget the thirst if we become too occupied with theories about water, but again and again it will assert, again and again it will be there. Unless you drink it is not going to be quenched.\nTruth is a longing, a deep longing in the heart. One wants to know the meaning of life, one has every right to ask 'Who am I? Why am I here? For what purpose?' And unless one knows it one's whole life is bound to remain accidental, just like driftwood, no direction, no sense of direction, no destiny, just at the mercy of the winds and the waves, driftwood goes on moving here and there, not knowing why, not knowing where, not knowing from where... Such a\nlife cannot be joyous.\nOne needs a deep undercurrent of meaningfulness -- and that's what I call truth, discovering the undercurrent of meaningfulness, from the grave to the cradle and from the cradle to the grave. I have been born many times, we have died many times, each death brings a new birth, each birth brings a new death.\nWe go on moving like a wheel. The same spokes come again and again and again -- life followed by death, death followed by life -- and everybody is utterly bored. You can see it everywhere all around the earth.\nOne thing which is common to all human beings is boredom, whatsoever their nation, whatsoever their religion, whatsoever their race, it makes no difference, they are all bored, bored to death.\nAnd it is natural because they have lived so many lives and gone through the same routine and there seems to be no end to it -- it is the same routine again and again and again.\nUnless one finds an undercurrent of meaning, boredom remains. The moment you discover the meaning, the moment you Experience the meaning, suddenly spring comes to your life. Then it is no more repetitive, it becomes very original. Then each moment is new and original and boredom disappears. The same energy that has entangled in boredom is released and becomes ecstasy.\nBut truth has to be an experience, not a belief not information, but a transformation!\nTruth is a flowering of your being. It is coming to a blossoming state, when all the petals of your inner lotus open up. We in the East have called the ultimate opening of our consciousness the one-thousand petalled lotus -- One thousand simply represents infinity.\nMan is an infinity. Man is not the body, not the mind, these are limitations. Man is consciousness --\nwhich is unlimited, unbounded, in fact there is no possibility to define it, no way to express it, no word is adequate to contain it.\nIt can be communicated only in silence, hence the discovery of the master-\ndisciple relationship. It is something absolutely Eastern, it has not happened in the West. The West still thinks in terms of a teacher-student relationship. Nothing parallel to it has happened in the West. Many times it has been tried because many times people have carried the message from the East to the West.\nJesus carried the message from the East to the West. For seventeen years continuously he was travelling in the East. The Bible contains only two small references to his life before he left for this pilgrimage. One is when he was born and another that when he was twelve years of age he argued with the rabbis in the temple.\nOnly two references, one about his birth and another about his argument with the rabbis when he was twelve. After that, for eighteen years continuously, up to the age thirty, there is no mention at what happened in those eighteen years? Something tremendous must have happened, because out of those eighteen years is born the man Jesus, who has been worshipped by the Christians for these two thousand years. So those eighteen years were of tremendous significance, the most important part of his life, in those years he was travelling all over the East.\nThere are documents ancient enough to prove the fact. He learned the art, a very subtle art, of a totally new dimension of relationship, and he tried to create that kind of phenomenon in the West. But he failed, because the whole context was missing.\nThe same was done by Pythagoras in Greece, but he failed too. So once in a while the attempt has been made but it never succeeded. But the East has lived the experience for thousands of years, and has grown it into one of the most significant phenomena. It is a totally different phenomenon than the teacher- student relationship.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe teacher simply passes on the information that he has collected from other teachers, he simply hands over borrowed knowledge. He knows nothing himself,\none ignorant person giving some theories to another ignorant person, one blind man giving theories about light to other blind men; and this goes on from generation to generation.\nThe master means one who sees, one who has experienced, one who has blossomed. And the disciple has just to be with the master, in deep love, in deep trust. The heart of the disciple has only to say yes, an unconditional yes -- and in that very unconditional yesness, something transpires. Nothing is said by the master, nothing is heard by the disciple, but something beyond the scriptures, beyond the words, reaches to the very heart of the disciple. The silence of the master triggers silence in the disciple, the fragrance of the master triggers a process which opens the lotus of the disciple too!\nThe master is a catalytic agent.\nSo learn how to be a disciple, how to sit silently in this commune, how to drop your ego, and how to be just a deep and total yes. And that's all. And then things start happening of their own accord.\nThe Old Pond ...

you can enter into reality -- in the same proportion. If you can touch
your own centre, you become immediately capable of touching the centre
of the whole universe. And that penetration brings immense freedom,
immense bliss, and abundant life.</p><p>Ruth also means beauty, a vision of beauty. The person who is capable
of seeing in a different way than the ordinary becomes aware of a
tremendous beauty that always surrounds you; but your eyes are closed.
it is showering on you, each moment, but because we are not vulnerable,
we are closed, hence we become almost oblivious to the beauty of
existence.</p><p>Once you can see, then the first experience if of truth, and the
second experience is of the good, and the ultimate experience is of
beauty.</p><p>We have two trinities in the Eastern mystic symbology. One is satyam,
shivam, sunderam -- truth, good, beauty, the other is satchitananda: sat
-- truth, chit -- consciousness, ananda -- bliss. But both start with
the truth.</p><p>Truth is the door and then, on the second step, you experience good,
virtue, real authentic morality on the one hand and on the other hand
you experience consciousness- Consciousness and goodness are two

the same -</p><p>- then you come across, on the one hand, beauty, on the other hand,
bliss. Beauty and bliss are again two aspects of the same
phenomenon.</p><p>So, in all, these two trinities give you five things, not six,
because truth is the common ground for both.</p><p>Once you know the truth you become capable of knowing four ultimate
values, the good, and simultaneously, consciousness, awakening,
awareness, beauty, and simultaneously, bliss, joy, celebration.</p><p>And if these five things can happen, then nothing more is needed,
life is fulfilled, one has arrived at this source and at the goal.</p><p>Jesus says in one of his most pregnant statements, Truth brings
liberation. But it is only half the truth that he is saying, the other
half has to be remembered, because people have forgotten the other half
completely. Truth liberates, but the truth has to be your own -- only
then does it liberate. If it is somebody else's then it creates new
bondages. The truth of Jesus liberates Jesus, but becomes a bondage for
all Christians. The truth of Buddha brings freedom to him, but to those
who are blind followers, imitators, for them it creates only beautiful
chains.</p><p>So one has to be very alert not to borrow truth. Borrowed truth
brings slavery. Truth has to be discovered, it has to be yours. Nobody
else's will go. Neither roses can give it to you, nor Jesus, nor
Mahavira, nor Buddha.</p><p>Nobody can give it to you, it is not a commodity which can be
transferred or given hence the function of the master is not to give you
the truth but only devices to discover it within yourself.</p><p>The moment it is discovered all chains disappear, suddenly all walls
have evaporated, there is no prison at all. And a great laughter arises
in one's innermost core because that moment one realises that the prison
was just an idea, a dream, a nightmare.</p><p>Truth comes like light and all nightmares and all dreams and all
darknesses disappear. And to live in truth is the only way to live. All
other ways are only ways to die.</p><p>The person who is not living <em>his</em> truth is simply living
unnecessarily. He is a burden to himself and a burden to the earth, he
is a curse to himself and a curse to others. The person who finds his
truth and starts living it is a blessing to himself and a blessing to
the whole universe.</p><p>Man lives in lies because he is not conscious, and unless he becomes
conscious he can only go on changing his lies. He can become a Christian
from being a</p><p>Hindu or can become a Mohammedan from being a Christian or can become
a Buddhist from being a Mohammedan or can become a communist from being
a Buddhist, but he is simply changing his lies.</p><p>One gets bored with the old lies, no one wants to change them and for
a few days one feels excited, because one has found new models of lies,
the latest models of lies. But it is only a honeymoon, soon one finds
the chains are the same. The shape may be different, the make may be
different, but the slavery is the same. Whether you are in a church or
in a temple or in a mosque -- it makes no difference at all. These are
different prisons and people go on changing from one prison to
another.</p><p>So it is not a question of changing your beliefs. It is a question of
changing your consciousness -- that's what sannyas is all about. I don't
give you anything to believe, I don't give you any consolation, I don't
give you any rationalisation. I am not at all interested in replacing
your old ideology with a new one, because that will be beautiful only
for a few days, beautiful only because it is new, not because it is
really beautiful.</p><p>Sometimes the new bondage can be more dangerous than the old, because
the old bondage is bound to have many loopholes and the new bondage is
going to be more technically efficient. The new bondage is bound to have
fewer loopholes. From an old Indian prison you can escape very easily,
but from a German concentration camp it is impossibles it is more
scientific, more technically developed. It is almost impossible. I have
never heard of anybody who has been able to escape from a Russian
prison. It cannot happen. Even the walls have ears!</p><p>In Russia you cannot talk sincerely, authentically, even with your
husband or wife -- you cannot open your heart. Nobody knows who is a
spy. Your husband is a member of the Communist party, your wife a member
of the women's section of the Communist party. Even your kids belong to
the children's Communist party. One cannot even talk truly before the
kids, because they will report, they are being taught to report, to
spy.</p><p>In Russia there is no possibility of any revolution. Every precaution
has been taken.</p><p>So sometimes the new ideology may appear good in the beginning but it
is</p><p>bound to prove far more 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

belief. On the contrary, I have to take away all beliefs. I can help you
to be more conscious -- and that is the only true help, this true love
and the true compassion.</p><p>If you can become more conscious, more aware, then truth is not far
away. It is within you -- a conscious person is bound to find it, it is
inevitable. And the moment truth is found all is found.</p><p>A man lives without knowing his truth, his meaning, lives in utter
futility, from one failure to another failure. He dies without ever
really being born. He dies in the womb, millions of people are dying in
the womb -- not physically but psychologically.</p><p>The function of the master is to give you a new birth, and it can
only be of consciousness. You have to come out of your psychological
bondage, your mental slavery. You have to drop all kinds of beliefs,
superstitions, theories, hypotheses, assumptions, prejudices, you have
to be utterly clean, empty. And in that nothingness you will discover
your spiritual virginity -- and that is the truth. The purity of it is
incalculable, the innocence of it is beyond praise.</p><p>And life takes wings the moment one his discovered one's truth. Then
the whole sky is yours -- even the sky is not the limit.</p><p>The truth is vast, so vast that it can contain contradictions. It is
so vast that it contains everything, from the smallest blade of grass to
the biggest star -- it contains all.</p><p>And man can enter into this ocean very simply, just one small
condition has to be fulfilled, one has to drop one's ego, the idea that
'I'm separate.' That's the only fallacy that keeps people away from God,
away from truth, away from love, away from bliss. That's the only
fallacy that creates hell and misery.</p><p>And it is good is one can become aware from <em>this</em> age, if one
can become aware from one's childhood, then much can be saved, much
unnecessary trouble can be saved. One need not go through all kinds of
stupidities. One can find a short-cut. There is no necessity that
everybody should behave like a fool.</p><p>And it is easier for a child to drop the ego, because the child is
still learning. Every child is born without an ego, then he has to learn
it. He force him to learn, we tell him 'You are separate, you are
special, you are this, you are that,' and the child certainly starts
accepting the beliefs of the parents, of the teachers. And they are all
saying 'You have to be very special, extraordinary, you have to top the
class in the school. In the college, in the university; you have to
become famous.' So the child starts thinking 'I have to be
ambitious,'</p><p>and ambition breeds the ego. Competition breeds the ego and ego
brings misery. And you can see that everywhere all people are
miserable.</p><p>Only once in a while they smile, and that smile is also phony, just
on the lips. It is not coming from their heart, it cannot come from
their heart -- they have lost track of their heart long before. They
don't know where it is. They smile just to ba polite, to be formal, but
there is no joy, there is no dance in their life. And life can be a
great ecstasy. It is our birthright to be ecstatic.</p><p>Life should burst forth into thousands of flowers, roses and roses.
Life should become a beautiful song, a dance. And it can all happen by a
simple method: don't think yourself separate from the universe, know
that we are one with the whole, we come from the whole and one day we
will go back to the whole.</p><p>I call that whole the ocean and we are just small dewdrops. If the
dewdrop slips into the ocean it becomes the ocean -- and that is the
moment of bliss, ecstasy.</p><p>Gold has been an ancient symbol in alchemy, it represents the highest
peak of consciousness, the most precious in man. Ordinarily man lives a
very meaningless, valueless life, but this whole meaninglessness can be
transformed into a great golden aura. One just needs a certain chemical
process, a bridge, to transform all that is ordinary, mundane, into
something sacred.</p><p>And meditation does exactly that, as you become more and more silent,
you start seeing great miracles happening in your inner being, you start
seeing stones turning into diamonds, the baser metal turning into gold.
And suddenly you know now that you have found the key to the infinite
treasure of your being. And</p><p>that treasure of your being is what I call the truth.</p><p>To me truth is not some dry philosophical concept it is a lived
experience. It is not dry like a desert, it is not empty, it is not
abstract. It is overflowing, it is like a garden full of flowers and
trees and greenery and springs and birds and songs and sun and the wind
and the rain. It contains the totality of existence.</p><p>So by truth I mean your true being, your authentic reality. It is
there but only in the seed. Meditation becomes a soil for the seed and
then the seed starts growing. And the seed sprouting is a great
miracle.</p><p>The seed looks so dead, so dry. If you cut it there is nothing in it,
but out of that nothingness millions of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

earth green</p><p>-- that much potential. And the same is true about man, each man
contains flowers of consciousness, truth, love, beauty, but they are
only in a seed, We have not given them the right soil where the seed can
die and the imprisoned splendour in the seed can become revealed.</p><p>Truth is not a thought, it is an experience. We are thirsty for
truth, so just information about truth is not going to quench the thirst
-- we need <em>real</em> water, living water. Unless we drink, the
thirst is going to remain.</p><p>we can forget the thirst if we become too occupied with theories
about water, but again and again it will assert, again and again it will
be there. Unless you drink it is not going to be quenched.</p><p>Truth is a longing, a deep longing in the heart. One wants to know
the meaning of life, one has every right to ask 'Who am I? Why am I
here? For what purpose?' And unless one knows it one's whole life is
bound to remain accidental, just like driftwood, no direction, no sense
of direction, no destiny, just at the mercy of the winds and the waves,
driftwood goes on moving here and there, not knowing why, not knowing
where, not knowing from where... Such a</p><p>life cannot be joyous.</p><p>One needs a deep undercurrent of meaningfulness -- and that's what I
call truth, discovering the undercurrent of meaningfulness, from the
grave to the cradle and from the cradle to the grave. I have been born
many times, we have died many times, each death brings a new birth, each
birth brings a new death.</p><p>We go on moving like a wheel. The same spokes come again and again
and again -- life followed by death, death followed by life -- and
everybody is utterly bored. You can see it everywhere all around the
earth.</p><p>One thing which is common to all human beings is boredom, whatsoever
their nation, whatsoever their religion, whatsoever their race, it makes
no difference, they are all bored, bored to death.</p><p>And it is natural because they have lived so many lives and gone
through the same routine and there seems to be no end to it -- it is the
same routine again and again and again.</p><p>Unless one finds an undercurrent of meaning, boredom remains. The
moment you discover the meaning, the moment you Experience the meaning,
suddenly spring comes to your life. Then it is no more repetitive, it
becomes very original. Then each moment is new and original and boredom
disappears. The same energy that has entangled in boredom is released
and becomes ecstasy.</p><p>But truth has to be an experience, not a belief not information, but
a transformation!</p><p>Truth is a flowering of your being. It is coming to a blossoming
state, when all the petals of your inner lotus open up. We in the East
have called the ultimate opening of our consciousness the one-thousand
petalled lotus -- One thousand simply represents infinity.</p><p>Man is an infinity. Man is not the body, not the mind, these are
limitations. Man is consciousness --</p><p>which is unlimited, unbounded, in fact there is no possibility to
define it, no way to express it, no word is adequate to contain it.</p><p>It can be communicated only in silence, hence the discovery of the
master-</p><p>disciple relationship. It is something absolutely Eastern, it has not
happened in the West. The West still thinks in terms of a
teacher-student relationship. Nothing parallel to it has happened in the
West. Many times it has been tried because many times people have
carried the message from the East to the West.</p><p>Jesus carried the message from the East to the West. For seventeen
years continuously he was travelling in the East. The Bible contains
only two small references to his life before he left for this
pilgrimage. One is when he was born and another that when he was twelve
years of age he argued with the rabbis in the temple.</p><p>Only two references, one about his birth and another about his
argument with the rabbis when he was twelve. After that, for eighteen
years continuously, up to the age thirty, there is no mention at what
happened in those eighteen years? Something tremendous must have
happened, because out of those eighteen years is born the man Jesus, who
has been worshipped by the Christians for these two thousand years. So
those eighteen years were of tremendous significance, the most important
part of his life, in those years he was travelling all over the
East.</p><p>There are documents ancient enough to prove the fact. He learned the
art, a very subtle art, of a totally new dimension of relationship, and
he tried to create that kind of phenomenon in the West. But he failed,
because the whole context was missing.</p><p>The same was done by Pythagoras in Greece, but he failed too. So once
in a while the attempt has been made but it never succeeded. But the
East has lived the experience for thousands of years, and has grown it
into one of the most significant phenomena. It is a totally different
phenomenon than the teacher- student relationship.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The teacher simply passes on the information that he has collected
from other teachers, he simply hands over borrowed knowledge. He knows
nothing himself,</p><p>one ignorant person giving some theories to another ignorant person,
one blind man giving theories about light to other blind men; and this
goes on from generation to generation.</p><p>The master means one who sees, one who has experienced, one who has
blossomed. And the disciple has just to be with the master, in deep
love, in deep trust. The heart of the disciple has only to say yes, an
unconditional yes -- and in that very unconditional yesness, something
transpires. Nothing is said by the master, nothing is heard by the
disciple, but something beyond the scriptures, beyond the words, reaches
to the very heart of the disciple. The silence of the master triggers
silence in the disciple, the fragrance of the master triggers a process
which opens the lotus of the disciple too!</p><p>The master is a catalytic agent.</p><p>So learn how to be a disciple, how to sit silently in this commune,
how to drop your ego, and how to be just a deep and total yes. And
that's all. And then things start happening of their own accord.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-old-pond-...-plop>The Old Pond ... Plop</h3><p>Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

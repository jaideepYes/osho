And that's what the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nso-called religions have been doing teaching people to be compassionate, to be of service to others, to have to be dutiful, to be loving, out all these qualities are by-products, so when you try them directly they remain phony.\nThe real thing is consciousness. The more conscious you become, simultaneously, compassion starts growing. You need not think about it at all; it comes of its own accord -- and that is true religion. This is the distinction between the true and the false: the false is cultivated, the true is spontaneous,\nnatural. The false is imposed from the outside, the true wells up from your within. And whenever something comes from your very being it has tremendous beauty.\nThat is another meaning of your name, beauty. And a really religious person will be beautiful. His whole life will be nothing but sheer grace; his actions will show his being, his gestures will indicate something invisible in him, his words will contain his silence and his silence will be his message. So whether he is speaking or not speaking, whether he is doing something or not doing, in every possible way grace will surround him. And he is not trying to maintain it, it is not out of effort -- he has not to think at all. It following him as a shadow follows one. he is not even half-conscious about it; hence he never becomes holier-than- thou. We never pretends that he is doing something great -- serving people, humanity.\nWhatsoever he is doing is his joy to do. Nobody is obliged, nobody is made to feel owed to him; in fact he is thankful to the whole existence that it has given him the opportunity to live a beautiful life, blissful life, a conscious life.\nInitiation into sannyas is initiation into consciousness. Become more aware, alert, watchful. That single word 'consciousness' contains the very soul of religion.\nConsciousness is the only hope in life, the unconscious person lives hopelessly. His life has no wonder, no surprise, no ecstasy. It is dull, it is dead. He somehow drags himself. When one can become a dance just to go on dragging yourself is stupid. The same energy that becomes a burden can also create wings, the same energy that creates misery can open the doors of paradise. All that is needed is the key -- and consciousness is that key. It is a master key, it can open all the locks and all the doors and all the mysteries.\nSo my whole effort here is to help my people become more and more conscious. I don't give you any commandments, I don't give you any morality, I give you only a simple alchemical secret, be more conscious -- and that's enough, because a conscious person cannot do anything wrong. And the unconscious person cannot do anything right; the unconscious person may intend to do right but he will do wrong. And the conscious person has no intention left. The more you become conscious, all intentions and all desires are consumed by the fire of consciousness. The conscious person simply lives without any motive. And to\nlive without any motive is to live an authentic life. When there is no motive, no expectation, one cannot be frustrated, obviously; every frustration needs as a prerequisite, expectation. The conscious person expects nothing, hence you cannot frustrate him. The conscious person never tries to succeed, hence he can never be a failure. The conscious person lives each moment for the sheer joy of living -- there is no motive, no desire, no ambition. And that is the true definition of a sannyasin living consciously is what sannyas is all about.\nMisery is rooted in our robot-like behavior; it arises out of our unconsciousness. You become angry because you are unconscious; if you are conscious, to be angry is so stupid -- it is impossible to get into it.\nOne can get into it only unconsciously; hence even unconscious people later on repent. When they start getting a little bit alert to what they have done, how they have behaved, how ugly it was, then they start saying \"I am sorry -- I did it in spite of myself!\" But how can you do it in spite of yourself? Then who does it?\nBut there is a certain significance in that expression; it shows that when you are unconscious you are not yourself. Then you are at the mercy of anything that is happening outside -- it can drive you into any direction. You become driftwood. The moment you are conscious, only then you are; and then you cannot be angry, cannot be jealous, cannot be dominating, cannot be egoistic. All these things simply disappear.\nAnd these are the causes of our misery. Once they are gone life is bliss. One should not settle for less than that.\nOne should keep oneself alert, so much so that one day your life becomes just a blissfulness. And it is possible, it is our potential, it is our birthright. And the whole of life is a challenge to get that which is our birthright.\nThere are a thousand and one fallacies prevalent all around the world about meditation. Meditation is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nvery simple: it is nothing but consciousness; it is not chanting. Chanting can create a hypnosis. It is not using a mantra or a rosary -- that too is a hypnotic method; it can give you a certain kind of rest. Nothing is wrong about that rest; if one is just trying to relax it is perfectly good -- any hypnotic method can be helpful.\nBut if one wants to know the truth then it is not enough.\nMeditation simply means transforming your unconsciousness into consciousness. Normally only one-tenth of our mind is conscious, nine-tenth is unconscious. Just a little part of our mind, a thin layer has light; otherwise the whole house is in darkness.\nAnd sannyas is a challenge to grow that small light so much that the whole house is flooded with light, so that not even a nook or corner is left in darkness. And then the whole house is full of light, then life is a miracle; it has the quality of magic. Then it is no more ordinary -- everything becomes extraordinary. The mundane is transformed into the sacred and the small things of life start having such tremendous significance that one would not have ever imagined: ordinary stones look as beautiful as diamonds, the whole existence becomes illuminated. The moment you are illuminated the whole existence is illuminated.\nIf you are dark then the whole existence is dark. It all depends on you. You will find only yourself reflected in thousands of ways in existence; in people's eyes, in the stars, in the rivers, in the mountains, in the trees, in the flowers, you will find yourself reflected. If you are full of darkness then you will not find light anywhere.\nBuddha is right when he says, \"Be a light unto yourself.\" That's what I mean by becoming conscious: becoming a light unto yourself. And no special method is needed. Just watch. Watch the actions of your body: while walking, watch; while eating, watch. Watch the thought processes of the mind -- thinking, desiring, dreaming -- watch. Watch the subtle emotions -- feelings, moods, thoughts -- just watch. These is no need to choose that this is good and that is bad. The moment you start choosing you lose watchfulness; you are no more a sannyasin, you have become a puritan, a moralist.\nThere is no question of good and bad. Whatsoever is the case, simply watch it, without any judgement.\nAnd then slowly slowly, from the body to the mind, from the mind to the heart... and then the ultimate jump happens one day: suddenly you become watchful of watchfulness itself -- and that is the moment when the house is full of light; one has come home.\nUnconsciousness creates all kinds of ugliness in life; so whenever you find anything ugly in you, just look for the cause; somewhere in the roots will be unconsciousness. If there is ambition the person becomes ugly. Politicians are bound to be ugly, so much ambition, so much desire to dominate others, by any means\n-- because time is short and competition is great. There are so many people who are trying to be the president, to be the prime minister in such a great competitive world, with such a short life, how can one bother about the means and the end? Then any means have to be used to fulfil your desire. Then one forgets all sense, all reason, all aesthetic sensibility.\nIf one has to murder people, one murders. Joseph Stalin killed at least ten million people, and the same is true about Mao Tse Tung, and the same is true about Adolf Hitler. The whole history of humanity is full of these monsters -- but everybody is a politician more or less. You may not kill thousands of people or millions of people but in your own small way you will kill a few people, you will kill your husband, your wife, your children -- whomsoever you can get hold of. You may not really murder but you may kill their spirit. The ambitious person is poisonous, whatsoever he touches becomes a poison.\nBut ambition exists because we are unconscious, otherwise who bothers to dominate anybody? It is enough to be a master of oneself. And one becomes an emperor, far greater than any Alexander the Great, because by knowing oneself one comes to know the inner kingdom of god -- which is eternal and infinite.\nAll that is thought to be valuable in the world suddenly becomes useless. When you know your inner world everything pales, everything starts losing all significance. Once you have real gold you will know that up to now you have been carrying an unnecessary load, it was not real gold, it was false. It only looked like gold, it glittered like gold, but all that glitters is not gold.\nBut one has to first know the real, then only can one judge what is unreal, otherwise there is no criterion.\nAnger, hatred -- all are ugly. And if so many uglinesses are there in your mind, so many snakes and scorpions and dogs barking inside, and wolves and foxes (laughter)... it is impossible to become a human being with all these creatures inside.\nConsciousness helps you in a very simple but very efficient way. The moment you start becoming ambitious, if you are conscious, suddenly you start laughing at the whole idea of ambition; it looks ridiculous, it drops like a dead leaf.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf you are getting into anger and you become conscious, anger evaporates, just like dewdrops in the early sun, leaving no trace behind.\nOnce you have learned that to be conscious is the real miracle of life -- because it drops all that is non --\nessential, all that is ugly -- then what is left is beautiful. Beauty has not to be cultivated, the ugly only has to cease and the beauty rises.\nBeauty is natural, ugliness is unnatural. Beauty is your self-nature and ugliness is something foreign.\nThat's why nobody wants to be ugly -- but because of unconsciousness everybody has to be ugly.\nEverybody wants to be beautiful, but not knowing how to be beautiful, people go on painting their faces, trimming their hair, trying this kind of dress or that kind of dress, dieting and all kinds of things, just to be beautiful. But they don't know that this is not going to help much.\nBeauty is something inner. Hence it is there, discovered, it starts radiating from your body, from your mind, from everything that you consist of. Once your inner beauty is there everything is beautified.\nThe real virtue has nothing to do with so-called morality. There is one very profound and pregnant statement of Socrates: he says 'Knowledge is virtue.' By knowledge he means wisdom, knowing, because his whole emphasis was 'Know thyself.' That's what I mean by being conscious, because it is only consciousness that makes you capable of knowing yourself. And the moment you have known yourself you cannot do anything harmful to anybody. It is simply impossible. You cannot be destructive.\nIt is like a man who has eyes, how can you think that he will try to pass through the wall? He as eyes so he knows where the door is -- he will pass through the door. But the blind man can try. He will knock all around, and he can even try to get out through the wall or from the window. He does not know where the door is. He will ask others where the door is. But each moment you are in a different house -- as far as life is concerned -- and each moment the house is changing. Sometimes the door is on the right and sometimes it is on the left, and sometimes it is at the back and sometimes in the front -- no directions from others can be of much help, because the door goes on changing.\nYou need your own eyes. Then there is no need to ask, then there is no need to think about the door whenever you want to get out, you simply look and you know where the door is. That's what consciousness gives you: an insight, a new vision, a way of seeing, a new eye -- in the east we call it the third eye. That is only a metaphor but there are a few fools who try to dissect a dead body to find out where the third eye is.\nThese fools can be great experts, scientists, but that does not make any difference. They have not understood the metaphor, they have not understood the poetry of the word. It is only an expression. The third eye does not exist in the physical body, it is only a way of saying that you have found how to see directly into reality, you have become conscious. And out of that consciousness is virtue.\nAnd remember: if virtue is imposed from the outside then it is a regimentation. When it comes from the within it has an individuality. It is not like ready-made clothes, it is made for you, it is made by your consciousness. Its harmony is total with your being.\nNow Moses wrote the Ten Commandments three thousand years ago, and there are fools who are still following them. They were perfectly good for Moses but they are not good for anybody else. They come out of his consciousness. That's\nthe parable, that they came out of an encounter with god, that's an old way of saying that one has become so conscious that one knows what truth is, what god is. His experience of the ultimate truth gave birth to those Ten Commandments; they were only applicable to him -- and to nobody else,\nIn India, Hindus have followed the rules and the discipline of Manu, who is even farther beck than Moses -- five thousand years old. They may have been perfectly good for Manu but they are not at all adequate for anybody else. And this is my insistence, that each person has to find his own religion, his own morality, his own virtue. Then your virtue has your signature. Then it is alive, breathing, and then you are doing it not for any other reason, but just because that's the right thing to do. Your very heart wants to do it.\nThen you are not asking for any rewards in heaven, you are not greedy for anything and you are not afraid of hell, of any punishment. You are doing exactly what your insight is tell in; you to do -- whatsoever the result, whatsoever the ultimate consequence. Nobody of deep consciousness ever cares about the consequences. He acts immediately, responds to reality directly -- and that's all. And he enjoys the moment when he acts with reality, with his total being. He enjoys that harmony, that meeting, that merger, that union.\nConsciousness changes everything from prose to poetry, from mathematics to music, from logic to love.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is a radical transformation -- and only after this transformation does one start enjoying the adventure of life. Then each moment is ecstatic, exquisite. Its beauty is immense, unfathomable, immeasurable, inestimable. One can experience it but one cannot express it. No expression is possible, no definition is possible. It is so vast and our words are so small; our words are like dewdrops and the experience of consciousness is oceanic. You cannot force the ocean into a dewdrop.\nThe experience of consciousness is absolutely wordless. It happens only in utter silence. The silence is so profound that even you are not there. It is just space. Everything is gone -- your mind is gone, your ego is gone, there is space full of light. This experience has been described as god or as nirvana or as truth.\nAnd if one wants to catch some glimpse of it, then prose is the most inadequate thing; maybe poetry can reflect it a little bit -- just a little bit. Something of it can be communicated through poetry, something of it one can sing. One may not be able to say but one can sing it. It will not be in the words, it will oe in the very background of the song; not in the song itself, but in the gaps, in the pauses, in the intervals.\nThe poetry is not in the words, it is always between the words and between the lines. It is something surrounding the word like an invisible aura, but it is not exactly in the word. Or it can be experienced a little bit in music, even better than in poetry, because music is the highest form of poetry. Words are gone: only wounds are there and the harmony of the sounds.\nIt is not sounds that make the music but the harmony of the sounds. And the consciousness that I am talking about creates a harmony in your inner world among all your fragments, it joins them, it integrates them into one reality. Ordinarily we are thousands of thing, not one. we are many, a multitude, a crowd. But when one becomes conscious, slowly slowly the crowd loses its many-ness and becomes one, it becomes an integration, a crystallization and then there is great harmony.\nFirst one has to become harmonious within oneself and then one can be harmonious with the universe, with the stars and the moon and the sun and the trees and the birds -- this whole vast infinite universe, one can merge into it. There are two mergers, one within yourself -- the first unity, and the second, with the whole -- the second unity. And within these two steps the whole journey is complete.\nFirst become one with yourself, then become one with the whole -- and that's what I call holiness. To me that's the goal of sannyas, become conscious so your life becomes nothing but poetry, music, harmony, unity, oneness. And unless it happens one has lived in utter futility, in vain.\nThe Old Pond ...

great -- serving people, humanity.</p><p>Whatsoever he is doing is his joy to do. Nobody is obliged, nobody is
made to feel owed to him; in fact he is thankful to the whole existence
that it has given him the opportunity to live a beautiful life, blissful
life, a conscious life.</p><p>Initiation into sannyas is initiation into consciousness. Become more
aware, alert, watchful. That single word 'consciousness' contains the
very soul of religion.</p><p>Consciousness is the only hope in life, the unconscious person lives
hopelessly. His life has no wonder, no surprise, no ecstasy. It is dull,
it is dead. He somehow drags himself. When one can become a dance just
to go on dragging yourself is stupid. The same energy that becomes a
burden can also create wings, the same energy that creates misery can
open the doors of paradise. All that is needed is the key -- and
consciousness is that key. It is a master key, it can open all the locks
and all the doors and all the mysteries.</p><p>So my whole effort here is to help my people become more and more
conscious. I don't give you any commandments, I don't give you any
morality, I give you only a simple alchemical secret, be more conscious
-- and that's enough, because a conscious person cannot do anything
wrong. And the unconscious person cannot do anything right; the
unconscious person may intend to do right but he will do wrong. And the
conscious person has no intention left. The more you become conscious,
all intentions and all desires are consumed by the fire of
consciousness. The conscious person simply lives without any motive. And
to</p><p>live without any motive is to live an authentic life. When there is
no motive, no expectation, one cannot be frustrated, obviously; every
frustration needs as a prerequisite, expectation. The conscious person
expects nothing, hence you cannot frustrate him. The conscious person
never tries to succeed, hence he can never be a failure. The conscious
person lives each moment for the sheer joy of living -- there is no
motive, no desire, no ambition. And that is the true definition of a
sannyasin living consciously is what sannyas is all about.</p><p>Misery is rooted in our robot-like behavior; it arises out of our
unconsciousness. You become angry because you are unconscious; if you
are conscious, to be angry is so stupid -- it is impossible to get into
it.</p><p>One can get into it only unconsciously; hence even unconscious people
later on repent. When they start getting a little bit alert to what they
have done, how they have behaved, how ugly it was, then they start
saying "I am sorry -- I did it in spite of myself!" But how can you do
it in spite of yourself? Then who does it?</p><p>But there is a certain significance in that expression; it shows that
when you are unconscious you are not yourself. Then you are at the mercy
of anything that is happening outside -- it can drive you into any
direction. You become driftwood. The moment you are conscious, only then
you are; and then you cannot be angry, cannot be jealous, cannot be
dominating, cannot be egoistic. All these things simply disappear.</p><p>And these are the causes of our misery. Once they are gone life is
bliss. One should not settle for less than that.</p><p>One should keep oneself alert, so much so that one day your life
becomes just a blissfulness. And it is possible, it is our potential, it
is our birthright. And the whole of life is a challenge to get that
which is our birthright.</p><p>There are a thousand and one fallacies prevalent all around the world
about meditation. Meditation is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>very simple: it is nothing but consciousness; it is not chanting.
Chanting can create a hypnosis. It is not using a mantra or a rosary --
that too is a hypnotic method; it can give you a certain kind of rest.
Nothing is wrong about that rest; if one is just trying to relax it is
perfectly good -- any hypnotic method can be helpful.</p><p>But if one wants to know the truth then it is not enough.</p><p>Meditation simply means transforming your unconsciousness into
consciousness. Normally only one-tenth of our mind is conscious,
nine-tenth is unconscious. Just a little part of our mind, a thin layer
has light; otherwise the whole house is in darkness.</p><p>And sannyas is a challenge to grow that small light so much that the
whole house is flooded with light, so that not even a nook or corner is
left in darkness. And then the whole house is full of light, then life
is a miracle; it has the quality of magic. Then it is no more ordinary
-- everything becomes extraordinary. The mundane is transformed into the
sacred and the small things of life start having such tremendous
significance that one would not have ever imagined: ordinary stones look
as beautiful as diamonds, the whole existence becomes illuminated. The
moment you are illuminated the whole existence is illuminated.</p><p>If you are dark then the whole existence is dark. It all depends on
you. You will find only yourself reflected in thousands of ways in
existence; in people's eyes, in the stars, in the rivers, in the
mountains, in the trees, in the flowers, you will find yourself
reflected. If you are full of darkness then you will not find light
anywhere.</p><p>Buddha is right when he says, "Be a light unto yourself." That's what
I mean by becoming conscious: becoming a light unto yourself. And no
special method is needed. Just watch. Watch the actions of your body:
while walking, watch; while eating, watch. Watch the thought processes
of the mind -- thinking, desiring, dreaming -- watch. Watch the subtle
emotions -- feelings, moods, thoughts -- just watch. These is no need to
choose that this is good and that is bad. The moment you start choosing
you lose watchfulness; you are no more a sannyasin, you have become a
puritan, a moralist.</p><p>There is no question of good and bad. Whatsoever is the case, simply
watch it, without any judgement.</p><p>And then slowly slowly, from the body to the mind, from the mind to
the heart... and then the ultimate jump happens one day: suddenly you
become watchful of watchfulness itself -- and that is the moment when
the house is full of light; one has come home.</p><p>Unconsciousness creates all kinds of ugliness in life; so whenever
you find anything ugly in you, just look for the cause; somewhere in the
roots will be unconsciousness. If there is ambition the person becomes
ugly. Politicians are bound to be ugly, so much ambition, so much desire
to dominate others, by any means</p><p>-- because time is short and competition is great. There are so many
people who are trying to be the president, to be the prime minister in
such a great competitive world, with such a short life, how can one
bother about the means and the end? Then any means have to be used to
fulfil your desire. Then one forgets all sense, all reason, all
aesthetic sensibility.</p><p>If one has to murder people, one murders. Joseph Stalin killed at
least ten million people, and the same is true about Mao Tse Tung, and
the same is true about Adolf Hitler. The whole history of humanity is
full of these monsters -- but everybody is a politician more or less.
You may not kill thousands of people or millions of people but in your
own small way you will kill a few people, you will kill your husband,
your wife, your children -- whomsoever you can get hold of. You may not
really murder but you may kill their spirit. The ambitious person is
poisonous, whatsoever he touches becomes a poison.</p><p>But ambition exists because we are unconscious, otherwise who bothers
to dominate anybody? It is enough to be a master of oneself. And one
becomes an emperor, far greater than any Alexander the Great, because by
knowing oneself one comes to know the inner kingdom of god -- which is
eternal and infinite.</p><p>All that is thought to be valuable in the world suddenly becomes
useless. When you know your inner world everything pales, everything
starts losing all significance. Once you have real gold you will know
that up to now you have been carrying an unnecessary load, it was not
real gold, it was false. It only looked like gold, it glittered like
gold, but all that glitters is not gold.</p><p>But one has to first know the real, then only can one judge what is
unreal, otherwise there is no criterion.</p><p>Anger, hatred -- all are ugly. And if so many uglinesses are there in
your mind, so many snakes and scorpions and dogs barking inside, and
wolves and foxes (laughter)... it is impossible to become a human being
with all these creatures inside.</p><p>Consciousness helps you in a very simple but very efficient way. The
moment you start becoming ambitious, if you are conscious, suddenly you
start laughing at the whole idea of ambition; it looks ridiculous, it
drops like a dead leaf.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>If you are getting into anger and you become conscious, anger
evaporates, just like dewdrops in the early sun, leaving no trace
behind.</p><p>Once you have learned that to be conscious is the real miracle of
life -- because it drops all that is non --</p><p>essential, all that is ugly -- then what is left is beautiful. Beauty
has not to be cultivated, the ugly only has to cease and the beauty
rises.</p><p>Beauty is natural, ugliness is unnatural. Beauty is your self-nature
and ugliness is something foreign.</p><p>That's why nobody wants to be ugly -- but because of unconsciousness
everybody has to be ugly.</p><p>Everybody wants to be beautiful, but not knowing how to be beautiful,
people go on painting their faces, trimming their hair, trying this kind
of dress or that kind of dress, dieting and all kinds of things, just to
be beautiful. But they don't know that this is not going to help
much.</p><p>Beauty is something inner. Hence it is there, discovered, it starts
radiating from your body, from your mind, from everything that you
consist of. Once your inner beauty is there everything is
beautified.</p><p>The real virtue has nothing to do with so-called morality. There is
one very profound and pregnant statement of Socrates: he says 'Knowledge
is virtue.' By knowledge he means wisdom, knowing, because his whole
emphasis was 'Know thyself.' That's what I mean by being conscious,
because it is only consciousness that makes you capable of knowing
yourself. And the moment you have known yourself you cannot do anything
harmful to anybody. It is simply impossible. You cannot be
destructive.</p><p>It is like a man who has eyes, how can you think that he will try to
pass through the wall? He as eyes so he knows where the door is -- he
will pass through the door. But the blind man can try. He will knock all
around, and he can even try to get out through the wall or from the
window. He does not know where the door is. He will ask others where the
door is. But each moment you are in a different house -- as far as life
is concerned -- and each moment the house is changing. Sometimes the
door is on the right and sometimes it is on the left, and sometimes it
is at the back and sometimes in the front -- no directions from others
can be of much help, because the door goes on changing.</p><p>You need your own eyes. Then there is no need to ask, then there is
no need to think about the door whenever you want to get out, you simply
look and you know where the door is. That's what consciousness gives
you: an insight, a new vision, a way of seeing, a new eye -- in the east
we call it the third eye. That is only a metaphor but there are a few
fools who try to dissect a dead body to find out where the third eye
is.</p><p>These fools can be great experts, scientists, but that does not make
any difference. They have not understood the metaphor, they have not
understood the poetry of the word. It is only an expression. The third
eye does not exist in the physical body, it is only a way of saying that
you have found how to see directly into reality, you have become
conscious. And out of that consciousness is virtue.</p><p>And remember: if virtue is imposed from the outside then it is a
regimentation. When it comes from the within it has an individuality. It
is not like ready-made clothes, it is made for you, it is made by your
consciousness. Its harmony is total with your being.</p><p>Now Moses wrote the Ten Commandments three thousand years ago, and
there are fools who are still following them. They were perfectly good
for Moses but they are not good for anybody else. They come out of his
consciousness. That's</p><p>the parable, that they came out of an encounter with god, that's an
old way of saying that one has become so conscious that one knows what
truth is, what god is. His experience of the ultimate truth gave birth
to those Ten Commandments; they were only applicable to him -- and to
nobody else,</p><p>In India, Hindus have followed the rules and the discipline of Manu,
who is even farther beck than Moses -- five thousand years old. They may
have been perfectly good for Manu but they are not at all adequate for
anybody else. And this is my insistence, that each person has to find
his own religion, his own morality, his own virtue. Then your virtue has
<em>your</em> signature. Then it is alive, breathing, and then you are
doing it not for any other reason, but just because that's the right
thing to do. Your very <em>heart</em> wants to do it.</p><p>Then you are not asking for any rewards in heaven, you are not greedy
for anything and you are not afraid of hell, of any punishment. You are
doing exactly what your insight is tell in; you to do -- whatsoever the
result, whatsoever the ultimate consequence. Nobody of deep
consciousness ever cares about the consequences. He acts immediately,
responds to reality directly -- and that's all. And he enjoys the moment
when he acts with reality, with his total being. He enjoys that harmony,
that meeting, that merger, that union.</p><p>Consciousness changes everything from prose to poetry, from
mathematics to music, from logic to love.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It is a radical transformation -- and only after this transformation
does one start enjoying the adventure of life. Then each moment is
ecstatic, exquisite. Its beauty is immense, unfathomable, immeasurable,
inestimable. One can experience it but one cannot express it. No
expression is possible, no definition is possible. It is so vast and our
words are so small; our words are like dewdrops and the experience of
consciousness is oceanic. You cannot force the ocean into a dewdrop.</p><p>The experience of consciousness is absolutely wordless. It happens
only in utter silence. The silence is so profound that even <em>you</em>
are not there. It is just space. Everything is gone -- your mind is
gone, your ego is gone, there is space full of light. This experience
has been described as god or as nirvana or as truth.</p><p>And if one wants to catch some glimpse of it, then prose is the most
inadequate thing; maybe poetry can reflect it a little bit -- just a
little bit. Something of it can be communicated through poetry,
something of it one can sing. One may not be able to say but one can
sing it. It will not be in the words, it will oe in the very background
of the song; not in the song itself, but in the gaps, in the pauses, in
the intervals.</p><p>The poetry is not in the words, it is always between the words and
between the lines. It is something surrounding the word like an
invisible aura, but it is not exactly in the word. Or it can be
experienced a little bit in music, even better than in poetry, because
music is the highest form of poetry. Words are gone: only wounds are
there and the harmony of the sounds.</p><p>It is not sounds that make the music but the harmony of the sounds.
And the consciousness that I am talking about creates a harmony in your
inner world among all your fragments, it joins them, it integrates them
into one reality. Ordinarily we are thousands of thing, not one. we are
many, a multitude, a crowd. But when one becomes conscious, slowly
slowly the crowd loses its many-ness and becomes one, it becomes an
integration, a crystallization and then there is great harmony.</p><p>First one has to become harmonious within oneself and then one can be
harmonious with the universe, with the stars and the moon and the sun
and the trees and the birds -- this whole vast infinite universe, one
can merge into it. There are two mergers, one within yourself -- the
first unity, and the second, with the whole -- the second unity. And
within these two steps the whole journey is complete.</p><p>First become one with yourself, then become one with the whole -- and
that's what I call holiness. To me that's the goal of sannyas, become
conscious so your life becomes nothing but poetry, music, harmony,
unity, oneness. And unless it happens one has lived in utter futility,
in vain.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-old-pond-...-plop>The Old Pond ... Plop</h3><p>Chapter #6</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

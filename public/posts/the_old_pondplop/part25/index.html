Pleasure comes through relationship, bliss arises in your absolute aloneness; hence pleasure always brings misery in its wake, because when something is dependent on somebody else there is bound to be many problems.\nFirst, the fear: what is available today, will it be available tomorrow too or not? And fear destroys all joy; it is poison to joy, it creates anxiety, anguish, worry. Out of this fear one tends to possess the other, so that the future becomes secure, insured. But the moment you possess the other you have reduced the other into a commodity. And joy is possible only if the other remains as individual, not a thing.\nSo one is in a dilemma. If you allow the other freedom, then there is fear. If you don't allow the freedom, then you cut the very roots of your joy. And when you try to possess the other, the other is going to resist, because freedom is the greatest longing in every heart. Nobody wants to be enslaved.\nThe resistance can be either feminine or it can be very male. Feminine resistance is subtle, indirect; male resistance is aggressive. So the other can be resistant in a subtle, feminine way; hence all the women go on nagging their lovers in every\npossible way -- that is their way of resistance. Or, it can be aggression -- both 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare ugly. The male is aggressive; hence he has reduced women to a kind of property.\nAll these problems are bound to arise, and when you try to possess the other, the other is bound to react in the same way, tit for tat; the other will try to possess you. And then there will be a struggle over who is going to dominate, who is superior, who is more powerful, who is on top.\nPleasure brings many miseries. They follow it like shadows. Bliss is a totally different dimension. It is your natural flowering. It is just being con-tented with yourself. It does not mean that you have to stop loving, but your quality of love will be totally different.\nWhen you are seeking pleasure love is only a means; the real desire is to find pleasure. Hence when you have found the pleasure your love disappears, because love was only a means to a certain end. When you are hungry you eat; of course, when you are not hungry you are no more interested in the food. Hence all lovers go through these phases: when they are in need they are very loving, when the need is no more there they are very unloving, they take revenge, they become almost enemies.\nThe blissful person also loves but his love is not a means to any end. It is an end unto itself, it is a sharing. He does not want to get anything out of it. He has so such bliss, so much fragrance in his being, he wants to share it. He is almost like a raincloud, so full of rainwater that it wants to shower.\nMonika is one of the most beautiful names possible. It defines exactly the state of the awakened person: he lives alone; out of his aloneness he shares, but he is alone. He may love thousands of people, he may love the whole universe, but it arises out of his deep aloneness. And remember, because his aloneness brings flowering, bliss, freedom, truth, it is not loneliness at all. His aloneness is just\nthe opposite of loneliness.\nLoneliness is a state of despair; aloneness is a state of total bliss.\nOne can cultivate character, but then there is no dignity in it; it is arbitrary, artificial, imposed. It in fact creates a schizophrenic state in the person. It makes one split. One is something inside and just the opposite on the outside. It gives you only a beautiful facade, a mask, and a mask cannot have any dignity -- it is dead.\nIt can give you respectability, it can give you much honour, because as far as your behaviour is concerned the society is in control. And the society always respects the people who allow themselves to be controlled and enslaved. The society never respects the rebellious person; it respects the popes and it kills Jesus.\nIt is a very strange world. Christ is crucified and popes are enthroned -- and popes are nothing! They are just parrots. It kills the real and honours the phony.\nSociety wants slaves, the state wants slaves, the church wants slaves; hence they all try to cultivate a certain conscience in you. Conscience is a trick.\nNow scientists have been working on putting electrodes in the human brain and these electrodes can be manipulated by remote control. And the person who has the electrode fixed in his brain will not be aware of it at all, because the inside of the skull is absolutely insensitive. Even if you put a small rock there you will not feel it. So just a small computerised mechanism, not bigger than a button, can be put into the head very easily, and the remote-controller can make you do things which you will think you are doing out of your own choice and you will be simply behaving according to some far-away source.\nDelgado has invented many things on these lines, and it is possible that in the future humanity will have to face this danger. This is far more dangerous than atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs; they can kill your body, but these electrodes can kill your very spirit. In a dictatorial country every child, when he is born in the hospital, can be fixed immediately with an electrode -- the first thing to be done -- and then for his whole life he can be controlled, and he will never know. When he says yes he will think he is saying yes, but it is the electrode that is making him say yes.\nNow this is a more developed form of the old conscience. Conscience is a bullock cart method; it takes a long time. The family, the society, the school, the college, the university -- almost twenty-five years it takes, one-third of a life- time, to create a certain conscience: do this, don't do that. The old method is simply nothing but hypnosis. Go on repeating to the small child 'This is right and that is wrong.' This creates a subtle conditioning in his mind and then that conditioning will control his whole life. This conditioning cannot have any dignity. It will give you a certain character, but it will not give you dignity; you will not be a Christ or a Buddha or a Lao Tzu or a Zarathustra.\nFor dignity of character, consciousness is needed, not conscience and that's the function of meditation.\nMeditation does not give you any character directly. It does not say what to do and what not to do. It never gives you any commandments. It simply gives you a technique for becoming more aware, for being more alert, watchful, witnessing.\nMeditation is the art of awareness. And once you are aware, out of your awareness your actions will 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\narise -- not out of conscience. Conscience is cultivated by others, by the vested interests, by the establishment. Consciousness is yours. It is individual, it is not collective. Conscience is part of the mob psychology. Consciousness gives you dignity because it gives you individuality. It gives you rebellion, it makes you capable of saying yes or no of your own accord. There is no foreign agency manipulating you in the name of religion, morality, etcetera.\nMy effort here is just to help you to be more aware so whatsoever you do comes out of that awareness.\nThat awareness has no ready-made answers; it is just like a mirror: it reflects the situation, the challenge of the situation, and you act immediately, spontaneously. You don't look for an answer in the memory, in the scriptures, in your parent's ideas, in all that has been taught to you. You simply encounter the situation\nimmediately; in your own light. Your action then has dignity, beauty, grace, because it is coming out of freedom. Freedom makes everything graceful. Freedom is the greatest value in life.\nAnd then certainly, whatsoever you do -- your character, your behaviour -- is\nyours, authentically yours.\nIt has your signature on it. Then you are not a carbon copy, you are original. The Zen people call it finding the original face.\nFor that, one has to drop all the masks, one has to risk many things, particularly respectability. That is a bribe by the society. It will give you a Nobel prize and it will give you many honours; it will do everything to make you feel great, if you can fulfil one condition: if you are obedient, obedient like a robot, then all respect is for you. Then the society will make you a great hero, but there will be no grace, no beauty, no freedom, no truth, no being; you have committed a real suicide.\nMeditation opens the doors of your inner treasures, what Jesus calls the kingdom of god. Meditation is only a key, and keys are always small things, but they can unlock immense treasures. Everybody is born as a prince or a princess, but gets lost in the blind crowd of beggars.\nA person who is always asking for more I call a beggar. He may be a rich beggar or a poor beggar -- that does not matter -- but the quality that determines his beggarhood is that he is always asking for more.\nWhatsoever he has is never enough. And it is never going to be enough. He is always desiring, and because of that desiring he is always in deep discontentment. And desires have a certain nature; they are like the horizon: it looks as if it's just there, a few miles ahead, just a few minutes' drive, but by the time you reach there it has gone ahead of you. The distance between you and the horizon will always remain the same, because the horizon does not exist in fact; it is all illusion, an optical illusion. Because the earth is round, the illusion is possible. It seems somewhere the sky is meeting the earth. It does not exist; hence you can go on and on and on, but the distance between you, wherever you are, and the horizon, will be the same.\nThe same is true about our desires: the beggar is in discontent as much as the so- called rich person, because the distance is the safe. It is the distance that hurts.\nThe beggar also knows that if only he can reach there all will be fulfilled; and the rich person, even a man like Alexander the Great, has the same horizon, the same distance. He dies in immense poverty, just like everybody else.\nMeditation is a turning in; not running after the horizon which goes on receding. Understanding the futility of desire is the beginning of meditation; seeing its absolute absurdity, ridiculousness, its impossibility, one turns in. When one searches inwards because the outer search seems to be pointless. And the moment you search inwards a miracle happens -- it is exactly a miracle -- because whatsoever you have been searching for always and always, maybe for many many lives, is suddenly there. It was always within the seeker himself; the sought is in the seeker. And we have been running everywhere, except withinwards.\nMeditation makes you aware of the immense blissfulness that is just your very nature. And to know it is to become an emperor, an empress; to know it is to become rich for the first time, and it is a richness that cannot be taken away from you. Even death cannot take it away from you, because in death only the outer shell dies your innermost being remains as it is, it is eternal.\nTo know the eternal, to be the eternal, is the whole enquiry of sannyas. My sannyasins have to find that they are princes, emperors, not beggars. I am not for beggars. In the past, monks and nuns have lived like beggars. They have been taught to live a life of renunciation; I teach living a life of rejoicing.\nAnd one who knows his inner world, how can he avoid rejoicing? His whole life will be just a celebration.\nThe only thing needed to find bliss is a little bit of courage -- just a little bit. Society makes us cowards.\nIt makes us afraid. In a thousand and one ways it makes us fear-oriented: fear of others, fear of death, fear of disease, fear of failure, fear of poverty, fear of old age. And even death does not satisfy the society, so they 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncreate the fear of hell after your death.\nThis fear-orientation is bound to create a life of misery. My sannyasins have to learn to drop this whole orientation. It is not a question of dropping one fear: if you drop one, nothing will happen because there are a thousand other fears. It is not at all meaningful to go on pruning the leaves; it is better to cut the very root.\nHence my insistence is on love, because love is the polar opposite of fear. Life should be love-oriented, not fear-oriented. All the religions in the past have made it a point to use fear-orientation, because that is an easy way to manipulate, dominate, subjugate people -- but that has made the whole of humanity miserable.\nThis is the work of your saints and so-called mahatmas.\nIn my vision they are the greatest criminals in the world, because they have crippled the very possibility of man becoming blissful, they have poisoned the very being. But if one has a little bit of courage one can pull oneself out of this orientation. It is just imposed on us, it never becomes part of us. It is just like clothes: you can throw them off. Just a little courage to be naked is needed, that's all. One can throw off the clothes -- they are dirty and they are suffocating and they are borrowed and so many people have used them before.\nA love-orientation makes all the difference. If one moves from fear to love one move, from misery to bliss. Bliss arises when you start looking at life in a deep loving way. The stars, the trees, the animals, the people, the very earth -- all this is so beautiful, in fact there cannot be any more beautiful world than it is.\nThere cannot be any more perfect world than it is.\nOne needs only to grow a little more sensitivity, a little more of an aesthetic approach, a little more poetic vision. It all depends on how you look at life.\nWhen a painter comes into the garden he sees many shades of green. When an ordinary person comes into the garden he simply sees green trees. He has not that subtle demarcation, that sensibility, that awareness that can see that there is not only one kind of green tree; each tree has a different green. The painter knows there are many more colours than ordinary people are aware of, but they are not aware at all, they are really colour-blind. George Bernard Shaw was colour-blind and up to the age of sixty he was not aware -- and such an\nintelligent man... If this can happen to a man like George Bernard Shaw what to say about ordinary people?\nOn his sixtieth birthday somebody sent him a beautiful suit as a present. The person just forgot to send a tie with the suit. Bernard Shaw loved the suit and he went to the market to find a tie of the same colour. His secretary followed him; she was surprised because the suit was green, and Bernard Shaw was choosing a yellow tie -- 'That will be just monstrous!' (laughter) She could not control herself. She said 'I should not interfere, that is not my business, but I have to tell you that this won't look good at all. This is yellow and the suit is green. ' He said 'Is there any difference between this tie and the suit?' That was the first time he became aware that he could not see yellow.\nFor him there was no difference between yellow and green. He could only see green, he was blind to yellow. But he lived sixty years without knowing it; and millions of people are living in the world who don't know the beauty of colours, who don't know the beauty of the birds and their songs, who don't know the beauty of the stars. They never look above in the sky. They go on crawling in the mud. They don't have any time to see a beautiful sunset. Even if they see it they only pretend to see; they are not really there, not in that moment -- their mind is far away, somewhere else, always somewhere else. They may even see and say\n'This is beautiful,' but they are simply repeating a cliche. They are not aware of what they are saying. They are saying something, that is expected of them. They are simply fulfilling, the expectation, but they are not really aware of the beauty. They don't mean it when they say it is beautiful: they are repeating parrotlike.\nOtherwise, this existence is so beautiful that if you cannot love it, it is really unfortunate. My whole effort here is to help you to love existence, without any fear, without any greed, because greed is nothing but fear in disguise, another phase of fear. If you can love the existence, to me that is religiousness. And out of that love arises bliss!. Then life has a totally different flavour to it. You can call that flavour godliness, a new fragrance, you can call it Buddhahood, Christ- consciousness, but just to call it a totally new fragrance is enough, more than enough. Then your life is surrounded by a new poetry, a new dance, a new song.\nI am not concerned with hell and heaven and all that nonsense. I am not concerned with mythologies and theologies; my whole concern is how to help you to understand beauty, love, bliss. And I repeat: just a little bit of courage is\nneeded -- nothing much!\nThe only way to find bliss is to surrender to existence -- not to Buddha, not to Christ, not to Krishna, not to me, but to the whole! The master has to be used only as a window, so that you can see the sky beyond, so 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthat you can see the further shore -- that's all. Once you have seen it you need not cling to the frame of the window.\nSurrendering tc a master is really surrendering to the whole. That is just the beginning, because at first the whole will be too much. You may become afraid.\nThere is a beautiful story in Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Krishna is explaining to Arjuna to surrender to the whole -- don't bring your will in.' But Arjuna is a sophisticated prince, well-educated, as educated as Krishna himself, far richer than Krishna, belongs to a far more renowned family than Krishna. Krishna is just functioning as a charioteer to Arjuna in the war. They are old friends, and relatives also: Krishna's sister is married to Arjuna.\nSo Arjuna goes on arguing. Finally when he cannot argue any more he says one thing. He says 'If you talk so much about the whole can you show me a vision of the whole?\"\nAnd the story is beautiful -- I don't think it is factual, it cannot be, but it is significant: Krishna becomes a window and Arjuna can see the vast universe, stars appearing and disappearing, the whole eternity. It is so vast that he becomes frightened. Its very vastness is frightening, is scary. He trembles, perspires and starts shouting, 'Close this window! I am absolutely convinced of what you are saying but don't show me this vastness -- this is too much. I cannot look at it any more.'\nAnd Krishna closes the window, he becomes again the same friend; he had disappeared and Arjuna had had a glimpse of the eternal process of existence.\nThe parable is beautiful because that's exactly what happens between a disciple and a master -- but not literally; it is a beautiful metaphor, metaphorically it really happens.\nIt is difficult to surrender to the whole. The master is only an excuse, but once you surrender to the master you have surrendered to the whole, and slowly slowly you will learn how to move closer and closer to eternity and infinity without any fear. In fact when one is surrendered, ego disappears, and with the ego all fear disappears.\nSannyas means surrender -- in the beginning to the master and then through the master to the whole. But one has to remember: one has to reach the whole. The river has to reach the ocean. Only when the river disappears into the ocean, loses its identity, has it come home.\nThe goal of every human being, in fact of all the beings, is to attain to the state of bliss. Even trees are trying in their own unconscious way to reach the state of bliss; animals, birds, in a haphazard way, zig-zag, because there is no consciousness.\nMan is privileged: he can become conscious of his longing. To become conscious of your longing for bliss is sannyas. Millions of human beings also go on searching for bliss, but in unconscious way. You cannot find it in unconscious ways; consciousness is an absolute necessity, a prerequisite. Only when you are conscious will you be able to attain to bliss; hence consciousness is the law, the ultimate law. To me consciousness is godliness.\nThe moment you become absolutely conscious, all your unconsciousness disappears, as if suddenly you have brought light into the house of your being and that very moment you know that the world does not consist only of matter -- matter is only a form of sleeping awareness -- that matter itself is immaterial, that the world consists of consciousness. And when you have known it, realised it -- not intellectually but existentially -- you can call it the realisation of god or truth or nirvana... they are only different expressions for the same thing, but the taste is one and that is of bliss, absolute bliss, unwavering bliss. Once attained it is attained forever.\nIntellect is a pseudo coin, easily attainable, but not really of any worth. Our schools, colleges, universities all impart intellect. And the more a person\nbecomes intellectual, scholarly, learned, informed, the more his intelligence becomes covered with rubbish; otherwise every child is born with tremendous intelligence. We destroy his intelligence; we are afraid of his intelligence, so we start crippling, paralysing his intelligence. And we start burdening his intelligence, putting on such a load of unnecessary knowledgeability -- geography, history, and all kinds of nonsense -- that he becomes so full of rubbish and loses contact with his own intelligence, he loses the way to his own being.\nMy effort here is to help you to find the diamond that you have lost in the rubbish of intellect. One has to learn how to throw all intellectual jargon out of one's being, how to empty oneself of all knowledge. The moment you are ready to empty yourself of all knowledge you attain your natural intelligence -- and that becomes a second birth. One becomes a 'dwija', twice born -- and that is the real beginning of life. Sannyas 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhas to be a second birth.\nJesus says 'Unless you are born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.' He is absolutely right: one has to move from intellect to intelligence, from knowledge to wisdom, from information to transformation. And this can be easily done by meditation, very easily. One just has to become more and more silent. So whenever you have time, just sit silently, doing nothing. Just watch your mind, all its gimmicks, games; enjoy all its trips and numbers, but remain aloof, cool, detached, just a watcher. It is just a screen, like a TV screen, on which things are moving; you are just an observer, unidentified with it. This is the whole secret of meditation: becoming unidentified.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference

through relationship, bliss arises in your absolute aloneness; hence
pleasure always brings misery in its wake, because when something is
dependent on somebody else there is bound to be many problems.</p><p>First, the fear: what is available today, will it be available
tomorrow too or not? And fear destroys all joy; it is poison to joy, it
creates anxiety, anguish, worry. Out of this fear one tends to possess
the other, so that the future becomes secure, insured. But the moment
you possess the other you have reduced the other into a commodity. And
joy is possible only if the other remains as individual, not a
thing.</p><p>So one is in a dilemma. If you allow the other freedom, then there is
fear. If you don't allow the freedom, then you cut the very roots of
your joy. And when you try to possess the other, the other is going to
resist, because freedom is the greatest longing in every heart. Nobody
wants to be enslaved.</p><p>The resistance can be either feminine or it can be very male.
Feminine resistance is subtle, indirect; male resistance is aggressive.
So the other can be resistant in a subtle, feminine way; hence all the
women go on nagging their lovers in every</p><p>possible way -- that is their way of resistance. Or, it can be
aggression -- both 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

kind of property.</p><p>All these problems are bound to arise, and when you try to possess
the other, the other is bound to react in the same way, tit for tat; the
other will try to possess you. And then there will be a struggle over
who is going to dominate, who is superior, who is more powerful, who is
on top.</p><p>Pleasure brings many miseries. They follow it like shadows. Bliss is
a totally different dimension. It is your natural flowering. It is just
being con-tented with yourself. It does not mean that you have to stop
loving, but your quality of love will be totally different.</p><p>When you are seeking pleasure love is only a means; the real desire
is to find pleasure. Hence when you have found the pleasure your love
disappears, because love was only a means to a certain end. When you are
hungry you eat; of course, when you are not hungry you are no more
interested in the food. Hence all lovers go through these phases: when
they are in need they are very loving, when the need is no more there
they are very unloving, they take revenge, they become almost
enemies.</p><p>The blissful person also loves but his love is not a means to any
end. It is an end unto itself, it is a sharing. He does not want to get
anything out of it. He has so such bliss, so much fragrance in his
being, he wants to share it. He is almost like a raincloud, so full of
rainwater that it wants to shower.</p><p>Monika is one of the most beautiful names possible. It defines
exactly the state of the awakened person: he lives alone; out of his
aloneness he shares, but he is alone. He may love thousands of people,
he may love the whole universe, but it arises out of his deep aloneness.
And remember, because his aloneness brings flowering, bliss, freedom,
truth, it is not loneliness at all. His aloneness is just</p><p>the opposite of loneliness.</p><p>Loneliness is a state of despair; aloneness is a state of total
bliss.</p><p>One can cultivate character, but then there is no dignity in it; it
is arbitrary, artificial, imposed. It in fact creates a schizophrenic
state in the person. It makes one split. One is something inside and
just the opposite on the outside. It gives you only a beautiful facade,
a mask, and a mask cannot have any dignity -- it is dead.</p><p>It can give you respectability, it can give you much honour, because
as far as your behaviour is concerned the society is in control. And the
society always respects the people who allow themselves to be controlled
and enslaved. The society never respects the rebellious person; it
respects the popes and it kills Jesus.</p><p>It is a very strange world. Christ is crucified and popes are
enthroned -- and popes are nothing! They are just parrots. It kills the
real and honours the phony.</p><p>Society wants slaves, the state wants slaves, the church wants
slaves; hence they all try to cultivate a certain conscience in you.
Conscience is a trick.</p><p>Now scientists have been working on putting electrodes in the human
brain and these electrodes can be manipulated by remote control. And the
person who has the electrode fixed in his brain will not be aware of it
at all, because the inside of the skull is absolutely insensitive. Even
if you put a small rock there you will not feel it. So just a small
computerised mechanism, not bigger than a button, can be put into the
head very easily, and the remote-controller can make you do things which
you will think you are doing out of your own choice and you will be
simply behaving according to some far-away source.</p><p>Delgado has invented many things on these lines, and it is possible
that in the future humanity will have to face this danger. This is far
more dangerous than atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs; they can kill your
body, but these electrodes can kill your very spirit. In a dictatorial
country every child, when he is born in the hospital, can be fixed
immediately with an electrode -- the first thing to be done -- and then
for his whole life he can be controlled, and he will never know. When he
says yes he will think <em>he</em> is saying yes, but it is the
electrode that is making him say yes.</p><p>Now this is a more developed form of the old conscience. Conscience
is a bullock cart method; it takes a long time. The family, the society,
the school, the college, the university -- almost twenty-five years it
takes, one-third of a life- time, to create a certain conscience: do
this, don't do that. The old method is simply nothing but hypnosis. Go
on repeating to the small child 'This is right and that is wrong.' This
creates a subtle conditioning in his mind and then that conditioning
will control his whole life. This conditioning cannot have any dignity.
It will give you a certain character, but it will not give you dignity;
you will not be a Christ or a Buddha or a Lao Tzu or a Zarathustra.</p><p>For dignity of character, consciousness is needed, not conscience and
that's the function of meditation.</p><p>Meditation does not give you any character directly. It does not say
what to do and what not to do. It never gives you any commandments. It
simply gives you a technique for becoming more aware, for being more
alert, watchful, witnessing.</p><p>Meditation is the art of awareness. And once you are aware, out of
your awareness your actions will 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>arise -- not out of conscience. Conscience is cultivated by others,
by the vested interests, by the establishment. Consciousness is yours.
It is individual, it is not collective. Conscience is part of the mob
psychology. Consciousness gives you dignity because it gives you
individuality. It gives you rebellion, it makes you capable of saying
yes or no of your own accord. There is no foreign agency manipulating
you in the name of religion, morality, etcetera.</p><p>My effort here is just to help you to be more aware so whatsoever you
do comes out of that awareness.</p><p>That awareness has no ready-made answers; it is just like a mirror:
it reflects the situation, the challenge of the situation, and you act
immediately, spontaneously. You don't look for an answer in the memory,
in the scriptures, in your parent's ideas, in all that has been taught
to you. You simply encounter the situation</p><p>immediately; in your own light. Your action then has dignity, beauty,
grace, because it is coming out of freedom. Freedom makes everything
graceful. Freedom is the greatest value in life.</p><p>And then certainly, whatsoever you do -- your character, your
behaviour -- is</p><p>yours<span class=p>, authentically yours.</span></p><p>It has your signature on it. Then you are not a carbon copy, you are
original. The Zen people call it finding the original face.</p><p>For that, one has to drop all the masks, one has to risk many things,
particularly respectability. That is a bribe by the society. It will
give you a Nobel prize and it will give you many honours; it will do
everything to make you feel great, if you can fulfil one condition: if
you are obedient, obedient like a robot, then all respect is for you.
Then the society will make you a great hero, but there will be no grace,
no beauty, no freedom, no truth, no being; you have committed a real
suicide.</p><p>Meditation opens the doors of your inner treasures, what Jesus calls
the kingdom of god. Meditation is only a key, and keys are always small
things, but they can unlock immense treasures. Everybody is born as a
prince or a princess, but gets lost in the blind crowd of beggars.</p><p>A person who is always asking for more I call a beggar. He may be a
rich beggar or a poor beggar -- that does not matter -- but the quality
that determines his beggarhood is that he is always asking for more.</p><p>Whatsoever he has is never enough. And it is never going to be
enough. He is always desiring, and because of that desiring he is always
in deep discontentment. And desires have a certain nature; they are like
the horizon: it looks as if it's just there, a few miles ahead, just a
few minutes' drive, but by the time you reach there it has gone ahead of
you. The distance between you and the horizon will always remain the
same, because the horizon does not exist in fact; it is all illusion, an
optical illusion. Because the earth is round, the illusion is possible.
It seems somewhere the sky is meeting the earth. It does not exist;
hence you can go on and on and on, but the distance between you,
wherever you are, and the horizon, will be the same.</p><p>The same is true about our desires: the beggar is in discontent
<em>as</em> much as the so- called rich person, because the distance is
the safe. It is the distance that hurts.</p><p>The beggar also knows that if only he can reach there all will be
fulfilled; and the rich person, even a man like Alexander the Great, has
the same horizon, the same distance. He dies in immense poverty, just
like everybody else.</p><p>Meditation is a turning in; not running after the horizon which goes
on receding. Understanding the futility of desire is the beginning of
meditation; seeing its absolute absurdity, ridiculousness, its
impossibility, one turns in. When one searches inwards because the outer
search seems to be pointless. And the moment you search inwards a
miracle happens -- it is exactly a miracle -- because whatsoever you
have been searching for always and always, maybe for many many lives, is
suddenly there. It was always within the seeker himself; the sought is
in the seeker. And we have been running everywhere, except
withinwards.</p><p>Meditation makes you aware of the immense blissfulness that is just
your very nature. And to know it is to become an emperor, an empress; to
know it is to become rich for the first time, and it is a richness that
cannot be taken away from you. Even death cannot take it away from you,
because in death only the outer shell dies your innermost being remains
as it is, it is eternal.</p><p>To know the eternal, to be the eternal, is the whole enquiry of
sannyas. My sannyasins have to find that they are princes, emperors, not
beggars. I am not for beggars. In the past, monks and nuns have lived
like beggars. They have been taught to live a life of renunciation; I
teach living a life of rejoicing.</p><p>And one who knows his inner world, how can he avoid rejoicing? His
whole life will be just a celebration.</p><p>The only thing needed to find bliss is a little bit of courage --
just a little bit. Society makes us cowards.</p><p>It makes us afraid. In a thousand and one ways it makes us
fear-oriented: fear of others, fear of death, fear of disease, fear of
failure, fear of poverty, fear of old age. And even death does not
satisfy the society, so they 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>create the fear of hell after your death.</p><p>This fear-orientation is bound to create a life of misery. My
sannyasins have to learn to drop this whole orientation. It is not a
question of dropping one fear: if you drop one, nothing will happen
because there are a thousand other fears. It is not at all meaningful to
go on pruning the leaves; it is better to cut the very root.</p><p>Hence my insistence is on love, because love is the polar opposite of
fear. Life should be love-oriented, not fear-oriented. All the religions
in the past have made it a point to use fear-orientation, because that
is an easy way to manipulate, dominate, subjugate people -- but that has
made the whole of humanity miserable.</p><p>This is the work of your saints and so-called mahatmas.</p><p>In <em>my</em> vision they are the greatest criminals in the world,
because they have crippled the very possibility of man becoming
blissful, they have poisoned the very being. But if one has a little bit
of courage one can pull oneself out of this orientation. It is just
imposed on us, it never becomes part of us. It is just like clothes: you
can throw them off. Just a little courage to be naked is needed, that's
all. One can throw off the clothes -- they are dirty and they are
suffocating and they are borrowed and so many people have used them
before.</p><p>A love-orientation makes all the difference. If one moves from fear
to love one move, from misery to bliss. Bliss arises when you start
looking at life in a deep loving way. The stars, the trees, the animals,
the people, the very earth -- all this is so beautiful, in fact there
cannot be any more beautiful world than it is.</p><p>There cannot be any more perfect world than it is.</p><p>One needs only to grow a little more sensitivity, a little more of an
aesthetic approach, a little more poetic vision. It all depends on how
you look at life.</p><p>When a painter comes into the garden he sees many shades of green.
When an ordinary person comes into the garden he simply sees green
trees. He has not that subtle demarcation, that sensibility, that
awareness that can see that there is not only one kind of green tree;
<em>each</em> tree has a different green. The painter knows there are
many more colours than ordinary people are aware of, but they are not
aware at all, they are really colour-blind. George Bernard Shaw was
colour-blind and up to the age of sixty he was not aware -- and such
an</p><p>intelligent man... If this can happen to a man like George Bernard
Shaw what to say about ordinary people?</p><p>On his sixtieth birthday somebody sent him a beautiful suit as a
present. The person just forgot to send a tie with the suit. Bernard
Shaw loved the suit and he went to the market to find a tie of the same
colour. His secretary followed him; she was surprised because the suit
was green, and Bernard Shaw was choosing a yellow tie -- 'That will be
just monstrous!' (laughter) She could not control herself. She said 'I
should not interfere, that is not my business, but I have to tell you
that this won't look good at all. This is yellow and the suit is green.
' He said 'Is there any difference between this tie and the suit?' That
was the first time he became aware that he could not see yellow.</p><p>For him there was no difference between yellow and green. He could
only see green, he was blind to yellow. But he lived sixty years without
knowing it; and millions of people are living in the world who don't
know the beauty of colours, who don't know the beauty of the birds and
their songs, who don't know the beauty of the stars. They never look
above in the sky. They go on crawling in the mud. They don't have any
time to see a beautiful sunset. Even if they see it they only
<em>pretend</em> to see; they are not really there, not in that moment
-- their mind is far away, somewhere else, always somewhere else. They
may even see and say</p><p>'This is beautiful,' but they are simply repeating a cliche. They are
not aware of what they are saying. They are saying something, that is
expected of them. They are simply fulfilling, the expectation, but they
are not really aware of the beauty. They don't <em>mean</em> it when
they say it is beautiful: they are repeating parrotlike.</p><p>Otherwise, this existence is so beautiful that if you cannot love it,
it is <em>really</em> unfortunate. My whole effort here is to help you
to love existence, without any fear, without any greed, because greed is
nothing but fear in disguise, another phase of fear. If you can love the
existence, to me that is religiousness. And out of that love arises
bliss!. Then life has a totally different flavour to it. You can call
that flavour godliness, a new fragrance, you can call it Buddhahood,
Christ- consciousness, but just to call it a totally new fragrance is
enough, more than enough. Then your life is surrounded by a new poetry,
a new dance, a new song.</p><p>I am not concerned with hell and heaven and all that nonsense. I am
not concerned with mythologies and theologies; my whole concern is how
to help you to understand beauty, love, bliss. And I repeat: just a
little bit of courage is</p><p>needed -- nothing much!</p><p>The only way to find bliss is to surrender to existence -- not to
Buddha, not to Christ, not to Krishna, not to me, but to the whole! The
master has to be used only as a window, so that you can see the sky
beyond, so 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>that you can see the further shore -- that's all. Once you have seen
it you need not cling to the frame of the window.</p><p>Surrendering tc a master is really surrendering to the whole. That is
just the beginning, because at first the whole will be too much. You may
become afraid.</p><p>There is a beautiful story in Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Krishna is
explaining to Arjuna to surrender to the whole -- don't bring your will
in.' But Arjuna is a sophisticated prince, well-educated, as educated as
Krishna himself, far richer than Krishna, belongs to a <em>far</em> more
renowned family than Krishna. Krishna is just functioning as a
charioteer to Arjuna in the war. They are old friends, and relatives
also: Krishna's sister is married to Arjuna.</p><p>So Arjuna goes on arguing. Finally when he cannot argue any more he
says one thing. He says 'If you talk so much about the whole can you
show me a vision of the whole?"</p><p>And the story is beautiful -- I don't think it is factual, it cannot
be, but it is significant: Krishna becomes a window and Arjuna can see
the vast universe, stars appearing and disappearing, the whole eternity.
It is so vast that he becomes frightened. Its very vastness is
frightening, is scary. He trembles, perspires and starts shouting,
'Close this window! I am absolutely convinced of what you are saying but
don't show me this vastness -- this is too much. I cannot look at it any
more.'</p><p>And Krishna closes the window, he becomes again the same friend; he
had disappeared and Arjuna had had a glimpse of the eternal process of
existence.</p><p>The parable is beautiful because that's exactly what happens between
a disciple and a master -- but not literally; it is a beautiful
metaphor, metaphorically it really happens.</p><p>It is difficult to surrender to the whole. The master is only an
excuse, but once you surrender to the master you have surrendered to the
whole, and slowly slowly you will learn how to move closer and closer to
eternity and infinity without any fear. In fact when one is surrendered,
ego disappears, and with the ego all fear disappears.</p><p>Sannyas means surrender -- in the beginning to the master and then
through the master to the whole. But one has to remember: one has to
reach the whole. The river has to reach the ocean. Only when the river
disappears into the ocean, loses its identity, has it come home.</p><p>The goal of every human being, in fact of all the beings, is to
attain to the state of bliss. Even trees are trying in their own
unconscious way to reach the state of bliss; animals, birds, in a
haphazard way, zig-zag, because there is no consciousness.</p><p>Man is privileged: he can become conscious of his longing. To become
conscious of your longing for bliss is sannyas. Millions of human beings
also go on searching for bliss, but in unconscious way. You cannot find
it in unconscious ways; consciousness is an absolute necessity, a
prerequisite. Only when you are conscious will you be able to attain to
bliss; hence consciousness is the law, the ultimate law. To me
consciousness is godliness.</p><p>The moment you become absolutely conscious, all your unconsciousness
disappears, as if suddenly you have brought light into the house of your
being and that very moment you know that the world does not consist only
of matter -- matter is only a form of sleeping awareness -- that matter
itself is immaterial, that the world consists of consciousness. And when
you have known it, realised it -- not intellectually but existentially
-- you can call it the realisation of god or truth or nirvana... they
are only different expressions for the same thing, but the taste is one
and that is of bliss, absolute bliss, unwavering bliss. Once attained it
is attained forever.</p><p>Intellect is a pseudo coin, easily attainable, but not really of any
worth. Our schools, colleges, universities all impart intellect. And the
more a person</p><p>becomes intellectual, scholarly, learned, informed, the more his
intelligence becomes covered with rubbish; otherwise every child is born
with tremendous intelligence. We destroy his intelligence; we are afraid
of his intelligence, so we start crippling, paralysing his intelligence.
And we start burdening his intelligence, putting on such a load of
unnecessary knowledgeability -- geography, history, and all kinds of
nonsense -- that he becomes so full of rubbish and loses contact with
his own intelligence, he loses the way to his own being.</p><p>My effort here is to help you to find the diamond that you have lost
in the rubbish of intellect. One has to learn how to throw all
intellectual jargon out of one's being, how to empty oneself of all
knowledge. The moment you are ready to empty yourself of all knowledge
you attain your natural intelligence -- and that becomes a second birth.
One becomes a 'dwija', twice born -- and that is the real beginning of
life. Sannyas 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>has to be a second birth.</p><p>Jesus says 'Unless you are born again you shall not enter into my
kingdom of god.' He is absolutely right: one has to move from intellect
to intelligence, from knowledge to wisdom, from information to
transformation. And this can be easily done by meditation, <em>very</em>
easily. One just has to become more and more silent. So whenever you
have time, just sit silently, doing nothing. Just watch your mind, all
its gimmicks, games; enjoy all its trips and numbers, but remain aloof,
cool, detached, just a watcher. It is just a screen, like a TV screen,
on which things are moving; you are just an observer, unidentified with
it. This is the whole secret of meditation: becoming unidentified.
Dropping the idea that 'I am the mind' is meditation.</p><p>When you know 'I am the witness and the mind is there, just an
object, and I am subjectivity, mind is a content and I am
consciousness,' that 'I am the seer and the mind is the seen' -- this is
the whole process of meditation. And this brings the transformation,
this brings you to the world of the immortals.</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-old-pond-...-plop>The Old Pond ... Plop</h3><p>Chapter #26</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

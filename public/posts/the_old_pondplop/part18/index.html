It is for reference purposes only.]\nLove can have three possibilities: the first is animal, the second is human, and the third is divine.\nOrdinarily people know only the first. It is biological attraction. It is something hormonal, chemical, unconscious. You are not the master of it. You are simply driven by instinctive energies. Those instincts are part of the body, not part of you.\nNature has its own ways to propagate the species. It forces every individual to reproduce. That's the only way, otherwise everybody will disappear; hence it has made it almost compulsory. It is so compulsive that even if one decides not to go into it, one is driven, in spite of oneself. And religions have been fighting against this energy for thousands of years. Their fight has not helped. In fact it has distorted the natural energies, it has created a very perverted humanity.\nThe way to get beyond them is not through fighting, but through understanding, through awareness, through meditation. Fighting means repression and whatsoever is repressed will come up again and again. It is not going to leave you. In fact the more you repress it, the more it strives to take possession of you. And the effort to fight and repress creates a dichotomy in you. You become dual,\ndivided, schizophrenic. It is because of the so-called religions that the whole of humanity is living a split life.\nFighting with oneself is an insane way of living. Your energies are simply dissipated. They are not used creatively. It is like making both of your hands fight with each other; what can be the outcome? Do you think either of your hands is going to win? Both belong to you. You can pretend that the right has won, but any moment you can also pretend that the left has won. It is up to you. It is just your decision. It is not going to give you any victory. It is bound to result in ultimate failure and frustration.\nLove has to be taken out of the bondage of biology, but fighting itself, is biological, struggle is biological, and you cannot transcend biology through biology. It is like wiping mud with more mud. It is sheer stupidity.\nYou have to bring some new element into the world of biology, and that I call meditation, a ray of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmeditation, a ray of watchfulness. That does not belong to biology at all, because animals are not aware, trees are not aware. They live in one-hundred-per cent unconsciousness.\nThe moment you start becoming conscious of all your biological forces, something new has already happened, something non-biological has penetrated, and that is going to become the source of transformation.\nMake your lust an object of observation; then it changes into human love. You have gone beyond the animal. The human is born. Out of one hundred so-called human beings there is only rarely one human being ninety-nine per cent are only apparently human, but not really. They look like human beings, they behave like animals. Their love is animal, their hate is animal, their violence is animal their anger is animal, their jealousy is animal, their possessiveness is animal -- all is animal.\nIt is one of the great transformations to become human. One is not born human; one is born an animal, but with the potential of being human. And that potential starts functioning only when you bring awareness in. Immediately awareness functions like a catalytic agent. Suddenly you are beyond your biology.\nIf you can watch, you are no more it -- the watcher is never the watched -- already you have surpassed, transcended, you are something above, you are an onlooker, a seer.\nHuman love is non-possessive, non-jealous, non -- biological. It has nothing to do with reproduction. It is a play, a sharing, a fun, a way of communicating. But still there is one thing in it which has to be dropped the boundaries. Even in human love the lovers are not one -- they are separate. Everything of the biological has disappeared except one thing which is not biological and therefore cannot disappear with the biology --\nthat is the ego.\nAnimals are not egoistic, neither are trees egoistic. They don't have the feeling of\nI. It is a human phenomenon. The more you become aware of your humanity, the more the ego is strengthened; hence the people of great sensitivity will always be more egoistic. The poets, the painters, the dancers -- they will be more egoistic than other people, for the simple reason that ego is a human phenomenon. Now their whole energy is released from biology and it is exploited by the ego.\nIt is better than biology, but it cannot be the ultimate goal, because if you are surrounded by a boundary you are limited and every limitation brings misery. One needs to be unlimited, unbounded only then the imprisoned splendour is released. Then you are as vast as the universe. And this can happen through love very easily.\nNow the second step is to bring your awareness to the ego; the same way you brought your awareness to your unconscious instincts and became free of them, bring your awareness to the ego. Now it has to be more subtle, because the ego is more invisible, more cunning, more clever. If you watch it at one point, it will appear at another point. If you are sitting at the front door it will come from the back door. If you are watching both doors it will come from the window or it may just remove a tile from the roof and jump from there! (laughter) Just like Santa Claus (laughter) coming from the chimney. It will find ways and means\nhow to come back again and again.\nOne has to be totally aware, not concentrated, not excluding anything. Awareness has to be inclusive.\nThe first awareness was a kind of concentration: you had to be focussed on your biology because it is a determinate phenomenon, it is there like an object and it cannot trick you, because it is just part of chemistry. If you watch it in a focussed way it will remain there. Not so with the ego: the ego is very elusive. If you watch it here it will disappear from there and you will feel very good and in that feeling itself it has come back. You start patting your own back, you say 'Now it is no more. I have become egoless,' and it has come. It has already grabbed your neck.\nSo one has to be inclusive of all dimensions. One has to be just aware, open, watchful, simply watchful, not in a concentrated way but in a relaxed way, so nothing remains hidden. Everything is in a way within the range of your awareness. Then the ego is transcended. And that very moment divine love is born. And divine love is the ultimate experience.\nYou can call it god, you can call it nirvana, you can call it enlightenment -- these are just words to indicate something which is wordless; but 'love' seems to be the most beautiful word. It has some poetry in it, some dance in it, some ecstasy in it.\nMan living as an ego lives like an island, separate from the whole; and that is his anxiety, anguish, because he feels always lonely, feels always afraid, always worried about death and what is going to happen tomorrow, worried about safety, security, worried about a thousand and one things. But the basic problem is created by ourselves. The moment we think ourselves separate we create all these problems. The separation 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis a falsity. Living as an ego is living in a dream-world, it is not true.\nWe cannot be separate from the whole. Our life is part of the whole. Each moment we breathe the whole in and breathe the whole out. The whole circulates in our blood. We are as rooted in the whole as trees are rooted in the earth. Of course our roots are invisible, but just don't breathe for a few minutes and you are gone. That means that breathing was something like a root which was connecting you with the whole continuously.\nWe are one with the whole. To know it is to be blissful. To experience it is to go beyond all anguish. But it has to be experienced, not believed. Belief won't help.\nIf you are thirsty you can believe that you are drinking water, but if you are not really drinking water the thirst is going to grow more and more. It will spread all over your body. It will kill you. Belief is not going to help and all the religions have been teaching people to believe.\nThe real thing is to experience; hence my emphasis is on experience, not on belief. Don't believe what I say. Try to experience it. And unless you have experienced, resist the temptation to believe; the temptation is always there because belief is cheap. The mind says 'What is the point of investigating, enquiring, exploring? Why bother? Just believe! Buddha knows, Jesus knows, Lao Tzu knows, Zarathustra knows, so what is the point? If they are all saying that it is so, it must be so.' But if Zarathustra drinks, his thirst is quenched, not yours. If Zarathustra knows, he knows, not you.\nMy sannyasins are not to be believers but experimenters. A tremendous scientific enquiry into the ultimate reality -- that's what initiation into sannyas is. It is an adventure. Belief is death, it is a full point; you simply take it for granted. Somebody says, Somebody authoritative -- the Bible, the Koran, the Gita --\nand you simply believe the authority. To believe in any authority is to destroy your own intelligence. All authorities are destructive of intelligence.\nI am not an authority in that sense. Whatsoever I am saying I am saying according to my experience --\nthat way I am authoritative, but that authority does not mean that anybody has to believe in it. That simply means: take it as a hypothesis and then enquire whether it is true or not.\nBeing here with me simply means exploring. And if you start exploring you will\nfind. There is no need to believe, because it is so. 'Es dhammo sanantano' says the Buddha -- this is the truth, the ultimate truth. so if it is the ultimate truth there is no need to believe; you can experience it.\nBelief is insisted upon only by people who themselves don't believe, who themselves don't know. They are afraid of enquiry, they are afraid of doubt, they are afraid of questions. They repress all questioning.\nThey condemn all doubt. I respect.\nSo I have to be just a hypothesis for you. I will give you hypotheses; then you have to go into enquiry.\nAnd I know that you will find the truth, because I have found the truth through the same enquiry; so there is no reason why you are not going to find it. I trust everybody's intelligence and everybody's intrinsic potential.\nAnd the day you discover that you are one with the whole, you have come home. For the first time you feel blessed, so much so that you can bless the whole universe.\nRitam means the law, the ultimate law.\nOne can live in two ways: either according to the universal law of life or against it. That much freedom is a prerogative of human beings. Going astray is available only to human beings. No dog can go astray.\nHave you ever seen a dog who is a sinner or a dog who is a saint; (laughter) Dogs are just dogs, neither sinners nor saints. Have you see a dog who is less of a dog or a dog who is more of a dog? They are just doggie, all the same way! (much laughter) But as far as man is concerned, you can say that this man is not man enough -- a little less than he should be or a little more than one had expected. You see lesser men, you see greater men, you see sinners, you see saints. What is the distinction? What is the criterion? What makes a sinner and what makes a real saint?\nAnd when I use the word 'saint' I am not using it in the Christian way, because the Christian way is the most stupid way of defining sainthood. The church declares that somebody is a saint, it certifies. The Christian word 'saint' comes from sanctum, sanctified by the church, certified by the church. The sanction has\nbeen given by the pope that this man is a saint. So sometimes they withdraw their sanctions. Even after hundreds of years -- a man may have been; for three hundred years and for three hundred years he has been a saint, worshipped, and then they withdraw sainthood. They find something. They reopen the case and they withdraw it. And sometimes a man was burned three hun-dred years before as a sinner and aFter three hundred years or four hundred years, they decide that it was wrong. The burning was done by one pope, and 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthen -- the same church and the same authority -- another pope declares him to be a saint, and he becomes a saint. This is the most stupid way.\nThe true meaning of the word 'saint' comes from the Sanskrit word 'sant', not from the English word\n'sanctum'. The Sanskrit word 'sant' means one who has known the truth. 'Sat' means truth, and 'sant' means one who has realised it. From 'sant' comes the English word 'saint'. It is exactly the same word, with just a little change in pronunciation: one who has known the truth, one who has lived according to the truth, one who has followed the law of existence, one who has not gone astray.\nBut man is free to choose. One can choose to go astray ... and the ego always wants to do that, because the ego feels good only when you go astray. Then you are on your own. When you are following the universal law you are no more there; the law is there. When the dewdrop drops into the ocean, where is it?\nIn a way it is no more, in a way it has become the ocean. But in every way the old ego is no more in existence, the old boundary is no more in existence.\nInitiation into sannyas means consciously, deliberately deciding to follow the law of existence. And how should one know what the law of existence is? -- it is not written in the books. But there is a natural criterion given to everybody; whatsoever makes you blissful is an indication that you are close to the law of existence, whatsoever makes you miserable is an indication that you are going away from the law of existence. When you are totally blissful you are one with\nthe law and when you are totally miserable you are against the law.\nBliss is the criterion. And this small criterion is enough. One should go on judging; whatsoever makes you blissful is the right thing to do, to be, and whatsoever makes you miserable is the wrong thing -- it has not to be done.\nI don't give you any commandments -- do this or don't do this. I simply tell you about the criterion so you can judge for yourself.\nIf jealousy makes you blissful (laughter) then follow it totally! Then that is the divine law! But I have never heard of anybody becoming blissful through jealousy, or through anger, or through violence, or through possessiveness, or through greed. These things have been making people live in hell -- but they cling to them. And by their clinging they make the hell bigger.\nThe moment you feel misery entering in you, be alert! you have taken the wrong step, you have fallen out of life's law, you are no more in tune with it.\nRitam also means rhythm. You have fallen out of rhythm, you have fallen out of harmony. This is how I define heaven and hell; hell is totally out of harmony with existence and heaven is totally in harmony with existence. And everybody has enough intelligence to know whether he is miserable or blissful.\nGo on choosing the blissful, go on dropping the miserable, and you will be on the right track towards the ultimate. Then one can be absolutely certain that he has found true religion.\nEgo is the only undivine thing. Ego is the only evil in the world. And it is not really an entity; it is just our fantasy, it is just imagination. It does not exist, it is only a nightmare; but we go on nourishing it and watering it and then it goes on growing more and more thorns. No flower ever comes through it. Ego has never brought a single flower into the world. It only brings thorns. The more you nourish it, the bigger the thorns. They hurt you, they hurt others. Their whole function is to hurt. It is not only that they hurt others.\nBefore they can hurt others they hurt you because they grow within you.\nFirst they penetrate your being, they create wounds in you, and then you start creating wounds in others out of revenge.\nThe miserable person creates misery all around. He wants everybody to be miserable. That's the only thing that gives him a little bit of happiness. If he can see everybody miserable, more miserable than he is then certainly, according to the law of relativity, according to Albert Einstein, he feels good and happy and blissful.\nThe ego never wants anybody to be blissful because that hurts very much. The miserable person creates misery, the blissful person create; bliss. we create only ourselves, because we can share only ourselves. for a sannyasin, the only thing to be dropped, the only thing to be renounced, is the eJo. And it is nothing; just a soap bubble, a little hot air. A pinprick is enough, and it is finished. One just has to decide to get rid of it.\nAnd if you can see what it has done to you and to others, you are bound to decide to get rid of it, because it has never given anybody any bliss, it is pure poison. And when there is no ego inside you a tremendous emptiness, a great emptiness comes in, spaciousness, nothingness. There is nobody inside, just a pure awareness, which is not somebody, which has no I as a centre to it. It is meeting and merging with the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhole. That's the ultimate goal of sannyas; to merge with the whole, to become one with the whole.\nThere are two kings of purity, two kinds of virtue, two kinds of morality. One is the cultivated kind, from the outside -- you have to practise it. It is a conditioning. Deep down you remain the same but you cover yourself with a beautiful facade. It is a superficial thing that can be scratched very easily and your reality will come rushing towards the surface.\nYou were smiling and you were all grace and somebody insults you; suddenly all grace is gone and all smiling is gone and the animal inside you takes possession. And you start doing things which you would not have ever thought you were capable of. And later on you will repent and you will say 'How did it happen? --\nI don't know.'\nThis cultivated kind of virtue, purity, morality has created a division in man, between the circumference and the centre; and this division is one of the most dangerous situations, because no man can be at ease.\nIt creates tensions. You cannot be yourself because you are two -- how can you be yourself? If you decide to follow the circumference, the centre becomes neglected, ignored, rejected; and it takes revenge. If you follow the centre, the circumference is angry, as if you have been programmed by two diametrically opposite programmes.\nOne you have brought from nature and one has been put on you by the society, so you are always in a state of conflict and inner turmoil. This is hell.\nThe second kind of purity, virtue and morality is not the cultivated one. I emphasise the second kind. It comes through meditation, not through cultivation. You simply have to become aware of your innermost core, you have to relax towards your centre. You have to settle at the centre and bring awareness there. You have to be fully alert at the centre, and that very alertness at the centre transforms the centre. Awareness is the greatest transforming agent in the world; nothing has ever surpassed it.\nIt is just like light; you bring the light in the room and all the darkness is gone. When you become aware at the centre your whole being is full of light, and out of that light your circumference acts. Then there is a unity, no conflict; and that unity is true sanity, true health, true wholeness. And that wholeness brings great ecstasy, great benediction.\nSo never follow the circumference because the centre is very powerful. You cannot drag the centre behind the circumference, but if your centre is transformed the circumference follows it naturally, like a shadow. Then there is no problem at all.\nAll the religions have been teaching the first kind of morality -- that's where I differ. I teach a totally different kind of virtue which arises as a natural consequence of centering, grounding, awareness.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- Ten days more.\n-- Then come back again. Ten days are good for ten commandments, but not for\nmy kind of... (The rest of the sentence is lost in laughter.) Good! Devagyan means divine knowing.\nAnimals don't know. Man knows but his knowing is only information, accumulation of facts, accumulation of theories, ideologies, philosophies -- it is all borrowed. And the borrowed always becomes a burden. It never brings freedom.\nBy 'divine knowing' I mean you have to know your own. You are not to become knowledgeable.\nKnowledgeability is a hindrance for known; because it gives you a false sense of knowing. It is a false coin.\nAnd one can believe in it; then one never enquires about the real coin.\nScholars are farther away from truth than anybody else. Even sinners are not so far away. I have seen both great sinners and great scholars. The sinners are almost always more innocent than the scholars. They are simple people. They are not very far away from the world of truth. But the scholar is very far away. He is too much in his head. He thinks he knows and he knows nothing.\nSannyas begins in dropping the idea of knowledge. Sannyas begins in remembering what Socrates says:\n'I know only one thing, that I know nothing' -- that is the beginning of sannyas. Because when you know nothing then immediately a tremendous desire and longing arise in you to know. And if you have dropped all borrowed knowledge, then the only dimension left open is to enter into your own inner world, into your own interiority, into your own consciousness.\nAnd as you go deeper in it, your knowing becomes more and more clear. When you have reached to the very core of your being, suddenly light explodes.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8101185 ShortTitle: POND18 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Love can have three possibilities: the first is animal, the second is
human, and the third is divine.</p><p>Ordinarily people know only the first. It is biological attraction.
It is something hormonal, chemical, unconscious. You are not the master
of it. You are simply driven by instinctive energies. Those instincts
are part of the body, not part of you.</p><p>Nature has its own ways to propagate the species. It forces every
individual to reproduce. That's the only way, otherwise everybody will
disappear; hence it has made it almost compulsory. It is so compulsive
that even if one decides not to go into it, one is driven, in spite of
oneself. And religions have been fighting against this energy for
thousands of years. Their fight has not helped. In fact it has distorted
the natural energies, it has created a very perverted humanity.</p><p>The way to get beyond them is not through fighting, but through
understanding, through awareness, through meditation. Fighting means
repression and whatsoever is repressed will come up again and again. It
is not going to leave you. In fact the more you repress it, the more it
strives to take possession of you. And the effort to fight and repress
creates a dichotomy in you. You become dual,</p><p>divided, schizophrenic. It is because of the so-called religions that
the whole of humanity is living a split life.</p><p>Fighting with oneself is an insane way of living. Your energies are
simply dissipated. They are not used creatively. It is like making both
of your hands fight with each other; what can be the outcome? Do you
think either of your hands is going to win? Both belong to you. You can
pretend that the right has won, but any moment you can also pretend that
the left has won. It is up to you. It is just your decision. It is not
going to give you any victory. It is bound to result in ultimate failure
and frustration.</p><p>Love has to be taken out of the bondage of biology, but fighting
itself, is biological, struggle is biological, and you cannot transcend
biology through biology. It is like wiping mud with more mud. It is
sheer stupidity.</p><p>You have to bring some new element into the world of biology, and
that I call meditation, a ray of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>meditation, a ray of watchfulness. That does not belong to biology at
all, because animals are not aware, trees are not aware. They live in
one-hundred-per cent unconsciousness.</p><p>The moment you start becoming conscious of all your biological
forces, something new has already happened, something non-biological has
penetrated, and that is going to become the source of
transformation.</p><p>Make your lust an object of observation; then it changes into human
love. You have gone beyond the animal. The human is born. Out of one
hundred so-called human beings there is only rarely one human being
ninety-nine per cent are only apparently human, but not really. They
look like human beings, they behave like animals. Their love is animal,
their hate is animal, their violence is animal their anger is animal,
their jealousy is animal, their possessiveness is animal -- all is
animal.</p><p>It is one of the great transformations to become human. One is not
born human; one is born an animal, but with the potential of being
human. And that potential starts functioning only when you bring
awareness in. Immediately awareness functions like a catalytic agent.
Suddenly you are beyond your biology.</p><p>If you can watch, you are no more it -- the watcher is never the
watched -- already you have surpassed, transcended, you are something
above, you are an onlooker, a seer.</p><p>Human love is non-possessive, non-jealous, non -- biological. It has
nothing to do with reproduction. It is a play, a sharing, a fun, a way
of communicating. But still there is one thing in it which has to be
dropped the boundaries. Even in human love the lovers are not one --
they are separate. Everything of the biological has disappeared except
one thing which is not biological and therefore cannot disappear with
the biology --</p><p>that is the ego.</p><p>Animals are not egoistic, neither are trees egoistic. They don't have
the feeling of</p><p>I. It is a human phenomenon. The more you become aware of your
humanity, the more the ego is strengthened; hence the people of great
sensitivity will always be more egoistic. The poets, the painters, the
dancers -- they will be more egoistic than other people, for the simple
reason that ego is a human phenomenon. Now their whole energy is
released from biology and it is exploited by the ego.</p><p>It is better than biology, but it cannot be the ultimate goal,
because if you are surrounded by a boundary you are limited and every
limitation brings misery. One needs to be unlimited, unbounded only then
the imprisoned splendour is released. Then you are as vast as the
universe. And this can happen through love very easily.</p><p>Now the second step is to bring your awareness to the ego; the same
way you brought your awareness to your unconscious instincts and became
free of them, bring your awareness to the ego. Now it has to be more
subtle, because the ego is more invisible, more cunning, more clever. If
you watch it at one point, it will appear at another point. If you are
sitting at the front door it will come from the back door. If you are
watching both doors it will come from the window or it may just remove a
tile from the roof and jump from there! (laughter) Just like Santa Claus
(laughter) coming from the chimney. It will find ways and means</p><p>how to come back again and again.</p><p>One has to be totally aware, not concentrated, not excluding
anything. Awareness has to be inclusive.</p><p>The first awareness was a kind of concentration: you had to be
focussed on your biology because it is a determinate phenomenon, it is
there like an object and it cannot trick you, because it is just part of
chemistry. If you watch it in a focussed way it will remain there. Not
so with the ego: the ego is very elusive. If you watch it here it will
disappear from there and you will feel very good and in that feeling
itself it has come back. You start patting your own back, you say 'Now
it is no more. I have become egoless,' and it has come. It has already
grabbed your neck.</p><p>So one has to be inclusive of all dimensions. One has to be just
aware, open, watchful, simply watchful, not in a concentrated way but in
a relaxed way, so nothing remains hidden. Everything is in a way within
the range of your awareness. Then the ego is transcended. And that very
moment divine love is born. And divine love is the ultimate
experience.</p><p>You can call it god, you can call it nirvana, you can call it
enlightenment -- these are just words to indicate something which is
wordless; but 'love' seems to be the most beautiful word. It has some
poetry in it, some dance in it, some ecstasy in it.</p><p>Man living as an ego lives like an island, separate from the whole;
and that is his anxiety, anguish, because he feels always lonely, feels
always afraid, always worried about death and what is going to happen
tomorrow, worried about safety, security, worried about a thousand and
one things. But the basic problem is created by ourselves. The moment we
think ourselves separate we create all these problems. The separation

true.</p><p>We cannot be separate from the whole. Our life is part of the whole.
Each moment we breathe the whole in and breathe the whole out. The whole
circulates in our blood. We are as rooted in the whole as trees are
rooted in the earth. Of course our roots are invisible, but just don't
breathe for a few minutes and you are gone. That means that breathing
was something like a root which was connecting you with the whole
continuously.</p><p>We are one with the whole. To know it is to be blissful. To
experience it is to go beyond all anguish. But it has to be experienced,
not believed. Belief won't help.</p><p>If you are thirsty you can believe that you are drinking water, but
if you are not really drinking water the thirst is going to grow more
and more. It will spread all over your body. It will kill you. Belief is
not going to help and all the religions have been teaching people to
believe.</p><p>The real thing is to experience; hence my emphasis is on experience,
not on belief. Don't believe what I say. Try to experience it. And
unless <em>you</em> have experienced, resist the temptation to believe;
the temptation is always there because belief is cheap. The mind says
'What is the point of investigating, enquiring, exploring? Why bother?
Just believe! Buddha knows, Jesus knows, Lao Tzu knows, Zarathustra
knows, so what is the point? If they are all saying that it is so, it
<em>must</em> be so.' But if Zarathustra drinks, his thirst is quenched,
not yours. If Zarathustra knows, he knows, not you.</p><p>My sannyasins are not to be believers but experimenters. A tremendous
scientific enquiry into the ultimate reality -- that's what initiation
into sannyas is. It is an adventure. Belief is death, it is a full
point; you simply take it for granted. Somebody says, Somebody
authoritative -- the Bible, the Koran, the Gita --</p><p>and you simply believe the authority. To believe in any authority is
to destroy your own intelligence. All authorities are destructive of
intelligence.</p><p>I am not an authority in <em>that</em> sense. Whatsoever I am saying
I am saying according to my experience --</p><p>that way I am authoritative, but that authority does not mean that
anybody has to believe in it. That simply means: take it as a hypothesis
and then enquire whether it is true or not.</p><p>Being here with me simply means exploring. And if you start exploring
you will</p><p>find. There is no need to believe, because it is so. 'Es dhammo
sanantano' says the Buddha -- this is the truth, the ultimate truth. so
if it is the ultimate truth there is no need to believe; you can
experience it.</p><p>Belief is insisted upon only by people who themselves don't believe,
who themselves don't know. They are afraid of enquiry, they are afraid
of doubt, they are afraid of questions. They repress all
questioning.</p><p>They condemn all doubt. I respect.</p><p>So I have to be just a hypothesis for you. I will give you
hypotheses; then you have to go into enquiry.</p><p>And I know that you will find the truth, because I have found the
truth through the same enquiry; so there is no reason why you are not
going to find it. I trust everybody's intelligence and everybody's
intrinsic potential.</p><p>And the day you discover that you are one with the whole, you have
come home. For the first time you feel blessed, so much so that you can
bless the whole universe.</p><p>Ritam means the law, the ultimate law.</p><p>One can live in two ways: either according to the universal law of
life or against it. That much freedom is a prerogative of human beings.
Going astray is available only to human beings. No dog can go
astray.</p><p>Have you ever seen a dog who is a sinner or a dog who is a saint;
(laughter) Dogs are just dogs, neither sinners nor saints. Have you see
a dog who is less of a dog or a dog who is more of a dog? They are just
doggie, all the same way! (much laughter) But as far as man is
concerned, you can say that this man is not man enough -- a little less
than he should be or a little more than one had expected. You see lesser
men, you see greater men, you see sinners, you see saints. What is the
distinction? What is the criterion? What makes a sinner and what makes a
real saint?</p><p>And when I use the word 'saint' I am not using it in the Christian
way, because the Christian way is the most stupid way of defining
sainthood. The church declares that somebody is a saint, it certifies.
The Christian word 'saint' comes from sanctum, sanctified by the church,
certified by the church. The sanction has</p><p>been given by the pope that this man is a saint. So sometimes they
withdraw their sanctions. Even after hundreds of years -- a man may have
been; for three hundred years and for three hundred years he has been a
saint, worshipped, and then they withdraw sainthood. They find
something. They reopen the case and they withdraw it. And sometimes a
man was burned three hun-dred years before as a sinner and aFter three
hundred years or four hundred years, they decide that it was wrong. The
burning was done by one pope, and 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>then -- the same church and the same authority -- another pope
declares him to be a saint, and he becomes a saint. This is the most
stupid way.</p><p>The true meaning of the word 'saint' comes from the Sanskrit word
'sant', not from the English word</p><p>'sanctum'. The Sanskrit word 'sant' means one who has known the
truth. 'Sat' means truth, and 'sant' means one who has realised it. From
'sant' comes the English word 'saint'. It is exactly the same word, with
just a little change in pronunciation: one who has known the truth, one
who has lived according to the truth, one who has followed the law of
existence, one who has not gone astray.</p><p>But man is free to choose. One can choose to go astray ... and the
ego always wants to do that, because the ego feels good only when you go
astray. Then you are on your own. When you are following the universal
law you are no more there; the law is there. When the dewdrop drops into
the ocean, where is it?</p><p>In a way it is no more, in a way it has become the ocean. But in
every way the old ego is no more in existence, the old boundary is no
more in existence.</p><p>Initiation into sannyas means consciously, deliberately deciding to
follow the law of existence. And how should one know what the law of
existence is? -- it is not written in the books. But there is a natural
criterion given to everybody; whatsoever makes you blissful is an
indication that you are close to the law of existence, whatsoever makes
you miserable is an indication that you are going away from the law of
existence. When you are totally blissful you are one with</p><p>the law and when you are totally miserable you are against the
law.</p><p>Bliss is the criterion. And this small criterion is enough. One
should go on judging; whatsoever makes you blissful is the right thing
to do, to be, and whatsoever makes you miserable is the wrong thing --
it has not to be done.</p><p>I don't give you any commandments -- do this or don't do this. I
simply tell you about the criterion so you can judge for yourself.</p><p>If jealousy makes you blissful (laughter) then follow it totally!
Then that is the divine law! But I have never heard of <em>anybody</em>
becoming blissful through jealousy, or through anger, or through
violence, or through possessiveness, or through greed. These things have
been making people live in hell -- but they cling to them. And by their
clinging they make the hell bigger.</p><p>The moment you feel misery entering in you, be alert! you have taken
the wrong step, you have fallen out of life's law, you are no more in
tune with it.</p><p>Ritam also means rhythm. You have fallen out of rhythm, you have
fallen out of harmony. This is how I define heaven and hell; hell is
totally out of harmony with existence and heaven is totally <em>in</em>
harmony with existence. And everybody has enough intelligence to know
whether he is miserable or blissful.</p><p>Go on choosing the blissful, go on dropping the miserable, and you
will be on the right track towards the ultimate. Then one can be
absolutely certain that he has found true religion.</p><p>Ego is the only undivine thing. Ego is the only evil in the world.
And it is not really an entity; it is just our fantasy, it is just
imagination. It does not exist, it is only a nightmare; but we go on
nourishing it and watering it and then it goes on growing more and more
thorns. No flower ever comes through it. Ego has never brought a single
flower into the world. It only brings thorns. The more you nourish it,
the bigger the thorns. They hurt you, they hurt others. Their whole
function is to hurt. It is not only that they hurt others.</p><p>Before they can hurt others they hurt you because they grow within
you.</p><p>First they penetrate <em>your</em> being, they create wounds in you,
and then you start creating wounds in others out of revenge.</p><p>The miserable person creates misery all around. He wants everybody to
be miserable. That's the only thing that gives him a little bit of
happiness. If he can see everybody miserable, <em>more</em> miserable
than he is then certainly, according to the law of relativity, according
to Albert Einstein, he feels good and happy and blissful.</p><p>The ego never wants anybody to be blissful because that hurts very
much. The miserable person creates misery, the blissful person create;
bliss. we create only ourselves, because we can share only ourselves.
for a sannyasin, the only thing to be dropped, the only thing to be
renounced, is the eJo. And it is nothing; just a soap bubble, a little
hot air. A pinprick is enough, and it is finished. One just has to
decide to get rid of it.</p><p>And if you can see what it has done to you and to others, you are
<em>bound</em> to decide to get rid of it, because it has never given
anybody any bliss, it is pure poison. And when there is no ego inside
you a tremendous emptiness, a great emptiness comes in, spaciousness,
nothingness. There is nobody inside, just a pure awareness, which is not
somebody, which has no I as a centre to it. It is meeting and merging
with the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>whole. That's the ultimate goal of sannyas; to merge with the whole,
to become one with the whole.</p><p>There are two kings of purity, two kinds of virtue, two kinds of
morality. One is the cultivated kind, from the outside -- you have to
practise it. It is a conditioning. Deep down you remain the same but you
cover yourself with a beautiful facade. It is a superficial thing that
can be scratched very easily and your reality will come rushing towards
the surface.</p><p>You were smiling and you were all grace and somebody insults you;
suddenly all grace is gone and all smiling is gone and the animal inside
you takes possession. And you start doing things which you would not
have ever thought you were capable of. And later on you will repent and
you will say 'How did it happen? --</p><p>I don't know.'</p><p>This cultivated kind of virtue, purity, morality has created a
division in man, between the circumference and the centre; and this
division is one of the most dangerous situations, because no man can be
at ease.</p><p>It creates tensions. You cannot be yourself because you are two --
how can you be yourself? If you decide to follow the circumference, the
centre becomes neglected, ignored, rejected; and it takes revenge. If
you follow the centre, the circumference is angry, as if you have been
programmed by two diametrically opposite programmes.</p><p>One you have brought from nature and one has been put on you by the
society, so you are always in a state of conflict and inner turmoil.
This is hell.</p><p>The second kind of purity, virtue and morality is not the cultivated
one. I emphasise the second kind. It comes through meditation, not
through cultivation. You simply have to become aware of your innermost
core, you have to relax towards your centre. You have to settle at the
centre and bring awareness there. You have to be fully alert at the
centre, and that very alertness at the centre transforms the centre.
Awareness is the greatest transforming agent in the world; nothing has
ever surpassed it.</p><p>It is just like light; you bring the light in the room and all the
darkness is gone. When you become aware at the centre your whole being
is full of light, and out of that light your circumference acts. Then
there is a unity, no conflict; and that unity is true sanity, true
health, true wholeness. And that wholeness brings great ecstasy, great
benediction.</p><p>So never follow the circumference because the centre is <em>very</em>
powerful. You cannot drag the centre behind the circumference, but if
your centre is transformed the circumference follows it naturally, like
a shadow. Then there is no problem at all.</p><p>All the religions have been teaching the first kind of morality --
that's where I differ. I teach a totally different kind of virtue which
arises as a natural consequence of centering, grounding, awareness.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Ten days more.</p><p>-- Then come back again. Ten days are good for ten commandments, but
not for</p><p>my <span class=p>kind of... (The rest of the sentence is lost in
laughter.) Good! Devagyan means divine knowing.</span></p><p>Animals don't know. Man knows but his knowing is only information,
accumulation of facts, accumulation of theories, ideologies,
philosophies -- it is all borrowed. And the borrowed always becomes a
burden. It never brings freedom.</p><p>By 'divine knowing' I mean you have to know your own. You are
<em>not</em> to become knowledgeable.</p><p>Knowledgeability is a hindrance for known; because it gives you a
false sense of knowing. It is a false coin.</p><p>And one can believe in it; then one never enquires about the real
coin.</p><p>Scholars are farther away from truth than anybody else. Even sinners
are not so far away. I have seen both great sinners and great scholars.
The sinners are almost always more innocent than the scholars. They are
simple people. They are not very far away from the world of truth. But
the scholar is very far away. He is too much in his head. He thinks he
knows and he knows nothing.</p><p>Sannyas begins in dropping the idea of knowledge. Sannyas begins in
remembering what Socrates says:</p><p>'I know only one thing, that I know nothing' -- that is the beginning
of sannyas. Because when you know nothing then immediately a tremendous
desire and longing arise in you to know. And if you have dropped all
borrowed knowledge, then the only dimension left open is to enter into
your own inner world, into your own interiority, into your own
consciousness.</p><p>And as you go deeper in it, your knowing becomes more and more clear.
When you have reached to the very core of your being, suddenly light
explodes. Hence the word 'enlightenment'; enlightenment is true

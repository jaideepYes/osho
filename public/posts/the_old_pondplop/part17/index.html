It is for reference purposes only.]\nMeditation basically is nothing but a state of total awareness. Our mind is only partially aware; only one tenth of our totality is conscious, nine-tenths is in a deep dark night. All our problems arise out of that darkness, that blindness. And it is nine times more than our awareness. The so-called religions, moralities, go on trying to cultivate that fragment of consciousness.\nYou can teach, you can programme that small fragment of consciousness but it will remain superficial.\nIn times of stress it won't help. One will remain very polite and humble, but only when everything is going good. When things start going wrong then suddenly all the repressed anger, violence, overwhelms one.\nThen the cultivated morality, the facade of character is of no use at all. That's why people do things which you never thought they could do. A very good man, a nice man, in every w!ay respected, can commit murder. He himself will not be able to believe how he could do it; hence the phrase 'in spite of myself.' It is a retrospective thinking later on when he comes back to his superficial consciousness he can see that he has 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndone it in spite of himself, because he is identified only with the conscious part. He has rejected the unconscious and that is nine times more.\nThat is our true reality, it cannot be rejected; and by cultivating the conscious part it remains unaffected, it remains the same. Hence my approach is not through character but through meditation.\nThe most fundamental thing is to make our consciousness bigger, to change the unconscious into consciousness -- that is true religion. That's what the whole purpose of alchemy was: the transformation of darkness into light, of the baser metal into gold. The gold represents light. And it is possible if you start becoming aware of what you are doing, of what you are thinking, of what you are feeling -- just an undercurrent of awareness of all these three dimensions -- then slowly slowly awareness deepens. More and more parts of the unconscious are claimed by consciousness.\nAnd once you have learned the knack of changing the unconscious into consciousness, then it is only a question of time, effort, patience. Then the day is not far away when the whole of unconsciousness disappears and your inner world is full of light. Then whatsoever you do is moral, whatsoever happens through you is virtue -- and that virtue is not cultivated at all. It is spontaneous. And when it is spontaneous it has a beauty of its own. When it is cultivated it is pseudo, phony. It creates only hypocrites, and that's why the whole world is full of hypocrites.\nIt is not their fault; it is ten thousand years of stupidity perpetuated in the name of religion. Religion should be simply an alchemical process of transforming unconsciousness into consciousness.\nA man without meditation is windowless, utterly closed to existence. No sun, no wind, no rain, reaches him. He lives almost in a grave. He is not alive.\nYou are alive only in the proportion to which you are vulnerable, open. The more alive you are, the more windows you have, the more doors you have; and you\nare totally alive when you are just under the sun, under the sky, utterly naked, with nothing to keep you isolated, to keep you encapsulated. And that's the function of meditation to create windows in you. In the beginning, windows, then doors; then by and by all the walls disappear. One day you find yourself for the first time merging, melting, into the whole.\nThat's the ultimate experience of bliss. But the beginning is in creating a small window; then go on making it bigger and bigger and bigger, so one day there is only window left. All the doors, all the walls, everything has disappeared. When there is nothing to disconnect you from existence, nothing to debar you, you experience godliness.\nMeditation gives you unbounded space. It makes you as vast as the ocean. Without it one is only a dewdrop, confined into a very small space, imprisoned. And that's our misery, that wherever we try to move there is a limitation. The body limits us, the mind limits us, even the heart limits us.\nOne has to go beyond the body, beyond the mind, beyond the heart. Only then, these three concentric circles transcended, you become as vast as existence itself. You are no more in that vastness. You cannot be the way you have always been; there is no ego.\nThe ego can exist only in the dewdrop. The ocean means egolessness. The moment you are infinite, you taste the truth for the first time; otherwise whatsoever we go on thinking about truth is not truth. Thinking about truth can never be truth. Truth is a taste on the tongue. The person who has never tasted sweetness may go on thinking about it for millions of years; still, he will not know what it is.\nThe blind man can think know light but all his thinking is futile. He may write a thesis, a great thesis, on light, he may be awarded a Ph.D. or a D. Lit., but still because he is blind he knows nothing of light. All his knowledge is mere knowledge, not knowing.\nTruth has to be known. No information can be of any help. it is an existential experience and the only way to know it is to become it -- to digest it and to be digested by it. Only in that union where I and thou disappear, where all dualities melt and become one, one knows. That state I call oceanic. That is the goal of sannyas.\nOne has to come out of the confinement of a dewdrop and become the ocean. One has to allow one's dewdrop to slip into the ocean and disappear into the ocean. To be one with the whole is the only way to be holy.\nMeditation is the essence of all true religion. Everything other than meditation is nothing but ritual. It is good for deceiving people, it is good for exploiting the fools, it is very good for the priests; the popes, the imams, but it is not religion. And a very strange thing is that all the vested interests are against meditation.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThey are all for going to the church, to the temple, to the mosque. They are all in support of reading the Bible every day, or the GITA, reciting it again and again and again but they are not in favour of meditation, because they have become aware again and again down the ages that the meditative person becomes a rebel.\nThe meditative person becomes so intelligent that he cannot be exploited and oppressed. The meditative person becomes so full of life that he cannot be repressed, crippled, paralysed. He becomes so full of bliss and joy that you cannot make him afraid and you cannot make him greedy either; so your hell and heaven both become superstitions for the meditative person, because hell is nothing but exploitation of fear and heaven is exploitation of greed -- two sides of the same coin. Because people are living in fear and in greed, the priest has invented hell and heaven; otherwise there is no hell, no heaven.\nThere is life eternal. And if you are silent, meditative, this very moment you are in paradise. And if you have song astray from your own centre, if you are no more centred in your being, you are in hell. Hell simply means living a life unconsciously and heaven means living a life consciously.\nAll the religions are afraid of meditation because it gives you the taste of paradise herenow and they all depend on a paradise after death; so you and your life can be postponed. Heaven will be after death and right now you have to live a meaningless life. So they go on giving you hope and hope is nothing but\nopium.\nMeditation means becoming so aware, so intensely aware, now, this very moment, that all these stupidities are seen as stupidities, and the moment you see something as false you are free of it. Not only that, there is even more danger for the vested interests, for the establishment; the person who has come to know the false as the false and the true as the true does not remain hidden. He cannot remain hidden. He has to share his experience. He has to spread his fire.\nAnd that fire can burn all the temples and all the churches and all the mosques. The meditative person will not be Christian, will not be Hindu, will not be Buddhist, will not be Mohammedan. He will simply be human. Hence the Christians will be against him, the Hindus will be against him, all the organised religions will be against him. He will not be a Christian of course; he will be a Christ. He will not be a Buddhist but he will be a Buddha -- and that is dangerous.\nThe Buddhists don't want another Buddha to be here, because the latest Buddha is bound to change the twenty -- five-centuries-old scriptures of the Buddhists, because he will speak the idiom of the day, he will speak in the context of the contemporary humanity.\nChristians will not like Christ to be here again. He will destroy all their business; hence nobody is in favour of meditation -- and meditation is the essential core of religion. In other words all religions are against religion, against the true religion, against the essential religiousness. And my effort here is to make you aware that rituals are not religion, that scriptures are not religion, that belonging to a certain sect is not religion. Religiousness is a totally different phenomenon: it is the experience of your own being.\nKnowing it, all is known.\nMind separates, meditation unites. Mind functions as a wall, meditation functions as a bridge.\nMeditation simply means a state of no-mind; slipping out of the mind and the games of the mind is the whole art of meditation. And it is not a difficult thing -- we have just never tried it, that's why it appears difficult. We have always lived in the mind so we don't know that there is a way to live beyond the mind too.\nOnce you have taken even a single step out of the mind you will be surprised; you were living unnecessarily in a prison. There was nobody guarding the door, you were not chained, you were just not aware that there is a beyond too. And the way out of the mind is to become aware of the mind and its mechanism, memory, imagination, thoughts, desires, fantasies -- the traffic is there, continuously going on.\nYou have just to stand by the side and watch whatsoever is passing, with no judgement, with no evaluation; just a silent mirror reflecting whatsoever is passing by. Not even making any comments that this is good, this is bad, that this is not so good, that this should not be or should be -- without any commentary, just watching.\nIn the beginning it seems difficult because our habit is of continuously commenting, but just a little patience, sitting silently, doing nothing, just watching; it comes. And when it comes it opens a totally new dimension. You can see the whole mind passing by and than you know that you are not the mind, because the one who is seeing the mind passing by cannot be the mind. The observer cannot be the observed -- and that is the moment you are out of the mind. That is the moment a tremendous freedom comes. One is no more confined to anything. The imprisoned splendour is released; and life begins only then. Before that we 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare just living a so-called life, lukewarm, with no intensity, with no passion, with no totality.\nMan lives mechanically, just like a sleep-walker, a somnambulist; he goes on doing things but almost like a robot. If you start watching your acts you will be surprised that you go on making the same mistakes every day. And you have decided many times not to do them again, but those decisions are meaningless.\nWhen the situation arises aGain, you react immediately in the old pattern. You don't know how to respond.\nThese two words are significant. 'Reaction' means mechanical, unconscious and 'response' means non-mechanical, conscious. 'Response' means acting according to the situation and 'reaction' means acting according to the old pattern. reaction means following ready-made answers, following a built-in programme, being dictated and dominated by the past -- that is reaction. And living in the moment, in the moment, with no interference from the past, is response.\nA sannyasin has to be responsible in this sense, not in a moralistic sense, not in the sense of being dutiful, but in the sense of being conscious. To be conscious means acting out of the light of awareness; otherwise people are acting out of darkness -- stumbling, groping. Yes, once in a while just accidentally they can do something right, but that is accidental. It has no value at all.\nNinety-nine per cent they will do wrong. One percent, accidentally, they will do right; but accidental right has no value. It is not virtue.\nOne has to be full of light. And when there is light you know where the door is, you need not stumble.\nYou know where the furniture is, you need not stumble. You know exactly what is what and you act according to that understanding.\nMeditation creates light within you. Without meditation one is living in a dark night of the soul. And the strange thing is that we have all the things necessary to create light.\nIn a Sufi story, a man is hungry. He has flour, he has water, he has butter, he has fuel, he has fire, he has everything -- he can make bread. But he is just sitting there hungry, because he cannot eat the fuel, he cannot eat the flour, he cannot eat all these things which only need to be put in a certain combination.\nOnce they are put in a certain combination they will become eatable.\nWe are born with everything; that is needed to create light, but you have to use a little intelligence to put everything in its right place. And that's what meditation is: putting things in their right place. And once they are in the right place a great harmony arises. Once life becomes such a deep accord, so full of music, so full of joy, so full of light, out of that joy, that music, that light, whatsoever you do is right.\nSo I don't teach you to do right. I only teach you to create the light... then right follows! (laughter) It is inevitable.\nThere is a vast difference between satisfaction and contentment.\nSatisfaction is something invented. In the old fable of Aesop, the fox says that the grapes are sour, because he can't reach those grapes -- that is finding some consolation.\nWhen people cannot reach they have to create a certain consolation around themselves. That consolation is satisfaction, that consolation functions like buffers.\nBetween two compartments in a train there are buffers so that if some accident happens the compartments don't crash into each other. Those buffers are shock absorbers.\nOr just like in a car, there are springs so that you don't feel the bumps -- particularly on an Indian road --\nthose springs help; they absorb the shocks. A little bit of it reaches to you end if you are also using an Indian car, then much of it reaches to you! Indian cars are made especially for Indian roads; they fit together.\nBut with good buffers, imported buffers, you can avoid many bumps on the road. Exactly the same is the case with our inner world: there are so many shocks in life.\nYou want money and you cannot get it, and you want power and you cannot get it -- because there is always a power shortage, (laughter)... gas shortage... everything is in shortage. There are many more consumers and everything is in shortage. And how many people can be prime ministers and presidents?\nNow this country has seven hundred million people and only one person can be the president. So seven hundred million people minus one are going to be shocked! (laughter) They have to find some consolation, they have to create some satisfaction. They can say, 'Who cares? I am not interested in power politics. I don't want to become a politician. All these dirty politicians... I am a simple man, a humble man, and I am perfectly satisfied with my life. These are creating buffers.\nThis helps you to carry on the routine life but this is not contentment; there is no joy in it, because deep down you know that it is only a deception. You can deceive others but how can you deceive yourself? You 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncan go on hypnotizing yourself just as Christian Scientists do: they are ill, they know they are ill, but they go on saying I am not ill, illness is all false, that illness is only of the mind. They can go on repeating morning evening, day in day out, but in fact the very fact that they are repeating again and again 'I am not sick,' is enough proof that they know they are sick.\nIn one story a young man met a Christian Scientist and the Christian Scientist asked, 'I have not seen your father for many days. Where is he?' And the young man said, 'He is very sick.' And the Christian Scientist said, 'He is not sick. He only thinks he is sick.'\nAfter one month he again met the young man and said, 'What about your father? And the young man said, 'Nothing much, now he thinks he is dead!' (much laughter) This type of tomfoolery, this kind of idiotic ideology has dominated humanity for centuries. People go on trying to befool themselves. Now he is befooling himself that he is dead...!\nPeople don't want to accept facts. They create fictions around themselves. Even if a person dies, people don't say directly that he is dead; they say 'he has gone to the heavenly abode', or that 'he has become god's beloved'... So what was he before that? People want to avoid facts, and they create smoke around themselves. That is not contentment.\nContentment is a totally different phenomenon. It happens only to the meditator, only the meditator becomes so blissful, so peaceful, because he has arrived! There is nowhere to go. He has found his home!\nHe has experienced the ultimate significance of there is nothing, more than that. He has touched the optimum, and out of that bliss is contentment.\nSo contentment is not something one can cultivate; it is a by-product of meditation. And one should not cultivate satisfaction, because that will keep you away from contentment. It is better to destroy all satisfaction and all consolations; it is better to realise facts as they ares illness is illness and death is death.\nAnd if you cannot reach the grapes, better to say 'I cannot reach,' because then some way can be found to reach. Don't go on deceiving others and yourself that they are sour.\nSo I am all for reality. My approach is pragmatic.\nI am a realist, not an idealist. I don't believe in all that hocus-pocus. And to be my sannyasin means to be utterly realistic, pragmatic, grounded in the Earth. And because one is grounded one starts growing like a tree into the sky towards the stars, and then there is immense contentment.\nMeditation is a process of rebirth. The first birth is only physiological, biological material. Don't think that that's all there is to life. Coming out of the womb of the mother is only an opportunity for a second birth, for the real birth. The day you come out of the womb of your psychology, you are really born.\nIn India we have called the people who have known the truth, twice born, dwija. And unless one becomes twice born, one lives in vain.\nLife has to be used as a jumping board for the beyond. It is an immense opportunity, but very few people have used it up to now. Once in a while a Jesus, a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Zarathustra, a Bahauddin --\nonly once in a while a few people have used this life for reaching to a higher plane, to another life.\nAll that is needed is that you have to die to your past; only then you can be born anew. The child has to leave the womb, and he is going on an unknown journey, uncharted. He knows nothing about what is going to happen. He has no idea, no map, no guide. And for nine months he has lived very comfortably, in a cosy world, almost asleep, and his every need was fulfilled -- no worry, no responsibility, no struggle, no anxiety, no anguish, no questions, no problems. He had lived the most comfortable and luxurious life that he will ever live. And it is going to be finished. But the child comes out of the mother's womb because the\nwomb, howsoever comfortable it is, is dark, meaningless. It is not life. There is no adventure.\nAnd without adventure. There is no possibility of life.\nThe child enters into the world of adventures, but that is nothing compared to the second birth.\nIf you die to your mind... mind means the past, all that you have accumulated in the past. Mind is nothing but a memory system. If you die to the past then you enter really into the greatest adventure there is: you are reborn. That's true resurrection, and it happens through meditation. Both things happens: dying to the past happens and birth to the present. And the present continues into the future. It contains the whole future.\nThe past is a barrier. Unless one is courageous enough to die to the past one cannot be rewarded by true life. And this death has to happen each moment, because each moment we are creating the past. It is not that once you have died to the past the whole thing is finished. After twenty-four hours again twenty-four 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhours of the past will be with you. You have to die each moment -- why accumulate it? Each moment, be finished with it, so you are always fresh and new and in tune with existence. You are never lagging behind.\nAnd when one is not lagging behind there is great celebration. You are in a dance with existence, utterly attuned, a kind of at-onement.

mind is only partially aware; only one tenth of our totality is
conscious, nine-tenths is in a deep dark night. All our problems arise
out of that darkness, that blindness. And it is nine times more than our
awareness. The so-called religions, moralities, go on trying to
cultivate that fragment of consciousness.</p><p>You can teach, you can programme that small fragment of consciousness
but it will remain superficial.</p><p>In times of stress it won't help. One will remain very polite and
humble, but only when everything is going good. When things start going
wrong then suddenly all the repressed anger, violence, overwhelms
one.</p><p>Then the cultivated morality, the facade of character is of no use at
all. That's why people do things which you never thought they could do.
A <em>very</em> good man, a nice man, in every w!ay respected, can
commit murder. He himself will not be able to believe how he could do
it; hence the phrase 'in spite of myself.' It is a retrospective
thinking later on when he comes back to his superficial consciousness he
can see that he has 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

conscious part. He has rejected the unconscious and that is nine times
more.</p><p>That is our true reality, it cannot be rejected; and by cultivating
the conscious part it remains unaffected, it remains the same. Hence my
approach is not through character but through meditation.</p><p>The most fundamental thing is to make our consciousness bigger, to
change the unconscious into consciousness -- that is true religion.
That's what the whole purpose of alchemy was: the transformation of
darkness into light, of the baser metal into gold. The gold represents
light. And it is possible if you start becoming aware of what you are
doing, of what you are thinking, of what you are feeling -- just an
undercurrent of awareness of all these three dimensions -- then slowly
slowly awareness deepens. More and more parts of the unconscious are
claimed by consciousness.</p><p>And once you have learned the knack of changing the unconscious into
consciousness, then it is only a question of time, effort, patience.
Then the day is not far away when the whole of unconsciousness
disappears and your inner world is full of light. Then whatsoever you do
is moral, whatsoever happens through you is virtue -- and that virtue is
not cultivated at all. It is spontaneous. And when it is spontaneous it
has a beauty of its own. When it is cultivated it is pseudo, phony. It
creates only hypocrites, and that's why the whole world is full of
hypocrites.</p><p>It is not their fault; it is ten thousand years of stupidity
perpetuated in the name of religion. Religion should be simply an
alchemical process of transforming unconsciousness into
consciousness.</p><p>A man without meditation is windowless, utterly closed to existence.
No sun, no wind, no rain, reaches him. He lives almost in a grave. He is
not alive.</p><p>You are alive only in the proportion to which you are vulnerable,
open. The more alive you are, the more windows you have, the more doors
you have; and you</p><p>are totally alive when you are just under the sun, under the sky,
utterly naked, with nothing to keep you isolated, to keep you
encapsulated. And that's the function of meditation to create windows in
you. In the beginning, windows, then doors; then by and by all the walls
disappear. One day you find yourself for the first time merging,
melting, into the whole.</p><p>That's the ultimate experience of bliss. But the beginning is in
creating a small window; then go on making it bigger and bigger and
bigger, so one day there is only window left. All the doors, all the
walls, everything has disappeared. When there is nothing to disconnect
you from existence, nothing to debar you, you experience godliness.</p><p>Meditation gives you unbounded space. It makes you as vast as the
ocean. Without it one is only a dewdrop, confined into a very small
space, imprisoned. And that's our misery, that wherever we try to move
there is a limitation. The body limits us, the mind limits us, even the
heart limits us.</p><p>One has to go beyond the body, beyond the mind, beyond the heart.
Only then, these three concentric circles transcended, you become as
vast as existence itself. You are no more in that vastness. You cannot
be the way you have always been; there is no ego.</p><p>The ego can exist only in the dewdrop. The ocean means egolessness.
The moment you are infinite, you taste the truth for the first time;
otherwise whatsoever we go on thinking about truth is not truth.
Thinking about truth can never be truth. Truth is a taste on the tongue.
The person who has never tasted sweetness may go on thinking about it
for millions of years; still, he will not know what it is.</p><p>The blind man can think know light but all his thinking is futile. He
may write a thesis, a great thesis, <em>on</em> light, he may be awarded
a Ph.D. or a D. Lit., but still because he is blind he knows nothing of
light. All his knowledge is <em>mere</em> knowledge, not knowing.</p><p>Truth has to be known. No information can be of any help. it is an
existential experience and the only way to know it is to become it -- to
digest it and to be digested by it. Only in that union where I and thou
disappear, where all dualities melt and become one, one knows. That
state I call oceanic. That is the goal of sannyas.</p><p>One has to come out of the confinement of a dewdrop and become the
ocean. One has to allow one's dewdrop to slip into the ocean and
disappear into the ocean. To be one with the whole is the only way to be
holy.</p><p>Meditation is the essence of all true religion. Everything other than
meditation is nothing but ritual. It is good for deceiving people, it is
good for exploiting the fools, it is very good for the priests; the
popes, the imams, but it is not religion. And a very strange thing is
that all the vested interests are against meditation.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

They are all in support of reading the Bible every day, or the GITA,
reciting it again and again and again but they are not in favour of
meditation, because they have become aware again and again down the ages
that the meditative person becomes a rebel.</p><p>The meditative person becomes so intelligent that he cannot be
exploited and oppressed. The meditative person becomes so full of life
that he cannot be repressed, crippled, paralysed. He becomes so full of
bliss and joy that you cannot make him afraid and you cannot make him
greedy either; so your hell and heaven both become superstitions for the
meditative person, because hell is nothing but exploitation of fear and
heaven is exploitation of greed -- two sides of the same coin. Because
people <em>are</em> living in fear and in greed, the priest has invented
hell and heaven; otherwise there is no hell, no heaven.</p><p>There is life eternal. And if you are silent, meditative,
<em>this</em> very moment you are in paradise. And if you have song
astray from your own centre, if you are no more centred in your being,
you are in hell. Hell simply means living a life unconsciously and
heaven means living a life consciously.</p><p>All the religions are afraid of meditation because it gives you the
taste of paradise herenow and they all depend on a paradise
<em>after</em> death; so you and your life can be postponed. Heaven will
be after death and right now you have to live a meaningless life. So
they go on giving you hope and hope is nothing but</p><p>opium.</p><p>Meditation means becoming so aware, so intensely aware, now, this
very moment, that all these stupidities are seen as stupidities, and the
moment you see something as false you are free of it. Not only that,
there is even more danger for the vested interests, for the
establishment; the person who has come to know the false as the false
and the true as the true does not remain hidden. He cannot remain
hidden. He has to share his experience. He has to spread his fire.</p><p>And that fire can burn all the temples and all the churches and all
the mosques. The meditative person will not be Christian, will not be
Hindu, will not be Buddhist, will not be Mohammedan. He will simply be
human. Hence the Christians will be against him, the Hindus will be
against him, <em>all</em> the organised religions will be against him.
He will not be a Christian of course; he will be a Christ. He will not
be a Buddhist but he will be a Buddha -- and that is dangerous.</p><p>The Buddhists don't want another Buddha to be here, because the
latest Buddha is bound to change the twenty -- five-centuries-old
scriptures of the Buddhists, because he will speak the idiom of the day,
he will speak in the context of the contemporary humanity.</p><p>Christians will not like Christ to be here again. He will destroy all
their business; hence nobody is in favour of meditation -- and
meditation is the essential core of religion. In other words all
religions are against religion, against the true religion, against the
essential religiousness. And my effort here is to make you aware that
rituals are not religion, that scriptures are not religion, that
belonging to a certain sect is not religion. Religiousness is a totally
different phenomenon: it is the experience of your own being.</p><p>Knowing it, all is known.</p><p>Mind separates, meditation unites. Mind functions as a wall,
meditation functions as a bridge.</p><p>Meditation simply means a state of no-mind; slipping out of the mind
and the games of the mind is the whole art of meditation. And it is not
a difficult thing -- we have just never tried it, that's why it appears
difficult. We have always lived in the mind so we don't know that there
is a way to live beyond the mind too.</p><p>Once you have taken even a single step out of the mind you will be
surprised; you were living unnecessarily in a prison. There was nobody
guarding the door, you were not chained, you were just not aware that
there is a beyond too. And the way out of the mind is to become aware of
the mind and its mechanism, memory, imagination, thoughts, desires,
fantasies -- the traffic is there, continuously going on.</p><p>You have just to stand by the side and watch whatsoever is passing,
with no judgement, with no evaluation; just a silent mirror reflecting
whatsoever is passing by. Not even making any comments that this is
good, this is bad, that this is not so good, that this should not be or
should be -- without any commentary, just watching.</p><p>In the beginning it seems difficult because our habit is of
continuously commenting, but just a little patience, sitting silently,
doing nothing, just watching; it comes. And when it comes it opens a
totally new dimension. You can see the whole mind passing by and than
you know that you are not the mind, because the one who is seeing the
mind passing by cannot be the mind. The observer cannot be the observed
-- and that is the moment you are out of the mind. That is the moment a
tremendous freedom comes. One is no more confined to anything. The
imprisoned splendour is released; and life begins only then. Before that

no passion, with no totality.</p><p>Man lives mechanically, just like a sleep-walker, a somnambulist; he
goes on doing things but almost like a robot. If you start watching your
acts you will be surprised that you go on making the same mistakes every
day. And you have decided many times not to do them again, but those
decisions are meaningless.</p><p>When the situation arises aGain, you react immediately in the old
pattern. You don't know how to respond.</p><p>These two words are significant. 'Reaction' means mechanical,
unconscious and 'response' means non-mechanical, conscious. 'Response'
means acting according to the situation and 'reaction' means acting
according to the old pattern. reaction means following ready-made
answers, following a built-in programme, being dictated and dominated by
the past -- that is reaction. And living <em>in</em> the moment,
<em>in</em> the moment, with no interference from the past, is
response.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be responsible in this sense, not in a moralistic
sense, not in the sense of being dutiful, but in the sense of being
conscious. To be conscious means acting out of the light of awareness;
otherwise people are acting out of darkness -- stumbling, groping. Yes,
once in a while just accidentally they can do something right, but that
is accidental. It has no value at all.</p><p>Ninety-nine per cent they will do wrong. One percent, accidentally,
they will do right; but accidental right has no value. It is not
virtue.</p><p>One has to be full of light. And when there is light you know where
the door is, you need not stumble.</p><p>You know where the furniture is, you need not stumble. You know
exactly what is what and you act according to that understanding.</p><p>Meditation creates light within you. Without meditation one is living
in a dark night of the soul. And the strange thing is that we have all
the things necessary to create light.</p><p>In a Sufi story, a man is hungry. He has flour, he has water, he has
butter, he has fuel, he has fire, he has everything -- he can make
bread. But he is just sitting there hungry, because he cannot eat the
fuel, he cannot eat the flour, he cannot eat all these things which only
need to be put in a certain combination.</p><p>Once they are put in a certain combination they will become
eatable.</p><p>We are born with everything; that is needed to create light, but you
have to use a little intelligence to put everything in its right place.
And that's what meditation is: putting things in their right place. And
once they are in the right place a great harmony arises. Once life
becomes such a deep accord, so full of music, so full of joy, so full of
light, out of that joy, that music, that light, whatsoever you do is
right.</p><p>So I don't teach you to do right. I only teach you to create the
light... then right follows! (laughter) It is inevitable.</p><p>There is a vast difference between satisfaction and contentment.</p><p>Satisfaction is something invented. In the old fable of Aesop, the
fox says that the grapes are sour, because he can't reach those grapes
-- that is finding some consolation.</p><p>When people cannot reach they have to create a certain consolation
around themselves. That consolation is satisfaction, that consolation
functions like buffers.</p><p>Between two compartments in a train there are buffers so that if some
accident happens the compartments don't crash into each other. Those
buffers are shock absorbers.</p><p>Or just like in a car, there are springs so that you don't feel the
bumps -- particularly on an Indian road --</p><p>those springs help; they absorb the shocks. A little bit of it
reaches to you end if you are also using an Indian car, then much of it
reaches to you! Indian cars are made especially for Indian roads; they
fit together.</p><p>But with good buffers, imported buffers, you can avoid many bumps on
the road. Exactly the same is the case with our inner world: there are
so many shocks in life.</p><p>You want money and you cannot get it, and you want power and you
cannot get it -- because there is always a power shortage, (laughter)...
gas shortage... <em>everything</em> is in shortage. There are many more
consumers and everything is in shortage. And how many people can be
prime ministers and presidents?</p><p>Now this country has seven hundred million people and only one person
can be the president. So seven hundred million people minus one are
going to be shocked! (laughter) They have to find some consolation, they
have to create some satisfaction. They can say, 'Who cares? I am not
interested in power politics. I don't want to become a politician. All
these dirty politicians... I am a simple man, a humble man, and I am
perfectly satisfied with my life. These are creating buffers.</p><p>This helps you to carry on the routine life but this is not
contentment; there is no joy in it, because deep down you know that it
is only a deception. You can deceive others but how can you deceive
yourself? You 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

are ill, they <em>know</em> they are ill, but they go on saying I am not
ill, illness is all false, that illness is only of the mind. They can go
on repeating morning evening, day in day out, but in fact the
<em>very</em> fact that they are repeating again and again 'I am not
sick,' is enough proof that they know they are sick.</p><p>In one story a young man met a Christian Scientist and the Christian
Scientist asked, 'I have not seen your father for many days. Where is
he?' And the young man said, 'He is very sick.' And the Christian
Scientist said, 'He is not sick. He only thinks he is sick.'</p><p>After one month he again met the young man and said, 'What about your
father? And the young man said, 'Nothing much, now he thinks he is
dead!' (much laughter) This type of tomfoolery, this kind of idiotic
ideology has dominated humanity for centuries. People go on trying to
befool themselves. Now he is befooling himself that he is dead...!</p><p>People don't want to accept facts. They create fictions around
themselves. Even if a person dies, people don't say directly that he is
dead; they say 'he has gone to the heavenly abode', or that 'he has
become god's beloved'... So what was he before that? People want to
avoid facts, and they create smoke around themselves. That is not
contentment.</p><p>Contentment is a totally different phenomenon. It happens only to the
meditator, only the meditator becomes so blissful, so peaceful, because
he has arrived! There is nowhere to go. He has found his home!</p><p>He has experienced the ultimate significance of there is nothing,
more than that. He has touched the optimum, and out of that bliss is
contentment.</p><p>So contentment is not something one can cultivate; it is a by-product
of meditation. And one should not cultivate satisfaction, because that
will keep you away from contentment. It is better to destroy all
satisfaction and all consolations; it is better to realise facts as they
ares illness is illness and death is death.</p><p>And if you cannot reach the grapes, better to say 'I cannot reach,'
because then some way can be found to reach. Don't go on deceiving
others and yourself that they are sour.</p><p>So I am all for reality. My approach is pragmatic.</p><p>I am a realist, not an idealist. I don't believe in all that
hocus-pocus. And to be my sannyasin means to be utterly realistic,
pragmatic, grounded in the Earth. And because one is grounded one starts
growing like a tree into the sky towards the stars, and then there is
immense contentment.</p><p>Meditation is a process of rebirth. The first birth is only
physiological, biological material. Don't think that that's all there is
to life. Coming out of the womb of the mother is only an opportunity for
a second birth, for the real birth. The day you come out of the womb of
your psychology, you are really born.</p><p>In India we have called the people who have known the truth, twice
born, dwija. And unless one becomes twice born, one lives in vain.</p><p>Life has to be used as a jumping board for the beyond. It is an
immense opportunity, but very few people have used it up to now. Once in
a while a Jesus, a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Zarathustra, a Bahauddin --</p><p>only once in a while a few people have used this life for reaching to
a higher plane, to another life.</p><p>All that is needed is that you have to die to your past; only then
you can be born anew. The child has to leave the womb, and he is going
on an unknown journey, uncharted. He knows nothing about what is going
to happen. He has no idea, no map, no guide. And for nine months he has
lived very comfortably, in a cosy world, almost asleep, and his every
need was fulfilled -- no worry, no responsibility, no struggle, no
anxiety, no anguish, no questions, no problems. He had lived the most
comfortable and luxurious life that he will ever live. And it is going
to be finished. But the child comes out of the mother's womb because
the</p><p>womb, howsoever comfortable it is, is dark, meaningless. It is not
life. There is no adventure.</p><p>And without adventure. There is no possibility of life.</p><p>The child enters into the world of adventures, but that is nothing
compared to the second birth.</p><p>If you die to your mind... mind means the past, all that you have
accumulated in the past. Mind is nothing but a memory system. If you die
to the past then you enter really into the greatest adventure there is:
you are reborn. That's true resurrection, and it happens through
meditation. Both things happens: dying to the past happens and birth to
the present. And the present continues into the future. It contains the
whole future.</p><p>The past is a barrier. Unless one is courageous enough to die to the
past one cannot be rewarded by true life. And this death has to happen
each moment, because each moment we are creating the past. It is not
that once you have died to the past the whole thing is finished. After
twenty-four hours again twenty-four 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

why accumulate it? Each moment, be finished with it, so you are always

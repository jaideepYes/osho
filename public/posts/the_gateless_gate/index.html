Much is to happen within you and without also. You are on the
verge of the explosion.</p><p>So, be alone.</p><p>Not lonely, but <em>Alone.</em></p><p>And live with that Aloneness. Rather <em>BE</em> that Aloneness.</p><p>That is the only meditation to you <em>Now</em>. Loneliness is
negative.</p><p>To be lonely is to be aware of the absence of others. But to be alone
is the most positive state of the mind. It is to be aware of the
<em>PRESENCE</em> of Oneself.</p><p><span class=p>Be aware of the</span>presence that is

Existence</h2><p><br></p><p>Dear Saraswati, Love.</p><p>I hope you will be in deep meditation. Breathe in it, sleep in it,
live in it.</p><p>Let meditation be thy very existence. Only then is the
<em>HAPPENING.</em> Don't do it, but <em>BE IT.</em></p><p>And, my blessings are always with you.</p><p>If you need any help from me, <em>just ask when you are
thoughtless.</em></p><p>And, it will be GIVEN to you.</p><p><br></p><p>25-10-1970</p><p><br></p><p>(To Dr. Miss Colette Guinebert, alias Ma Saraswati, 87, Avenue due

And, stay with me for a little longer.
And, let me help.</p><p>It will be difficult for you, because, you will have to</p><p>LET GO <span class=p>yourself completely. But it is not
impossible.</span></p><p>And with you especially.</p><p>Because, I have seen in you the great potential that is awaiting its
opportunity.</p><p>With you much impossible is possible.</p><p>The seed is there which is longing to explode. Its very longing is
the source of your search. Its longing is the <em>Tension</em> that you
are today.</p><p>And its longing will be the <em>Freedom</em> that you will be
tomorrow.</p><p>The essence is there and the existence will follow it, if you so
wish,</p><p>Please, <span class=p>follow its call</span>to the conclusion.</p><p>Go on doing meditation. Do not seek results.</p><p>They will come by themselves, when the time is ripe.</p><p>And The Time Is Ripe. But still you are not.</p><p>Let meditation ripen you.</p><p><br></p><p>25-10-1970</p><p>(To Dr. Jean Georges Henrotte, 65, Rue De Lt, Federation, Paris-15,

Will be Done’</h2><p>Dear Bhakti, Love.</p><p>Your letter.</p><p>I know your inner condition more than you know yourself.</p><p>Because, NOW, your inner is not my outer.</p><p>Things that are happening to you unconsciously AND even against your
conscious will are GOOD. WELCOME them and be grateful.</p><p>Because, nothing divine can happen with you and your will.</p><p>Rather, your will is the only barrier in the way. Say wholeheartedly:
"Thy will be done".</p><p>And feel it. And live it.</p><p>Come HOME soon. I am waiting for you.</p><p>And much more is waiting to happen to you; also I know you are
sceptical.</p><p>That is not bad.</p><p>But a good beginning to begin with. Wherever, there is mind, there is
skepticism Mind is scepticism.</p><p>And therefore conflict.</p><p>That is the way of the mind. And its Nature.</p><p>Please do not fight with it.</p><p>And neither be identified with it. These are the obvious
alternatives. But both false.</p><p>And aspects of the same coin. You will have to walk in-between.</p><p>Come, and be with me and you will understand.</p><p><br></p><p>27-10-1970</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. You know better than me,</p><p>Whether I am coming to the U.S.A. or not Because, I will not come,

meet me.</p><p><br></p><p>(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, Sivananda Ashram, New York, U.S.A.).</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-call-from-beyond-has-come>5/ The Call from Beyond Has Come</h2><p>Dear Ananda Prema, Love and blessings.</p><p>Received your letter. I was waiting for it daily, since you</p><p>left.</p><p>I know that you have gone far away from here; but I also know that
NOW you cannot go away from ME.</p><p>And, that nearness is all that counts.</p><p>You have come near to me in a non-spatial and non- temporal
sense.</p><p>The meeting has taken place in the NO-WHERE. Or, in the
EVERY-WHERE.</p><p>Because, they both mean the same thing.</p><p>And, the real MEETING takes place only in this way. All else is
illusion.</p><p>Remember me whenever you need and you will find me then and
there.</p><p>Ask, anything - and <em>WAIT</em> and you will be answered. The
barriers have fallen down from your mind.</p><p>And, you have entered the meditative state. Now the <em>DOORS</em> of
the divine are open.</p><p>DO NOT HESITATE AND TAKE THE PLUNGE.</p><p>You are completely ready - just only be courageous to enter the
uncharted and the unknown.</p><p>The <em>CALL</em> from <em>BEYOND</em> has come - now accept the
challenge and be <em>FULFILLED.</em></p><p>Now, close your eyes and feel me and see me and let my blessings be
showered on you.</p><p>Send Bhakti soon and convey my love to her.</p><p><br></p><p>27-11-1970</p><p>(To Ma Ananda Prema, Sivananda Ashram, 205, East, 77th Street, 10-A,

BEING is That-Which-Is.</p><p>Becoming is longing for the future. BEING is to be in the
present.</p><p>Becoming is mental. BEING is existential.</p><p>That is why - becoming must cease for the BEING to reveal itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming is just like the smoke around the flame. Or, just like the
outer covering around the seed.</p><p>So, please let the smoke go for the flame to explode in its complete
glory and splendour.</p><p><br></p><p>And, let the seed die to its outer shell so that it may be what it is
in its inner most depth.</p><p><br></p><p>7-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To Shree Dharmendra Tukaram Dhokhe, Clerk, Police Wireless Training

Drops into the Drop</h2><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti, Love.</p><p>Be in the crowd as if you are alone. And vice versa.</p><p><br></p><p>Receive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. And, when
alone, maintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests.</p><p>In this way, the drop drops in the Ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon retiring, sleep as if you have entered your last sleep. And,
upon awakening be reborn again.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, the ocean drops into the drop.</p><p><br></p><p>15-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=be-open-and-let-things-happen>8/ Be Open, And Let Things
Happen</h2><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p>Love. When you are with me be completely at ease and relaxed; that
is, be totally yourself.</p><p>If you feel like crying <em>then cry.</em></p><p>If you feel like weeping <em>then weep. But just be uninterruptedly
aware.</em></p><p>Do not think about what you are doing - just be the doing and when
your senses are shaken like leaves in the wind <em>- then enter this
shaking.</em></p><p>Because, <em>only in such situations the being is revealed.</em></p><p>If a mood against someone or for someone arises do not place it on
the person in question but remain <em>centered</em> in yourself and you
will know a transcendence which is not of this world at all.</p><p><br></p><p>16-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To, Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;line-height:16pt;text-align:left id=carefulness-for-spiritual-crisis>9/ Carefulness for Spiritual
Crisis</h2><p>Dear Atmananda,</p><p>Love. Bhakti needs only time to absorb the shock she has come across
her deep meditations.</p><p>Remember: only TIME and nothing else. The shock is nothing new.</p><p>It happens whenever the deeper layers of the unconscious are
encountered.</p><p>Before any mutation this is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Be grateful to the Divine because this is a good omen. Bhakti needed
it badly; and when she is out of it, she will be a new person
totally.</p><p>Soon she will be twice-born.</p><p>Presently she is passing through a great spiritual crisis - so you be
with her <em>but just as if you are not.</em></p><p>Be present but with absolute absence.</p><p>This is the only way you can be helpful to her. Let her be alone as
much as possible.</p><p>Do not talk with her except it is needed absolutely. And, then too,
be telegraphic.</p><p>But if she herself wants to talk, let her talk as much as she likes -
and you yourself be just a passive listener.</p><p>Let her do whatsoever she wants to do or not to do. And soon
everything will be O.K.</p><p>Do not worry at all.</p><p>I will be there besides you always - and if you can see you will be
able to see me also.</p><p>Of course, Bhakti will feel my Presence and will become aware of me
these days so many times.</p><p>Convey my blessings to Bhakti.</p><p><br></p><p>27-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To Ma Atmananda (Mrs. Wellington, now Ma Dhyan Siddhi) 1016, Old
Post Road, Mamarneck, New York, 10543, U.S.A.)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:196pt;text-indent:-154pt;text-align:left id=ecstasy-and-bliss-of-living-moment-to-moment>10/ Ecstasy and Bliss
of Living Moment to Moment</h2><p>Dear Saraswati,</p><p>Love. <em>I live not by planning and I also feel that that is the
only way to be alive at all.</em></p><p>In fact, I live a wild life - absolutely unplanned - not knowing
anything about the future, <em>not even about the next moment.</em></p><p>Today is enough for me - really more than enough!</p><p>The moment that is present is the only living moment - the
<em>past</em> is dead in the sense that it is <em>no more</em> and the
<em>future</em> is also dead in the sense that it is <em>not yet
born.</em></p><p>And, so to be concerned with the past is to be dead and to be
concerned with the future is also to be dead.</p><p>The only way to be alive is to be here and now - in the moment and
totally in it.</p><p>Living moment to moment I have <span class=p>found</span>that
Ecstasy and bliss which is not of this world at all.</p><p>The single moment lived totally transcends time itself. It becomes
the gap between two moments of time.</p><p>And, if one can be in this gap then one is beyond death. Because,
<em>time is death; and timelessness is life.</em></p><p>Life is not something fixed and finished - <em>Life is living</em>
that is - <em>a process - just river like -</em> flowing always into the
unknown - from <em>the shores</em> of <em>the known to the shores</em>
of <em>the unknown.</em></p><p><br></p><p>27-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To, Docteur C. Guinebert, 87, Avenue Du Maine, XIV Medicis 26-94
Paris, France)</p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:41pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=spiritual-sleep-and-constant-awareness>11/ Spiritual Sleep and
Constant Awareness</h2><p><br></p><p>Dear Ananda Prema,</p><p>Love. Do not forget the search for the Divine for <em>even a single
moment.</em></p><p>Because, the time is always short and the task is great. And,
besides, the mind is wavering.</p><p>In fact, the <em>mind is the wavering.</em></p><p>Remember this - and remain aware of this fact as much as you can.</p><p>Because, the moment one is aware the wavering stops. And in the
intervals are the glimpses - glimpses of oneself</p><p>- glimpses of no-mind.</p><p>One has to transcend the wavering of the mind absolutely before one
comes to the doors of the Beloved.</p><p>NO-MINDNESS is the Door.</p><p>And the door is not far off. But the seeker is asleep.</p><p>MIND is the SLEEP.</p><p>That is why you will have to be attentive and alert of everything
that passes before your consciousness - <em>even be attentive of the
in-attentive moments.</em></p><p>Through constant awareness the spiritual sleep will be broken and you
will be transformed.</p><p>This is your potentiality - this is every ones potentiality.</p><p>And, for you <em>the time is RIPE.</em></p><p>But the seed can remain a seed and die.</p><p><br></p><p>The opportunity can be lost.</p><p>You are free to be that which you are meant to be - or to be that
which you are not meant to be.</p><p>Man is free to be or not to be.</p><p>This is the glory and this is the burden. Freedom means
responsibility.</p><p>So <em>be careful.</em></p><p>If you can be that which is your potentiality - if you can flower to
your fullness - then there is bliss - then there is ECSTASY; otherwise
ashes are in hands and anguish in the heart.</p><p>And, ultimately everything depends on you.</p><p>Heaven or Hell - and you and only you will be responsible for it.</p><p>So <em>be careful.</em></p><p>My blessings are always with you.</p><p><br></p><p>28-1-1971</p><p><br></p><p>(To, Ma Ananda Prema, Sivananda Ashram, 205, East 77th St. 10-A New

Meditation Is Encountering Yourself In Total Nakedness</h2><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Everything has happened, as it should happen.</p><p>And I was surprised not because you ran away from here, but because I
never thought that you could be so <em>predictable!</em></p><p>It is not from here that you have escaped; it is only a vain effort
to <em>escape from yourself.</em></p><p>Which is impossible.</p><p>How can one escape from oneself?</p><p>But, in meditation a moment comes necessarily when the mind tries the
impossible - for the mind this is the last defensive act.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is ultimately <em>suicidal to the mind.</em></p><p>And, of course, the mind must be given a chance! And, you have given
it!</p><p>Meditation is encountering <span class=p>yourself - directly and in
your total nakedness.</span></p><p>This creates fear and the futile effort to escape.</p><p>The effort is futile because whatsoever is known once - <em>it is

You have to live your life. Never compromise, otherwise you will miss much. Never compromise! If you feel like becoming a sannyasin, become a sannyasin. Take the risk. If he loves you there is no problem, he will understand -- because love gives freedom. If he does not love you then there will be difficulty for him, because he will feel you are getting out of his possession, you are becoming independent, you are trying to be yourself. But to bow down to such expectations is suicidal. That is his problem. You have to live your life, he has to live his life. Nobody should try to impose things on the other.\nBut my feeling is that you must also be imposing things on him, that's why you are afraid. If you are not imposing anything on him, you can be independent. But it is a mutual arrangement: people are slaves to each other, and whenever you make a slave of somebody, remember, you are making somebody your master too. It is a mutual arrangement. You must be trying to manipulate your husband, you must be trying to force things upon him, you must be making him a cripple. Now you want to be independent, he will assert his independence too. Then he would like to go his own way, and that you cannot afford. That is the real fear.\nBut if you don't do something that you like, that you wanted to do, that you wanted to be, you will never be able to forgive him. And you will take revenge, and you will be angry, and you will be in a rage -- because you will constantly think you wanted to become a sannyasin, and it is only because of this man... And you will feel encaged, imprisoned. Nobody likes being imprisoned. Then one hates the person who is the cause of your imprisonment, then one tries to take revenge in subtle ways. That will destroy your marriage.\nNever create such a situation in which you cannot forgive the other. Only two independent persons can forgive each other. Slaves cannot forgive. And who knows, it may help him too, in some way.\nI was reading one anecdote the other day:\nTwo explorers met in the wilds of the Amazon. The following exchange took place.\nFirst explorer: \"I came out here because the urge to wander is in my blood. Civilization sickens me. I like to see nature in its primitive form. I would like to plant my footprints where no human being has ever gone before. How about you? Why did you come out here?\"\nSecond explorer: \"My wife has become Osho's sannyasin, and she is doing Dynamic Meditation in the morning and Kundalini in the evening -- that's why!\"\nBut good! If your husband goes to the Amazon and becomes an explorer, this is giving him a good opportunity to do something.\nEnough for today.\n3\nNegation of Knowledge\n13 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS FORM; EMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS, THAT IS FORM; THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,\nPERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. HERE, O SARIPUTRA,\nALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR STOPPED,\nNOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.\nKnowledge is the curse, the calamity, the cancer. It is through knowledge that man becomes divided from the whole. Knowledge creates the distance.\nYou come across a wildflower in the mountains, you don't know what it is, your mind has nothing to say about it, the mind is silent. You look at the flower, you see the flower, but no knowledge arises in you -- there is wonder, there is mystery. The flower is there, you are there. Through wonder you are not separate, you are bridged.\nIf you know that this is a rose or a marigold, or something else, that very knowing disconnects you. The flower is there, you are here, but there is no bridge -- you know! Knowledge creates distance. The more you know the bigger is the distance; the less you know the lesser the distance. And if you are in the moment of not knowing, there is no distance, you are bridged.\nYou fall in love with a woman or a man -- the day you fall in love there is no distance. There is only wonder, a thrill, an excitement, an ecstasy -- but no knowledge. You don't know who this woman is. Without knowledge, there is nothing to divide you. Hence the beauty of those first moments of love. You have lived with the woman only for twenty-four hours; knowledge has arisen. Now you have some ideas about the woman: you know who she is, there is an image. Twenty-four hours have created a past. Those twenty-four hours have left marks on the mind: you look at the same woman, there is no longer the same mystery. You are coming down the hill, that peak is lost.\nTo understand this is to understand much. To understand that knowledge divides, knowledge creates distance, is to understand the very secret of meditation. Meditation is a state of not knowing. Meditation is pure space, undisturbed by knowledge. Yes, the biblical story is true -- that man has fallen through knowledge, by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge. No other scripture of the world surpasses that. That parable is the last word; no other parable has reached to that height and insight.\nIt looks so illogical that man has fallen through knowledge. It looks illogical because logic is part of knowledge. Logic is all in support of knowledge. It looks illogical, because logic is the root cause of man's fall. A man who is absolutely logical, absolutely sane, always sane, never allows any illogic in his life, is a madman. Sanity needs to be balanced by insanity; logic needs to be balanced by illogic. The opposites meet and balance. A man who is just rational is unreasonable -- he will miss much. In fact he will go on missing all that is beautiful and all that is true. He will collect trivia, his life will be a mundane life. He will be the worldly man.\nThat biblical parable has immense insight. Why has man fallen through knowledge? -- because knowledge creates distance, because knowledge creates 'I' and 'thou', because knowledge creates subject and object, the knower and the known, the observer and the observed. Knowledge is basically schizophrenic; it creates a split. And then there is no way to bridge it. That's why the more man has become knowledgeable, the less he is religious. The more educated a man, the less is the possibility for him to approach God.\nJesus is right when he says, \"Only children will be able to enter into my kingdom\"... only children.\nWhat is that quality that a child has and you have lost? The child has the quality of non-knowledge, innocence. He looks with wonder, his eyes are absolutely clear. He looks deep, but he has no prejudices, no judgments, no a priori ideas. He does not project, hence he comes to know that which is.\nThe other day we were talking about the distinction between reality and truth. The child knows the truth, you know only the reality. The reality is that which you have created around yourself -- projecting, desiring, thinking. The reality is your interpretation of truth. Truth is simply that which is; reality is that which you have come to understand -- it is your idea of the truth. Reality consists of things, all separate. Truth consists of only one cosmic energy. Truth consists of oneness, reality consists of 'many-ness'. Reality is a crowd, truth is integration.\nBefore we enter into the sutras, this has to become the foundation: that knowledge is a curse.\nJ. Krishnamurti has said, \"To negate is silence.\" To negate what? -- to negate knowledge, to negate mind, to negate this constant occupation inside you; to create an unoccupied space. When you are unoccupied you are in tune with the whole. When you are occupied you have fallen out of tune. Hence, whenever it happens that you can attain a moment of silence, there is immense joy. In that moment life has significance, in that moment life has a grandeur beyond words. In that moment life is a dance. In that moment if even death comes it will be a dance and a celebration, because that moment knows nothing but joy. That moment is joyous, it is blissful.\nKnowledge has to be negated -- but not because I am saying so or because J. Krishnamurti says so or because Gautam Buddha has said so. If you negate because I am saying so, then you will negate your knowledge, and whatsoever I am saying will become your knowledge in its place; you will substitute it. The negation has not to come from the mind, otherwise the mind\nis very tricky. Then whatsoever I say becomes your knowledge, you start clinging to it. You throw your old idols and you replace them with new ones. But it is the same game played with new words, new ideas, new thoughts.\nThen how to negate knowledge? Not by other knowledge: just seeing into the fact that knowledge creates distance, just seeing into this fact intensely, totally, is enough. Not that you have to replace it with something else; that intensity is fire, that intensity will reduce your knowledge to ashes. That intensity is enough. That intensity is what is known as 'insight'. Insight will burn your knowledge, and it will not be replaced by other knowledge. Then there is emptiness, shunyata. Then there is nothingness, because then there is no content; there is undisturbed, undistorted truth.\nYou have to see what I am saying, you are not to learn what I am saying. Here, sitting with me every day, listening to me, don't start collecting knowledge. Here, listening to me, don't start hoarding. Listening to me should be an experiment in insight. You should listen with intensity, with totality, with as much awareness as is possible for you. In that very awareness you will see a point, and that very seeing is transformation. Not that you have to do something else afterwards; the seeing itself brings mutation. If some effort is needed, that simply shows you missed. If you come tomorrow and ask me, \"I have understood that knowledge is the curse, that knowledge creates distance. Now, how to drop it?\" -- then you missed. If the 'how' arises, then you missed. The 'how' cannot arise, because the 'how' is asking for more knowledge. The 'how' is asking for methods, techniques: \"What should be done?\" And insight is enough; it need not be helped by any efforts. Its fire is more than enough to burn all knowledge that you carry within you. Just see the point.\nListening to me, go with me. Listening to me, hold my hand and move in the spaces that I'm trying to help you to move in. And see what I am saying, don't argue. Don't say yes, don't say no. Don't agree, don't disagree. Just be with me in this moment -- and suddenly the insight is there. If you are listening attentively... and by attention I don't mean concentration; by attention I simply mean you are listening with awareness, not with a dull mind; you are listening with intelligence, with aliveness, with openness. You are here, now, with me. That's what I mean by attention: you are nowhere else. You are not comparing in the mind what I am saying with your old thoughts. You are not comparing at all, you are not judging. You are not there judging inside, within you, whether what I am saying is right or not, or how much is right.\nJust the other day I was talking with a seeker. He has the quality of a seeker, but is burdened by knowledge. While I was talking to him his eyes became full of tears. His heart was just going to open, and in that very moment the mind jumped in and destroyed the whole beauty of it. He was just moving towards the heart and opening, but immediately his mind came in. Those tears that were just on the verge of dropping, disappeared. His eyes became dry. What had happened? -- I said something with which he could not agree. He was agreeing with me, up to a certain point. Then I said something which goes against his Jewish background, which goes against the Kabbala, and immediately the whole energy changed. He said, \"Everything is right. Whatsoever you are saying is right, but this one thing: that God has no purpose, that existence exists purposelessly -- with this I cannot agree, because the Kabbala says just the opposite: that life has purpose, that God is purposive, that he is leading us towards a certain destiny, that there is a destination.\"\nHe may not have even looked at it this way -- that he missed in that moment because comparison came in. What does the Kabbala have to do with me? When you are with me, put\naway all your knowledge of the Kabbala, of yoga, of tantra, of this and that. When you are with me, be with me. If you are totally with me... and I am not saying that you are agreeing with me, remember. I am not saying that you are agreeing with me: there is no question of agreement or disagreement.\nWhen you see a roseflower, do you agree with it or disagree with it? When you see the sunrise, do you agree or do you disagree? When you see the moon in the night, you simply see it! Either you see it or you don't see it, but there is no question of agreement or disagreement.\nThat way, be with me; that is the way of being with a master. Just be with me. I'm not trying to convince you about anything. I'm not trying to convert you to some theory, philosophy, dogma, to some church, no! I'm simply sharing what has happened to me, and in that very sharing, if you participate, it can happen to you too. It is infectious. Insight transforms.\nWhen I am saying knowledge is a curse you can agree or disagree -- and you have missed! You just listen to it, just see into it, go into the whole process of knowledge. You see how knowledge creates distance, how knowledge becomes a barrier, how knowledge stands in between, how knowledge goes on increasing and the distance goes on increasing, how innocence is lost through knowledge, how wonder is destroyed, crippled, murdered through knowledge, how life becomes a dull and boring affair through knowledge. Mystery is lost, and with the mystery God is lost.\nMystery disappears because you start having the idea that you know. When you know, how can there be mystery? Mystery is possible only when you don't know.\nAnd remember, man has not known a thing! All that we have gathered is just rubbish. The ultimate remains beyond grasp. What we have gathered are only facts, truth remains untouched by our efforts. And that is the experience not only of Buddha, Krishna, Krishnamurti and Ramana; that is the experience even of Edison, Newton, Albert Einstein. That is the experience of poets, painters, dancers. All the great intelligences of the world -- they may be mystics, they may be poets, they may be scientists -- are in absolute agreement about one thing: that the more we know, the more we understand that life is an absolute mystery. Our knowledge does not destroy its mystery. It is only stupid people who think that because they know a little bit, now there is no more mystery in life. It is only the mediocre mind that becomes too attached to knowledge; the intelligent mind remains above knowledge. He uses it, certainly uses it -- it is useful, it is utilitarian -- but knows perfectly well that all that is true is hidden, remains hidden. We can go on knowing and knowing, but God remains unexhausted.\nListen with insight, attention, totality. And in that very vision you will see something, and that seeing changes you. You don't ask how.\nThat is the meaning when Krishnamurti says, \"To negate is silence.\" Insight negates. And when something is negated and nothing is posited instead, something has been destroyed and nothing has been put, replaced in its place, there is silence -- because there is space. There is silence because the old has been thrown and the new has not been brought in. That silence Buddha calls shunyata. That silence is emptiness, nothingness. And only that nothingness can operate in the world of truth.\nThought cannot operate there. Thought works only in the world of things, because thought is also a thing -- subtle, but it is also material. That's why thought can be recorded, that's why thought can be relayed, conveyed. I can throw a thought at you; you can hold it, you can have\nit. It can be taken and given, it is transferable, because it is a thing. It is a material phenomenon.\nEmptiness cannot be given, emptiness cannot be thrown at you. You can participate in it, you can move into it, but nobody can give it to you. It is nontransferable. And only emptiness operates in the world of truth. Truth is known only when mind is not. To know truth mind has to cease, it has to go out of functioning. It has to be quiet, still, unmoving.\nThought cannot operate in truth, but truth can operate through thoughts. You cannot attain to truth by thinking, but when you have attained it you can use thinking in its service. That's what I am doing, that's what Buddha has done, that's what all the masters have done.\nWhat I am saying is a thought, but behind this thought is emptiness. That emptiness has not been produced by thought, that emptiness is beyond thought. Thought cannot touch it, thought cannot even look at it.\nHave you observed one phenomenon? -- that you cannot think about emptiness, you cannot make emptiness a thought. You cannot think about it, it is unthinkable. If you can think about it, it will not be emptiness at all. Thought has to go for emptiness to come; they never meet. Once emptiness has come, it can use all kinds of devices to express itself.\nInsight is a state of no-thought. Whenever you see something, you always see when there is no thought. Here also, listening to me, being with me, sometimes you see. But those moments are gaps, intervals. One thought has gone, another has not come, and there is a gap; and in that gap something strikes, something starts vibrating. It is like somebody playing on a drum: the drum is empty inside, that's why it can be played upon. That emptiness vibrates. That beautiful sound that comes out is produced out of emptiness. When you are, without a thought, then something is possible, immediately possible. Then you can see what I am saying. Then it will not be just a word heard, then it will become an intuition, an insight, a vision. You have looked into it, you have shared it with me.\nInsight is a state of non-thinking, no-thought. It is a gap, an interval in the process of thought, and in that gap is the glimpse, the truth.\nThe English word empty comes from a root which means at leisure, unoccupied. It is a beautiful word if you go to the root. The root is very pregnant: it means at leisure, unoccupied. Whenever you are unoccupied, at leisure, you are empty. And remember, the proverb that says that the empty mind is the devil's workshop is just nonsense. Just the opposite is the truth: the occupied mind is the devil's workshop. The empty mind is God's workshop, not the devil's. But you have to understand what I mean by 'empty' -- at leisure, relaxed, non-tense, not moving, not desiring, not going anywhere, just being here, utterly here. An empty mind is a pure presence. And all is possible in that pure presence, because the whole existence comes out of that pure presence.\nThese trees grow out of that pure presence, these stars are born out of this pure presence; we are here -- all the Buddhas have come out of this pure presence. In that pure presence you are in God, you are God. Occupied, you fall; occupied, you have to be expelled from the garden of Eden. Unoccupied you are back in the garden, unoccupied you are back at home.\nWhen the mind is not occupied by reality, by things, by thoughts, then there is that which is. And that which is, is the truth. Only in emptiness is there a meeting, merging. Only in emptiness do you open to truth and truth enters in you. Only in emptiness do you become pregnant with truth.\nThese are the three states of the mind. The first is content and consciousness. You always have contents in the mind -- a thought moving, a desire arising, anger, greed, ambition. You always have some content in the mind; the mind is never unoccupied. The traffic goes on, day-in, day-out. While awake it is there, while asleep it is there. While awake you call it thinking, while asleep you call it dreaming -- it is the same process. Dreaming is a little more primitive, that's all -- because it thinks in pictures. It does not use concepts, it uses pictures. It is more primitive; like small children think in pictures. So in small children's books you have to make big pictures, colorful, because they think through pictures. Through pictures they will learn words. By and by those pictures become smaller and smaller, and then they disappear.\nThe primitive man also thinks in pictures. The ancientmost languages are pictorial languages. Chinese is a pictorial language: it has no alphabet. It is the ancientmost language. In the night you again become primitive, you forget your sophistication of the day and you start thinking in pictures -- but it is the same.\nAnd the psychoanalyst's insight is valuable -- that he looks into your dreams. Then there is more truth, because you are more primitive; you are not trying to deceive anybody, you are more authentic. In the day you have a personality around you which hides you -- layers upon layers of personality. It is very difficult to find out the true man. You will have to dig deep, and it hurts, and the man will resist. But in the night, just as you put your clothes away, you put your personality away too. It is not needed because you will not be communicating with anybody, you will be alone in your bed. And you will not be in the world, you will be absolutely in your private realm. There is no need to hide and no need to pretend. That's why the psychoanalyst tries to go into your dreams, because they show much more clearly who you are. But it is the same game played in different languages; the game is not different. This is the ordinary state of the mind: mind and content, consciousness plus content.\nThe second state of the mind is consciousness without content; that's what meditation is. You are fully alert, and there is a gap, an interval. No thought is encountered, there is no thought before you. You are not asleep, you are awake -- but there is no thought. This is meditation. The first state is called mind, the second state is called meditation.\nAnd then there is a third state. When the content has disappeared, the object has disappeared, the subject cannot remain for long -- because they exist together. They produced each other. When the subject is alone it can only hang around a little while more, just out of the momentum of the past. Without the content the consciousness cannot be there long; it will not be needed, because a consciousness is always a consciousness about something. When you say 'conscious', it can be asked \"About what?\" You say, \"I am conscious of...\" That object is needed, it is a must for the subject to exist. Once the object has disappeared, soon the subject will also disappear. First go the contents, then consciousness disappears.\nThen the third state is called samadhi -- no content, no consciousness. But remember, this no-content, no-consciousness, is not a state of unconsciousness. It is a state of superconsciousness, of transcendental consciousness. Consciousness now is only conscious of itself. Consciousness has turned upon itself; the circle is complete. You have come home. This is the third state, samadhi; and this third state is what Buddha means by shunyata.\nFirst drop the content -- you become half-empty, then drop consciousness -- you become fully empty. And this full-emptiness is the most beautiful thing that can happen, the greatest benediction.\nIn this nothingness, in this emptiness, in this selflessness, in this shunyata, there is complete security and stability. You will be surprised to know about this -- complete security and stability when you are not. All fears disappear... because what is the basic fear? The basic fear is the fear of death. All other fears are just reflections of the basic fear. All other fears can be reduced to one fear: the fear of death, the fear that, \"One day I may have to disappear, one day I may have to die. I am, and the day is coming when I will not be\" -- that frightens, that is the fear.\nTo avoid that fear we start moving in such a way so that we can live as long as possible. And we try to secure our lives -- we start compromising, we start becoming more and more secure, safe, because of the fear. We become paralyzed, because the more secure you are, the more safe you are, the less alive you will be.\nLife exists in challenges, life exists in crises, life needs insecurity. It grows in the soil of insecurity. Whenever you are insecure, you will find yourself more alive, more alert. That's why rich people become dull: a kind of stupidity and a kind of stupor surrounds them. They are so secure, there is no challenge. They are so secure, they need not be intelligent. They are so secure -- for what do they need intelligence? Intelligence is needed when there is challenge, intelligence is provoked by challenge.\nSo because of the fear of death we strive for security, for a bank balance, for insurance, for marriage, for a settled life, for a home; we become part of a country, we join a political party, we join a religious church -- we become Hindus, Christians, Mohammedans. These are all ways to find security. These are all ways to find some place to belong to -- a country, a church. Because of this fear politicians and priests go on exploiting you. If you are not in any fear, no politician, no priest can exploit you. It is only out of fear that he can exploit because he can provide -- at least he can promise -- that this will make you secure: \"This will be your security. I can guarantee.\" The goods may never be delivered -- that's another thing -- but the promise... And the promise keeps people exploited, oppressed. The promise keeps people in bondage.\nOnce you have known this inner emptiness then there is no fear, because death has already happened. In that emptiness it has happened. In that emptiness you have disappeared. How can you be afraid anymore? About what? About whom? And who can be afraid? In this emptiness all fear disappears because death has already happened. Now there is no longer any death possible. You feel a kind of deathlessness, timelessness. Eternity has arrived. Now you don't look for security; there is no need.\nThis is the state of a sannyasin. This is the state where a man need not be a part of a country, need not be a part of a church, or stupid things like that.\nIt is only when you have become nothing that you can be yourself. It looks paradoxical. And you need not compromise, because it is out of fear and greed that one compromises.\nAnd you can live in rebellion because there is nothing to lose. You can become a rebellion;\nthere is nothing to fear. Nobody can kill you, you have already done that thing yourself. Nobody can take anything away from you; you have dropped all that which can be taken away from you. Now you are in nothingness, you are a nothingness. Hence the paradoxical phenomenon: that in this nothingness arises a great security, a great safety, a stability -- because there is no more death possible.\nAnd with death, time disappears. With death disappear all the problems that are created by death and by time. In the wake of all these disappearances, what is left is a pure sky. This pure sky is samadhi, nirvana. Buddha is talking about this.\nThese sutras have been addressed to one of Buddha's greatest disciples, Sariputra. Why to Sariputra?\nThe first day I told you that there are seven planes, seven rungs of the ladder. The seventh is the transcendental: Zen, Tantra, Tao. The sixth is the spiritual-transcendental: yoga. Up to the sixth, method remains important, 'how' remains important. Up to the sixth, discipline remains important, ritual remains important, techniques remain important. Only when you reach to the seventh do you see that to be nothing is needed.\nSariputra is addressed in these sutras because Sariputra was at the sixth center, the sixth rung. He was one of the greatest disciples of Buddha. Buddha had eighty great disciples; Sariputra is one of the chief amongst those eighty. He was the most knowledgeable man around Buddha. He was the greatest scholar and pundit around Buddha. When he had come to Buddha, he himself had five thousand disciples.\nWhen he had come to Buddha for the first time he had come to argue, to debate with and defeat Buddha. He had come with his five thousand disciples -- to impress. And when he stood before Buddha, Buddha laughed. And Buddha said to him, \"Sariputra, you know much, but you do not know at all. I can see you have accumulated great knowledge, but you are empty. You have come to discuss and debate and to defeat me, but if you really want to discuss with me, you will have to wait at least one year.\"\nSariputra said, \"One year? For what?\"\nBuddha said, \"You will have to remain silent for one year; that will be the price to be paid. If you can remain silent for one year then you can discuss with me, because what I am going to say to you will come out of silence. You need a little experience of it. And I see, Sariputra, you have not even tasted a single moment of silence. You are so full of knowledge, your head is heavy. I feel compassion for you, Sariputra. You have been carrying such a load for many lives. You are not a brahmin only in this life, Sariputra, you have been a brahmin for many lives. And for many lives you have carried the Vedas and the scriptures. It has been your style for many lives... but I see a possibility. You are knowledgeable, but yet the promise is there. You are knowledgeable, but your knowledge has not completely blocked your being; there are a few windows still left. I would like, for one year, to clean those windows, and then there is a possibility of our meeting and talking and being. You be here for one year.\"\nThis was strange. Sariputra had been traveling all over the country, defeating people. That was one of the things in India: knowledgeable people used to travel all over the country and defeat others in great debates and discussions, marathon debates. And that was thought to be one of the greatest things to do. If somebody had become victorious all over the country and he had defeated all the scholars, that was a great ego satisfaction. That man was thought to be bigger than kings, emperors. That man was thought to be greater than the rich people.\nSariputra was traveling. And naturally, you cannot declare yourself the victorious one if you have not defeated Buddha. So he had come for that. So he said, \"Okay, if I have to wait for one year, I will wait.\" And for one year he was sitting there in silence with Buddha. In one year, the silence settled in him.\nAnd after one year Buddha asked him, \"Now we can discuss and you can defeat me, Sariputra. I will be immensely happy to be defeated by you.\"\nAnd he laughed and touched Buddha's feet and said, \"Initiate me. In this one year's silence, listening to you, there have been a few moments when the insight has happened to me.\nAlthough I had come as the antagonist, I thought, 'While I am here sitting for one year, why not listen to this man, to what he is saying?' So out of curiosity I started listening. But sometimes those moments came and you penetrated me, and you touched my heart, and you played on my inner organ, and I have heard the music. You have defeated me without defeating me.\"\nSariputra became Buddha's disciple, and his five thousand disciples also became Buddha's disciples. Sariputra was one of the very well-known scholars of those days. These sutras are addressed to Sariputra.\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS FORM; EMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS, THAT IS FORM, THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,\nPERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES, AND CONSCIOUSNESS.\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA... What does Buddha mean by 'here'? He means his space. He says, \"From the vision of my world, from the transcendental standpoint, the space where I exist and the eternity where I exist...\"\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS FORM;\nThis is one of the most important assertions. The whole Buddhist approach depends on this: that the manifest is the unmanifest; that the form is nothing but the form of emptiness itself, and the emptiness is also nothing but the form, the possibility of the form. The statement is illogical and obviously appears to be nonsense. How can form be emptiness? They are opposites. How can emptiness be form? They are polarities.\nOne thing has to be understood before we can enter into the sutra rightly: Buddha is not logical, Buddha is dialectical.\nThere are two approaches towards reality: one is logical. Of that approach, Aristotle is the father in the West. It simply moves in a line, a clear-cut line. It never allows the opposite; the opposite has to be discarded. This approach says A is A and never not A. A cannot be not A. This is the formulation of Aristotelian logic -- and it looks perfectly right, because we have all been brought up with that logic in the schools, colleges, universities. The world is dominated by Aristotle: A is A and never not A.\nThe second approach towards reality is dialectical. In the West that approach is associated with the names of Heraclitus, Hegel. The dialectical process says: life moves through polarities, through opposites -- just as a river flows through two banks which oppose each\nother, but those opposing banks keep the river flowing between them. This is more existential. Electricity has two poles, positive and negative. If Aristotle's logic is of existence, then electricity is very, very illogical. Then God himself is illogical, because he produces new life out of the meeting of a man and a woman, which are opposites -- yin and yang, male and female. If God had been brought up by Aristotle in an Aristotelian logic, in the linear logic, then homosexuality would have been the norm and heterosexuality would have been perversion. Then man would love man and woman would love woman. Then opposites could not meet.\nBut God is dialectical. Everywhere, opposites are meeting. In you, birth and death are meeting. Everywhere, opposites are meeting -- day and night, summer and winter. The thorn and the flower, they are meeting; they are on the same branch, they come out of the same source. Man and woman, youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, body and soul, the world and God -- all are opposites. This is a symphony of the opposites. Opposites are not only meeting but creating a great symphony -- only opposites can create a symphony. Otherwise life would be a monotony, not a symphony. Life would be a boredom. If there were only one note continuously being repeated, it would be bound to create boredom. There are opposite notes: thesis meeting with the antithesis, creating a synthesis; and in its own turn, synthesis again becomes a thesis, creates an antithesis, and a higher synthesis evolves. That's how life moves.\nThus Buddha's approach is dialectical, and it is more existential, more true, more valid.\nA man loves a woman, a woman loves a man -- then something else has to be understood too. Now biologists say, and psychologists agree, that man is not only man, he is woman too. And woman is not simply woman, she is man too. So when a man and a woman meet, there are not two persons meeting but four persons meeting. The man is meeting with the woman, but the man has a hidden woman in himself; so has the woman a hidden man in herself; they are also meeting. The meeting is on double planes. It is more intricate, more complex, more intertwined. A man is man and woman, both. Why? -- because he comes out of both. Something has been contributed to you by your father and something has been contributed to you by your mother, whosoever you are. A man flows in your blood and a woman too. You have to be both because you are the meeting of the polar opposites. You are a synthesis! It is impossible to deny one and just be the other. That's what has been done.\nAristotle has been followed literally, in every way, and that has created many problems for man -- and such problems which seem to be unsolvable if Aristotle is to be followed. A man has been taught to be just a man: never to show any feminine traits, never to show any softness of the heart, never to show any receptivity, always be aggressive. Man has been taught never to cry, never weep -- because tears are feminine. Women have been taught never to be in any way like the male: never to show aggression, never show expression, to always remain passive, receptive. This is against reality, and this has crippled both. In a better world, with better understanding, a man will be both, a woman will be both -- because sometimes a man needs to be a woman. There are moments when he needs to be soft -- tender moments, love-moments. And there are moments when a woman needs to be expressive and aggressive\n-- in anger, in defense, in rebellion. If a woman is simply passive, then she will turn into a slave automatically. A passive woman is bound to become a slave -- that's what happened down the ages. And an aggressive man, emphatically aggressive and never tender, is bound to create wars, neurosis in the world, violence.\nMan has been fighting, continuously fighting; it seems that man exists on the earth just to fight. In three thousand years there have been five thousand wars! War continues somewhere or other, the earth is never whole and healthy... never a moment without war. Either it is in Korea, or it is in Vietnam, or it is in Israel, or India, Pakistan, or in Bangladesh; somewhere the massacre has to continue. Man has to kill. To remain man, he has to kill. Seventy-five percent of energy is put into war effort, into creating more bombs, hydrogen bombs, neutron bombs, and so on and so forth. It seems that man's whole purpose here on earth is war. The war heroes are respected the most. The war politicians become the great names in history: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong -- these names are going to remain. Why? -- because they fought great wars, they destroyed. Whether in aggression or in defense -- that is not the point -- but these were the warmongers. And nobody ever knows who was aggressive -- whether Germany was aggressive or not, it all depends on who writes the history. Whosoever wins will write the history, and he will prove the other was the aggressor. History would be totally different if Adolf Hitler had been victorious. Yes, the Nuremburg trials would have been there, but the Americans and English and French generals and politicians would have been on trial. And history would have been written by Germans; naturally they would have a different vision.\nNobody knows what is true. One thing is certain: that man puts his whole energy into war effort. The reason? -- the reason is that man has been taught to be just man, his woman has been denied. So no man is whole. And so is the case with woman -- no woman is whole. She has been denied her male part. When she was a small child she could not fight with boys, she could not climb on the trees; she had to play with dolls, she had to play 'house'. This is a very, very distorted vision.\nMan is both, so is woman -- and both are needed to create a real, harmonious human being. The existence is dialectical; and opposites are not only opposites, they are complementaries too.\nBuddha says: HERE O SARIPUTRA -- in my world, Sariputra, in my space, in my time, Sariputra, at the seventh rung of the ladder, in this state of no-mind, in this state of samadhi, in this state of nirvana, enlightenment -- FORM IS EMPTINESS. Man is woman and woman is man, and life is death and death is life. Opposites are not opposites, Sariputra; they are interpenetrating each other, they exist through each other. To show this basic insight Buddha says: Form is formlessness, and formlessness is form; the unmanifest becomes manifest, and the manifest again becomes unmanifest. They are not different, Sariputra, they are one. The duality is only apparent. Deep down it is all one.\nEMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS, THAT IS FORM; THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,\nPERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES AND CONSCIOUSNESS.\nThe whole of life and the whole existence consists of polar opposites, but only on the surface are they different. These opposites are like my two hands: I can oppose them with each other, I can even manage a kind of conflict, a fight between them. But my left hand and my right hand are both my hands. Within me, they are one. That is exactly the case.\nWhy is Buddha saying this thing to Sariputra? -- because if you understand this your worries will disappear. Then there is no worry. Life is death, death is life. To be is a way towards not-to-be, and not-to-be is a way towards to be. It is the same game. Then there is no fear, then there is no problem. With this insight a great acceptance arises.\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA,\nALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR STOPPED,\nNOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.\nBuddha says: All dharmas are full of emptiness. That nothingness exists at everything's core: that nothingness exists in a tree, that nothingness exists in a rock, that nothingness exists in a star.\nNow scientists will agree: they say that when a star collapses it becomes a black hole, nothingness. But that nothingness is not just nothingness; it is immensely powerful, it is very full, overflowing.\nThe concept, the hypothesis of a black hole, is of immense value in understanding Buddha. A star exists for millions and trillions of years, but one day it has to die. Everything that is born has to die. Man exists for seventy years, then what happens? Exhausted, tired, he disappears, he falls back into the original unity. So it is going to happen to everything, sooner or later. The Himalayas will disappear one day, so will this earth disappear one day, so will this sun disappear one day. But when a great star disappears, where will it disappear? It collapses within itself. It is such a big mass; it collapses. Just as a man walking -- an old man\n-- falls on the street and collapses, if you leave the man there, sooner or later his body will disappear, disintegrate into the mud, into the earth. If you leave it there for many years, then the bones will also disappear into dust. The man was there one day, walking, living, loving, fighting, and now all has disappeared into a black hole. So does it happen with a star: when a star collapses into itself it becomes a black hole. Why is it called a black hole? -- because now there is no mass, there is only pure emptiness, what Buddha calls shunyata. And the shunyata, the pure emptiness, is so powerful that if you come under the impact of it, near it, in its vicinity, you will be pulled, pulled into the emptiness, and you will also collapse and disappear.\nFor space travel this is going to be a future problem, because there are many stars which have become black holes. And you cannot see it because it is nothing, it is just absence. You cannot see it, and you can come across it. If a spaceship comes near it, under its gravitation, it will simply be pulled in. Then there is no way to get out of it, it is impossible to find a way to get out of it. The pull is so big it will be simply pulled in, and it will disappear and collapse.\nAnd you will never hear about the spaceship, where it went, what happened to it, what happened to the space travelers.\nThis black hole is very, very like Buddha's concept of emptiness. All forms collapse and disappear into blackness, and then when they have rested for a long time, they bubble up -- again a star is born. This goes on: life and death, life and death -- this goes on. This is the way existence moves.\nFirst it becomes manifested, then becomes tired, goes into unmanifestation, then again revives its energy through rest, relaxation, again becomes manifest. The whole day you work, you become tired; in the night you disappear in your sleep into a black hole. You put your lights out, you slip under your blanket, you close your eyes; then within moments consciousness is gone. You have collapsed withinwards. There are moments when even dreams are no longer there; then sleep is the deepest. In that deep sleep you are in a black hole, you are dead. For the time being you are in death, resting in death. And then in the morning you are again back, full of juice and gusto and life, again rejuvenated. If you have a really good, deep sleep without dreams, the morning is so fresh, so vital, so radiant, you are again young. If you know how to sleep deeply, you know how to revive yourself again and again. By the evening again you are collapsing, tired, exhausted by the day's activities.\nThe same happens to everything. Man is a miniature of the whole existence. What happens to man happens to the whole existence on a bigger scale, that's all. Every night you disappear into nothingness, every morning you come into form. Form, no-form, form, no-form; this is how life moves, these are the two steps.\nHERE, O SARIPUTRA,\nALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR STOPPED...\nAnd Buddha is saying: Nothing has to be done, only understanding is needed.\nThis is a radical statement. It can transform your whole life if you can see it as an insight.\n... THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR STOPPED...\nNobody is producing these forms, and nobody is stopping these forms. Buddha does not believe in a God as manipulator, as a controller, as a creator, no. That would be a duality, an unnecessary hypothesis. Buddha says it is happening on its own; it is natural, nobody is doing it. It is not that first God thinks, \"Let there be light\" -- as it says in the Bible -- so there is light. And then one day he says, \"Now, let there be no light,\" and the light disappears. Why bring this God in? And why give him such ugly work? And he will have to do it forever and forever: \"Let there be light, let there be no light, let there be light... Now let this man be there, now let him die\" -- just think of him and his boredom! Buddha relieves him, he says it is unnecessary.\nIt is just natural. Trees bring seeds, then seeds bring trees, and trees again bring seeds. What is a seed? The disappearance of the tree; the tree has moved into no-form. You can carry\na seed in your pocket, you can carry a thousand seeds in your pocket, but you cannot carry a thousand trees in your pocket. The trees have form, bulk, mass; the seed has nothing. And if you look into the seed you will find nothing. If you had not seen, not known that a seed becomes a tree, and somebody gives you a seed and says, \"Look, this seed is very, very magical -- it can become a big tree, and there will be many fruits for many years, and great foliage and flowers and greenery, and birds will come and make nests there,\" you will say, \"What are you talking about? Out of this small pebble? Do you think I am stupid or something? How can it happen? It can't happen.\"\nBut you know it happens, that's why you don't take any note of it. A miracle is happening. The small seed is carrying the whole blueprint of the tree, of the leaves -- the shape and the size and the number -- and the branches, and the form of the branches, and the length and the height of the tree, and the life, and how many fruits and how many flowers will come out of it, and how many seeds finally this one seed is going to produce. Scientists say that even a single seed is enough to make the whole earth green. It has immense potentiality. Not only the whole earth -- one single seed can fill all the planets with greenery, because one seed can produce millions of seeds, then each seed will produce millions, and so on and so forth. The whole existence can become green out of a single seed. That nothingness is very potential, very powerful! Immense! Enormous! Vast!\nBuddha says nobody is producing it and nobody is stopping it. Buddha says there is no need to go to a temple and to pray and tell God, \"Do this, don't do that\" -- there is nobody.\nAnd what is his message? He says, \"Accept it. It is so. It is in the nature of things. It is just natural, things come and go.\"\nIn this acceptance, in this tathata, in this suchness, all worries disappear; you are freed from worries. Then there is no problem. And nothing can be stopped, and nothing can be changed, and nothing can be produced. Things are as they are and things will be as they will be, so there is nothing for you to do. You can just watch these things happening. You can participate in these things. Be... in that being there is silence, in that being there is joy. That being is freedom.\nTHESE ARE... NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE...\nThis existence is neither impure nor pure. There is nobody who is a sinner and nobody who is a saint.\nBuddha's insight is utterly revolutionary: he says nothing can be impure and nothing can be pure; things are just as they are. It is all mind games that we play around, and we create the idea of purity -- and then comes impurity. We create the idea of the saint -- and then in comes the sinner.\nYou want sinners to disappear? They can disappear only when your saints have disappeared, not before that. They exist together. You want immorality to disappear? -- then morality has to go. It is morality that creates immorality. It is the moral ideals that create condemnation for a few people who cannot follow them, who cannot go with them. And you can make anything immoral -- just create an idea: This is moral. You can make a holy cow out of anything, and then it becomes a problem.\nBuddha says nothing is ever defiled and nothing is ever immaculate. Purity, impurity, are mind attitudes. Can you tell about a tree whether it is moral or immoral? Can you say about an animal that he's a sinner or a saint? Try to see this ultimate vision: there is no sinner, no saint, nothing moral, nothing immoral. In this acceptance, where is the possibility of worrying? There is nothing to improve either! And there is no goal, because there is no value. This journey is a journey without any goal. It is a pure journey; it is a play, a leela. And there is nobody behind it, doing it. All is happening, and there is nobody doing it. If the doer is there then the problem arises -- then pray to the doer, then persuade the doer, then become friends with the doer. Then you will be benefitted, and those who are not friends with the doer will be deprived -- they will suffer in hell. That's what Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans think. Mohammedans think those who are Mohammedans are going to heaven and those who are not, poor fellows, they are going to hell. And the same is the case with Christians and Hindus: the Hindus think those who are not Hindus have no chance; the Christians think those who don't come through the church, those who don't pass through the church, are going to suffer eternal hell -- not limited, unlimitedly, forever.\nBuddha says: There is no sinner, no saint; nothing is pure, nothing is impure, things are as they are. Just try to persuade a tree, ask the tree, \"Why are you green? Why are you not red?\"\nAnd if the tree listens to you, she will go neurotic -- \"Why am I not red? Why? Really, the question is relevant. Why am I green?\" Condemn the green and praise the red, and sooner or later you will find the tree on some psychiatrist's couch being analyzed, helped.\nFirst you create the problem, and then comes the savior. It is a beautiful business.\nBuddha cuts the very root. He says: You are the way you are. There is nothing to improve, nowhere to go. And this is my whole approach too: you are as perfect as you can be, more is not possible. The 'more' will only create trouble for you. The idea of 'more' will drive you mad. Accept nature, live naturally, simply, spontaneously, moment-to-moment, and there is holiness -- because you are whole, not because you have become a saint.\n... NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.\nNothing is complete and nothing is incomplete; these values are meaningless. Says Buddha: Here, O Sariputra, where I exist, nothing is good, nothing is bad. Here, where I exist, samsara and nirvana are the same. There is no distinction between this world and that world. There is no distinction between the profane and the sacred. Here, where I exist, all distinctions have disappeared, because distinctions are made by thought. When thought disappears, distinctions disappear.\nSinners are created by thought, and saints are created by thought. Good and bad are created by thought. It is thought alone that makes distinctions. Buddha says: When knowledge disappears, thought disappears. There is no duality. It is all oneness.\nThere is a famous saying of Sosan:\nIN THE HIGHER REALMS OF TRUE SUCHNESS\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9552","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_heart_sutra/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_heart_sutra/>The Heart Sutra</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 Negation of Knowledge</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9552 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Heart_Sutra/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

understand your sannyas, it is his problem. You have to live your life.
Never compromise, otherwise you will miss much. Never compromise! If you
feel like becoming a sannyasin, become a sannyasin. Take the risk. If he
loves you there is no problem, he will understand -- because love gives
freedom. If he does not love you then there will be difficulty for him,
because he will feel you are getting out of his possession, you are
becoming independent, you are trying to be yourself. But to bow down to
such expectations is suicidal. That is his problem. You have to live
your life, he has to live his life. Nobody should try to impose things
on the other.</p><p>But my feeling is that you must also be imposing things on him,
that's why you are afraid. If you are not imposing anything on him, you
can be independent. But it is a mutual arrangement: people are slaves to
each other, and whenever you make a slave of somebody, remember, you are
making somebody your master too. It is a mutual arrangement. You must be
trying to manipulate your husband, you must be trying to force things
upon him, you must be making him a cripple. Now you want to be
independent, he will assert his independence too. Then he would like to
go his own way, and that you cannot afford. That is the real fear.</p><p>But if you don't do something that you like, that you wanted to do,
that you wanted to be, you will never be able to forgive him. And you
will take revenge, and you will be angry, and you will be in a rage --
because you will constantly think you wanted to become a sannyasin, and
it is only because of this man... And you will feel encaged, imprisoned.
Nobody likes being imprisoned. Then one hates the person who is the
cause of your imprisonment, then one tries to take revenge in subtle
ways. That will destroy your marriage.</p><p>Never create such a situation in which you cannot forgive the other.
Only two independent persons can forgive each other. Slaves cannot
forgive. And who knows, it may help him too, in some way.</p><p>I was reading one anecdote the other day:</p><p><br></p><p>Two explorers met in the wilds of the Amazon. The following exchange
took place.</p><p>First explorer: "I came out here because the urge to wander is in my
blood. Civilization sickens me. I like to see nature in its primitive
form. I would like to plant my footprints where no human being has ever
gone before. How about you? Why did you come out here?"</p><p>Second explorer: "My wife has become Osho's sannyasin, and she is
doing Dynamic Meditation in the morning and Kundalini in the evening --
that's why!"</p><p><br></p><p>But good! If your husband goes to the Amazon and becomes an explorer,
this is giving him a good opportunity to do something.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>3</p><p>Negation of Knowledge</p><p>13 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS FORM;
EMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM
EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS,
THAT IS FORM; THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,</p><p>PERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. HERE, O SARIPUTRA,</p><p>ALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR
STOPPED,</p><p>NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is the curse, the calamity, the cancer. It is through
knowledge that man becomes divided from the whole. Knowledge creates the
distance.</p><p>You come across a wildflower in the mountains, you don't know what it
is, your mind has nothing to say about it, the mind is silent. You look
at the flower, you see the flower, but no knowledge arises in you --
there is wonder, there is mystery. The flower is there, you are there.
Through wonder you are not separate, you are bridged.</p><p>If you know that this is a rose or a marigold, or something else,
that very knowing disconnects you. The flower is there, you are here,
but there is no bridge -- you know! Knowledge creates distance. The more
you know the bigger is the distance; the less you know the lesser the
distance. And if you are in the moment of not knowing, there is no
distance, you are bridged.</p><p>You fall in love with a woman or a man -- the day you fall in love
there is no distance. There is only wonder, a thrill, an excitement, an
ecstasy -- but no knowledge. You don't know who this woman is. Without
knowledge, there is nothing to divide you. Hence the beauty of those
first moments of love. You have lived with the woman only for
twenty-four hours; knowledge has arisen. Now you have some ideas about
the woman: you know who she is, there is an image. Twenty-four hours
have created a past. Those twenty-four hours have left marks on the
mind: you look at the same woman, there is no longer the same mystery.
You are coming down the hill, that peak is lost.</p><p>To understand this is to understand much. To understand that
knowledge divides, knowledge creates distance, is to understand the very
secret of meditation. Meditation is a state of not knowing. Meditation
is pure space, undisturbed by knowledge. Yes, the biblical story is true
-- that man has fallen through knowledge, by eating the fruit of the
tree of knowledge. No other scripture of the world surpasses that. That
parable is the last word; no other parable has reached to that height
and insight.</p><p>It looks so illogical that man has fallen through knowledge. It looks
illogical because logic is part of knowledge. Logic is all in support of
knowledge. It looks illogical, because logic is the root cause of man's
fall. A man who is absolutely logical, absolutely sane, always sane,
never allows any illogic in his life, is a madman. Sanity needs to be
balanced by insanity; logic needs to be balanced by illogic. The
opposites meet and balance. A man who is just rational is unreasonable
-- he will miss much. In fact he will go on missing all that is
beautiful and all that is true. He will collect trivia, his life will be
a mundane life. He will be the worldly man.</p><p>That biblical parable has immense insight. Why has man fallen through
knowledge? -- because knowledge creates distance, because knowledge
creates 'I' and 'thou', because knowledge creates subject and object,
the knower and the known, the observer and the observed. Knowledge is
basically schizophrenic; it creates a split. And then there is no way to
bridge it. That's why the more man has become knowledgeable, the less he
is religious. The more educated a man, the less is the possibility for
him to approach God.</p><p>Jesus is right when he says, "Only children will be able to enter
into my kingdom"... only children.</p><p>What is that quality that a child has and you have lost? The child
has the quality of non-knowledge, innocence. He looks with wonder, his
eyes are absolutely clear. He looks deep, but he has no prejudices, no
judgments, no a priori ideas. He does not project, hence he comes to
know that which is.</p><p>The other day we were talking about the distinction between reality
and truth. The child knows the truth, you know only the reality. The
reality is that which you have created around yourself -- projecting,
desiring, thinking. The reality is your interpretation of truth. Truth
is simply that which is; reality is that which you have come to
understand -- it is your idea of the truth. Reality consists of things,
all separate. Truth consists of only one cosmic energy. Truth consists
of oneness, reality consists of 'many-ness'. Reality is a crowd, truth
is integration.</p><p>Before we enter into the sutras, this has to become the foundation:
that knowledge is a curse.</p><p>J. Krishnamurti has said, "To negate is silence." To negate what? --
to negate knowledge, to negate mind, to negate this constant occupation
inside you; to create an unoccupied space. When you are unoccupied you
are in tune with the whole. When you are occupied you have fallen out of
tune. Hence, whenever it happens that you can attain a moment of
silence, there is immense joy. In that moment life has significance, in
that moment life has a grandeur beyond words. In that moment life is a
dance. In that moment if even death comes it will be a dance and a
celebration, because that moment knows nothing but joy. That moment is
joyous, it is blissful.</p><p>Knowledge has to be negated -- but not because I am saying so or
because J. Krishnamurti says so or because Gautam Buddha has said so. If
you negate because I am saying so, then you will negate your knowledge,
and whatsoever I am saying will become your knowledge in its place; you
will substitute it. The negation has not to come from the mind,
otherwise the mind</p><p>is very tricky. Then whatsoever I say becomes your knowledge, you
start clinging to it. You throw your old idols and you replace them with
new ones. But it is the same game played with new words, new ideas, new
thoughts.</p><p>Then how to negate knowledge? Not by other knowledge: just seeing
into the fact that knowledge creates distance, just seeing into this
fact intensely, totally, is enough. Not that you have to replace it with
something else; that intensity is fire, that intensity will reduce your
knowledge to ashes. That intensity is enough. That intensity is what is
known as 'insight'. Insight will burn your knowledge, and it will not be
replaced by other knowledge. Then there is emptiness, shunyata. Then
there is nothingness, because then there is no content; there is
undisturbed, undistorted truth.</p><p>You have to see what I am saying, you are not to learn what I am
saying. Here, sitting with me every day, listening to me, don't start
collecting knowledge. Here, listening to me, don't start hoarding.
Listening to me should be an experiment in insight. You should listen
with intensity, with totality, with as much awareness as is possible for
you. In that very awareness you will see a point, and that very seeing
is transformation. Not that you have to do something else afterwards;
the seeing itself brings mutation. If some effort is needed, that simply
shows you missed. If you come tomorrow and ask me, "I have understood
that knowledge is the curse, that knowledge creates distance. Now, how
to drop it?" -- then you missed. If the 'how' arises, then you missed.
The 'how' cannot arise, because the 'how' is asking for more knowledge.
The 'how' is asking for methods, techniques: "What should be done?" And
insight is enough; it need not be helped by any efforts. Its fire is
more than enough to burn all knowledge that you carry within you. Just
see the point.</p><p>Listening to me, go with me. Listening to me, hold my hand and move
in the spaces that I'm trying to help you to move in. And see what I am
saying, don't argue. Don't say yes, don't say no. Don't agree, don't
disagree. Just be with me in this moment -- and suddenly the insight is
there. If you are listening attentively... and by attention I don't mean
concentration; by attention I simply mean you are listening with
awareness, not with a dull mind; you are listening with intelligence,
with aliveness, with openness. You are here, now, with me. That's what I
mean by attention: you are nowhere else. You are not comparing in the
mind what I am saying with your old thoughts. You are not comparing at
all, you are not judging. You are not there judging inside, within you,
whether what I am saying is right or not, or how much is right.</p><p>Just the other day I was talking with a seeker. He has the quality of
a seeker, but is burdened by knowledge. While I was talking to him his
eyes became full of tears. His heart was just going to open, and in that
very moment the mind jumped in and destroyed the whole beauty of it. He
was just moving towards the heart and opening, but immediately his mind
came in. Those tears that were just on the verge of dropping,
disappeared. His eyes became dry. What had happened? -- I said something
with which he could not agree. He was agreeing with me, up to a certain
point. Then I said something which goes against his Jewish background,
which goes against the Kabbala, and immediately the whole energy
changed. He said, "Everything is right. Whatsoever you are saying is
right, but this one thing: that God has no purpose, that existence
exists purposelessly -- with this I cannot agree, because the Kabbala
says just the opposite: that life has purpose, that God is purposive,
that he is leading us towards a certain destiny, that there is a
destination."</p><p>He may not have even looked at it this way -- that he missed in that
moment because comparison came in. What does the Kabbala have to do with
me? When you are with me, put</p><p>away all your knowledge of the Kabbala, of yoga, of tantra, of this
and that. When you are with me, be with me. If you are totally with
me... and I am not saying that you are agreeing with me, remember. I am
not saying that you are agreeing with me: there is no question of
agreement or disagreement.</p><p>When you see a roseflower, do you agree with it or disagree with it?
When you see the sunrise, do you agree or do you disagree? When you see
the moon in the night, you simply see it! Either you see it or you don't
see it, but there is no question of agreement or disagreement.</p><p>That way, be with me; that is the way of being with a master. Just be
with me. I'm not trying to convince you about anything. I'm not trying
to convert you to some theory, philosophy, dogma, to some church, no!
I'm simply sharing what has happened to me, and in that very sharing, if
you participate, it can happen to you too. It is infectious. Insight
transforms.</p><p>When I am saying knowledge is a curse you can agree or disagree --
and you have missed! You just listen to it, just see into it, go into
the whole process of knowledge. You see how knowledge creates distance,
how knowledge becomes a barrier, how knowledge stands in between, how
knowledge goes on increasing and the distance goes on increasing, how
innocence is lost through knowledge, how wonder is destroyed, crippled,
murdered through knowledge, how life becomes a dull and boring affair
through knowledge. Mystery is lost, and with the mystery God is
lost.</p><p>Mystery disappears because you start having the idea that you know.
When you know, how can there be mystery? Mystery is possible only when
you don't know.</p><p>And remember, man has not known a thing! All that we have gathered is
just rubbish. The ultimate remains beyond grasp. What we have gathered
are only facts, truth remains untouched by our efforts. And that is the
experience not only of Buddha, Krishna, Krishnamurti and Ramana; that is
the experience even of Edison, Newton, Albert Einstein. That is the
experience of poets, painters, dancers. All the great intelligences of
the world -- they may be mystics, they may be poets, they may be
scientists -- are in absolute agreement about one thing: that the more
we know, the more we understand that life is an absolute mystery. Our
knowledge does not destroy its mystery. It is only stupid people who
think that because they know a little bit, now there is no more mystery
in life. It is only the mediocre mind that becomes too attached to
knowledge; the intelligent mind remains above knowledge. He uses it,
certainly uses it -- it is useful, it is utilitarian -- but knows
perfectly well that all that is true is hidden, remains hidden. We can
go on knowing and knowing, but God remains unexhausted.</p><p>Listen with insight, attention, totality. And in that very vision you
will see something, and that seeing changes you. You don't ask how.</p><p>That is the meaning when Krishnamurti says, "To negate is silence."
Insight negates. And when something is negated and nothing is posited
instead, something has been destroyed and nothing has been put, replaced
in its place, there is silence -- because there is space. There is
silence because the old has been thrown and the new has not been brought
in. That silence Buddha calls shunyata. That silence is emptiness,
nothingness. And only that nothingness can operate in the world of
truth.</p><p>Thought cannot operate there. Thought works only in the world of
things, because thought is also a thing -- subtle, but it is also
material. That's why thought can be recorded, that's why thought can be
relayed, conveyed. I can throw a thought at you; you can hold it, you
can have</p><p>it. It can be taken and given, it is transferable, because it is a
thing. It is a material phenomenon.</p><p>Emptiness cannot be given, emptiness cannot be thrown at you. You can
participate in it, you can move into it, but nobody can give it to you.
It is nontransferable. And only emptiness operates in the world of
truth. Truth is known only when mind is not. To know truth mind has to
cease, it has to go out of functioning. It has to be quiet, still,
unmoving.</p><p>Thought cannot operate in truth, but truth can operate through
thoughts. You cannot attain to truth by thinking, but when you have
attained it you can use thinking in its service. That's what I am doing,
that's what Buddha has done, that's what all the masters have done.</p><p>What I am saying is a thought, but behind this thought is emptiness.
That emptiness has not been produced by thought, that emptiness is
beyond thought. Thought cannot touch it, thought cannot even look at
it.</p><p>Have you observed one phenomenon? -- that you cannot think about
emptiness, you cannot make emptiness a thought. You cannot think about
it, it is unthinkable. If you can think about it, it will not be
emptiness at all. Thought has to go for emptiness to come; they never
meet. Once emptiness has come, it can use all kinds of devices to
express itself.</p><p>Insight is a state of no-thought. Whenever you see something, you
always see when there is no thought. Here also, listening to me, being
with me, sometimes you see. But those moments are gaps, intervals. One
thought has gone, another has not come, and there is a gap; and in that
gap something strikes, something starts vibrating. It is like somebody
playing on a drum: the drum is empty inside, that's why it can be played
upon. That emptiness vibrates. That beautiful sound that comes out is
produced out of emptiness. When you are, without a thought, then
something is possible, immediately possible. Then you can see what I am
saying. Then it will not be just a word heard, then it will become an
intuition, an insight, a vision. You have looked into it, you have
shared it with me.</p><p>Insight is a state of non-thinking, no-thought. It is a gap, an
interval in the process of thought, and in that gap is the glimpse, the
truth.</p><p>The English word empty comes from a root which means at leisure,
unoccupied. It is a beautiful word if you go to the root. The root is
very pregnant: it means at leisure, unoccupied. Whenever you are
unoccupied, at leisure, you are empty. And remember, the proverb that
says that the empty mind is the devil's workshop is just nonsense. Just
the opposite is the truth: the occupied mind is the devil's workshop.
The empty mind is God's workshop, not the devil's. But you have to
understand what I mean by 'empty' -- at leisure, relaxed, non-tense, not
moving, not desiring, not going anywhere, just being here, utterly here.
An empty mind is a pure presence. And all is possible in that pure
presence, because the whole existence comes out of that pure
presence.</p><p>These trees grow out of that pure presence, these stars are born out
of this pure presence; we are here -- all the Buddhas have come out of
this pure presence. In that pure presence you are in God, you are God.
Occupied, you fall; occupied, you have to be expelled from the garden of
Eden. Unoccupied you are back in the garden, unoccupied you are back at
home.</p><p>When the mind is not occupied by reality, by things, by thoughts,
then there is that which is. And that which is, is the truth. Only in
emptiness is there a meeting, merging. Only in emptiness do you open to
truth and truth enters in you. Only in emptiness do you become pregnant
with truth.</p><p>These are the three states of the mind. The first is content and
consciousness. You always have contents in the mind -- a thought moving,
a desire arising, anger, greed, ambition. You always have some content
in the mind; the mind is never unoccupied. The traffic goes on, day-in,
day-out. While awake it is there, while asleep it is there. While awake
you call it thinking, while asleep you call it dreaming -- it is the
same process. Dreaming is a little more primitive, that's all -- because
it thinks in pictures. It does not use concepts, it uses pictures. It is
more primitive; like small children think in pictures. So in small
children's books you have to make big pictures, colorful, because they
think through pictures. Through pictures they will learn words. By and
by those pictures become smaller and smaller, and then they
disappear.</p><p>The primitive man also thinks in pictures. The ancientmost languages
are pictorial languages. Chinese is a pictorial language: it has no
alphabet. It is the ancientmost language. In the night you again become
primitive, you forget your sophistication of the day and you start
thinking in pictures -- but it is the same.</p><p>And the psychoanalyst's insight is valuable -- that he looks into
your dreams. Then there is more truth, because you are more primitive;
you are not trying to deceive anybody, you are more authentic. In the
day you have a personality around you which hides you -- layers upon
layers of personality. It is very difficult to find out the true man.
You will have to dig deep, and it hurts, and the man will resist. But in
the night, just as you put your clothes away, you put your personality
away too. It is not needed because you will not be communicating with
anybody, you will be alone in your bed. And you will not be in the
world, you will be absolutely in your private realm. There is no need to
hide and no need to pretend. That's why the psychoanalyst tries to go
into your dreams, because they show much more clearly who you are. But
it is the same game played in different languages; the game is not
different. This is the ordinary state of the mind: mind and content,
consciousness plus content.</p><p>The second state of the mind is consciousness without content; that's
what meditation is. You are fully alert, and there is a gap, an
interval. No thought is encountered, there is no thought before you. You
are not asleep, you are awake -- but there is no thought. This is
meditation. The first state is called mind, the second state is called
meditation.</p><p>And then there is a third state. When the content has disappeared,
the object has disappeared, the subject cannot remain for long --
because they exist together. They produced each other. When the subject
is alone it can only hang around a little while more, just out of the
momentum of the past. Without the content the consciousness cannot be
there long; it will not be needed, because a consciousness is always a
consciousness about something. When you say 'conscious', it can be asked
"About what?" You say, "I am conscious of..." That object is needed, it
is a must for the subject to exist. Once the object has disappeared,
soon the subject will also disappear. First go the contents, then
consciousness disappears.</p><p>Then the third state is called samadhi -- no content, no
consciousness. But remember, this no-content, no-consciousness, is not a
state of unconsciousness. It is a state of superconsciousness, of
transcendental consciousness. Consciousness now is only conscious of
itself. Consciousness has turned upon itself; the circle is complete.
You have come home. This is the third state, samadhi; and this third
state is what Buddha means by shunyata.</p><p>First drop the content -- you become half-empty, then drop
consciousness -- you become fully empty. And this full-emptiness is the
most beautiful thing that can happen, the greatest benediction.</p><p>In this nothingness, in this emptiness, in this selflessness, in this
shunyata, there is complete security and stability. You will be
surprised to know about this -- complete security and stability when you
are not. All fears disappear... because what is the basic fear? The
basic fear is the fear of death. All other fears are just reflections of
the basic fear. All other fears can be reduced to one fear: the fear of
death, the fear that, "One day I may have to disappear, one day I may
have to die. I am, and the day is coming when I will not be" -- that
frightens, that is the fear.</p><p>To avoid that fear we start moving in such a way so that we can live
as long as possible. And we try to secure our lives -- we start
compromising, we start becoming more and more secure, safe, because of
the fear. We become paralyzed, because the more secure you are, the more
safe you are, the less alive you will be.</p><p>Life exists in challenges, life exists in crises, life needs
insecurity. It grows in the soil of insecurity. Whenever you are
insecure, you will find yourself more alive, more alert. That's why rich
people become dull: a kind of stupidity and a kind of stupor surrounds
them. They are so secure, there is no challenge. They are so secure,
they need not be intelligent. They are so secure -- for what do they
need intelligence? Intelligence is needed when there is challenge,
intelligence is provoked by challenge.</p><p>So because of the fear of death we strive for security, for a bank
balance, for insurance, for marriage, for a settled life, for a home; we
become part of a country, we join a political party, we join a religious
church -- we become Hindus, Christians, Mohammedans. These are all ways
to find security. These are all ways to find some place to belong to --
a country, a church. Because of this fear politicians and priests go on
exploiting you. If you are not in any fear, no politician, no priest can
exploit you. It is only out of fear that he can exploit because he can
provide -- at least he can promise -- that this will make you secure:
"This will be your security. I can guarantee." The goods may never be
delivered -- that's another thing -- but the promise... And the promise
keeps people exploited, oppressed. The promise keeps people in
bondage.</p><p>Once you have known this inner emptiness then there is no fear,
because death has already happened. In that emptiness it has happened.
In that emptiness you have disappeared. How can you be afraid anymore?
About what? About whom? And who can be afraid? In this emptiness all
fear disappears because death has already happened. Now there is no
longer any death possible. You feel a kind of deathlessness,
timelessness. Eternity has arrived. Now you don't look for security;
there is no need.</p><p>This is the state of a sannyasin. This is the state where a man need
not be a part of a country, need not be a part of a church, or stupid
things like that.</p><p>It is only when you have become nothing that you can be yourself. It
looks paradoxical. And you need not compromise, because it is out of
fear and greed that one compromises.</p><p>And you can live in rebellion because there is nothing to lose. You
can become a rebellion;</p><p>there is nothing to fear. Nobody can kill you, you have already done
that thing yourself. Nobody can take anything away from you; you have
dropped all that which can be taken away from you. Now you are in
nothingness, you are a nothingness. Hence the paradoxical phenomenon:
that in this nothingness arises a great security, a great safety, a
stability -- because there is no more death possible.</p><p>And with death, time disappears. With death disappear all the
problems that are created by death and by time. In the wake of all these
disappearances, what is left is a pure sky. This pure sky is samadhi,
nirvana. Buddha is talking about this.</p><p>These sutras have been addressed to one of Buddha's greatest
disciples, Sariputra. Why to Sariputra?</p><p>The first day I told you that there are seven planes, seven rungs of
the ladder. The seventh is the transcendental: Zen, Tantra, Tao. The
sixth is the spiritual-transcendental: yoga. Up to the sixth, method
remains important, 'how' remains important. Up to the sixth, discipline
remains important, ritual remains important, techniques remain
important. Only when you reach to the seventh do you see that to be
nothing is needed.</p><p>Sariputra is addressed in these sutras because Sariputra was at the
sixth center, the sixth rung. He was one of the greatest disciples of
Buddha. Buddha had eighty great disciples; Sariputra is one of the chief
amongst those eighty. He was the most knowledgeable man around Buddha.
He was the greatest scholar and pundit around Buddha. When he had come
to Buddha, he himself had five thousand disciples.</p><p>When he had come to Buddha for the first time he had come to argue,
to debate with and defeat Buddha. He had come with his five thousand
disciples -- to impress. And when he stood before Buddha, Buddha
laughed. And Buddha said to him, "Sariputra, you know much, but you do
not know at all. I can see you have accumulated great knowledge, but you
are empty. You have come to discuss and debate and to defeat me, but if
you really want to discuss with me, you will have to wait at least one
year."</p><p>Sariputra said, "One year? For what?"</p><p>Buddha said, "You will have to remain silent for one year; that will
be the price to be paid. If you can remain silent for one year then you
can discuss with me, because what I am going to say to you will come out
of silence. You need a little experience of it. And I see, Sariputra,
you have not even tasted a single moment of silence. You are so full of
knowledge, your head is heavy. I feel compassion for you, Sariputra. You
have been carrying such a load for many lives. You are not a brahmin
only in this life, Sariputra, you have been a brahmin for many lives.
And for many lives you have carried the Vedas and the scriptures. It has
been your style for many lives... but I see a possibility. You are
knowledgeable, but yet the promise is there. You are knowledgeable, but
your knowledge has not completely blocked your being; there are a few
windows still left. I would like, for one year, to clean those windows,
and then there is a possibility of our meeting and talking and being.
You be here for one year."</p><p>This was strange. Sariputra had been traveling all over the country,
defeating people. That was one of the things in India: knowledgeable
people used to travel all over the country and defeat others in great
debates and discussions, marathon debates. And that was thought to be
one of the greatest things to do. If somebody had become victorious all
over the country and he had defeated all the scholars, that was a great
ego satisfaction. That man was thought to be bigger than kings,
emperors. That man was thought to be greater than the rich people.</p><p>Sariputra was traveling. And naturally, you cannot declare yourself
the victorious one if you have not defeated Buddha. So he had come for
that. So he said, "Okay, if I have to wait for one year, I will wait."
And for one year he was sitting there in silence with Buddha. In one
year, the silence settled in him.</p><p>And after one year Buddha asked him, "Now we can discuss and you can
defeat me, Sariputra. I will be immensely happy to be defeated by
you."</p><p>And he laughed and touched Buddha's feet and said, "Initiate me. In
this one year's silence, listening to you, there have been a few moments
when the insight has happened to me.</p><p>Although I had come as the antagonist, I thought, 'While I am here
sitting for one year, why not listen to this man, to what he is saying?'
So out of curiosity I started listening. But sometimes those moments
came and you penetrated me, and you touched my heart, and you played on
my inner organ, and I have heard the music. You have defeated me without
defeating me."</p><p>Sariputra became Buddha's disciple, and his five thousand disciples
also became Buddha's disciples. Sariputra was one of the very well-known
scholars of those days. These sutras are addressed to Sariputra.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS FORM;
EMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM
EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS,
THAT IS FORM, THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,</p><p>PERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES, AND CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA... What does Buddha mean by 'here'? He means his
space. He says, "From the vision of my world, from the transcendental
standpoint, the space where I exist and the eternity where I
exist..."</p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA, FORM IS EMPTINESS AND THE VERY EMPTINESS IS
FORM;</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most important assertions. The whole Buddhist
approach depends on this: that the manifest is the unmanifest; that the
form is nothing but the form of emptiness itself, and the emptiness is
also nothing but the form, the possibility of the form. The statement is
illogical and obviously appears to be nonsense. How can form be
emptiness? They are opposites. How can emptiness be form? They are
polarities.</p><p>One thing has to be understood before we can enter into the sutra
rightly: Buddha is not logical, Buddha is dialectical.</p><p>There are two approaches towards reality: one is logical. Of that
approach, Aristotle is the father in the West. It simply moves in a
line, a clear-cut line. It never allows the opposite; the opposite has
to be discarded. This approach says A is A and never not A. A cannot be
not A. This is the formulation of Aristotelian logic -- and it looks
perfectly right, because we have all been brought up with that logic in
the schools, colleges, universities. The world is dominated by
Aristotle: A is A and never not A.</p><p>The second approach towards reality is dialectical. In the West that
approach is associated with the names of Heraclitus, Hegel. The
dialectical process says: life moves through polarities, through
opposites -- just as a river flows through two banks which oppose
each</p><p>other, but those opposing banks keep the river flowing between them.
This is more existential. Electricity has two poles, positive and
negative. If Aristotle's logic is of existence, then electricity is
very, very illogical. Then God himself is illogical, because he produces
new life out of the meeting of a man and a woman, which are opposites --
yin and yang, male and female. If God had been brought up by Aristotle
in an Aristotelian logic, in the linear logic, then homosexuality would
have been the norm and heterosexuality would have been perversion. Then
man would love man and woman would love woman. Then opposites could not
meet.</p><p>But God is dialectical. Everywhere, opposites are meeting. In you,
birth and death are meeting. Everywhere, opposites are meeting -- day
and night, summer and winter. The thorn and the flower, they are
meeting; they are on the same branch, they come out of the same source.
Man and woman, youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, body and soul,
the world and God -- all are opposites. This is a symphony of the
opposites. Opposites are not only meeting but creating a great symphony
-- only opposites can create a symphony. Otherwise life would be a
monotony, not a symphony. Life would be a boredom. If there were only
one note continuously being repeated, it would be bound to create
boredom. There are opposite notes: thesis meeting with the antithesis,
creating a synthesis; and in its own turn, synthesis again becomes a
thesis, creates an antithesis, and a higher synthesis evolves. That's
how life moves.</p><p>Thus Buddha's approach is dialectical, and it is more existential,
more true, more valid.</p><p>A man loves a woman, a woman loves a man -- then something else has
to be understood too. Now biologists say, and psychologists agree, that
man is not only man, he is woman too. And woman is not simply woman, she
is man too. So when a man and a woman meet, there are not two persons
meeting but four persons meeting. The man is meeting with the woman, but
the man has a hidden woman in himself; so has the woman a hidden man in
herself; they are also meeting. The meeting is on double planes. It is
more intricate, more complex, more intertwined. A man is man and woman,
both. Why? -- because he comes out of both. Something has been
contributed to you by your father and something has been contributed to
you by your mother, whosoever you are. A man flows in your blood and a
woman too. You have to be both because you are the meeting of the polar
opposites. You are a synthesis! It is impossible to deny one and just be
the other. That's what has been done.</p><p>Aristotle has been followed literally, in every way, and that has
created many problems for man -- and such problems which seem to be
unsolvable if Aristotle is to be followed. A man has been taught to be
just a man: never to show any feminine traits, never to show any
softness of the heart, never to show any receptivity, always be
aggressive. Man has been taught never to cry, never weep -- because
tears are feminine. Women have been taught never to be in any way like
the male: never to show aggression, never show expression, to always
remain passive, receptive. This is against reality, and this has
crippled both. In a better world, with better understanding, a man will
be both, a woman will be both -- because sometimes a man needs to be a
woman. There are moments when he needs to be soft -- tender moments,
love-moments. And there are moments when a woman needs to be expressive
and aggressive</p><p>-- in anger, in defense, in rebellion. If a woman is simply passive,
then she will turn into a slave automatically. A passive woman is bound
to become a slave -- that's what happened down the ages. And an
aggressive man, emphatically aggressive and never tender, is bound to
create wars, neurosis in the world, violence.</p><p>Man has been fighting, continuously fighting; it seems that man
exists on the earth just to fight. In three thousand years there have
been five thousand wars! War continues somewhere or other, the earth is
never whole and healthy... never a moment without war. Either it is in
Korea, or it is in Vietnam, or it is in Israel, or India, Pakistan, or
in Bangladesh; somewhere the massacre has to continue. Man has to kill.
To remain man, he has to kill. Seventy-five percent of energy is put
into war effort, into creating more bombs, hydrogen bombs, neutron
bombs, and so on and so forth. It seems that man's whole purpose here on
earth is war. The war heroes are respected the most. The war politicians
become the great names in history: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill,
Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong -- these names are going to remain. Why? --
because they fought great wars, they destroyed. Whether in aggression or
in defense -- that is not the point -- but these were the warmongers.
And nobody ever knows who was aggressive -- whether Germany was
aggressive or not, it all depends on who writes the history. Whosoever
wins will write the history, and he will prove the other was the
aggressor. History would be totally different if Adolf Hitler had been
victorious. Yes, the Nuremburg trials would have been there, but the
Americans and English and French generals and politicians would have
been on trial. And history would have been written by Germans; naturally
they would have a different vision.</p><p>Nobody knows what is true. One thing is certain: that man puts his
whole energy into war effort. The reason? -- the reason is that man has
been taught to be just man, his woman has been denied. So no man is
whole. And so is the case with woman -- no woman is whole. She has been
denied her male part. When she was a small child she could not fight
with boys, she could not climb on the trees; she had to play with dolls,
she had to play 'house'. This is a very, very distorted vision.</p><p>Man is both, so is woman -- and both are needed to create a real,
harmonious human being. The existence is dialectical; and opposites are
not only opposites, they are complementaries too.</p><p>Buddha says: HERE O SARIPUTRA -- in my world, Sariputra, in my space,
in my time, Sariputra, at the seventh rung of the ladder, in this state
of no-mind, in this state of samadhi, in this state of nirvana,
enlightenment -- FORM IS EMPTINESS. Man is woman and woman is man, and
life is death and death is life. Opposites are not opposites, Sariputra;
they are interpenetrating each other, they exist through each other. To
show this basic insight Buddha says: Form is formlessness, and
formlessness is form; the unmanifest becomes manifest, and the manifest
again becomes unmanifest. They are not different, Sariputra, they are
one. The duality is only apparent. Deep down it is all one.</p><p><br></p><p>EMPTINESS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM
EMPTINESS; WHATEVER IS FORM, THAT IS EMPTINESS, WHATEVER IS EMPTINESS,
THAT IS FORM; THE SAME IS TRUE OF FEELINGS,</p><p>PERCEPTIONS, IMPULSES AND CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p>The whole of life and the whole existence consists of polar
opposites, but only on the surface are they different. These opposites
are like my two hands: I can oppose them with each other, I can even
manage a kind of conflict, a fight between them. But my left hand and my
right hand are both my hands. Within me, they are one. That is exactly
the case.</p><p>Why is Buddha saying this thing to Sariputra? -- because if you
understand this your worries will disappear. Then there is no worry.
Life is death, death is life. To be is a way towards not-to-be, and
not-to-be is a way towards to be. It is the same game. Then there is no
fear, then there is no problem. With this insight a great acceptance
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA,</p><p>ALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR
STOPPED,</p><p>NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: All dharmas are full of emptiness. That nothingness
exists at everything's core: that nothingness exists in a tree, that
nothingness exists in a rock, that nothingness exists in a star.</p><p>Now scientists will agree: they say that when a star collapses it
becomes a black hole, nothingness. But that nothingness is not just
nothingness; it is immensely powerful, it is very full, overflowing.</p><p>The concept, the hypothesis of a black hole, is of immense value in
understanding Buddha. A star exists for millions and trillions of years,
but one day it has to die. Everything that is born has to die. Man
exists for seventy years, then what happens? Exhausted, tired, he
disappears, he falls back into the original unity. So it is going to
happen to everything, sooner or later. The Himalayas will disappear one
day, so will this earth disappear one day, so will this sun disappear
one day. But when a great star disappears, where will it disappear? It
collapses within itself. It is such a big mass; it collapses. Just as a
man walking -- an old man</p><p>-- falls on the street and collapses, if you leave the man there,
sooner or later his body will disappear, disintegrate into the mud, into
the earth. If you leave it there for many years, then the bones will
also disappear into dust. The man was there one day, walking, living,
loving, fighting, and now all has disappeared into a black hole. So does
it happen with a star: when a star collapses into itself it becomes a
black hole. Why is it called a black hole? -- because now there is no
mass, there is only pure emptiness, what Buddha calls shunyata. And the
shunyata, the pure emptiness, is so powerful that if you come under the
impact of it, near it, in its vicinity, you will be pulled, pulled into
the emptiness, and you will also collapse and disappear.</p><p>For space travel this is going to be a future problem, because there
are many stars which have become black holes. And you cannot see it
because it is nothing, it is just absence. You cannot see it, and you
can come across it. If a spaceship comes near it, under its gravitation,
it will simply be pulled in. Then there is no way to get out of it, it
is impossible to find a way to get out of it. The pull is so big it will
be simply pulled in, and it will disappear and collapse.</p><p>And you will never hear about the spaceship, where it went, what
happened to it, what happened to the space travelers.</p><p>This black hole is very, very like Buddha's concept of emptiness. All
forms collapse and disappear into blackness, and then when they have
rested for a long time, they bubble up -- again a star is born. This
goes on: life and death, life and death -- this goes on. This is the way
existence moves.</p><p>First it becomes manifested, then becomes tired, goes into
unmanifestation, then again revives its energy through rest, relaxation,
again becomes manifest. The whole day you work, you become tired; in the
night you disappear in your sleep into a black hole. You put your lights
out, you slip under your blanket, you close your eyes; then within
moments consciousness is gone. You have collapsed withinwards. There are
moments when even dreams are no longer there; then sleep is the deepest.
In that deep sleep you are in a black hole, you are dead. For the time
being you are in death, resting in death. And then in the morning you
are again back, full of juice and gusto and life, again rejuvenated. If
you have a really good, deep sleep without dreams, the morning is so
fresh, so vital, so radiant, you are again young. If you know how to
sleep deeply, you know how to revive yourself again and again. By the
evening again you are collapsing, tired, exhausted by the day's
activities.</p><p>The same happens to everything. Man is a miniature of the whole
existence. What happens to man happens to the whole existence on a
bigger scale, that's all. Every night you disappear into nothingness,
every morning you come into form. Form, no-form, form, no-form; this is
how life moves, these are the two steps.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE, O SARIPUTRA,</p><p>ALL DHARMAS ARE MARKED WITH EMPTINESS; THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR
STOPPED...</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha is saying: Nothing has to be done, only understanding is
needed.</p><p>This is a radical statement. It can transform your whole life if you
can see it as an insight.</p><p><br></p><p>... THEY ARE NOT PRODUCED OR STOPPED...</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is producing these forms, and nobody is stopping these forms.
Buddha does not believe in a God as manipulator, as a controller, as a
creator, no. That would be a duality, an unnecessary hypothesis. Buddha
says it is happening on its own; it is natural, nobody is doing it. It
is not that first God thinks, "Let there be light" -- as it says in the
Bible -- so there is light. And then one day he says, "Now, let there be
no light," and the light disappears. Why bring this God in? And why give
him such ugly work? And he will have to do it forever and forever: "Let
there be light, let there be no light, let there be light... Now let
this man be there, now let him die" -- just think of him and his
boredom! Buddha relieves him, he says it is unnecessary.</p><p>It is just natural. Trees bring seeds, then seeds bring trees, and
trees again bring seeds. What is a seed? The disappearance of the tree;
the tree has moved into no-form. You can carry</p><p>a seed in your pocket, you can carry a thousand seeds in your pocket,
but you cannot carry a thousand trees in your pocket. The trees have
form, bulk, mass; the seed has nothing. And if you look into the seed
you will find nothing. If you had not seen, not known that a seed
becomes a tree, and somebody gives you a seed and says, "Look, this seed
is very, very magical -- it can become a big tree, and there will be
many fruits for many years, and great foliage and flowers and greenery,
and birds will come and make nests there," you will say, "What are you
talking about? Out of this small pebble? Do you think I am stupid or
something? How can it happen? It can't happen."</p><p>But you know it happens, that's why you don't take any note of it. A
miracle is happening. The small seed is carrying the whole blueprint of
the tree, of the leaves -- the shape and the size and the number -- and
the branches, and the form of the branches, and the length and the
height of the tree, and the life, and how many fruits and how many
flowers will come out of it, and how many seeds finally this one seed is
going to produce. Scientists say that even a single seed is enough to
make the whole earth green. It has immense potentiality. Not only the
whole earth -- one single seed can fill all the planets with greenery,
because one seed can produce millions of seeds, then each seed will
produce millions, and so on and so forth. The whole existence can become
green out of a single seed. That nothingness is very potential, very
powerful! Immense! Enormous! Vast!</p><p>Buddha says nobody is producing it and nobody is stopping it. Buddha
says there is no need to go to a temple and to pray and tell God, "Do
this, don't do that" -- there is nobody.</p><p>And what is his message? He says, "Accept it. It is so. It is in the
nature of things. It is just natural, things come and go."</p><p>In this acceptance, in this tathata, in this suchness, all worries
disappear; you are freed from worries. Then there is no problem. And
nothing can be stopped, and nothing can be changed, and nothing can be
produced. Things are as they are and things will be as they will be, so
there is nothing for you to do. You can just watch these things
happening. You can participate in these things. Be... in that being
there is silence, in that being there is joy. That being is freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>THESE ARE... NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE...</p><p><br></p><p>This existence is neither impure nor pure. There is nobody who is a
sinner and nobody who is a saint.</p><p>Buddha's insight is utterly revolutionary: he says nothing can be
impure and nothing can be pure; things are just as they are. It is all
mind games that we play around, and we create the idea of purity -- and
then comes impurity. We create the idea of the saint -- and then in
comes the sinner.</p><p>You want sinners to disappear? They can disappear only when your
saints have disappeared, not before that. They exist together. You want
immorality to disappear? -- then morality has to go. It is morality that
creates immorality. It is the moral ideals that create condemnation for
a few people who cannot follow them, who cannot go with them. And you
can make anything immoral -- just create an idea: This is moral. You can
make a holy cow out of anything, and then it becomes a problem.</p><p>Buddha says nothing is ever defiled and nothing is ever immaculate.
Purity, impurity, are mind attitudes. Can you tell about a tree whether
it is moral or immoral? Can you say about an animal that he's a sinner
or a saint? Try to see this ultimate vision: there is no sinner, no
saint, nothing moral, nothing immoral. In this acceptance, where is the
possibility of worrying? There is nothing to improve either! And there
is no goal, because there is no value. This journey is a journey without
any goal. It is a pure journey; it is a play, a leela. And there is
nobody behind it, doing it. All is happening, and there is nobody doing
it. If the doer is there then the problem arises -- then pray to the
doer, then persuade the doer, then become friends with the doer. Then
you will be benefitted, and those who are not friends with the doer will
be deprived -- they will suffer in hell. That's what Christians, Hindus,
Mohammedans think. Mohammedans think those who are Mohammedans are going
to heaven and those who are not, poor fellows, they are going to hell.
And the same is the case with Christians and Hindus: the Hindus think
those who are not Hindus have no chance; the Christians think those who
don't come through the church, those who don't pass through the church,
are going to suffer eternal hell -- not limited, unlimitedly,
forever.</p><p>Buddha says: There is no sinner, no saint; nothing is pure, nothing
is impure, things are as they are. Just try to persuade a tree, ask the
tree, "Why are you green? Why are you not red?"</p><p>And if the tree listens to you, she will go neurotic -- "Why am I not
red? Why? Really, the question is relevant. Why am I green?" Condemn the
green and praise the red, and sooner or later you will find the tree on
some psychiatrist's couch being analyzed, helped.</p><p>First you create the problem, and then comes the savior. It is a
beautiful business.</p><p>Buddha cuts the very root. He says: You are the way you are. There is
nothing to improve, nowhere to go. And this is my whole approach too:
you are as perfect as you can be, more is not possible. The 'more' will
only create trouble for you. The idea of 'more' will drive you mad.
Accept nature, live naturally, simply, spontaneously, moment-to-moment,
and there is holiness -- because you are whole, not because you have
become a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>... NOT DEFILED OR IMMACULATE, NOT DEFICIENT OR COMPLETE.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is complete and nothing is incomplete; these values are
meaningless. Says Buddha: Here, O Sariputra, where I exist, nothing is
good, nothing is bad. Here, where I exist, samsara and nirvana are the
same. There is no distinction between this world and that world. There
is no distinction between the profane and the sacred. Here, where I
exist, all distinctions have disappeared, because distinctions are made
by thought. When thought disappears, distinctions disappear.</p><p>Sinners are created by thought, and saints are created by thought.
Good and bad are created by thought. It is thought alone that makes
distinctions. Buddha says: When knowledge disappears, thought
disappears. There is no duality. It is all oneness.</p><p>There is a famous saying of Sosan:</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE HIGHER REALMS OF TRUE SUCHNESS</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

From your vision, your neurotic vision, what I have is empty.\nBuddha looks empty -- just pure emptiness -- to you. Because of your ideas, because of your clingings, because of your possessiveness about things, Buddha looks empty. Buddha is full: you are empty. And his vision is absolute; your vision is very relative.\nThe sutra says:\nAVOLOKITA, THE HOLY LORD AND BODHISATTVA, WAS MOVING IN THE DEEP COURSE OF THE WISDOM WHICH HAS GONE BEYOND.\nHE LOOKED DOWN FROM ON HIGH, HE BEHELD BUT FIVE HEAPS,\nAND HE SAW THAT IN THEIR OWN BEING THEY WERE EMPTY.\nEmptiness is the key to Buddhism -- shunyata. We will be going into it more and more as we enter into the deeper realms of The Heart Sutra.\nMeditate over these sutras -- meditate with love, with sympathy, not with logic and reasoning. If you go to these sutras with logic and reasoning you will kill their spirit. Don't dissect them. Try to understand them as they are, and don't bring your mind -- your mind will be an interference.\nIf you can look at these sutras without your mind, great clarity is going to happen to you. Enough for today.\n2\nSurrender is Understanding\n12 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall\nThe first question:\nQuestion 1\nBELOVED OSHO, SOMETIMES WHILE JUST SITTING, THE QUESTION COMES UP IN THE MIND: WHAT IS TRUTH? BUT BY THE TIME I COME HERE I REALIZE THAT I AM NOT CAPABLE TO ASK. BUT MAY I ASK WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE QUESTION ARISES SO STRONGLY THAT HAD YOU BEEN NEARBY I WOULD HAVE ASKED IT. OR IF YOU HAD NOT REPLIED, I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HOLD OF YOUR BEARD OR COLLAR AND ASKED, \"WHAT IS TRUTH, OSHO?\"\nThat is the most important question that can arise in anybody's mind, but there is no answer for it. The most important question, the ultimate question, cannot have any answer; that's why it is ultimate.\nWhen Pontius Pilate asked Jesus, \"What is truth?\" Jesus remained silent. Not only that, the story says that when Pontius Pilate asked the question, \"What is truth?\" he did not wait to listen for the answer. He left the room and went away. This is very strange. Pontius Pilate also thinks that there cannot be an answer for it, so he didn't wait for the answer. Jesus remained silent because he also knows it cannot be answered.\nBut these two understandings are not the same, because these two persons are diametrically opposite. Pontius Pilate thinks that it cannot be answered because there is no truth; how can you answer it? That is the logical mind, the Roman mind. Jesus remains silent not because there is no truth, but because the truth is so vast, it is not definable. The truth is so huge, enormous, it cannot be confined in a word, it cannot be reduced to language. It is there. One can be it, but one cannot say it.\nFor two different reasons they behaved almost in the same way: Pontius didn't wait to hear the answer, he knew already that there is no truth. Jesus remains silent because he knows truth, and knows that it could not be said.\nChidvilas has asked this question. The question is absolutely significant. There is no question higher than that, because there is no religion higher than truth. It has to be understood; the question has to be analyzed. Analyzing the question, trying to understand the question itself, you may have an insight into what truth is. I will not answer it, I cannot answer it; nobody can answer it. But we can go deep into the question. Going deep into the question, the question will start disappearing. When the question has disappeared you will find the answer there at the very core of your heart -- you are truth, so how can you miss it? Maybe you have forgotten about it, maybe you have lost track of it, maybe you have forgotten how to enter into your own being, into your own truth.\nTruth is not an hypothesis, truth is not a dogma. Truth is neither Hindu nor Christian nor Mohammedan. Truth is neither mine nor yours. Truth belongs to nobody, but everybody belongs to truth. Truth means that which is: that is exactly the meaning of the word. It comes from a Latin root, verus. Verus means: that which is. In English there are a few words which are derivations of the Latin root verus: was, were -- they come from verus. In German, war -- that comes from verus. Verus means that which is, uninterpreted. Once the interpretation comes in, then what you know is reality, not truth. That is the difference between truth and reality. Reality is truth interpreted.\nSo the moment you answer the question, \"What is truth?\" it becomes reality; it is no longer truth. Interpretation has entered into it, the mind has colored it. And realities are as many as there are minds; there are multi-realities. Truth is one because truth is known only when the mind is not there. It is mind that keeps you separate from me, separate from others, separate from existence. If you look through the mind, then the mind will give you a picture of truth. That will be only a picture, a photograph of that which is. And of course, the photograph depends on the camera, on the film used, on the chemicals, on how it has been developed, how it has been printed, who has done it. A thousand and one other things enter in; it becomes reality.\nThe word reality is also beautiful to be understood. It comes from the root, res; it means thing or things. Truth is not a thing. Once interpreted, once the mind has grabbed it, defined it, demarked it, it becomes a thing.\nWhen you fall in love with a woman there is some truth -- if you have fallen absolutely unaware, if you have not 'done' it in any way, if you have not acted, managed, if you have not even thought about it. Suddenly you see a woman, you look into her eyes, she looks into your eyes, and something clicks. You are not the doer of it, you are simply possessed by it, you simply fall into it. It has nothing to do with you. Your ego is not involved, at least not in the very, very beginning, when love is virgin. In that moment there is truth, but there is no interpretation. That's why love remains indefinable.\nSoon the mind comes in, starts managing things, takes possession of you. You start thinking about the girl as your girlfriend, you start thinking of how to get married, you start thinking about the woman as your wife. Now these are things; the girlfriend, the wife -- these are things. The truth is no longer there, it has receded back. Now things are becoming more important. The definable is more secure, the indefinable is insecure. You have started killing, poisoning the truth. Sooner or later there will be a wife and a husband, two things. But the beauty is gone, the joy has disappeared, the honeymoon is over.\nThe honeymoon is over at that exact moment when truth becomes reality, when love becomes a relationship. The honeymoon is very short, unfortunately -- I'm not talking about the honeymoon that you go for. The honeymoon is very short. Maybe for a single moment it was there, but the purity of it, the crystal purity of it, the divinity of it, the beyondness of it -- it is from eternity, it is not of time. It is not part of this mundane world, it is like a ray coming into a dark hole. It comes from the transcendental. It is absolutely appropriate to call love God, because love is truth. The closest that you come to truth in ordinary life is love.\nChidvilas asks: \"What is truth?\"\nAsking has to disappear; only then do you know.\nIf you ask, \"What is truth?\" what are you asking? If I say A is truth, B is truth, C is truth, will that be the answer? If I say A is truth, then certainly A cannot be the truth: it is something\nelse that I am using as synonymous with truth. If it is absolutely synonymous, then it will be a tautology. Then I can say, \"Truth is truth,\" but that is silly, meaningless. Nothing is solved by it. If it is exactly the same, if A is truth, then it will mean truth is truth. If A is different, is not exactly truth, then I am falsifying. Then to say A is truth will be only approximate. And remember, there cannot be anything approximate. Either truth is or it is not. So I cannot say A is truth.\nI cannot even say, \"God is truth,\" because if God is truth then it is a tautology -- \"Truth is truth.\" Then I'm not saying anything. If God is different from truth, then I am saying something, but then I am saying something wrong. Then God is different, then how can he be truth? If I say it is approximate, linguistically it looks alright, but it is not right. 'Approximately' means some lie is there, something false is there. Otherwise, why is it not a hundred percent truth? If it is ninety-nine percent truth then something is there which is not true. And truth and untruth cannot exist together, just as darkness and light cannot exist together -- because darkness is nothing but absence. Absence and presence cannot exist together, truth and untruth cannot exist together. Untruth is nothing but the absence of truth.\nSo no answer is possible, hence Jesus remained silent. But if you look at it with deep sympathy, if you look into the silence of Jesus, you will have an answer. Silence is the answer. Jesus is saying, \"Be silent, as I am silent, and you will know\" -- not saying it in words. It is a gesture, it is very, very Zen-like. In that moment when Jesus remained silent, he comes very close to the Zen approach, to the Buddhist approach. He is a Buddha in that moment. Buddha never answered these questions. He had eleven questions listed: wherever he would move his disciples would go around and declare to people, \"Never ask these eleven questions of Buddha\" -- questions which are fundamental, questions which are really significant. You could ask anything else, and Buddha was always ready to answer. But don't ask the fundamental, because the fundamental can only be experienced. And truth is the most fundamental; the very substance of existence is what truth is.\nGo into the question. The question is significant, it is arising in your heart: \"What is truth?\" -- a desire to know that which is, is arising. Don't push it aside, go into it. Chidvilas, whenever it happens again, close your eyes, go into the question. Let the question become very, very focussed -- \"What... is... truth?\" Let there arise a great concentration. Forget everything, as if your whole life depends on this simple question, \"What is truth?\" Let it become a matter of life and death. And don't try to answer it, because you don't know the answer.\nAnswers may be coming -- the mind always tries to supply answers -- but see the fact that you don't know, that's why you are asking. So how can your mind supply you an answer? The mind knows not, so tell the mind, \"Keep quiet.\" If you know, then there is no need for the question. You don't know, hence the question.\nSo don't be befooled by the mind's toys. It supplies toys: it says, \"Look, it is written in the Bible. Look, it is written in the Upanishads. This is the answer. Look, this is written by Lao Tzu, this is the answer.\" The mind can throw all kinds of scriptures at you: the mind can quote, the mind can supply from the memory. You have heard many things, you have read many things; the mind carries all those memories. It can repeat in a mechanical way. But look into this phenomenon: that the mind knows not, and all that mind is repeating is borrowed. And the borrowed cannot help.\nIt happened at a railway crossing. The gates were closed, some train was to pass, and a man was sitting in his car, waiting for the train to pass, reading a book. A drunkard who was just sitting by the side of the gate came close, knocked on the air-conditioned car's window. The man opened the window and said, \"What can I do for you? Do you need any help?\"\nAnd the bum said, \"Yes, for two days I have not eaten anything at all. Can you give me two rupees? That will be enough for me, just two rupees.\"\nThe man laughed and said, \"Never borrow and never lend money,\" and showed the book to the bum and said, \"Shakespeare -- Shakespeare says so. Look.\"\nThe bum pulled out of his pocket a very dirty paperback and said to the man, \"You sonofabitch -- D. H. Lawrence.\"\nBeware of the mind. The mind goes on quoting, the mind knows all without knowing at all. The mind is a pretender. See into this phenomenon: this I call insight. It is not a question of thinking. If you think about it, it is again the mind. You have to see through and through. You have to look deeply into the very phenomenon, the functioning of the mind, how the mind functions. It borrows from here and there, it goes on borrowing and accumulating. It is a hoarder, a hoarder of knowledge. Mind becomes very knowledgeable, and then whenever you ask a question which is really important the mind gives a very unimportant answer to it -- futile, superficial, rubbish.\nA man bought a parrot from a pet shop. The shop-owner assured him the bird would learn to say hello within half an hour. Back home he spent an hour 'helloing' to the parrot, but not a word from the bird. As he was turning away in sheer despair, the bird said, \"Number engaged.\"\nA parrot is a parrot. He must have heard it in the pet shop. And this man was going on and on, \"Hello, hello, hello,\" and the bird was listening, and waiting for him to stop. Then he could say, \"Number engaged!\"\nYou can go on asking the mind, \"What is truth, what is truth, what is truth?\" And the moment you stop, the mind will immediately say, \"Number engaged\" or something. The mind will give you an answer. Beware of the mind.\nThe mind is the devil, there is no other devil. And it is your mind. This insight has to be developed -- of looking through and through. Cut the mind in two with a sharp blow of the sword. That sword is awareness. Cut the mind in two and go through it, go beyond it! And if you can go beyond the mind, through the mind, and a moment of no-mind arises in you, there is the answer -- not a verbal answer, not a scripture quoted, not in quotation marks, but authentically yours, an experience. Truth is an existential experience.\nThe question is immensely significant, but you will have to be very respectful towards the question. Don't be in a hurry to find any answer, otherwise some rubbish will kill the answer. Don't allow your mind to kill the question. And the way of the mind to kill the question is to supply answers, unlived, unexperienced.\nYou are truth! But it can happen only in utter silence, when not a single thought moves, when the mind has nothing to say, when not a single ripple is in your consciousness. When\nthere is no ripple in your consciousness, your consciousness remains undistorted. When there is a ripple, there is a distortion.\nJust go to a lake. Standing on the bank, look down at your reflection. If there are waves, ripples on the lake, and wind is blowing, your reflection is shaky. You cannot figure out what is what -- where is your nose and where are your eyes -- you can only guess. But when the lake is silent and the wind is not blowing and there is not a single ripple on the surface, suddenly you are there. In absolute perfection, the reflection is there. The lake becomes a mirror.\nWhenever there is a thought moving in your consciousness it distorts. And there are many thoughts, millions of thoughts, continuously rushing, and it is always rush-hour. Twenty-four hours a day it is rush-hour, and the traffic goes on and on and on, and each thought is associated with thousands of other thoughts. They are all holding hands and linked together and interlinked, and the whole crowd is rushing around you. How can you know what truth is? Get out of this crowd.\nThat's what meditation is, that's what meditation is all about: a consciousness without mind, a consciousness without thoughts, a consciousness without any wavering -- an unwavering consciousness. Then it is there in all its beauty and benediction. Then truth is there -- call it God, call it nirvana, or whatsoever you like to call it. It is there, and it is there as an experience. You are in it and it is in you.\nUse this question. Make it more penetrating. Make it so penetrating; put everything at stake so that the mind cannot befool you by its superficial answers. Once the mind disappears, once the mind is no longer playing its old tricks, you will know what truth is. You will know it in silence. You will know it in thoughtless awareness.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nMY SURRENDER IS GOAL-ORIENTED. I'M SURRENDERING IN ORDER TO WIN FREEDOM, SO IT IS NOT REAL SURRENDER AT ALL. I'M WATCHING IT, BUT THE PROBLEM IS: IT IS ALWAYS 'I' WHO IS WATCHING. THEREFORE EVERY REALIZATION OUT OF THAT WATCHING IS A REINFORCEMENT OF THE EGO. I FEEL TRICKED BY MY EGO.\nYou have not understood what surrender is.\nThe first thing to remember about surrender is: you cannot do it, it is not a doing. You can prevent it from happening, but you cannot manage for it to happen. Your power about surrender is only negative: you can prevent it, but you cannot bring it.\nSurrender is not something that you can do. If you do it, it is not surrender, because the doer is there. Surrender is a great understanding that, \"I am not.\" Surrender is an insight that the ego exists not, that, \"I am not separate.\" Surrender is not an act but an understanding.\nIn the first place you are false, the separation is false. Not for a single moment can you exist separate from the universe. The tree cannot exist if uprooted from the earth. The tree cannot exist if the sun disappears tomorrow. The tree cannot exist if no water is coming to its roots. The tree cannot exist if it cannot breathe. The tree is rooted in all the five elements -- what Buddhists call skandhas, the five groups we were talking about the other day. Avalokita... when Buddha came to the transcendental vision, when he passed through all the stages, when he passed through all the rungs of the ladder and came to the seventh -- from there he looked down, looked back -- what did he see? He saw only five heaps with nothing substantial in them, just emptiness, shunyata.\nThe tree cannot exist if these five elements are not constantly pouring energy into it. The tree is just a combination of these five elements. If the tree starts thinking, \"I am,\" then there is going to be misery for the tree. The tree will create a hell for itself. But trees are not so foolish, they don't carry any mind. They are there, and if tomorrow they disappear, they simply disappear. They don't cling; there is nobody to cling. The tree is constantly surrendered to existence. By surrendered it means it is never separate, it has not come to that stupid idea of the ego. And so are the birds, so are the mountains, so are the stars. It is only man who has turned his great opportunity of being conscious into being self-conscious. Man has consciousness. If consciousness grows, it can bring you the greatest bliss possible. But if something goes wrong and consciousness turns sour and becomes self-consciousness, then it creates hell, then it creates misery. Both alternatives are always open; it is for you to choose.\nThe first thing to be understood about ego is that it exists not. Nobody exists in separation. You are as much one with the universe as I am, as Buddha is, as Jesus is. I know it, you don't know it; the difference is only of recognition. The difference is not existential, not at all! So you have to look into this stupid idea of separation. Now if you start trying to surrender you are still carrying the idea of separation. Now you are thinking, \"I will surrender, now I am going to surrender\" -- but you think you are.\nLooking into the very idea of separation, one day you find that you are not separate, so how can you surrender? There is nobody to surrender! There has never been anybody to surrender! The surrenderer is not there, not at all -- never found anywhere. If you go into yourself you will not find the surrenderer anywhere. In that moment is surrender. When the surrenderer is not found, in that moment is surrender. You cannot do it. If you do it, it is a false thing. Out of falsity only falsity arises. You are false, so whatsoever you do will be false, more false. And one falsity leads to another, and so on and so forth. And the fundamental falsity is the ego, the idea, \"I am separate.\"\nYou ask: \"My surrender is goal-oriented.\"\nThe ego is always goal-oriented. It is always greedy, it is always grabbing. It is always searching for more and more and more; it lives in the more. If you have money it wants to have more money; if you have a house it wants to have a bigger house; if you have a woman it wants to have a beautiful woman, but it always wants more. The ego is constantly hungry. It lives in the future and in the past. In the past it lives as a hoarder -- \"I have this and this and this.\" It gets a great satisfaction: \"I have got something\" -- power, prestige, money. It gives a kind of reality to it. It gives the notion that, \"When I have these things, I must be there.\" And it lives in the future with the idea of more. It lives as memory and as desire.\nWhat is a goal? A desire: \"I have to reach there, I have to be that, I have to attain.\" The ego does not, cannot live in the present, because the present is real and the ego is false -- they\nnever meet. The past is false, it is no more. Once it was, but when it was present, ego was not there. Once it has disappeared, is no longer existential, ego starts grabbing it, accumulating it. It grabs and accumulates dead things. The ego is a graveyard: it collects corpses, dead bones.\nOr, it lives in the future. Again, the future is not yet -- it is imagination, fantasy, dream. Ego can live with that too, very easily; falsities go together perfectly well, smoothly well. Bring anything existential and the ego disappears. Hence the insistence of being in the present, being herenow. Just this moment... If you are intelligent there is no need to think about what I am saying; you can simply see into it this very moment! Where is the ego? There is silence, and there is no past, and there is no future, only this moment... and this dog barking. This moment, and you are not. Let this moment be, and you are not. And there is immense silence, there is profound silence, within and without. And then there is no need to surrender because you know you are not. Knowing that you are not is surrender.\nIt is not a question of surrendering to me, it is not a question of surrendering to God. It is not a question of surrendering at all. Surrendering is an insight, an understanding that, \"I am not.\" Seeing, \"I am not, I am a nothingness, emptiness,\" surrender grows. The flower of surrender grows on the tree of emptiness. It cannot be goal-oriented.\nThe ego is goal-oriented. The ego is hankering for the future. It can hanker even for the other life, it can hanker for heaven, it can hanker for nirvana. It doesn't matter what it hankers for -- hankering is what it is, desiring is what it is, projecting into the future is what it is.\nSee it! See into it! I'm not saying think about it. If you think about it you miss. Thinking again means past and future. Have a look into it -- avalokita! -- look into it. The English word look comes from the same root as avalokita. Look into it, and do it right now. Don't say to yourself, \"Okay, I will go home and do it.\" The ego has entered, the goal has come, the future has entered. Whenever time enters you are falling into that falsity of separation.\nLet it be here, this very moment. And then you suddenly see you are, and you are not going anywhere, and you are not coming from anywhere. You have always been here. Here is the only time, the only space. Now is the only existence. In that now, there is surrender.\n\"My surrender is goal-oriented,\" you say; \"I'm surrendering in order to win freedom.\"\nBut you are free! You have never been unfree. You are free, but again there is the same problem: you want to be free, but you don't understand that you can be free only when you are free from yourself -- there is no other freedom. When you think about freedom, you think as if you will be there and free. You will not be there; there will be freedom. Freedom means freedom from the self, not freedom of the self. The moment the prison disappears the prisoner also disappears, because the prisoner is the prison! The moment you come out of the prison, you also are not. There is pure sky, pure space. That pure space is called nirvana, moksha, liberation.\nTry to understand rather than trying to achieve. \"I am surrendering in order to win freedom.\"\nThen you are using surrender as a means, and surrender is the goal, is the end unto itself. When I say surrender is the goal, I'm not saying that surrender has to be achieved somewhere in the future. I'm saying that surrender is not a means, it is an end unto itself. It is not that surrender brings freedom, surrender is freedom! They are synonymous, they mean the same thing. You are looking at the same thing from two different angles.\n\"So it is not real surrender at all.\"\nIt is neither real nor unreal. It is not surrender at all. It is not even unreal.\n\"I am watching it, but the problem is it is always 'I' who is watching. Therefore every realization out of that watching is a reinforcement of the ego. I feel tricked by my ego.\"\nWho is this 'I' you are talking about who feels tricked by the ego? It is the ego itself. The ego is such that it can divide itself into fragments, into parts, and then the game starts. You are the chaser and you are the chased. It is like a dog trying to catch hold of its own tail, and goes on jumping. And you look and you see the absurdity of it -- but you see the absurdity, the dog cannot see it. The more he finds it is difficult to catch hold of the tail, the more he becomes crazy, the more he jumps. And the faster and the bigger the jump, the more the tail jumps faster and bigger also. And the dog cannot conceive what is happening: he's such a great catcher of everything, and this ordinary tail, and he cannot catch hold of it?\nThis is what is happening to you. It is 'I' who is trying to catch, and who is the catcher and the caught both. See the ridiculousness of it, and in that very seeing be free of it.\nThere is not a thing to be done -- not a thing, I say, because you are already that which you want to become. You are Buddhas, you have never been otherwise. Seeing is enough.\nAnd when you say that, \"I am watching,\" it is again the 'I'. Watching, the 'I' will be created again, because watching again is an act, there is effort involved. You are watching -- then who is watching? Relax. In relaxation -- when there is nothing to be watched and nobody as a watcher, when you are not divided into a duality -- there arises a different quality of witnessing. It is not a watching, it is just passive awareness; passive, I say -- remember. It has nothing aggressive in it. Watching is very aggressive: effort is needed, you have to be tense. But be non-tense, relaxed. Just be there. In that consciousness when you are simply there, sitting doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself.\nThat is the whole Buddhist approach: that anything that you do will create and enhance the doer -- watching also, thinking also, surrendering also. Anything that you do will create the trap. Nothing is needed to be done on your part. Just be... and let things happen. Don't try to manage, don't try to manipulate. Let the breeze pass, let the sunrays come, let life dance, and let death come and have its dance into you too.\nThis is my meaning of sannyas: it is not something that you do, but when you drop all doing and you see the absurdity of doing. Who are you to do? You are just a wave in this ocean. One day you are, another day you will disappear; the ocean continues. Why should you be so worried? You come, you disappear. Meanwhile, for this small interval, you become so worried and tense, and you take all the burdens on your shoulders, and you carry rocks on your heart -- for no reason at all.\nYou are free this very moment!\nI declare you enlightened in this very moment. But you don't trust me. You say, \"That's right, Osho, but just tell us how to become enlightened.\"\nThat becoming, that achieving, that desiring, goes on jumping on every object that you can find. Sometimes it is money, sometimes it is God. Sometimes it is power, sometimes it is meditation -- but any object, and you start grabbing it. Non-grabbing is the way to live the real life, the true life, non-grasping, non-possessing.\nLet things happen, let life be a happening, and there is joy, there is rejoicing -- because then there is no frustration, ever, because you had never expected anything in the first place. Whatsoever comes is good, is welcome. There is no failure, no success. That game of failure and success has been dropped. The sun comes in the morning and wakes you, and the moon comes in the evening and sings a lullaby and you go to sleep. Hunger comes and you eat, and so on and so forth. That's what Zen masters mean when they say: When hungry, eat, when sleepy, sleep, and there is nothing else to do.\nAnd I'm not teaching you inaction. I'm not saying don't go and work, I'm not saying don't earn your bread, I'm not saying renounce the world and depend on others and become exploiters; no, not at all. But don't be a doer. Yes, when you are hungry you have to eat, and when you have to eat you have to earn the bread -- but there is nobody doing it. It is hunger itself that is working; there is nobody else doing it. It is thirst itself that is taking you towards the well or towards the river. It is thirst itself moving; there is nobody who is thirsty. Drop nouns and pronouns in your life and let verbs live.\nBuddha says: The truth is that when you see a dancer, there is no dancer but only a dance. When you see a river, there is no river but only rivering. When you see a tree, there is no tree but only treeing. When you see a smile, there is nobody who is smiling, there is only smile, smiling. When you see love, there is nobody who is a lover but only loving. Life is a process.\nBut we are accustomed to thinking in terms of static nouns. That creates trouble. And there is nothing static -- all is flux and flowing. Flow with this, flow with this river, and never be a doer. Even when you are doing don't be a doer. There is doing but there is no doer. Once this insight settles in you there is nothing else.\nEnlightenment is not something like a goal that has to be attained. It is the very ordinary life, this simple life that surrounds you. But when you are not struggling, this ordinary life becomes extraordinarily beautiful. Then trees are more green, then birds sing in richer tones, then everything that is happening around is precious... then ordinary pebbles are diamonds.\nAccept this simple, ordinary life. Just drop the doer. And when I say drop the doer, don't become a dropper! Seeing into the reality of it, it disappears.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 'SHUNYAVADA' OF NAGARJUNA AND 'AVYAKRITOPADESH', THE UNSPOKEN AND THE UNDEFINABLE TEACHING OF LORD BUDDHA?\nThere is no difference at all. If a difference appears to be there, that is only because of the formulation. Nagarjuna is a great philosopher, one of the greatest of the world. Only a few people in the world, very few, have that quality of penetration that Nagarjuna has. So, his way of talking is very philosophical, logical, absolutely logical. Buddha is a mystic, not a philosopher. His way of saying things is more poetic than philosophical. The approach is\ndifferent, but Nagarjuna is saying exactly the same thing as Buddha. Their formulation is certainly different, but what they are saying has to be understood.\nYou ask -- the question is from Omanath Bharti -- \"Is there any difference between shunyavada...\" shunyavada means the theory, the philosophy of nothingness. In English there is no word which can be equivalent, appropriately equivalent, to shunya. Shunya means emptiness; but not negative, very positive emptiness. It means nothingness, but it does not mean simply nothingness; it means no-thing-ness. Shunya means void, void of everything. But the void itself is there, with utter presence, so it is not just void. It is like the sky which is empty, which is pure space, but which is. Everything comes in it and goes, and it remains.\nShunya is like the sky -- pure presence. You cannot touch it although you live in it. You cannot see it although you can never be without it. You exist in it; just as the fish exists in the ocean, you exist in space, in shunya. Shunyavada means that everything arises out of no-thing.\nJust a few minutes ago I was telling you the difference between truth and reality. Reality means the world of things, and truth means the world of no-thing, nothing -- shunya. All things arise out of nothing and dissolve back into nothing.\nIn the Upanishads there is a story:\nSvetaketu has come from his master's house, back to his parents. He has learned all. His father, Uddalaka, a great philosopher, looks at him and says, \"Svetaketu, you go outside and bring a fruit from yonder tree.\"\nHe goes out, brings a fruit. And the father says, \"Break it. What do you see in it?\" There are many seeds in it. And the father says, \"Take one seed and break it. What do you see in it?\"\nAnd he says, \"Nothing.\"\nAnd the father says, \"Everything arises out of this nothing. This big tree, so big that one thousand bullock carts can rest underneath it, has arisen out of just a seed. And you break the seed and you find nothing there. This is the mystery of life -- everything arises out of nothing. And one day the tree disappears, and you don't know where; you cannot find it anywhere.\"\nSo does man: we arise out of nothing, and we are nothing, and we disappear into nothing.\nThis is shunyavada.\nAnd what is Buddha's avyakritopadesh, the unspoken and the undefinable teaching? It is the same. He never made it so philosophically clear as Nagarjuna has made it. That's why he has never spoken about it. That's why he says it is indefinable; it cannot be brought to the level of language. He has kept silent about it.\nYou know the Flower Sermon? One day he comes with a lotus flower in his hand and sits silently, saying nothing. And the ten thousand disciples are there, the ten thousand bhikkhus are there, and they are waiting for him to say something, and he goes on looking at the lotus flower. There is great silence, and then there is great restlessness too. People start becoming fidgety -- \"What is he doing? He has never done that before.\"\nAnd then one disciple, Mahakashyapa, smiles.\nBuddha calls Mahakashyapa, gives him the lotus flower, and says to the assembly, \"What can be said I have said to you, and what cannot be said I have given to Mahakashyapa.\"\nThis is avyakritopadesh, this is the indefinable message. This is the origin of Zen Buddhism, the transmission. Something was transmitted by Buddha to Mahakashyapa, something which is nothing; on the visible plane nothing -- no word, no scripture, no theory -- but something has been transmitted. What?\nThe Zen monks have been meditating on this for two thousand five hundred years: \"What? What was transmitted? What exactly was given?\" In fact, nothing has been given from Buddha to Mahakashyapa; Mahakashyapa has certainly understood something. He understood the silence, he understood the penetrating silence. He understood that moment of clarity, that moment of utter thoughtlessness. He became one, in that moment, with Buddha. That's what surrender is. Not that he was doing it: Buddha was silent and he was silent, and the silences met, and the two silences dissolved into each other. And two silences cannot remain separate, remember, because a silence has no boundary, a silence is unbounded, a silence is simply open, open from all sides. In that great assembly of ten thousand monks there were two silences that day -- Buddha and Mahakashyapa. The others remained outside. Mahakashyapa and Buddha met: that's why he smiled -- because that was the greatest sermon that Buddha had ever preached. Not saying a single thing and he had said all, all that could be said -- and all that could not be said, that too.\nMahakashyapa understood and laughed. In that laughter Mahakashyapa disappeared totally, became a Buddha. The flame from the lamp of Buddha jumped into Mahakashyapa. That is called the 'transmission beyond scriptures' -- the Flower Sermon. It is unique in the history of human consciousness. That is what is called avyakritopadesh: the unspoken word, the unuttered word.\nSilence became so substantial, so solid; silence became so real, so existential; silence became tangible in that moment. Buddha was a nothing, Mahakashyapa also understood what it means to be a nothing, to be utterly empty.\nThere is no difference between Nagarjuna's shunyavada and Buddha's unuttered message. Nagarjuna is one of the greatest disciples of Buddha, and one of the most penetrating intellects ever. Only very few people -- once in a while, a Socrates, a Shankara -- can be compared with Nagarjuna. He was very, very intelligent. The uttermost that the intellect can do is to commit suicide; the greatest thing, the greatest crescendo that can come to the intellect is to go beyond itself -- that's what Nagarjuna has done. He has passed through all the realms of intellect, and beyond.\nThe logical positivists say that nothing is merely an abstraction. In the various instances of negative assertions -- for example: this is not sweet, I am not healthy, I was not there, he did not like me, etcetera, etcetera -- negation has no substance of its own. This is what the logical positivists say. Buddha does not agree, Nagarjuna does not agree. Martin Heidegger, one of the most penetrating intellects of the modern age, does not agree.\nHeidegger says there is an actual experience of nothing. It is not just something created by language; there is an actual experience of nothing. It is inseparably bound up with being. The experience that attests to this is that of dread. Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, also asks, \"What effect does nothing produce?\" and answers, \"It begets dread.\"\nNothing is an actual experience. Either you can experience it in deep meditation, or when death comes. Death and meditation are the two possibilities of experiencing it. Yes, sometimes you can experience it in love too. If you dissolve into somebody in deep love you can experience a kind of nothingness. That's why people are afraid of love -- they go only so\nfar, then panic arises, then they are frightened. That's why very few people have remained orgasmic -- because orgasm gives you an experience of nothingness. You disappear, you melt into something and you don't know what it is. You go into the indefinable, avyakrit. You go beyond the social. You go into some unity where separation is no longer valid, where ego exists not. And it is frightening, because it is deathlike.\nSo it is an experience, either in love, which people have learned to avoid -- so many go on hankering for love, and go on destroying all possibilities for it because of the fear of nothingness -- or, in deep meditation when thought stops. You simply see there is nothing inside, but that nothing has a presence; it is not simply absence of thought, it is presence of something unknown, mysterious, something very huge. Or, you can experience it in death, if you are alert. People ordinarily die in unconsciousness. Because of the fear of nothingness they become unconscious. If you die consciously... And you can die consciously only if you accept the phenomenon of death, and for that one has to learn for the whole life, prepare. One has to love to be ready to die, and one has to meditate to be ready to die. Only a man who has loved and meditated will be able to die consciously. And once you die consciously then there is no need for you to come back, because you have learned the lesson of life. Then you disappear into the whole; that is nirvana.\nThe logical positivists look very logical, but they miss something -- because reality is far more than logic. In ordinary experience we come only to what they say: this chair is here, this will be removed, then you will say there is no chair there. It simply indicates absence -- the chair has been removed. These are ordinary instances of nothingness: there was once a house and then it has been dismantled, it is no longer there. It is only an absence.\nBut there are nothingnesses deep inside your being, at the very core. At the very core of life, death exists. Death is the center of the cyclone. In love you come close to that, in meditation you come close to that, in physical death also you come close to that. In deep sleep, when dreams disappear, you come close to it. It is very life-giving, it is life-enhancing. A man who cannot sleep deeply will become ill, because it is only in deep sleep, when he dies into his deepest depth, that he regains life, energy, vitality. In the morning he is again fresh and full of zest, gusto -- vibrant, again vibrant.\nLearn to die! That is the greatest art to be learned, the greatest skill there is.\nHeidegger's standpoint comes very close to Buddha's, and his language is very modern, that's why I'm quoting him. He says: \"Every being, so far as it is a being, is made out of nothing.\" There is a parallel Christian doctrine too -- very neglected, because Christian theologicians cannot manage it, it is too much. The doctrine is creatio ex nihilo: the creation is out of nothing.\nIf you ask the modern physicist he will agree with Buddha: the deeper you go into matter, things start disappearing. A moment comes, when the atom is divided -- thing-hood completely disappears. Then there are electrons, but they are not things anymore, they are no-things. It is very difficult to understand. But physics, modern physics, has come very close to metaphysics -- because it is coming closer and closer to reality every day. It is approaching through matter, but coming to nothing. You know matter no longer exists in modern physics. Matter is just an illusion: it only appears, it is not there. The solidity of it, the substantiality of it, is all illusion; nothing is substantial, all is flux and energy. Matter is nothing but energy. And when you go deeper into energy, energy is not a thing, it is a no-thing.\nDeath is the point at which knowledge fails, and we become open to being -- that has been the Buddhist experience down the ages. Buddha used to send his disciples, when somebody had died, to see the body burning on the funeral pyre: \"Meditate there, meditate on the nothingness of life.\" Death is the point at which knowledge fails, and when knowledge fails, mind fails. And when mind fails, there is a possibility of truth penetrating you.\nBut people don't know. When somebody dies you don't know what to do, you are very embarrassed. When somebody dies it is a great moment to meditate.\nI always think that each city needs a Death Center. When somebody is dying and his death is very, very imminent he should be moved to the Death Center. It should be a small temple where people who can go deep in meditation should sit around him, should help him to die, and should participate in his being when he disappears into nothing. When somebody disappears into nothing great energy is released. The energy that was there, surrounding him, is released. If you are in a silent space around him, you will go on a great trip. No psychedelic can take you there. The man is naturally releasing great energy; if you can absorb that energy, you will also kind of die with him. And you will see the ultimate -- the source and the goal, the beginning and the end.\n\"Man is the being by whom nothing comes into the world,\" says Jean-Paul Sartre. Consciousness is not this or that object, it is not any object at all; but surely it is itself? \"No,\" says Sartre, \"that is precisely what it is not. Consciousness is never identical with itself. Thus, when I reflect upon myself, the self that is reflected is other than the self that reflects. When I try to state what I am, I fail, because while I am speaking, what I am talking about slips away into the past and becomes what I was. I am my past and my future, and yet I am not. I have been the one, and I shall be the other. But in the present, there is nothingness.\"\nIf somebody asks you, \"Who are you?\" what are you going to say? Either you can answer out of the past, which is no more, or you can answer out of the future, which you are not yet. But who are you right in this moment? A nobody, a nothingness. This nothingness is the very core, the heart -- the heart of your being.\nDeath is not the ax that cuts down the tree of life, it is the fruit that grows on it. Death is the very substance you are made of. Nothingness is your very being. Attain to this nothingness either through love or meditation, and go on having glimpses of it. This is what Nagarjuna means by shunya. This is what Buddha transferred that day when he delivered the Flower Sermon. This is what Mahakashyapa understood when he laughed. He saw nothingness, and the purity of it, the innocence of it, the primal innocence of it, the radiance of it, the immortality of it -- because nothingness cannot die. Things die; nothingness is immortal, eternal.\nIf you are identified with anything, you will suffer death. But if you know that you are death, how can you suffer death? Then nothing can destroy you; nothingness is indestructible.\nA Buddhist parable narrates that the king of hell asked a newly arrived spirit whether during life he had met the three heavenly messengers. And when he answered, \"No, my Lord, I did not,\" he asked whether he had ever seen an old man bent with age, or a poor and friendless sick man, or a dead man?\nBuddhists call these three 'the messengers of God': old age, sickness, death -- three messengers of God. Why? -- because only through these experiences in life do you become aware of death. And if you become aware of death and you start learning how to go into it,\nhow to welcome it, how to receive it, you are released from the bondage, from the wheel of life and death.\nHeidegger says, and so does Síren Kierkegaard, that nothingness creates dread. That is only half of the story. Because these two people are just philosophers, that's why it creates dread.\nIf you ask Buddha, Mahakashyapa, Nagarjuna, if you ask me, death looked at only partially creates dread; looked at absolutely, totally, it frees you from all dread, from all anguish, from all anxiety, it frees you from SAMSARA... because if you look partly then it creates fear that you are going to die, that you will become a nothing, that soon you will disappear. And naturally you feel nervous, shaken, uprooted. If you look at death totally, then you know you are death, you are made of it. So nothing is going to disappear, nothing is going to remain. Only nothingness is.\nBuddhism is not a pessimistic religion as has been thought by many people. Buddhism is the way to get rid of both optimism and pessimism, to get rid of duality.\nStart meditating on death. And whenever you feel death close by, go into it through the door of love, through the door of meditation, through the door of a man dying. And if some day you are dying -- and the day is going to come one day -- receive it in joy, benediction. And if you can receive death in joy and benediction, you will attain to the greatest peak, because death is the crescendo of life. Hidden in it is the greatest orgasm, because hidden in it is the greatest freedom.\nDeath is making love to God, or God making love to you. Death is cosmic, total orgasm. So drop all ideas that you carry about death -- they are dangerous. They make you antagonistic to the greatest experience that you need to have. If you miss death you will be born again. Unless you have learned how to die, you will go on being born again and again and again. This is the wheel, samsara, the world. Once you have known the greatest orgasm, then there is no need; you disappear, and you remain in that orgasm forever. You don't remain like you, you don't remain as an entity, you don't remain defined, identified with anything. You remain as the whole, not as the part.\nThis is Nagarjuna's shunyavada, and this is Buddha's unspoken message, the unspoken word. They are both the same.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 4\nBELOVED OSHO, I AM AFRAID OF TAKING SANNYAS, ALTHOUGH I AM IMMENSELY ATTRACTED. I AM AFRAID BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT.\nYou are not very respectful towards your husband. Do you think he's stupid or something? Why should he not be able to understand it? If he loves you, he will understand it. Love is understanding. If he does not love you, then whether you take sannyas or not, he's not going to understand you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9065","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_heart_sutra/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_heart_sutra/>The Heart Sutra</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Surrender is Understanding</h1><div class=post-meta>43 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9065 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Heart_Sutra/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE MIND: WHAT IS TRUTH? BUT BY THE TIME I COME HERE I REALIZE THAT I AM
NOT CAPABLE TO ASK. BUT MAY I ASK WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE
QUESTION ARISES SO STRONGLY THAT HAD YOU BEEN NEARBY I WOULD HAVE ASKED
IT. OR IF YOU HAD NOT REPLIED, I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HOLD OF YOUR BEARD OR
COLLAR AND ASKED, "WHAT IS TRUTH, OSHO?"</p><p><br></p><p>That is the most important question that can arise in anybody's mind,
but there is no answer for it. The most important question, the ultimate
question, cannot have any answer; that's why it is ultimate.</p><p>When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus, "What is truth?" Jesus remained
silent. Not only that, the story says that when Pontius Pilate asked the
question, "What is truth?" he did not wait to listen for the answer. He
left the room and went away. This is very strange. Pontius Pilate also
thinks that there cannot be an answer for it, so he didn't wait for the
answer. Jesus remained silent because he also knows it cannot be
answered.</p><p>But these two understandings are not the same, because these two
persons are diametrically opposite. Pontius Pilate thinks that it cannot
be answered because there is no truth; how can you answer it? That is
the logical mind, the Roman mind. Jesus remains silent not because there
is no truth, but because the truth is so vast, it is not definable. The
truth is so huge, enormous, it cannot be confined in a word, it cannot
be reduced to language. It is there. One can be it, but one cannot say
it.</p><p>For two different reasons they behaved almost in the same way:
Pontius didn't wait to hear the answer, he knew already that there is no
truth. Jesus remains silent because he knows truth, and knows that it
could not be said.</p><p>Chidvilas has asked this question. The question is absolutely
significant. There is no question higher than that, because there is no
religion higher than truth. It has to be understood; the question has to
be analyzed. Analyzing the question, trying to understand the question
itself, you may have an insight into what truth is. I will not answer
it, I cannot answer it; nobody can answer it. But we can go deep into
the question. Going deep into the question, the question will start
disappearing. When the question has disappeared you will find the answer
there at the very core of your heart -- you are truth, so how can you
miss it? Maybe you have forgotten about it, maybe you have lost track of
it, maybe you have forgotten how to enter into your own being, into your
own truth.</p><p>Truth is not an hypothesis, truth is not a dogma. Truth is neither
Hindu nor Christian nor Mohammedan. Truth is neither mine nor yours.
Truth belongs to nobody, but everybody belongs to truth. Truth means
that which is: that is exactly the meaning of the word. It comes from a
Latin root, verus. Verus means: that which is. In English there are a
few words which are derivations of the Latin root verus: was, were --
they come from verus. In German, war -- that comes from verus. Verus
means that which is, uninterpreted. Once the interpretation comes in,
then what you know is reality, not truth. That is the difference between
truth and reality. Reality is truth interpreted.</p><p>So the moment you answer the question, "What is truth?" it becomes
reality; it is no longer truth. Interpretation has entered into it, the
mind has colored it. And realities are as many as there are minds; there
are multi-realities. Truth is one because truth is known only when the
mind is not there. It is mind that keeps you separate from me, separate
from others, separate from existence. If you look through the mind, then
the mind will give you a picture of truth. That will be only a picture,
a photograph of that which is. And of course, the photograph depends on
the camera, on the film used, on the chemicals, on how it has been
developed, how it has been printed, who has done it. A thousand and one
other things enter in; it becomes reality.</p><p>The word reality is also beautiful to be understood. It comes from
the root, res; it means thing or things. Truth is not a thing. Once
interpreted, once the mind has grabbed it, defined it, demarked it, it
becomes a thing.</p><p>When you fall in love with a woman there is some truth -- if you have
fallen absolutely unaware, if you have not 'done' it in any way, if you
have not acted, managed, if you have not even thought about it. Suddenly
you see a woman, you look into her eyes, she looks into your eyes, and
something clicks. You are not the doer of it, you are simply possessed
by it, you simply fall into it. It has nothing to do with you. Your ego
is not involved, at least not in the very, very beginning, when love is
virgin. In that moment there is truth, but there is no interpretation.
That's why love remains indefinable.</p><p>Soon the mind comes in, starts managing things, takes possession of
you. You start thinking about the girl as your girlfriend, you start
thinking of how to get married, you start thinking about the woman as
your wife. Now these are things; the girlfriend, the wife -- these are
things. The truth is no longer there, it has receded back. Now things
are becoming more important. The definable is more secure, the
indefinable is insecure. You have started killing, poisoning the truth.
Sooner or later there will be a wife and a husband, two things. But the
beauty is gone, the joy has disappeared, the honeymoon is over.</p><p>The honeymoon is over at that exact moment when truth becomes
reality, when love becomes a relationship. The honeymoon is very short,
unfortunately -- I'm not talking about the honeymoon that you go for.
The honeymoon is very short. Maybe for a single moment it was there, but
the purity of it, the crystal purity of it, the divinity of it, the
beyondness of it -- it is from eternity, it is not of time. It is not
part of this mundane world, it is like a ray coming into a dark hole. It
comes from the transcendental. It is absolutely appropriate to call love
God, because love is truth. The closest that you come to truth in
ordinary life is love.</p><p>Chidvilas asks: "What is truth?"</p><p>Asking has to disappear; only then do you know.</p><p>If you ask, "What is truth?" what are you asking? If I say A is
truth, B is truth, C is truth, will that be the answer? If I say A is
truth, then certainly A cannot be the truth: it is something</p><p>else that I am using as synonymous with truth. If it is absolutely
synonymous, then it will be a tautology. Then I can say, "Truth is
truth," but that is silly, meaningless. Nothing is solved by it. If it
is exactly the same, if A is truth, then it will mean truth is truth. If
A is different, is not exactly truth, then I am falsifying. Then to say
A is truth will be only approximate. And remember, there cannot be
anything approximate. Either truth is or it is not. So I cannot say A is
truth.</p><p>I cannot even say, "God is truth," because if God is truth then it is
a tautology -- "Truth is truth." Then I'm not saying anything. If God is
different from truth, then I am saying something, but then I am saying
something wrong. Then God is different, then how can he be truth? If I
say it is approximate, linguistically it looks alright, but it is not
right. 'Approximately' means some lie is there, something false is
there. Otherwise, why is it not a hundred percent truth? If it is
ninety-nine percent truth then something is there which is not true. And
truth and untruth cannot exist together, just as darkness and light
cannot exist together -- because darkness is nothing but absence.
Absence and presence cannot exist together, truth and untruth cannot
exist together. Untruth is nothing but the absence of truth.</p><p>So no answer is possible, hence Jesus remained silent. But if you
look at it with deep sympathy, if you look into the silence of Jesus,
you will have an answer. Silence is the answer. Jesus is saying, "Be
silent, as I am silent, and you will know" -- not saying it in words. It
is a gesture, it is very, very Zen-like. In that moment when Jesus
remained silent, he comes very close to the Zen approach, to the
Buddhist approach. He is a Buddha in that moment. Buddha never answered
these questions. He had eleven questions listed: wherever he would move
his disciples would go around and declare to people, "Never ask these
eleven questions of Buddha" -- questions which are fundamental,
questions which are really significant. You could ask anything else, and
Buddha was always ready to answer. But don't ask the fundamental,
because the fundamental can only be experienced. And truth is the most
fundamental; the very substance of existence is what truth is.</p><p>Go into the question. The question is significant, it is arising in
your heart: "What is truth?" -- a desire to know that which is, is
arising. Don't push it aside, go into it. Chidvilas, whenever it happens
again, close your eyes, go into the question. Let the question become
very, very focussed -- "What... is... truth?" Let there arise a great
concentration. Forget everything, as if your whole life depends on this
simple question, "What is truth?" Let it become a matter of life and
death. And don't try to answer it, because you don't know the
answer.</p><p>Answers may be coming -- the mind always tries to supply answers --
but see the fact that you don't know, that's why you are asking. So how
can your mind supply you an answer? The mind knows not, so tell the
mind, "Keep quiet." If you know, then there is no need for the question.
You don't know, hence the question.</p><p>So don't be befooled by the mind's toys. It supplies toys: it says,
"Look, it is written in the Bible. Look, it is written in the
Upanishads. This is the answer. Look, this is written by Lao Tzu, this
is the answer." The mind can throw all kinds of scriptures at you: the
mind can quote, the mind can supply from the memory. You have heard many
things, you have read many things; the mind carries all those memories.
It can repeat in a mechanical way. But look into this phenomenon: that
the mind knows not, and all that mind is repeating is borrowed. And the
borrowed cannot help.</p><p>It happened at a railway crossing. The gates were closed, some train
was to pass, and a man was sitting in his car, waiting for the train to
pass, reading a book. A drunkard who was just sitting by the side of the
gate came close, knocked on the air-conditioned car's window. The man
opened the window and said, "What can I do for you? Do you need any
help?"</p><p>And the bum said, "Yes, for two days I have not eaten anything at
all. Can you give me two rupees? That will be enough for me, just two
rupees."</p><p>The man laughed and said, "Never borrow and never lend money," and
showed the book to the bum and said, "Shakespeare -- Shakespeare says
so. Look."</p><p>The bum pulled out of his pocket a very dirty paperback and said to
the man, "You sonofabitch -- D. H. Lawrence."</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of the mind. The mind goes on quoting, the mind knows all
without knowing at all. The mind is a pretender. See into this
phenomenon: this I call insight. It is not a question of thinking. If
you think about it, it is again the mind. You have to see through and
through. You have to look deeply into the very phenomenon, the
functioning of the mind, how the mind functions. It borrows from here
and there, it goes on borrowing and accumulating. It is a hoarder, a
hoarder of knowledge. Mind becomes very knowledgeable, and then whenever
you ask a question which is really important the mind gives a very
unimportant answer to it -- futile, superficial, rubbish.</p><p><br></p><p>A man bought a parrot from a pet shop. The shop-owner assured him the
bird would learn to say hello within half an hour. Back home he spent an
hour 'helloing' to the parrot, but not a word from the bird. As he was
turning away in sheer despair, the bird said, "Number engaged."</p><p><br></p><p>A parrot is a parrot. He must have heard it in the pet shop. And this
man was going on and on, "Hello, hello, hello," and the bird was
listening, and waiting for him to stop. Then he could say, "Number
engaged!"</p><p>You can go on asking the mind, "What is truth, what is truth, what is
truth?" And the moment you stop, the mind will immediately say, "Number
engaged" or something. The mind will give you an answer. Beware of the
mind.</p><p>The mind is the devil, there is no other devil. And it is your mind.
This insight has to be developed -- of looking through and through. Cut
the mind in two with a sharp blow of the sword. That sword is awareness.
Cut the mind in two and go through it, go beyond it! And if you can go
beyond the mind, through the mind, and a moment of no-mind arises in
you, there is the answer -- not a verbal answer, not a scripture quoted,
not in quotation marks, but authentically yours, an experience. Truth is
an existential experience.</p><p>The question is immensely significant, but you will have to be very
respectful towards the question. Don't be in a hurry to find any answer,
otherwise some rubbish will kill the answer. Don't allow your mind to
kill the question. And the way of the mind to kill the question is to
supply answers, unlived, unexperienced.</p><p>You are truth! But it can happen only in utter silence, when not a
single thought moves, when the mind has nothing to say, when not a
single ripple is in your consciousness. When</p><p>there is no ripple in your consciousness, your consciousness remains
undistorted. When there is a ripple, there is a distortion.</p><p>Just go to a lake. Standing on the bank, look down at your
reflection. If there are waves, ripples on the lake, and wind is
blowing, your reflection is shaky. You cannot figure out what is what --
where is your nose and where are your eyes -- you can only guess. But
when the lake is silent and the wind is not blowing and there is not a
single ripple on the surface, suddenly you are there. In absolute
perfection, the reflection is there. The lake becomes a mirror.</p><p>Whenever there is a thought moving in your consciousness it distorts.
And there are many thoughts, millions of thoughts, continuously rushing,
and it is always rush-hour. Twenty-four hours a day it is rush-hour, and
the traffic goes on and on and on, and each thought is associated with
thousands of other thoughts. They are all holding hands and linked
together and interlinked, and the whole crowd is rushing around you. How
can you know what truth is? Get out of this crowd.</p><p>That's what meditation is, that's what meditation is all about: a
consciousness without mind, a consciousness without thoughts, a
consciousness without any wavering -- an unwavering consciousness. Then
it is there in all its beauty and benediction. Then truth is there --
call it God, call it nirvana, or whatsoever you like to call it. It is
there, and it is there as an experience. You are in it and it is in
you.</p><p>Use this question. Make it more penetrating. Make it so penetrating;
put everything at stake so that the mind cannot befool you by its
superficial answers. Once the mind disappears, once the mind is no
longer playing its old tricks, you will know what truth is. You will
know it in silence. You will know it in thoughtless awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MY SURRENDER IS GOAL-ORIENTED. I'M SURRENDERING IN ORDER TO WIN
FREEDOM, SO IT IS NOT REAL SURRENDER AT ALL. I'M WATCHING IT, BUT THE
PROBLEM IS: IT IS ALWAYS 'I' WHO IS WATCHING. THEREFORE EVERY
REALIZATION OUT OF THAT WATCHING IS A REINFORCEMENT OF THE EGO. I FEEL
TRICKED BY MY EGO.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not understood what surrender is.</p><p>The first thing to remember about surrender is: you cannot do it, it
is not a doing. You can prevent it from happening, but you cannot manage
for it to happen. Your power about surrender is only negative: you can
prevent it, but you cannot bring it.</p><p>Surrender is not something that you can do. If you do it, it is not
surrender, because the doer is there. Surrender is a great understanding
that, "I am not." Surrender is an insight that the ego exists not, that,
"I am not separate." Surrender is not an act but an understanding.</p><p>In the first place you are false, the separation is false. Not for a
single moment can you exist separate from the universe. The tree cannot
exist if uprooted from the earth. The tree cannot exist if the sun
disappears tomorrow. The tree cannot exist if no water is coming to its
roots. The tree cannot exist if it cannot breathe. The tree is rooted in
all the five elements -- what Buddhists call skandhas, the five groups
we were talking about the other day. Avalokita... when Buddha came to
the transcendental vision, when he passed through all the stages, when
he passed through all the rungs of the ladder and came to the seventh --
from there he looked down, looked back -- what did he see? He saw only
five heaps with nothing substantial in them, just emptiness,
shunyata.</p><p>The tree cannot exist if these five elements are not constantly
pouring energy into it. The tree is just a combination of these five
elements. If the tree starts thinking, "I am," then there is going to be
misery for the tree. The tree will create a hell for itself. But trees
are not so foolish, they don't carry any mind. They are there, and if
tomorrow they disappear, they simply disappear. They don't cling; there
is nobody to cling. The tree is constantly surrendered to existence. By
surrendered it means it is never separate, it has not come to that
stupid idea of the ego. And so are the birds, so are the mountains, so
are the stars. It is only man who has turned his great opportunity of
being conscious into being self-conscious. Man has consciousness. If
consciousness grows, it can bring you the greatest bliss possible. But
if something goes wrong and consciousness turns sour and becomes
self-consciousness, then it creates hell, then it creates misery. Both
alternatives are always open; it is for you to choose.</p><p>The first thing to be understood about ego is that it exists not.
Nobody exists in separation. You are as much one with the universe as I
am, as Buddha is, as Jesus is. I know it, you don't know it; the
difference is only of recognition. The difference is not existential,
not at all! So you have to look into this stupid idea of separation. Now
if you start trying to surrender you are still carrying the idea of
separation. Now you are thinking, "I will surrender, now I am going to
surrender" -- but you think you are.</p><p>Looking into the very idea of separation, one day you find that you
are not separate, so how can you surrender? There is nobody to
surrender! There has never been anybody to surrender! The surrenderer is
not there, not at all -- never found anywhere. If you go into yourself
you will not find the surrenderer anywhere. In that moment is surrender.
When the surrenderer is not found, in that moment is surrender. You
cannot do it. If you do it, it is a false thing. Out of falsity only
falsity arises. You are false, so whatsoever you do will be false, more
false. And one falsity leads to another, and so on and so forth. And the
fundamental falsity is the ego, the idea, "I am separate."</p><p>You ask: "My surrender is goal-oriented."</p><p>The ego is always goal-oriented. It is always greedy, it is always
grabbing. It is always searching for more and more and more; it lives in
the more. If you have money it wants to have more money; if you have a
house it wants to have a bigger house; if you have a woman it wants to
have a beautiful woman, but it always wants more. The ego is constantly
hungry. It lives in the future and in the past. In the past it lives as
a hoarder -- "I have this and this and this." It gets a great
satisfaction: "I have got something" -- power, prestige, money. It gives
a kind of reality to it. It gives the notion that, "When I have these
things, I must be there." And it lives in the future with the idea of
more. It lives as memory and as desire.</p><p>What is a goal? A desire: "I have to reach there, I have to be that,
I have to attain." The ego does not, cannot live in the present, because
the present is real and the ego is false -- they</p><p>never meet. The past is false, it is no more. Once it was, but when
it was present, ego was not there. Once it has disappeared, is no longer
existential, ego starts grabbing it, accumulating it. It grabs and
accumulates dead things. The ego is a graveyard: it collects corpses,
dead bones.</p><p>Or, it lives in the future. Again, the future is not yet -- it is
imagination, fantasy, dream. Ego can live with that too, very easily;
falsities go together perfectly well, smoothly well. Bring anything
existential and the ego disappears. Hence the insistence of being in the
present, being herenow. Just this moment... If you are intelligent there
is no need to think about what I am saying; you can simply see into it
this very moment! Where is the ego? There is silence, and there is no
past, and there is no future, only this moment... and this dog barking.
This moment, and you are not. Let this moment be, and you are not. And
there is immense silence, there is profound silence, within and without.
And then there is no need to surrender because you know you are not.
Knowing that you are not is surrender.</p><p>It is not a question of surrendering to me, it is not a question of
surrendering to God. It is not a question of surrendering at all.
Surrendering is an insight, an understanding that, "I am not." Seeing,
"I am not, I am a nothingness, emptiness," surrender grows. The flower
of surrender grows on the tree of emptiness. It cannot be
goal-oriented.</p><p>The ego is goal-oriented. The ego is hankering for the future. It can
hanker even for the other life, it can hanker for heaven, it can hanker
for nirvana. It doesn't matter what it hankers for -- hankering is what
it is, desiring is what it is, projecting into the future is what it
is.</p><p>See it! See into it! I'm not saying think about it. If you think
about it you miss. Thinking again means past and future. Have a look
into it -- avalokita! -- look into it. The English word look comes from
the same root as avalokita. Look into it, and do it right now. Don't say
to yourself, "Okay, I will go home and do it." The ego has entered, the
goal has come, the future has entered. Whenever time enters you are
falling into that falsity of separation.</p><p>Let it be here, this very moment. And then you suddenly see you are,
and you are not going anywhere, and you are not coming from anywhere.
You have always been here. Here is the only time, the only space. Now is
the only existence. In that now, there is surrender.</p><p>"My surrender is goal-oriented," you say; "I'm surrendering in order
to win freedom."</p><p>But you are free! You have never been unfree. You are free, but again
there is the same problem: you want to be free, but you don't understand
that you can be free only when you are free from yourself -- there is no
other freedom. When you think about freedom, you think as if you will be
there and free. You will not be there; there will be freedom. Freedom
means freedom from the self, not freedom of the self. The moment the
prison disappears the prisoner also disappears, because the prisoner is
the prison! The moment you come out of the prison, you also are not.
There is pure sky, pure space. That pure space is called nirvana,
moksha, liberation.</p><p>Try to understand rather than trying to achieve. "I am surrendering
in order to win freedom."</p><p>Then you are using surrender as a means, and surrender is the goal,
is the end unto itself. When I say surrender is the goal, I'm not saying
that surrender has to be achieved somewhere in the future. I'm saying
that surrender is not a means, it is an end unto itself. It is not that
surrender brings freedom, surrender is freedom! They are synonymous,
they mean the same thing. You are looking at the same thing from two
different angles.</p><p>"So it is not real surrender at all."</p><p>It is neither real nor unreal. It is not surrender at all. It is not
even unreal.</p><p>"I am watching it, but the problem is it is always 'I' who is
watching. Therefore every realization out of that watching is a
reinforcement of the ego. I feel tricked by my ego."</p><p>Who is this 'I' you are talking about who feels tricked by the ego?
It is the ego itself. The ego is such that it can divide itself into
fragments, into parts, and then the game starts. You are the chaser and
you are the chased. It is like a dog trying to catch hold of its own
tail, and goes on jumping. And you look and you see the absurdity of it
-- but you see the absurdity, the dog cannot see it. The more he finds
it is difficult to catch hold of the tail, the more he becomes crazy,
the more he jumps. And the faster and the bigger the jump, the more the
tail jumps faster and bigger also. And the dog cannot conceive what is
happening: he's such a great catcher of everything, and this ordinary
tail, and he cannot catch hold of it?</p><p>This is what is happening to you. It is 'I' who is trying to catch,
and who is the catcher and the caught both. See the ridiculousness of
it, and in that very seeing be free of it.</p><p>There is not a thing to be done -- not a thing, I say, because you
are already that which you want to become. You are Buddhas, you have
never been otherwise. Seeing is enough.</p><p>And when you say that, "I am watching," it is again the 'I'.
Watching, the 'I' will be created again, because watching again is an
act, there is effort involved. You are watching -- then who is watching?
Relax. In relaxation -- when there is nothing to be watched and nobody
as a watcher, when you are not divided into a duality -- there arises a
different quality of witnessing. It is not a watching, it is just
passive awareness; passive, I say -- remember. It has nothing aggressive
in it. Watching is very aggressive: effort is needed, you have to be
tense. But be non-tense, relaxed. Just be there. In that consciousness
when you are simply there, sitting doing nothing, the spring comes and
the grass grows by itself.</p><p>That is the whole Buddhist approach: that anything that you do will
create and enhance the doer -- watching also, thinking also,
surrendering also. Anything that you do will create the trap. Nothing is
needed to be done on your part. Just be... and let things happen. Don't
try to manage, don't try to manipulate. Let the breeze pass, let the
sunrays come, let life dance, and let death come and have its dance into
you too.</p><p>This is my meaning of sannyas: it is not something that you do, but
when you drop all doing and you see the absurdity of doing. Who are you
to do? You are just a wave in this ocean. One day you are, another day
you will disappear; the ocean continues. Why should you be so worried?
You come, you disappear. Meanwhile, for this small interval, you become
so worried and tense, and you take all the burdens on your shoulders,
and you carry rocks on your heart -- for no reason at all.</p><p>You are free this very moment!</p><p>I declare you enlightened in this very moment. But you don't trust
me. You say, "That's right, Osho, but just tell us how to become
enlightened."</p><p>That becoming, that achieving, that desiring, goes on jumping on
every object that you can find. Sometimes it is money, sometimes it is
God. Sometimes it is power, sometimes it is meditation -- but any
object, and you start grabbing it. Non-grabbing is the way to live the
real life, the true life, non-grasping, non-possessing.</p><p>Let things happen, let life be a happening, and there is joy, there
is rejoicing -- because then there is no frustration, ever, because you
had never expected anything in the first place. Whatsoever comes is
good, is welcome. There is no failure, no success. That game of failure
and success has been dropped. The sun comes in the morning and wakes
you, and the moon comes in the evening and sings a lullaby and you go to
sleep. Hunger comes and you eat, and so on and so forth. That's what Zen
masters mean when they say: When hungry, eat, when sleepy, sleep, and
there is nothing else to do.</p><p>And I'm not teaching you inaction. I'm not saying don't go and work,
I'm not saying don't earn your bread, I'm not saying renounce the world
and depend on others and become exploiters; no, not at all. But don't be
a doer. Yes, when you are hungry you have to eat, and when you have to
eat you have to earn the bread -- but there is nobody doing it. It is
hunger itself that is working; there is nobody else doing it. It is
thirst itself that is taking you towards the well or towards the river.
It is thirst itself moving; there is nobody who is thirsty. Drop nouns
and pronouns in your life and let verbs live.</p><p>Buddha says: The truth is that when you see a dancer, there is no
dancer but only a dance. When you see a river, there is no river but
only rivering. When you see a tree, there is no tree but only treeing.
When you see a smile, there is nobody who is smiling, there is only
smile, smiling. When you see love, there is nobody who is a lover but
only loving. Life is a process.</p><p>But we are accustomed to thinking in terms of static nouns. That
creates trouble. And there is nothing static -- all is flux and flowing.
Flow with this, flow with this river, and never be a doer. Even when you
are doing don't be a doer. There is doing but there is no doer. Once
this insight settles in you there is nothing else.</p><p>Enlightenment is not something like a goal that has to be attained.
It is the very ordinary life, this simple life that surrounds you. But
when you are not struggling, this ordinary life becomes extraordinarily
beautiful. Then trees are more green, then birds sing in richer tones,
then everything that is happening around is precious... then ordinary
pebbles are diamonds.</p><p>Accept this simple, ordinary life. Just drop the doer. And when I say
drop the doer, don't become a dropper! Seeing into the reality of it, it
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 'SHUNYAVADA' OF NAGARJUNA AND
'AVYAKRITOPADESH', THE UNSPOKEN AND THE UNDEFINABLE TEACHING OF LORD
BUDDHA?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no difference at all. If a difference appears to be there,
that is only because of the formulation. Nagarjuna is a great
philosopher, one of the greatest of the world. Only a few people in the
world, very few, have that quality of penetration that Nagarjuna has.
So, his way of talking is very philosophical, logical, absolutely
logical. Buddha is a mystic, not a philosopher. His way of saying things
is more poetic than philosophical. The approach is</p><p>different, but Nagarjuna is saying exactly the same thing as Buddha.
Their formulation is certainly different, but what they are saying has
to be understood.</p><p>You ask -- the question is from Omanath Bharti -- "Is there any
difference between shunyavada..." shunyavada means the theory, the
philosophy of nothingness. In English there is no word which can be
equivalent, appropriately equivalent, to shunya. Shunya means emptiness;
but not negative, very positive emptiness. It means nothingness, but it
does not mean simply nothingness; it means no-thing-ness. Shunya means
void, void of everything. But the void itself is there, with utter
presence, so it is not just void. It is like the sky which is empty,
which is pure space, but which is. Everything comes in it and goes, and
it remains.</p><p>Shunya is like the sky -- pure presence. You cannot touch it although
you live in it. You cannot see it although you can never be without it.
You exist in it; just as the fish exists in the ocean, you exist in
space, in shunya. Shunyavada means that everything arises out of
no-thing.</p><p>Just a few minutes ago I was telling you the difference between truth
and reality. Reality means the world of things, and truth means the
world of no-thing, nothing -- shunya. All things arise out of nothing
and dissolve back into nothing.</p><p>In the Upanishads there is a story:</p><p><br></p><p>Svetaketu has come from his master's house, back to his parents. He
has learned all. His father, Uddalaka, a great philosopher, looks at him
and says, "Svetaketu, you go outside and bring a fruit from yonder
tree."</p><p>He goes out, brings a fruit. And the father says, "Break it. What do
you see in it?" There are many seeds in it. And the father says, "Take
one seed and break it. What do you see in it?"</p><p>And he says, "Nothing."</p><p>And the father says, "Everything arises out of this nothing. This big
tree, so big that one thousand bullock carts can rest underneath it, has
arisen out of just a seed. And you break the seed and you find nothing
there. This is the mystery of life -- everything arises out of nothing.
And one day the tree disappears, and you don't know where; you cannot
find it anywhere."</p><p><br></p><p>So does man: we arise out of nothing, and we are nothing, and we
disappear into nothing.</p><p>This is shunyavada.</p><p>And what is Buddha's avyakritopadesh, the unspoken and the
undefinable teaching? It is the same. He never made it so
philosophically clear as Nagarjuna has made it. That's why he has never
spoken about it. That's why he says it is indefinable; it cannot be
brought to the level of language. He has kept silent about it.</p><p>You know the Flower Sermon? One day he comes with a lotus flower in
his hand and sits silently, saying nothing. And the ten thousand
disciples are there, the ten thousand bhikkhus are there, and they are
waiting for him to say something, and he goes on looking at the lotus
flower. There is great silence, and then there is great restlessness
too. People start becoming fidgety -- "What is he doing? He has never
done that before."</p><p>And then one disciple, Mahakashyapa, smiles.</p><p>Buddha calls Mahakashyapa, gives him the lotus flower, and says to
the assembly, "What can be said I have said to you, and what cannot be
said I have given to Mahakashyapa."</p><p>This is avyakritopadesh, this is the indefinable message. This is the
origin of Zen Buddhism, the transmission. Something was transmitted by
Buddha to Mahakashyapa, something which is nothing; on the visible plane
nothing -- no word, no scripture, no theory -- but something has been
transmitted. What?</p><p>The Zen monks have been meditating on this for two thousand five
hundred years: "What? What was transmitted? What exactly was given?" In
fact, nothing has been given from Buddha to Mahakashyapa; Mahakashyapa
has certainly understood something. He understood the silence, he
understood the penetrating silence. He understood that moment of
clarity, that moment of utter thoughtlessness. He became one, in that
moment, with Buddha. That's what surrender is. Not that he was doing it:
Buddha was silent and he was silent, and the silences met, and the two
silences dissolved into each other. And two silences cannot remain
separate, remember, because a silence has no boundary, a silence is
unbounded, a silence is simply open, open from all sides. In that great
assembly of ten thousand monks there were two silences that day --
Buddha and Mahakashyapa. The others remained outside. Mahakashyapa and
Buddha met: that's why he smiled -- because that was the greatest sermon
that Buddha had ever preached. Not saying a single thing and he had said
all, all that could be said -- and all that could not be said, that
too.</p><p>Mahakashyapa understood and laughed. In that laughter Mahakashyapa
disappeared totally, became a Buddha. The flame from the lamp of Buddha
jumped into Mahakashyapa. That is called the 'transmission beyond
scriptures' -- the Flower Sermon. It is unique in the history of human
consciousness. That is what is called avyakritopadesh: the unspoken
word, the unuttered word.</p><p>Silence became so substantial, so solid; silence became so real, so
existential; silence became tangible in that moment. Buddha was a
nothing, Mahakashyapa also understood what it means to be a nothing, to
be utterly empty.</p><p>There is no difference between Nagarjuna's shunyavada and Buddha's
unuttered message. Nagarjuna is one of the greatest disciples of Buddha,
and one of the most penetrating intellects ever. Only very few people --
once in a while, a Socrates, a Shankara -- can be compared with
Nagarjuna. He was very, very intelligent. The uttermost that the
intellect can do is to commit suicide; the greatest thing, the greatest
crescendo that can come to the intellect is to go beyond itself --
that's what Nagarjuna has done. He has passed through all the realms of
intellect, and beyond.</p><p>The logical positivists say that nothing is merely an abstraction. In
the various instances of negative assertions -- for example: this is not
sweet, I am not healthy, I was not there, he did not like me, etcetera,
etcetera -- negation has no substance of its own. This is what the
logical positivists say. Buddha does not agree, Nagarjuna does not
agree. Martin Heidegger, one of the most penetrating intellects of the
modern age, does not agree.</p><p>Heidegger says there is an actual experience of nothing. It is not
just something created by language; there is an actual experience of
nothing. It is inseparably bound up with being. The experience that
attests to this is that of dread. Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher,
also asks, "What effect does nothing produce?" and answers, "It begets
dread."</p><p>Nothing is an actual experience. Either you can experience it in deep
meditation, or when death comes. Death and meditation are the two
possibilities of experiencing it. Yes, sometimes you can experience it
in love too. If you dissolve into somebody in deep love you can
experience a kind of nothingness. That's why people are afraid of love
-- they go only so</p><p>far, then panic arises, then they are frightened. That's why very few
people have remained orgasmic -- because orgasm gives you an experience
of nothingness. You disappear, you melt into something and you don't
know what it is. You go into the indefinable, avyakrit. You go beyond
the social. You go into some unity where separation is no longer valid,
where ego exists not. And it is frightening, because it is
deathlike.</p><p>So it is an experience, either in love, which people have learned to
avoid -- so many go on hankering for love, and go on destroying all
possibilities for it because of the fear of nothingness -- or, in deep
meditation when thought stops. You simply see there is nothing inside,
but that nothing has a presence; it is not simply absence of thought, it
is presence of something unknown, mysterious, something very huge. Or,
you can experience it in death, if you are alert. People ordinarily die
in unconsciousness. Because of the fear of nothingness they become
unconscious. If you die consciously... And you can die consciously only
if you accept the phenomenon of death, and for that one has to learn for
the whole life, prepare. One has to love to be ready to die, and one has
to meditate to be ready to die. Only a man who has loved and meditated
will be able to die consciously. And once you die consciously then there
is no need for you to come back, because you have learned the lesson of
life. Then you disappear into the whole; that is nirvana.</p><p>The logical positivists look very logical, but they miss something --
because reality is far more than logic. In ordinary experience we come
only to what they say: this chair is here, this will be removed, then
you will say there is no chair there. It simply indicates absence -- the
chair has been removed. These are ordinary instances of nothingness:
there was once a house and then it has been dismantled, it is no longer
there. It is only an absence.</p><p>But there are nothingnesses deep inside your being, at the very core.
At the very core of life, death exists. Death is the center of the
cyclone. In love you come close to that, in meditation you come close to
that, in physical death also you come close to that. In deep sleep, when
dreams disappear, you come close to it. It is very life-giving, it is
life-enhancing. A man who cannot sleep deeply will become ill, because
it is only in deep sleep, when he dies into his deepest depth, that he
regains life, energy, vitality. In the morning he is again fresh and
full of zest, gusto -- vibrant, again vibrant.</p><p>Learn to die! That is the greatest art to be learned, the greatest
skill there is.</p><p>Heidegger's standpoint comes very close to Buddha's, and his language
is very modern, that's why I'm quoting him. He says: "Every being, so
far as it is a being, is made out of nothing." There is a parallel
Christian doctrine too -- very neglected, because Christian
theologicians cannot manage it, it is too much. The doctrine is creatio
ex nihilo: the creation is out of nothing.</p><p>If you ask the modern physicist he will agree with Buddha: the deeper
you go into matter, things start disappearing. A moment comes, when the
atom is divided -- thing-hood completely disappears. Then there are
electrons, but they are not things anymore, they are no-things. It is
very difficult to understand. But physics, modern physics, has come very
close to metaphysics -- because it is coming closer and closer to
reality every day. It is approaching through matter, but coming to
nothing. You know matter no longer exists in modern physics. Matter is
just an illusion: it only appears, it is not there. The solidity of it,
the substantiality of it, is all illusion; nothing is substantial, all
is flux and energy. Matter is nothing but energy. And when you go deeper
into energy, energy is not a thing, it is a no-thing.</p><p>Death is the point at which knowledge fails, and we become open to
being -- that has been the Buddhist experience down the ages. Buddha
used to send his disciples, when somebody had died, to see the body
burning on the funeral pyre: "Meditate there, meditate on the
nothingness of life." Death is the point at which knowledge fails, and
when knowledge fails, mind fails. And when mind fails, there is a
possibility of truth penetrating you.</p><p>But people don't know. When somebody dies you don't know what to do,
you are very embarrassed. When somebody dies it is a great moment to
meditate.</p><p>I always think that each city needs a Death Center. When somebody is
dying and his death is very, very imminent he should be moved to the
Death Center. It should be a small temple where people who can go deep
in meditation should sit around him, should help him to die, and should
participate in his being when he disappears into nothing. When somebody
disappears into nothing great energy is released. The energy that was
there, surrounding him, is released. If you are in a silent space around
him, you will go on a great trip. No psychedelic can take you there. The
man is naturally releasing great energy; if you can absorb that energy,
you will also kind of die with him. And you will see the ultimate -- the
source and the goal, the beginning and the end.</p><p>"Man is the being by whom nothing comes into the world," says
Jean-Paul Sartre. Consciousness is not this or that object, it is not
any object at all; but surely it is itself? "No," says Sartre, "that is
precisely what it is not. Consciousness is never identical with itself.
Thus, when I reflect upon myself, the self that is reflected is other
than the self that reflects. When I try to state what I am, I fail,
because while I am speaking, what I am talking about slips away into the
past and becomes what I was. I am my past and my future, and yet I am
not. I have been the one, and I shall be the other. But in the present,
there is nothingness."</p><p>If somebody asks you, "Who are you?" what are you going to say?
Either you can answer out of the past, which is no more, or you can
answer out of the future, which you are not yet. But who are you right
in this moment? A nobody, a nothingness. This nothingness is the very
core, the heart -- the heart of your being.</p><p>Death is not the ax that cuts down the tree of life, it is the fruit
that grows on it. Death is the very substance you are made of.
Nothingness is your very being. Attain to this nothingness either
through love or meditation, and go on having glimpses of it. This is
what Nagarjuna means by shunya. This is what Buddha transferred that day
when he delivered the Flower Sermon. This is what Mahakashyapa
understood when he laughed. He saw nothingness, and the purity of it,
the innocence of it, the primal innocence of it, the radiance of it, the
immortality of it -- because nothingness cannot die. Things die;
nothingness is immortal, eternal.</p><p>If you are identified with anything, you will suffer death. But if
you know that you are death, how can you suffer death? Then nothing can
destroy you; nothingness is indestructible.</p><p>A Buddhist parable narrates that the king of hell asked a newly
arrived spirit whether during life he had met the three heavenly
messengers. And when he answered, "No, my Lord, I did not," he asked
whether he had ever seen an old man bent with age, or a poor and
friendless sick man, or a dead man?</p><p>Buddhists call these three 'the messengers of God': old age,
sickness, death -- three messengers of God. Why? -- because only through
these experiences in life do you become aware of death. And if you
become aware of death and you start learning how to go into it,</p><p>how to welcome it, how to receive it, you are released from the
bondage, from the wheel of life and death.</p><p>Heidegger says, and so does Síren Kierkegaard, that nothingness
creates dread. That is only half of the story. Because these two people
are just philosophers, that's why it creates dread.</p><p>If you ask Buddha, Mahakashyapa, Nagarjuna, if you ask me, death
looked at only partially creates dread; looked at absolutely, totally,
it frees you from all dread, from all anguish, from all anxiety, it
frees you from SAMSARA... because if you look partly then it creates
fear that you are going to die, that you will become a nothing, that
soon you will disappear. And naturally you feel nervous, shaken,
uprooted. If you look at death totally, then you know you are death, you
are made of it. So nothing is going to disappear, nothing is going to
remain. Only nothingness is.</p><p>Buddhism is not a pessimistic religion as has been thought by many
people. Buddhism is the way to get rid of both optimism and pessimism,
to get rid of duality.</p><p>Start meditating on death. And whenever you feel death close by, go
into it through the door of love, through the door of meditation,
through the door of a man dying. And if some day you are dying -- and
the day is going to come one day -- receive it in joy, benediction. And
if you can receive death in joy and benediction, you will attain to the
greatest peak, because death is the crescendo of life. Hidden in it is
the greatest orgasm, because hidden in it is the greatest freedom.</p><p>Death is making love to God, or God making love to you. Death is
cosmic, total orgasm. So drop all ideas that you carry about death --
they are dangerous. They make you antagonistic to the greatest
experience that you need to have. If you miss death you will be born
again. Unless you have learned how to die, you will go on being born
again and again and again. This is the wheel, samsara, the world. Once
you have known the greatest orgasm, then there is no need; you
disappear, and you remain in that orgasm forever. You don't remain like
you, you don't remain as an entity, you don't remain defined, identified
with anything. You remain as the whole, not as the part.</p><p>This is Nagarjuna's shunyavada, and this is Buddha's unspoken
message, the unspoken word. They are both the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, I AM AFRAID OF TAKING SANNYAS, ALTHOUGH I AM IMMENSELY
ATTRACTED. I AM AFRAID BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not very respectful towards your husband. Do you think he's
stupid or something? Why should he not be able to understand it? If he
loves you, he will understand it. Love is understanding. If he does not
love you, then whether you take sannyas or not, he's not going to
understand you.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

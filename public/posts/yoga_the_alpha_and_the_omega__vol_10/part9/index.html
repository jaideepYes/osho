THEN FOLLOWS FREEDOM FROM AFFLICTIONS AND KARMAS.\n30.

HAVING FULFILLED THEIR OBJECT, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE THREE GUNAS COMES TO AN END.\n32. KRAMAHA, THE PROCESS, IS THE SUCCESSION OF CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM THE MOMENT TO MOMENT WHICH BECOME APPREHENSIBLE AT THE FINAL END OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.\n33. KAIVALYA IS THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT THAT FOLLOWS THE REMERGENCE OF THE GUNAS, DUE TO THEIR BECOMING DEVOID OF THE OBJECT OF THE PURUSA.\n34. IN THIS STATE, THE PURUSA IS ESTABLISHED IN HIS REAL NATURE, WHICH IS PURE CONSCIOUSNESS.\nThe first sutra:\nVISESA-DARSINA ATMA-BHAVA-BHAVANAVINIVRTTIH.\nWHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE FOR DWELLING IN THE ATMA, THE SELF.\nBUDDHA HAS CALLED the ultimate state of consciousness anatta – no self, non-being. It is very difficult to comprehend it. Buddha has said that the last desire to drop is the desire to be. There are millions of desires. The whole world is nothing but desire objects, but the basic desire is to be. The basic desire is to continue, to persist, to remain. Death is the greatest fear; the last desire to be dropped is the desire to be.\nPatanjali in this sutra says: when your awareness has become perfect, when viveka, discrimination has been achieved, when you have become a witness, a pure witness of whatsoever happens, outside you, inside you.You are no more a doer, you are simply watching; the birds are singing\noutside... you watch; the blood is circulating inside... you watch; the thoughts are moving inside... you watch – you never get identified anywhere. You don’t say, “I am the body”; you don’t say, “I am the mind”; you don’t say anything. You simply go on watching without being identified with any object. You remain a pure subject; you simply remember one thing: that you are the watcher, the witness – when this witnessing is established, then the desire to be disappears.\nAnd the moment the desire to be disappears, death also disappears. Death exists because you want to persist. Death exists because you don’t want to die. Death exists because you are struggling against the whole. The moment you are ready to die, death is meaningless; it cannot be possible now. When you are ready to die, how can you die? In the very readiness of dying, disappearing, all possibility of death is overcome. This is the paradox of religion.\nJesus says, “If you are going to cling to yourself, you will lose yourself. If you want to attain yourself, don’t cling.” Those who try to be are destroyed. Not that somebody is there destroying you; your very effort to be is destructive because the moment the idea arises: “I should persist,” you are moving against the whole. It is as if a wave is trying to be against the ocean. Now the very effort is going to create worry and misery, and one moment will come when the wave will have to disappear. But now, because the wave was fighting against the ocean, the disappearance will look like death. If the wave was ready, and the wave was aware: “I’m nothing but the ocean, so what is the point in persisting? I have been always and I will be always, because the ocean has always been there and will be always there. I may not exist as a wave – wave is just the form I have taken for the moment.\nThe form will disappear, but not my content. I may not exist like this wave; I may exist like another wave, or I may not exist as a wave as such. I may become the very depth of the ocean where no waves arise”\nBut the innermost reality is going to remain because the whole has penetrated you. You are nothing but the whole, an expression of the whole. Once awareness is established, Patanjali says, “When one has seen this distinction, that ‘I am neither this nor that’, when one has become aware and is not identified with anything whatsoever, there is a cessation of desire for dwelling in the atma, in the self” Then the last desire disappears, and the last is the fundamental. Hence, Buddha says, “You can drop desiring money, wealth, power, prestige – that’s nothing. You can stop desiring the world – that’s nothing – because those are secondary desires. The basic desire is to be.” So people who renounce the world start desiring liberation, but liberation is also their liberation. They will remain in moksha, in a liberated state. They desire that pain should not be there. They desire that misery should not be there. They will be in absolute bliss, but they will be. The insistence is that they must be there.\nThat’s why Buddha could not get roots into this country which thinks itself very religious. The most religious man who was born on this earth could not get roots into this religious country. What happened? He said, he insisted, to drop the basic desire of being: he said, “Be a non-being.” He said, “Don’t be.” He said, “Don’t ask for liberation because the freedom is not for you. The freedom is going to be freedom from you; not for you, but from you.”\nLiberation is liberation from yourself. See the distinction: it is not for you; liberation is not for you. It is not that liberated you will exist. Liberated, you will disappear. Buddha said, “Only bondage exists.” Let me try to explain it to you.\nHave you ever come across health? You have been healthy many times, but can you say what health is? Only disease exists. Health is non-existential; you cannot pin-point it. If you have a headache you know it is there, but have you ever known the absence of headache? In fact, if there is no headache the head- also disappears. You don’t feel it anymore. If you go on feeling your head, that simply shows that there must be a certain tension inside, a certain stress, a strain. A sort of headache must be there continuously. If your whole body is healthy, the body disappears. You forget that the body is. In Zen, when meditators sit for many years, just sitting and doing nothing, a certain moment comes when they forget that they have bodies. That is their first satori. Not that the body is not there; body is there but there is no tension, so how to feel it? If I say something you can hear me, but if I’m silent how can you hear me? Silence is there – it has much to communicate to you – but silence cannot be heard. Sometimes when you say, “Yes, I can hear the silence,” then you are hearing some noise. Maybe it is the noise of the dark night, but it is still noise. If it is absolutely silent, you will not be able to hear it. When your body is perfectly healthy, you don’t feel it. If some tension arises in the body, some disease, some illness, then you start hearing. If everything is in harmony and there is no pain and no misery, suddenly you are empty. A nothingness overwhelms you.\nKaivalya is the ultimate health, wholeness, all wounds healed. When all wounds heal, how can you exist? The self is nothing but accumulated tensions. The self is nothing but all sorts of diseases, illnesses. The self is nothing but desires unfulfilled, hopes frustrated, expectations, dreams – all broken, fractured. It is nothing but accumulated disease, that you call ‘self’. Or take it from another\nside: in moments of harmony you forget that you are. Later on, you may remember how beautiful it was, how fantastic it was, how far-out. But in moments of real far-outness, you are not there. Something bigger than you has overpowered you; something higher than you has possessed you; something deeper than you has bubbled up. You have disappeared. In deep moments of love, lovers disappear. In deep moments of silence, meditators disappear. In deep moments of singing, dancing, celebration, celebrators disappear. And this is going to be the last celebration, the ultimate, the highest peak – kaivalya.\nPatanjali says, “Even the desire to be disappears. Even the desire to remain disappears.” One is so fulfilled, so tremendously fulfilled that one never thinks in terms of being. For what? – you want to be there tomorrow also because today is unfulfilled. The tomorrow is needed; otherwise you will die unfulfilled. The yesterday was a deep frustration; today is again a frustration; tomorrow is needed. A frustrated mind creates future. A frustrated mind clings with the future. A frustrated mind wants to be because now, if death comes, no flower has flowered. Nothing has yet happened; there has only been a fruitless waiting: “Now, how can I die? I have not even lived yet.” That unlived life creates a desire to be.\nPeople are so much afraid of death: these are the people who have not lived. These are the people who are, in a certain sense, already dead. A person who has lived and lived totally does not think about death. If it comes, good; he will welcome. He will live that too, he will celebrate that too. Life has been such a blessing, a benediction; one is even ready to accept death. Life has been such a tremendous experience; one is ready to experience death also. One is not afraid because the tomorrow is not needed; the today has been so fulfilling. One has come to fruition, flowered, bloomed. Now the desire for tomorrow disappears. The desire for tomorrow is always out of fear, and fear is there because love has not happened. The desire to always remain simply shows that deep down you are feeling yourself completely meaningless. You are waiting for some meaning. Once the meaning has happened, you are ready to die – silently, beautifully, gracefully.\n“Kaivalya,” Patanjali says, “happens only when the last desire to be has disappeared.” The whole problem is to be or not to be. The whole life we try to be this and that, and the ultimate can happen only when you are not.\nWHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE FOR DWELLING IN THE SELF.\nThe self is nothing but the most purified form of the ego. It is the last remnant of strain, stress, tension. You are still not perfectly open; something is still closed. When you are completely open, just a watcher on the hill, a witness, even the death desire disappears. With the disappearance of this desire, something absolutely new happens in life. A new law starts functioning.\nYou have heard about the law of gravitation; you have not heard about the law of grace. The law of gravitation is that everything falls downwards. The law of grace is that things start falling upwards. And that law has to be there because in life everything is balanced by the opposite. Science has come to discover the law of gravitation: Newton sitting on a bench in a garden saw one apple falling – it happened or not; that is not the point – but seeing that the apple was falling down, a thought arose in him: “Why do things always fall downwards? Why not otherwise? Why doesn’t a ripe fruit fall upwards and disappear into the sky? Why not sideways? Why always downwards?” He started\nbrooding and meditating, and then he discovered a law. He came upon, stumbled upon a very fundamental law: that the earth is gravitating things towards itself. It has a gravitation field. Like a magnet, it pulls everything downwards.\nPatanjali, Buddha, Krishna, Christ – they also became aware of a different fundamental law, higher than gravitation. They became aware that there comes a moment in the inner life of consciousness when consciousness starts rising upwards – exactly like gravitation. If the apple is hanging on the tree, it does not fall. The tree helps it not to fall downwards. When the fruit leaves the tree, then it falls downwards.\nExactly the same: if you are clinging to your body you will not fall upwards; if you are clinging to your mind you will not fall upwards. If you are clinging to the idea of self, you will remain under the impact of gravitation – because body is under the impact of gravitation, and mind also. Mind is subtle body; body is gross mind. They are both under the impact of gravitation. And because you are clinging to them you are not under the impact of gravitation, but you are clinging to something which is under the impact of gravitation. It is as if you are carrying a big rock and trying to swim in a river; the rock will pull you down. It won’t allow you to swim. If you leave the rock, you will be able to swim easily.\nWe are clinging to something which is functioning under the law of gravitation: body, mind. “Once,” Patanjali says, “you have become aware that you are neither the body nor the mind, suddenly you start rising upwards.” Some center somewhere high in the sky pulls you up. That law is called ‘grace’. Then God pulls you upwards. And that type of law has to be there, otherwise gravitation could not exist. In nature, if positive electricity exists, then negative electricity has to exist. Man exists, then the woman has to exist. Reason exists, then intuition has to exist. Night exists, then the day has to exist. Life exists, then death has to exist. Everything needs the opposite to balance it. Now science has become aware of one law: gravitation. Science still needs a Patanjali to give it another dimension, the dimension of falling upwards. Then life becomes complete.\nYou are a meeting place of gravitation and grace. In you, grace and gravitation are criss-crossing. You have something of the earth and something of the sky within you. You are the horizon where earth and sky are meeting. If you hold too much to the earth, then you will forget completely that you belong to the sky, to the infinite space, the beyond. Once you are no more attached with the earth part of you, suddenly you start rising high.\nWHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE FOR DWELLING IN THE SELF.\nTADAHI VIVEKA-NIMNAM KAIVALYA-PRAGBHARAM CITTAM.\nTHEN THE MIND IS INCLINED TOWARDS DISCRIMINATION, AND GRAVITATES TOWARDS LIBERATION.\nA new gravitation starts functioning. Liberation is nothing but entering the stream of grace. You cannot liberate yourself, you can only drop the barriers; liberation happens to you. Have you seen a magnet? – small iron pieces are pulled towards it. You can see those small iron pieces rushing towards the magnet, but don’t be deceived by your eyes. In fact, they are not rushing, the magnet is pulling them. On the surface it appears that those iron filings are going, moving towards the magnet.\nThat is just on the surface. Deep down, something just opposite is happening: they are not moving towards the magnet, the magnet is pulling them towards itself. In fact, it is the magnet which has reached them. With the magnetic field it has approached them, touched them, pulled them. If those iron filings are free, not attached to something – not attached to a rock – then the magnet can pull them. If they are attached to a rock, the magnet will go on pulling but they will not be pulled because they are attached.\nExactly the same happens: once you discriminate that you are not the body, you are no more bound to any rock, you are no more in bondage with earth. Immediately, God’s magnet starts functioning. It is not that you reach to God. In fact, God has already reached you. You are under His magnetic field, but clinging to something. Drop that clinging and you are in the stream. Buddha used to use a word srotaapanna: falling into the stream. He used to say, “Once you fall into the stream, then the stream takes you to the ocean. Then you need not do anything.” The only thing is to jump into the stream. You are sitting on the bank. Enter the stream and then the stream will do the remaining work. It is as if you are standing on a high building, on the roof of a high building, three hundred feet or five hundred feet above the earth. You go on standing, the gravitation has reached you, but it will not work unless you jump. Once you jump, then you need not do anything. Just a step off the roof... enough; your work is finished. Now the gravitation will do all the work. You need not ask, “Now what am I supposed to do?” You have taken the first step. The first is the last step. Krishnamurti has written a book, THE FIRST AND THE LAST FREEDOM. The meaning is: the first step is the last step because once you are in the stream, everything else is to be done by the stream. You are not needed. Only for the first step is your courage needed.\nTHEN THE MIND IS INCLINED TOWARDS DISCRIMINATION, AND GRAVITATES TOWARDS LIBERATION.\nYou start moving slowly upwards. Your life energy starts rising high – an upsurge. And it is unbelievable when it happens because it is against all the laws that you have known up to now. It is levitation, not gravitation. Something in you simply starts moving upwards, and there is no barrier to it. Nothing bars its path. Just a little relaxation, a little unclinging – the first step – and then automatically, spontaneously, your consciousness becomes more and more discriminative, more and more aware.\nLet me tell you about another thing. You have heard the word, the phrase: ‘vicious circle’. Let us make another phrase: ‘virtuous circle’. In a vicious circle, one bad thing leads to another. For example, if you get angry then one anger leads you to more anger, and of course, more anger will lead you to still more anger. Now you are in a vicious circle. Each anger will make the habit of anger more strong, and will create more anger, and more anger will make the habit still more strong, and on and on. You move in a vicious circle which goes on becoming stronger and stronger and stronger.\nLet us try a new word: virtuous circle. If you become aware, what Patanjali calls vivek, awareness; if you become aware: vairagya. Discrimination creates renunciation. If you become aware, suddenly you see that you are no more the body. Not that you renounce the body; in your very awareness the body is renounced. If you become aware, you become aware that these thoughts are not you. In that very awareness those thoughts are renounced. You have started dropping them. You don’t give them any more energy; you don’t cooperate with them. Your cooperation has stopped, and they\ncannot live without your energy. They live on your energy, they exploit you. They don’t have their own energy. Each thought that enters you partakes of your energy. And because you are kaivalya willing to give your energy, it lives there, it makes its abode there. Of course, then its children come, and friends, and relatives, and this goes on. Once you are a little aware, vivek brings vairagya, awareness brings renunciation. And renunciation makes you capable of becoming more aware. And of course, more awareness brings more vairagya, more renunciation, and so on and so forth.\nThis is what I am calling the virtuous circle: one virtue leads to another, and each virtue becomes again a ground for more virtue to arise.\n“This goes on,” Patanjali says, “to the last moment” – what he calls, dharma megha samadhi. We will be coming to it later on. He calls it ‘the cloud of virtue showering on you’. This virtuous circle, vivek leading to vairagya, vairagya leading to more vivek, vivek again creating more possibilities for vairagya, and so on and so forth – comes to the ultimate peak when the cloud of virtue showers on you: dharma megha samadhi.\nIN BREAKS OF DISCRIMINATION, OTHER PRATYAYAS, CONCEPTS, ARISE THROUGH THE FORCE OF PREVIOUS IMPRESSIONS.\nStill, though, many intervals will be there. So don’t be discouraged. Even if you have become very aware and in sudden moments you feel the pull, the upward pull of grace, and in certain moments you are in the stream, floating perfectly beautifully, with no effort, effortlessly, and everything is going and running smoothly, still there will be gaps. Suddenly you will find yourself standing again on the bank just because of old habits. For so many lives you have lived on the bank. Just because of the old habit, again and again the past will overpower you. Don’t be discouraged by it. The moment you see that you are again on the bank, again get down into the stream. Don’t be sad about it, because if you become sad you will again be in a vicious circle. Don’t be sad about it. Many times the seeker comes at very close quarters, and many times he loses the track. No need to be worried; again bring awareness. This is going to happen many times; it is natural. For so many millions of lives we have lived in unawareness – it is only natural that many times the old habit will start functioning. Let me tell you a few anecdotes.\nThe boss was full of confidence as he approached the reception desk at a large hotel with his secretary and signed the register as Mr. and Mrs.\n“Double or twin beds?” enquired the clerk.\nHe turned to his secretary and asked casually, “Would a double be alright, darling?” “Yes, sir,” she answered.\n“Yes, sir,” the wife was saying to the husband! – but just the old habit of being a secretary, continuously saying, “Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir.” Habits become very ingrained, and they catch hold of you in such a way that unless you are very, very watchful, you will not even suspect.\nIt happened: An indignant schoolteacher rang the local police station to complain that a crowd of young hooligans had chalked four-letter words all over her front door. “And what is more,” she concluded, “they have not even spelled them right!”\nA school teacher is just a school teacher. She is complaining against the four-letter words, but the basic complaint is that they have not even spelled them right. Continuously correcting the spelling of children.…\nIN BREAKS OF DISCRIMINATION, OTHER CONCEPTS ARISE THROUGH THE FORCE OF PREVIOUS IMPRESSIONS.\nMany times you will be pulled back, again and again and again. The struggle is hard, but not impossible. It is difficult, it is very arduous, but don’t become sad and don’t become discouraged. Whenever you remember again, don’t be worried about what has happened. Let your awareness again be established, that’s all. Continuously establishing your awareness again and again and again will create a new impact inside your being, a new impression of virtue. One day, it becomes as natural as other habits.\nONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION, ENTERS THE STATE KNOWN AS ‘THE CLOUD WHICH SHOWERS VIRTUE’.\n“One who is able to maintain a constant state of desirelessness even towards the most exalted states of enlightenment...” Patanjali calls it paravairagya: the ultimate renunciation. You have renounced the world: you have renounced greed, you have renounced money, you have renounced power; you have renounced everything of the outside. You have even renounced your body, you have even renounced your mind, but the last renunciation is the kaivalya renunciation of kaivalya itself, of moksha itself, of nirvana itself. Now you renounce even the idea of liberation, because that too is a desire. And desire, whatsoever its object, is the same. You desire money, I desire moksha. Of course, my object is better than your object, but still my desire is the same as yours. Desire says, “I am not content as I am. More money is needed; then I will be contented. More liberation is needed; then I will be contented.” The quality of desire is the same, the problem of desire is the same. The problem is that the future is needed: “As I am, it is not enough; something more is needed. Whatsoever has happened to me is not enough. Something still has to happen to me; only then can I be happy.” This is the nature of desire: you need more money, somebody needs a bigger house, somebody thinks of more power, politics, somebody thinks of a better wife or a better husband, somebody thinks of more education, more knowledge, somebody thinks of more miraculous powers, but it makes no difference. Desire is desire, and desirelessness is needed.\nNow the paradox: if you are absolutely desireless – and in absolute desirelessness, the desire of moksha is included – a moment comes when you don’t desire even moksha, you don’t desire even God. You simply don’t desire; you are, and there is no desire. This is the state of desirelessness. Moksha happens in this state. Moksha cannot be desired, by its very nature, because it comes only in desirelessness. Liberation cannot be desired. It cannot become a motive because it happens only when all motives have disappeared. You cannot make God an object of your desire because the desiring mind remains ungodly. The desiring mind remains unholy; the desiring mind remains worldly. When there is no desire, not even the desire for God, suddenly He has always been there. Your eyes open and you recognize Him.\nDesires function as barriers. And the last desire, the most subtle desire, is the desire to be liberated. The last, subtle desire is the desire to be desireless.\nONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION...\nOf course, the ultimate in discrimination will be needed. You will have to be aware – so much so that this very, very deep desire of becoming free of all misery, of becoming free of all bondage, even this desire does not arise. Your awareness is so perfect that not even a small corner is left dark inside your being. You are full of light, illuminated with awareness. That’s why when Buddha is asked again and again, “What happens to a man who becomes enlightened?” he remains silent. He never answers. Again and again he is asked, “Why don’t you answer?” He says, “If I answer, you will create a desire for it, and that will become a barrier. Let me keep quiet. Let me remain silent so I don’t give you a new object for desire. If I say, ‘It is satchitananda: it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss,’ immediately a desire will arise in you. If I talk about that ecstatic state of being in God, immediately your greed takes it. Suddenly, a desire starts arising in you. Your mind starts saying, ‘Yes, you have to seek it, you have to find it. This has to be searched. Whatsoever the cost, but you have to become blissful.’” Buddha says, “I don’t say anything about it, because whatsoever I say, your mind will jump on it and make a desire out of it, and that will become the cause, and you will never be able to attain it.”\nBuddha insisted that there is no moksha. He insisted that when a man becomes aware, he simply disappears. He disappears as when you blow out a lamp and the light disappears. The word ‘nirvana’ simply means blowing a lamp out. Then you don’t ask where the flame has gone, what has happened to the flame; it simply disappears – annihilated. Buddha insisted that there is nothing left; when you have become enlightened everything disappears, like the flame of a lamp put out. Why? – looks very negative – but he does not want to give you an object of desire. Then people started asking, “Then why should we try for such a state? It is better then to be in the world. At least we are; miserable – but at least we are; in anguish – but we are. And your state of nothingness has no appeal for us.”\nIn India, Buddhism disappeared; in China, in Burma, in Ceylon, in Japan, it reappeared, but it never appeared in its purity again because Buddhists learned a lesson: that man lives through desire. If they insist that there is nothing beyond enlightenment and everything disappears, then people are not going to follow them. Then everything will remain as it is; only their religion will disappear. So they learned a trick, and in Japan, in China, in Ceylon, in Burma, they started talking of beautiful states after enlightenment. They betrayed Buddha. The purity was lost; then religion spread. Buddhism became one of the great religions of the world. They learned the politics of the human mind. They fulfilled your desire. They said, “Yes... Lands of tremendous beauty, Buddha- lands, heavenly lands where eternal bliss reigns.” They started talking in positive terms. Again people’s greeds were inflamed, desire arose. People started following Buddhism, but Buddhism lost its beauty. Its beauty was in its insistence that it would not give you any object for desire.\nPatanjali has written the best that it is possible to write about the ultimate truth, but no religion has arisen around him, no established church exists around him. Such a great teacher, such a great Master has remained really without a following. Not a single temple is devoted to him. What happened? His Yoga Sutras are read, commented upon, but nothing like Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, exists with Patanjali. Why? – because he will not give any hope to you. He will not give any help to your desire.\nONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION, ENTERS THE STATE KNOWN AS ‘THE CLOUD WHICH SHOWERS VIRTUE’.\nDharma megha samadhi: this word has to be understood. It is very complex. And so many commentaries have been written on Patanjali, but it seems they go on missing the point. dharma megha samadhi means: a moment comes when every desire has disappeared. When even the self is no more desired, when death is not feared, virtue showers on you – as if a cloud gathers around your head, and a beautiful shower of virtue, a benediction, a great blessing.But why does\nPatanjali call it ‘cloud’? – one has to go even beyond that; it is still a cloud. Before, your eyes were full of vice, now your eyes are full of virtue, but you are still blind. Before, nothing but misery was showering on you, just a hell was showering on you; now, you have entered heaven and everything is perfectly beautiful, there is nothing to complain about, but still it is a cloud. Maybe it is a white cloud, not a black cloud, but still it is a cloud – and one has to go beyond it also. That’s why he calls it ‘cloud’.\nThat is the last barrier, and of course it is very beautiful because it is of virtue. It is like golden chains studded with diamonds. They are not like ordinary chains; they look very ornamental. They are more like ornaments than chains. One would like to cling to them. Who would not like to have a tremendous happiness showering on oneself, a non-ending happiness? Who would not like to be in this ecstasy forever and ever? But this too is a cloud – white, beautiful, but still the real sky is hidden behind it.\nThere is a possibility from this exalted point to still fall back. If you become too attached to dharma megha samadhi, if you become too much attached, you start enjoying it too much and you don’t discriminate that “I am also not this,” there is a possibility that you will come back.\nIn Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, only two states exist: hell and heaven. This is what Christians call heaven, what Patanjali calls dharma megha samadhi. In the West, no religion has risen beyond that. In India we have three terms: hell, heaven and moksha. Hell is absolute misery; heaven is absolute happiness; moksha is beyond both: neither hell nor heaven. In Western language, there exists not a single term equivalent to moksha. Christianity stops at heaven – dharma megha samadhi. Who bothers anymore to go beyond it? It is so beautiful. And you have lived in so much misery for so long; you would like to remain there forever and ever. But Patanjali says, “If you cling to it, you slip from the last rung of the ladder. You were just close to home. One step more, and then you would have achieved the point of no return – but you slipped. You were just reaching home and you missed the path. You were just at the door – a knock and the doors would have opened – but you thought that the porch was the palace and you started living there.” Sooner or later you will even lose the porch, because the porch exists for those who are going into the palace. It cannot be made an abode. If you make an abode of it, sooner or later you will be thrown out: you are not worthy. You are like a beggar who has started to live on somebody’s porch.\nYou have to enter the palace; then the porch will remain available. But if you stop at the porch even the porch will be taken away. And the porch is very beautiful, and we have never known anything like that, so certainly we misunderstand – we think the palace has come. We have lived always in anxiety, misery, tension, and even the porch, even to be close to the ultimate palace, to be so close\nto the ultimate truth, is so silent, so peaceful, so blissful, such a great benediction, that you cannot imagine that better than that is possible. You would like to settle here.\nPatanjali says, “Remain aware.” That’s why he calls it a cloud. It can blind you; you can be lost in it. If you can transcend this cloud – TATAH KLESA-KARMA-NIVRTTIH – THEN FOLLOWS FREEDOM FROM AFFLICTIONS AND KARMAS.\nIf you can transcend dharma megha samadhi, if you can transcend this heavenly state, this paradise, then only... then follows freedom from afflictions and karmas. Otherwise, you will fall back into the world. Have you seen small children play a game called ludo, ladders and snakes? From the ladders they go on rising, and from the snakes they go on coming back. From point ninety-nine, if they reach a hundred they have won the game, they are victorious. But from point ninety-nine there is a snake. If you reach ninety-nine, you are suddenly back, back into the world.\nDharma megha samadhi is the ninety-ninth point, but the snake is there. Before the snake takes hold of you, you have to jump to the hundredth point. Only then, there is abode. You have come back home; a full circle.\nTHEN FOLLOWS FREEDOM FROM AFFLICTIONS AND KARMAS.\nTHAT WHICH CAN BE KNOWN THROUGH THE MIND IS VERY LITTLE COMPARED WITH THE INFINITE KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED IN ENLIGHTENMENT, WHEN THE VEILS, DISTORTIONS, AND IMPURITIES ARE REMOVED.\nJust a few sutras back, Patanjali said that the mind is infinitely knowledgeable, the mind can know infinitely. Now he says that that which can be known through the mind is very little compared with the infinite knowledge obtained in enlightenment.\nAs you progress higher, each state is bigger than the first state that you have transcended. When one is lost in his senses, the mind functions in a crippled way. When one is no more lost in the senses and no more attached to the body, the mind starts functioning in a perfectly healthy way. An infinite apprehension happens to mind; it becomes capable of knowing infinities. But that too is nothing compared to when mind is completely dropped and you start functioning without mind. No medium is now needed. All wheels disappear and you are immediate to reality. Not even mind is there as an agent, as a go-between. Nothing is in between. You and the reality are one. The knowledge that comes through mind is nothing compared to the knowledge that happens through enlightenment.\nHAVING FULFILLED THEIR OBJECT, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE THREE GUNAS COMES TO AN END.\nFor the enlightened person the whole world stops, because now there is no need for the world to go on. The ultimate has been achieved. The world exists as a situation. The world exists for your growth. The school exists for learning. When you have learned the lesson, the school is no more for you; you have graduated. When somebody attains enlightenment, he has graduated from the world. Now the school no longer has any function for him. Now he can forget about the school, and the school can forget about him. He has gone beyond, he has grown. The situation is no longer needed.\nThe world is a situation: it is a situation for you to go astray and come back home. It is a situation to be lost in and then come back. It is a situation to forget God and then remember Him again.\nBut why this situation? – because there is a subtle law: if you cannot forget God, you cannot remember Him. If there is no possibility to forget Him, how will you remember, why will you remember? That which is always available is easily forgotten. The fish in the ocean never knows the ocean, never comes across it. He lives in it, is born in it, dies in it, but never comes to know the ocean. There is only one situation when the fish comes to know the ocean: when it is taken out of the ocean. Then suddenly it becomes aware that this was the ocean, his life. When the fish is thrown on the bank, on the sand, then she knows what ocean is.\nWe needed to be thrown out of the ocean of God; there was no other way to know Him. The world is a great situation to become aware. Anguish is there, pain is there, but it is all meaningful. Nothing is meaningless in the world. Suffering is meaningful. The suffering is just like the fish suffering on the bank, in the sand, and making all efforts to go back to the ocean. Now, if the fish goes back to the ocean she will know. Nothing has changed – the ocean is the same, the fish is the same – but their relationship has tremendously changed. Now she will know, “This is the ocean.” Now she will know how grateful she is to the ocean. The suffering has created a new understanding. Before also she was in the same ocean, but now the same ocean is no more the same because a new understanding exists, a new awareness, a new recognition.\nMan needs to be thrown out of God. To be thrown into the world is nothing but to be thrown out of God. And it is out of compassion, out of the compassion of the whole that you are thrown out, so that you try to find the way back. By effort, by arduous effort you will be able to reach, and then you will understand. You have to pay for it by your efforts, otherwise God would be too cheap. And when a thing is too cheap, you cannot enjoy it. Otherwise, God would be too obvious. When a thing is too obvious you tend to forget. Otherwise, God would be too close to you and there would be no space to know Him. That will be the real misery, not to know Him. The misery of the world is not a misery; it is a blessing in disguise because only through this misery will you come to know the tremendous blissfulness of recognizing, of seeing face to face... the divine truth.\nHAVING FULFILLED THEIR OBJECT, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE THREE GUNAS COMES TO AN END.\nThe whole world of the three gunas: sattva, rajas, tamas, comes to an end. Whenever somebody becomes enlightened, for him the world comes to an end. Of course, others go on dreaming. If there are too many fish suffering on the bank, in the hot sand, in the burning sun, and one fish tries and tries and jumps into the ocean, again back home, for her, or for him, the hot sun and the burning sand and all the misery has disappeared. It is already a nightmare of the past; but for others, it exists.\nWhen a fish like Buddha, Patanjali, jumps into the ocean, for them the world has disappeared. They are again back in the cool womb of the ocean. They are back again, joined, connected to the infinite life. They are no longer disconnected; they are no longer alienated. They have become aware. They have come back with a new understanding: alert, enlightened – but for others the world continues.\nThese sutras of Patanjali are nothing but messages of a fish who has reached home, trying to jump and say something to the people who are still on the bank and suffering. Maybe they are very close\nto the ocean, just on the border, but they don’t know how to enter into it. They are not making enough effort, or, are making them in the wrong directions, or, are simply lost in misery and have accepted that this is what life is, or, are so frustrated, discouraged, that they are not making any effort. Yoga is the effort to reach to that reality with which we have become disconnected. To be reconnected is to be a yogi. Yoga means: re-connection, re-union, re-merging.\nKRAMAHA, THE PROCESS, IS THE SUCCESSION OF CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, WHICH BECOME APPREHENSIBLE AT THE FINAL END OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.\nIn this small sutra Patanjali has said everything that modern physics has come to discover. Just thirty or forty years ago, it would have been impossible to understand this sutra because the whole quantum physics is present, in seed form, in this small sutra. And this is good, because this is just the last-but-one. So Patanjali summarizes the whole world of physics in this last-but-one sutra: then, the METAphysics. This is the essential physics. The greatest insight that has come to physics in this century is the theory of quantum.\nMax Planck discovered a very unbelievable thing. He discovered that life is not a continuity; everything is discontinuous. One moment of time is separate from another moment of time, and between the two moments of time there is a space. They are not connected; they are disconnected. One atom is separate from another atom, and between the two atoms there is great space. They are not connected. This is what he calls ‘quanta’: distinct, separate atoms not bridged with each other, floating in infinite space, but separate – just as you pour peas from one carton into another and the peas all fall, separate, distinct, or, if you pour oil from one container into another, the oil falls in a continuity.\nThe existence is like peas, separate. Why does Patanjali mention this? – because he says, “One atom, another atom: these are two things the world consists of. Just between the two is the space. That is what the whole consists of, the God. Call it space, call it brahma, call it purusa or whatsoever you like; the world consists of distinct atoms, and the whole consists of the infinite space between the two.”\nNow physicists say that if we press the whole world and press the space out of it, all the stars and all the suns can be pressed into just a small ball. Only that much matter exists. It is really space. Matter is very rare, here and there. If we press the earth very much, we can put it into a matchbox. If all the space is thrown out, unbelievable! “And that too, if we go on pressing it still more,” Patanjali says, “then even that small quantity will disappear.” Now physicists say that when matter disappears it leaves black holes.\nEverything comes out of nothingness, plays around, disappears again into nothingness. As there are material bodies: earth, sun, stars, there are, just similar to them, empty holes, black holes. Those black holes are nothingness condensed. It is not simply nothingness; it is very dynamic – whirlpools of nothingness. If a star comes by a black hole, the black hole will suck it in. So it is very dynamic, but it is nothing – no matter in it, simply absence of matter; just pure space, but tremendously powerful. It can suck any star in, and the star will disappear into nothingness; it will be reduced to nothingness. So ultimately, if we try, then all matter will disappear. It comes out of a tremendous nothingness, and it drops again into a tremendous nothingness: out of nothingness, and back into nothingness.\nKRAMAHA, THE PROCESS – THE PROCESS OF QUANTUM – IS THE SUCCESSION OF CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT WHICH BECOMES APPREHENSIBLE AT THE FINAL END OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.\nThis the yogi comes to see at the final stage, when all the three gunas are disappearing into black holes, disappearing into nothingness. That’s why yogis have called the world maya, a magic show.\nHave you seen a magician producing a mango tree within seconds, and then it goes on growing; and not only that – within seconds mangoes have appeared... out of nothing? It is just illusory; he creates illusion. Maybe he sends deep messages to your unconscious. It is just like deep hypnosis. He creates the idea, but he visualizes his idea so deeply and he impresses it on your unconscious so deeply that you also start seeing it as he wants you to see it. Nothing is happening. The tree is not there, the mango is not there. And it is possible, just out of great imagination, to create a mango tree, and mangoes come. Not only that, but he can pluck one mango and give it to you and you will say, “Very sweet.”\nHindus call the world maya, a magic show. It is God’s imagination. The whole is dreaming, the whole is projecting.\nYou go to a movie: on a wide screen you see a great story being enacted, and you see that everything seems to be continuous, but it is not. If the film is moved a little slower, you will see that everything is discontinuous – quanta. One picture goes, another comes, another goes, another comes, but between two pictures there is a gap. In that gap you can see the real screen. When the pictures are moving very fast, they create an illusion of movement. Of course, a movie film is not a moving film. It is as static a photograph as any other. The movement is illusory because those static photographs are running after each other so fast, the gap between them is so small, that you cannot see the gap. So everything looks as if it is continuous.\nI move my hand: to show this hand moving in a film. thousands of pictures will be needed of each state of stasis – from this point to this, from this point to this, from this point to this. The one simple movement of the hand will be divided into thousands of small static movements. Then all those pictures move fast: the hand seems to be moving. It is an illusion. Deep down, between two pictures, it is a white screen, empty.\nPatanjali says, “The world is nothing but a cinematograph, a projection.” But this understanding arises only when one achieves to the last point of understanding. When he sees all gunas stopped, nothing is moving, suddenly he becomes aware that the whole story was created by illusory movement, by fast movement. This is what is happening to modern physics.\nFirst they said when they had come to the atom, “Now this is the ultimate; it cannot be divided any more.” Then they also divided the atom. Then they came to electrons: “Now it cannot be divided any more.” Now they have divided that too. Now they have come to nothingness; now they don’t know what has come. Division, division, division, and a point has come in modern physics where matter has completely disappeared. Modern physics has reached via matter, and Patanjali and the yogis have reached to the same point via consciousness. Up to this last-but-one sutra, physics has reached. Up to this last-but-one sutra, scientists can have an approach, an understanding, a penetration. The last sutra is not possible for scientists, because that last sutra can be achieved\nonly if you move through consciousness, not through matter; not through objects, but directly through subjectivity.\nPURUSARTHA-SUNYANAM GUNANAM PRATIPRASAVAH KAIVALYAM SVARUPA-PRATISTHA VA CITI-SAKTER ITI. KAIVALYA IS THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT THAT FOLLOWS THE REMERGENCE OF THE GUNAS, DUE TO THEIR BECOMING DEVOID OF THE OBJECT OF THE PURUSA. IN THIS STATE, THE PURUSA IS ESTABLISHED IN HIS REAL NATURE, WHICH IS PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. FINISH.\nKAIVALYA is the state of enlightenment that follows the remergence of the three gunas... when the world stops, when the process, the kramaha of the world stops, when you become able to see between two moments of time and two atoms of matter, and you can move into space, and you can see that everything has arisen out of space and is moving back into space; when you have become so aware that suddenly the illusory world disappears like a dream, then kaivalya. Then you are left as pure consciousness – with no identity, with no name, no form. Then you are the purest of the pure. Then you are the most fundamental, the most essential, the most existential, and you are established in this purity, aloneness.\nPatanjali says, “kaivalya is the state of enlightenment that follows the remergence of the gunas, due to their becoming devoid of the object of the Purusa. In this state the Purusa is established in his real nature.” You have come back home. The journey has been long, torturous, arduous, but you have come back home. The fish has jumped into the ocean which is pure consciousness. Patanjali does not say anything more about it, because more cannot be said. And when Patanjali says, “Finish; the end,” he does not only mean that the YOGA SUTRAS finish here. He says, “All possibility to express ends here. All possibility to say anything about the ultimate reality ends here. Beyond this is only experience. Expression ends here.” And nobody has been able to go beyond it – nobody. Not a single exception exists in the whole history of human consciousness. People have tried. Very few have even reached to where Patanjali had reached, but nobody has been able to go beyond Patanjali.\nThat’s why I say he’s the alpha and the omega. He starts from the very beginning; nobody has been able to find a better beginning than him. He begins from the very beginning and he comes to the very end. When he says, “Finish,” he’s simply saying expression is finished, definition is finished, description is finished. If you have really come with him up to now, there is only experience beyond. Now starts the existential. One can be it, but one cannot say it. One can live in it, but one cannot define it. Words won’t help. All language is impotent beyond this point. Simply saying this much: that one achieves to one’s own true nature – Patanjali stops. That’s the goal: to know one’s nature and to live in it – because unless we reach to our own natures we will be in misery. All misery is indicative that we are living somehow unnaturally. All misery is simply symptomatic that somehow our nature is not being fulfilled, that somehow we are not in tune with our reality. The misery is not your enemy; it is just a symptom. It indicates. It is like a thermometer; it simply shows that you are going wrong somewhere. Put it all right, put yourself right; bring yourself in harmony, come back, tune yourself. When every misery disappears one is in tune with one’s nature. That nature Lao Tzu calls tao, Patanjali calls kaivalya, Mahavir calls moksha, Buddha calls nirvana. But whatsoever you want to call it – it has no name and it has no form – it is in you, present, right this moment. You have lost the ocean because you have come out of your self. You have moved too much in the outer world. Move inwards. Now, let this be your pilgrimage: move inwards.\nIt happened: A Sufi mystic, Bayazid, was going on a pilgrimage to Mecca. It was difficult. He was poor and somehow he had managed the travelling expenses by begging for years. Now he was very happy. He had almost the necessary money to go to Mecca, and then he travelled. By the time he reached near Mecca, just outside the town he met a fakir, his Master. He was sitting there just under a tree, and he said, “Oh fool, where are you going?” Bayazid looked at him; he had never seen such a luminous being. He came near him and the man said, “Give me whatsoever you have! Where are you going?” He said, “I am going to Mecca for a pilgrimage.” He said, “Finish. There is now no need; you just worship me. You can move around me as many times as you like. You can do your parikrama, your circumlocution, around me. I am Mecca.” And Bayazid was so filled with this person’s magnetism that he gave all his money, he worshipped. Then the old man said, “Now go back home”; and he went back home.\nWhen he went into his town people gathered and said, “Something seems to have happened to you. So really it works, going to Mecca works? You are looking luminous, so full of light.” He said, “Stop this nonsense! One old man met me – he changed my whole pilgrimage. He says, ‘Go home,’ and since then I have been going home, inwards. I have arrived. I have arrived, I have reached to my Mecca.”\nThe outer Mecca is not the real Mecca. The real Mecca is inside you. You are the temple of God. You are the abode of the ultimate. So the question is not where to find truth, the question is: how have you lost it? The question is not where to go; you are already there – stop going.\nDrop from all the paths. All paths are of desire, extensions of desire, projections of desire: going somewhere, going somewhere, always somewhere else, never here.\nSeeker, leave all paths, because all paths lead there, and He is here.\nPURUSARTHA-SUNYANAM GUNANAM PRATIPRASAVAH KAIVALYAM SVARUPA-PRATISTHA VA CITI-SAKTER ITI.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9431","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_10/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_10/>Yoga, The Alpha and the Omega - Vol 10</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 Kaivalya</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9431 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Yoga_The_Alpha_and_the_Omega__Vol_10/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

FROM THE MOMENT TO MOMENT WHICH BECOME APPREHENSIBLE AT THE FINAL END OF
THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.</p><p><br></p><p>33. KAIVALYA IS THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT THAT FOLLOWS THE
REMERGENCE OF THE GUNAS, DUE TO THEIR BECOMING DEVOID OF THE OBJECT OF
THE PURUSA.</p><p><br></p><p>34. IN THIS STATE, THE PURUSA IS ESTABLISHED IN HIS REAL NATURE,
WHICH IS PURE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>VISESA-DARSINA ATMA-BHAVA-BHAVANAVINIVRTTIH.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE
FOR DWELLING IN THE ATMA, THE SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA HAS CALLED the ultimate state of consciousness anatta – no
self, non-being. It is very difficult to comprehend it. Buddha has said
that the last desire to drop is the desire to be. There are millions of
desires. The whole world is nothing but desire objects, but the basic
desire is to be. The basic desire is to continue, to persist, to remain.
Death is the greatest fear; the last desire to be dropped is the desire
to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali in this sutra says: when your awareness has become perfect,
when viveka, discrimination has been achieved, when you have become a
witness, a pure witness of whatsoever happens, outside you, inside
you.<span class=s4></span>You are no more a doer, you are simply
watching; the birds are singing</p><p>outside... you watch; the blood is circulating inside... you watch;
the thoughts are moving inside... you watch – you never get identified
anywhere. You don’t say, “I am the body”; you don’t say, “I am the
mind”; you don’t say anything. You simply go on watching without being
identified with any object. You remain a pure subject; you simply
remember one thing: that you are the watcher, the witness – when this
witnessing is established, then the desire to be disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment the desire to be disappears, death also disappears.
Death exists because you want to persist. Death exists because you don’t
want to die. Death exists because you are struggling against the whole.
The moment you are ready to die, death is meaningless; it cannot be
possible now. When you are ready to die, how can you die? In the very
readiness of dying, disappearing, all possibility of death is overcome.
This is the paradox of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “If you are going to cling to yourself, you will lose
yourself. If you want to attain yourself, don’t cling.” Those who try to
be are destroyed. Not that somebody is there destroying you; your very
effort to be is destructive because the moment the idea arises: “I
should persist,” you are moving against the whole. It is as if a wave is
trying to be against the ocean. Now the very effort is going to create
worry and misery, and one moment will come when the wave will have to
disappear. But now, because the wave was fighting against the ocean, the
disappearance will look like death. If the wave was ready, and the wave
was aware: “I’m nothing but the ocean, so what is the point in
persisting? I have been always and I will be always, because the ocean
has always been there and will be always there. I may not exist as a
wave – wave is just the form I have taken for the moment.</p><p>The form will disappear, but not my content. I may not exist like
this wave; I may exist like another wave, or I may not exist as a wave
as such. I may become the very depth of the ocean where no waves
arise<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>But the innermost reality is going to remain because the whole has
penetrated you. You are nothing but the whole, an expression of the
whole. Once awareness is established, Patanjali says, “When one has seen
this distinction, that ‘I am neither this nor that’, when one has become
aware and is not identified with anything whatsoever, there is a
cessation of desire for dwelling in the atma, in the self” Then the last
desire disappears, and the last is the fundamental. Hence, Buddha says,
“You can drop desiring money, wealth, power, prestige – that’s nothing.
You can stop desiring the world – that’s nothing – because those are
secondary desires. The basic desire is to be.” So people who renounce
the world start desiring liberation, but liberation is also their
liberation. They will remain in moksha, in a liberated state. They
desire that pain should not be there. They desire that misery should not
be there. They will be in absolute bliss, but they will be. The
insistence is that they must be there.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Buddha could not get roots into this country which thinks
itself very religious. The most religious man who was born on this earth
could not get roots into this religious country. What happened? He said,
he insisted, to drop the basic desire of being: he said, “Be a
non-being.” He said, “Don’t be.” He said, “Don’t ask for liberation
because the freedom is not for you. The freedom is going to be freedom
from you; not for you, but from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Liberation is liberation from yourself. See the distinction: it is
not for you; liberation is not for you. It is not that liberated you
will exist. Liberated, you will disappear. Buddha said, “Only bondage
exists.” Let me try to explain it to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever come across health? You have been healthy many times,
but can you say what health is? Only disease exists. Health is
non-existential; you cannot pin-point it. If you have a headache you
know it is there, but have you ever known the absence of headache? In
fact, if there is no headache the head- also disappears. You don’t feel
it anymore. If you go on feeling your head, that simply shows that there
must be a certain tension inside, a certain stress, a strain. A sort of
headache must be there continuously. If your whole body is healthy, the
body disappears. You forget that the body is. In Zen, when meditators
sit for many years, just sitting and doing nothing, a certain moment
comes when they forget that they have bodies. That is their first
satori. Not that the body is not there; body is there but there is no
tension, so how to feel it? If I say something you can hear me, but if
I’m silent how can you hear me? Silence is there – it has much to
communicate to you – but silence cannot be heard. Sometimes when you
say, “Yes, I can hear the silence,” then you are hearing some noise.
Maybe it is the noise of the dark night, but it is still noise. If it is
absolutely silent, you will not be able to hear it. When your body is
perfectly healthy, you don’t feel it. If some tension arises in the
body, some disease, some illness, then you start hearing. If everything
is in harmony and there is no pain and no misery, suddenly you are
empty. A nothingness overwhelms you.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaivalya is the ultimate health, wholeness, all wounds healed. When
all wounds heal, how can you exist? The self is nothing but accumulated
tensions. The self is nothing but all sorts of diseases, illnesses. The
self is nothing but desires unfulfilled, hopes frustrated, expectations,
dreams – all broken, fractured. It is nothing but accumulated disease,
that you call ‘self’. Or take it from another</p><p>side: in moments of harmony you forget that you are. Later on, you
may remember how beautiful it was, how fantastic it was, how far-out.
But in moments of real far-outness, you are not there. Something bigger
than you has overpowered you; something higher than you has possessed
you; something deeper than you has bubbled up. You have disappeared. In
deep moments of love, lovers disappear. In deep moments of silence,
meditators disappear. In deep moments of singing, dancing, celebration,
celebrators disappear. And this is going to be the last celebration, the
ultimate, the highest peak – kaivalya.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says, “Even the desire to be disappears. Even the desire to
remain disappears.” One is so fulfilled, so tremendously fulfilled that
one never thinks in terms of being. For what? – you want to be there
tomorrow also because today is unfulfilled. The tomorrow is needed;
otherwise you will die unfulfilled. The yesterday was a deep
frustration; today is again a frustration; tomorrow is needed. A
frustrated mind creates future. A frustrated mind clings with the
future. A frustrated mind wants to be because now, if death comes, no
flower has flowered. Nothing has yet happened; there has only been a
fruitless waiting: “Now, how can I die? I have not even lived yet.” That
unlived life creates a desire to be.</p><p><br></p><p>People are so much afraid of death: these are the people who have not
lived. These are the people who are, in a certain sense, already dead. A
person who has lived and lived totally does not think about death. If it
comes, good; he will welcome. He will live that too, he will celebrate
that too. Life has been such a blessing, a benediction; one is even
ready to accept death. Life has been such a tremendous experience; one
is ready to experience death also. One is not afraid because the
tomorrow is not needed; the today has been so fulfilling. One has come
to fruition, flowered, bloomed. Now the desire for tomorrow disappears.
The desire for tomorrow is always out of fear, and fear is there because
love has not happened. The desire to always remain simply shows that
deep down you are feeling yourself completely meaningless. You are
waiting for some meaning. Once the meaning has happened, you are ready
to die – silently, beautifully, gracefully.</p><p><br></p><p>“Kaivalya,” Patanjali says, “happens only when the last desire to be
has disappeared.” The whole problem is to be or not to be. The whole
life we try to be this and that, and the ultimate can happen only when
you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE
FOR DWELLING IN THE SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>The self is nothing but the most purified form of the ego. It is the
last remnant of strain, stress, tension. You are still not perfectly
open; something is still closed. When you are completely open, just a
watcher on the hill, a witness, even the death desire disappears. With
the disappearance of this desire, something absolutely new happens in
life. A new law starts functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard about the law of gravitation; you have not heard about
the law of grace. The law of gravitation is that everything falls
downwards. The law of grace is that things start falling upwards. And
that law has to be there because in life everything is balanced by the
opposite. Science has come to discover the law of gravitation: Newton
sitting on a bench in a garden saw one apple falling – it happened or
not; that is not the point – but seeing that the apple was falling down,
a thought arose in him: “Why do things always fall downwards? Why not
otherwise? Why doesn’t a ripe fruit fall upwards and disappear into the
sky? Why not sideways? Why always downwards?” He started</p><p>brooding and meditating, and then he discovered a law. He came upon,
stumbled upon a very fundamental law: that the earth is gravitating
things towards itself. It has a gravitation field. Like a magnet, it
pulls everything downwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali, Buddha, Krishna, Christ – they also became aware of a
different fundamental law, higher than gravitation. They became aware
that there comes a moment in the inner life of consciousness when
consciousness starts rising upwards – exactly like gravitation. If the
apple is hanging on the tree, it does not fall. The tree helps it not to
fall downwards. When the fruit leaves the tree, then it falls
downwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly the same: if you are clinging to your body you will not fall
upwards; if you are clinging to your mind you will not fall upwards. If
you are clinging to the idea of self, you will remain under the impact
of gravitation – because body is under the impact of gravitation, and
mind also. Mind is subtle body; body is gross mind. They are both under
the impact of gravitation. And because you are clinging to them you are
not under the impact of gravitation, but you are clinging to something
which is under the impact of gravitation. It is as if you are carrying a
big rock and trying to swim in a river; the rock will pull you down. It
won’t allow you to swim. If you leave the rock, you will be able to swim
easily.</p><p><br></p><p>We are clinging to something which is functioning under the law of
gravitation: body, mind. “Once,” Patanjali says, “you have become aware
that you are neither the body nor the mind, suddenly you start rising
upwards.” Some center somewhere high in the sky pulls you up. That law
is called ‘grace’. Then God pulls you upwards. And that type of law has
to be there, otherwise gravitation could not exist. In nature, if
positive electricity exists, then negative electricity has to exist. Man
exists, then the woman has to exist. Reason exists, then intuition has
to exist. Night exists, then the day has to exist. Life exists, then
death has to exist. Everything needs the opposite to balance it. Now
science has become aware of one law: gravitation. Science still needs a
Patanjali to give it another dimension, the dimension of falling
upwards. Then life becomes complete.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a meeting place of gravitation and grace. In you, grace and
gravitation are criss-crossing. You have something of the earth and
something of the sky within you. You are the horizon where earth and sky
are meeting. If you hold too much to the earth, then you will forget
completely that you belong to the sky, to the infinite space, the
beyond. Once you are no more attached with the earth part of you,
suddenly you start rising high.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE
FOR DWELLING IN THE SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>TADAHI VIVEKA-NIMNAM KAIVALYA-PRAGBHARAM CITTAM.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE MIND IS INCLINED TOWARDS DISCRIMINATION, AND GRAVITATES
TOWARDS LIBERATION.</p><p><br></p><p>A new gravitation starts functioning. Liberation is nothing but
entering the stream of grace. You cannot liberate yourself, you can only
drop the barriers; liberation happens to you. Have you seen a magnet? –
small iron pieces are pulled towards it. You can see those small iron
pieces rushing towards the magnet, but don’t be deceived by your eyes.
In fact, they are not rushing, the magnet is pulling them. On the
surface it appears that those iron filings are going, moving towards the
magnet.</p><p>That is just on the surface. Deep down, something just opposite is
happening: they are not moving towards the magnet, the magnet is pulling
them towards itself. In fact, it is the magnet which has reached them.
With the magnetic field it has approached them, touched them, pulled
them. If those iron filings are free, not attached to something – not
attached to a rock – then the magnet can pull them. If they are attached
to a rock, the magnet will go on pulling but they will not be pulled
because they are attached.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly the same happens: once you discriminate that you are not the
body, you are no more bound to any rock, you are no more in bondage with
earth. Immediately, God’s magnet starts functioning. It is not that you
reach to God. In fact, God has already reached you. You are under His
magnetic field, but clinging to something. Drop that clinging and you
are in the stream. Buddha used to use a word srotaapanna: falling into
the stream. He used to say, “Once you fall into the stream, then the
stream takes you to the ocean. Then you need not do anything.” The only
thing is to jump into the stream. You are sitting on the bank. Enter the
stream and then the stream will do the remaining work. It is as if you
are standing on a high building, on the roof of a high building, three
hundred feet or five hundred feet above the earth. You go on standing,
the gravitation has reached you, but it will not work unless you jump.
Once you jump, then you need not do anything. Just a step off the
roof... enough; your work is finished. Now the gravitation will do all
the work. You need not ask, “Now what am I supposed to do?” You have
taken the first step. The first is the last step. Krishnamurti has
written a book, THE FIRST AND THE LAST FREEDOM. The meaning is: the
first step is the last step because once you are in the stream,
everything else is to be done by the stream. You are not needed. Only
for the first step is your courage needed.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE MIND IS INCLINED TOWARDS DISCRIMINATION, AND GRAVITATES
TOWARDS LIBERATION.</p><p><br></p><p>You start moving slowly upwards. Your life energy starts rising high
– an upsurge. And it is unbelievable when it happens because it is
against all the laws that you have known up to now. It is levitation,
not gravitation. Something in you simply starts moving upwards, and
there is no barrier to it. Nothing bars its path. Just a little
relaxation, a little unclinging – the first step – and then
automatically, spontaneously, your consciousness becomes more and more
discriminative, more and more aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you about another thing. You have heard the word, the
phrase: ‘vicious circle’. Let us make another phrase: ‘virtuous circle’.
In a vicious circle, one bad thing leads to another. For example, if you
get angry then one anger leads you to more anger, and of course, more
anger will lead you to still more anger. Now you are in a vicious
circle. Each anger will make the habit of anger more strong, and will
create more anger, and more anger will make the habit still more strong,
and on and on. You move in a vicious circle which goes on becoming
stronger and stronger and stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us try a new word: virtuous circle. If you become aware, what
Patanjali calls vivek, awareness; if you become aware: vairagya.
Discrimination creates renunciation. If you become aware, suddenly you
see that you are no more the body. Not that you renounce the body; in
your very awareness the body is renounced. If you become aware, you
become aware that these thoughts are not you. In that very awareness
those thoughts are renounced. You have started dropping them. You don’t
give them any more energy; you don’t cooperate with them. Your
cooperation has stopped, and they</p><p>cannot live without your energy. They live on your energy, they
exploit you. They don’t have their own energy. Each thought that enters
you partakes of your energy. And because you are kaivalya willing to
give your energy, it lives there, it makes its abode there. Of course,
then its children come, and friends, and relatives, and this goes on.
Once you are a little aware, vivek brings vairagya, awareness brings
renunciation. And renunciation makes you capable of becoming more aware.
And of course, more awareness brings more vairagya, more renunciation,
and so on and so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I am calling the virtuous circle: one virtue leads to
another, and each virtue becomes again a ground for more virtue to
arise.</p><p><br></p><p>“This goes on,” Patanjali says, “to the last moment” – what he calls,
dharma megha samadhi. We will be coming to it later on. He calls it ‘the
cloud of virtue showering on you’. This virtuous circle, vivek leading
to vairagya, vairagya leading to more vivek, vivek again creating more
possibilities for vairagya, and so on and so forth – comes to the
ultimate peak when the cloud of virtue showers on you: dharma megha
samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>IN BREAKS OF DISCRIMINATION, OTHER PRATYAYAS, CONCEPTS, ARISE THROUGH
THE FORCE OF PREVIOUS IMPRESSIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, though, many intervals will be there. So don’t be discouraged.
Even if you have become very aware and in sudden moments you feel the
pull, the upward pull of grace, and in certain moments you are in the
stream, floating perfectly beautifully, with no effort, effortlessly,
and everything is going and running smoothly, still there will be gaps.
Suddenly you will find yourself standing again on the bank just because
of old habits. For so many lives you have lived on the bank. Just
because of the old habit, again and again the past will overpower you.
Don’t be discouraged by it. The moment you see that you are again on the
bank, again get down into the stream. Don’t be sad about it, because if
you become sad you will again be in a vicious circle. Don’t be sad about
it. Many times the seeker comes at very close quarters, and many times
he loses the track. No need to be worried; again bring awareness. This
is going to happen many times; it is natural. For so many millions of
lives we have lived in unawareness – it is only natural that many times
the old habit will start functioning. Let me tell you a few
anecdotes.</p><p><br></p><p>The boss was full of confidence as he approached the reception desk
at a large hotel with his secretary and signed the register as Mr. and
Mrs.</p><p><br></p><p>“Double or twin beds?” enquired the clerk.</p><p><br></p><p>He turned to his secretary and asked casually, “Would a double be
alright, darling?” “Yes, sir,” she answered.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” the wife was saying to the husband! – but just the old
habit of being a secretary, continuously saying, “Yes sir, yes sir, yes
sir.” Habits become very ingrained, and they catch hold of you in such a
way that unless you are very, very watchful, you will not even
suspect.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened: An indignant schoolteacher rang the local police station
to complain that a crowd of young hooligans had chalked four-letter
words all over her front door. “And what is more,” she concluded, “they
have not even spelled them right!”</p><p>A school teacher is just a school teacher. She is complaining against
the four-letter words, but the basic complaint is that they have not
even spelled them right. Continuously correcting the spelling of
children.…</p><p><br></p><p>IN BREAKS OF DISCRIMINATION, OTHER CONCEPTS ARISE THROUGH THE FORCE
OF PREVIOUS IMPRESSIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times you will be pulled back, again and again and again. The
struggle is hard, but not impossible. It is difficult, it is very
arduous, but don’t become sad and don’t become discouraged. Whenever you
remember again, don’t be worried about what has happened. Let your
awareness again be established, that’s all. Continuously establishing
your awareness again and again and again will create a new impact inside
your being, a new impression of virtue. One day, it becomes as natural
as other habits.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN
TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO
EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION, ENTERS THE STATE KNOWN AS
‘THE CLOUD WHICH SHOWERS VIRTUE’.</p><p><br></p><p>“One who is able to maintain a constant state of desirelessness even
towards the most exalted states of enlightenment...” Patanjali calls it
paravairagya: the ultimate renunciation. You have renounced the world:
you have renounced greed, you have renounced money, you have renounced
power; you have renounced everything of the outside. You have even
renounced your body, you have even renounced your mind, but the last
renunciation is the kaivalya renunciation of kaivalya itself, of moksha
itself, of nirvana itself. Now you renounce even the idea of liberation,
because that too is a desire. And desire, whatsoever its object, is the
same. You desire money, I desire moksha. Of course, my object is better
than your object, but still my desire is the same as yours. Desire says,
“I am not content as I am. More money is needed; then I will be
contented. More liberation is needed; then I will be contented.” The
quality of desire is the same, the problem of desire is the same. The
problem is that the future is needed: “As I am, it is not enough;
something more is needed. Whatsoever has happened to me is not enough.
Something still has to happen to me; only then can I be happy.” This is
the nature of desire: you need more money, somebody needs a bigger
house, somebody thinks of more power, politics, somebody thinks of a
better wife or a better husband, somebody thinks of more education, more
knowledge, somebody thinks of more miraculous powers, but it makes no
difference. Desire is desire, and desirelessness is needed.</p><p>Now the paradox: if you are absolutely desireless – and in absolute
desirelessness, the desire of moksha is included – a moment comes when
you don’t desire even moksha, you don’t desire even God. You simply
don’t desire; you are, and there is no desire. This is the state of
desirelessness. Moksha happens in this state. Moksha cannot be desired,
by its very nature, because it comes only in desirelessness. Liberation
cannot be desired. It cannot become a motive because it happens only
when all motives have disappeared. You cannot make God an object of your
desire because the desiring mind remains ungodly. The desiring mind
remains unholy; the desiring mind remains worldly. When there is no
desire, not even the desire for God, suddenly He has always been there.
Your eyes open and you recognize Him.</p><p>Desires function as barriers. And the last desire, the most subtle
desire, is the desire to be liberated. The last, subtle desire is the
desire to be desireless.</p><p>ONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN
TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO
EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION...</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, the ultimate in discrimination will be needed. You will
have to be aware – so much so that this very, very deep desire of
becoming free of all misery, of becoming free of all bondage, even this
desire does not arise. Your awareness is so perfect that not even a
small corner is left dark inside your being. You are full of light,
illuminated with awareness. That’s why when Buddha is asked again and
again, “What happens to a man who becomes enlightened?” he remains
silent. He never answers. Again and again he is asked, “Why don’t you
answer?” He says, “If I answer, you will create a desire for it, and
that will become a barrier. Let me keep quiet. Let me remain silent so I
don’t give you a new object for desire. If I say, ‘It is satchitananda:
it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss,’ immediately a desire
will arise in you. If I talk about that ecstatic state of being in God,
immediately your greed takes it. Suddenly, a desire starts arising in
you. Your mind starts saying, ‘Yes, you have to seek it, you have to
find it. This has to be searched. Whatsoever the cost, but you have to
become blissful.’” Buddha says, “I don’t say anything about it, because
whatsoever I say, your mind will jump on it and make a desire out of it,
and that will become the cause, and you will never be able to attain
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha insisted that there is no moksha. He insisted that when a man
becomes aware, he simply disappears. He disappears as when you blow out
a lamp and the light disappears. The word ‘nirvana’ simply means blowing
a lamp out. Then you don’t ask where the flame has gone, what has
happened to the flame; it simply disappears – annihilated. Buddha
insisted that there is nothing left; when you have become enlightened
everything disappears, like the flame of a lamp put out. Why? – looks
very negative – but he does not want to give you an object of desire.
Then people started asking, “Then why should we try for such a state? It
is better then to be in the world. At least we are; miserable – but at
least we are; in anguish – but we are. And your state of nothingness has
no appeal for us.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, Buddhism disappeared; in China, in Burma, in Ceylon, in
Japan, it reappeared, but it never appeared in its purity again because
Buddhists learned a lesson: that man lives through desire. If they
insist that there is nothing beyond enlightenment and everything
disappears, then people are not going to follow them. Then everything
will remain as it is; only their religion will disappear. So they
learned a trick, and in Japan, in China, in Ceylon, in Burma, they
started talking of beautiful states after enlightenment. They betrayed
Buddha. The purity was lost; then religion spread. Buddhism became one
of the great religions of the world. They learned the politics of the
human mind. They fulfilled your desire. They said, “Yes... Lands of
tremendous beauty, Buddha- lands, heavenly lands where eternal bliss
reigns.” They started talking in positive terms. Again people’s greeds
were inflamed, desire arose. People started following Buddhism, but
Buddhism lost its beauty. Its beauty was in its insistence that it would
not give you any object for desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali has written the best that it is possible to write about the
ultimate truth, but no religion has arisen around him, no established
church exists around him. Such a great teacher, such a great Master has
remained really without a following. Not a single temple is devoted to
him. What happened? His Yoga Sutras are read, commented upon, but
nothing like Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Mohammedanism,
exists with Patanjali. Why? – because he will not give any hope to you.
He will not give any help to your desire.</p><p>ONE WHO IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT STATE OF DESIRELESSNESS, EVEN
TOWARDS THE MOST EXALTED STATES OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND IS ABLE TO
EXERCISE THE HIGHEST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION, ENTERS THE STATE KNOWN AS
‘THE CLOUD WHICH SHOWERS VIRTUE’.</p><p><br></p><p>Dharma megha samadhi: this word has to be understood. It is very
complex. And so many commentaries have been written on Patanjali, but it
seems they go on missing the point. dharma megha samadhi means: a moment
comes when every desire has disappeared. When even the self is no more
desired, when death is not feared, virtue showers on you – as if a cloud
gathers around your head, and a beautiful shower of virtue, a
benediction, a great blessing.<span class=s4></span>But why does</p><p>Patanjali call it ‘cloud’? – one has to go even beyond that; it is
still a cloud. Before, your eyes were full of vice, now your eyes are
full of virtue, but you are still blind. Before, nothing but misery was
showering on you, just a hell was showering on you; now, you have
entered heaven and everything is perfectly beautiful, there is nothing
to complain about, but still it is a cloud. Maybe it is a white cloud,
not a black cloud, but still it is a cloud – and one has to go beyond it
also. That’s why he calls it ‘cloud’.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the last barrier, and of course it is very beautiful because
it is of virtue. It is like golden chains studded with diamonds. They
are not like ordinary chains; they look very ornamental. They are more
like ornaments than chains. One would like to cling to them. Who would
not like to have a tremendous happiness showering on oneself, a
non-ending happiness? Who would not like to be in this ecstasy forever
and ever? But this too is a cloud – white, beautiful, but still the real
sky is hidden behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a possibility from this exalted point to still fall back. If
you become too attached to dharma megha samadhi, if you become too much
attached, you start enjoying it too much and you don’t discriminate that
“I am also not this,” there is a possibility that you will come
back.</p><p><br></p><p>In Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, only two states exist: hell
and heaven. This is what Christians call heaven, what Patanjali calls
dharma megha samadhi. In the West, no religion has risen beyond that. In
India we have three terms: hell, heaven and moksha. Hell is absolute
misery; heaven is absolute happiness; moksha is beyond both: neither
hell nor heaven. In Western language, there exists not a single term
equivalent to moksha. Christianity stops at heaven – dharma megha
samadhi. Who bothers anymore to go beyond it? It is so beautiful. And
you have lived in so much misery for so long; you would like to remain
there forever and ever. But Patanjali says, “If you cling to it, you
slip from the last rung of the ladder. You were just close to home. One
step more, and then you would have achieved the point of no return – but
you slipped. You were just reaching home and you missed the path. You
were just at the door – a knock and the doors would have opened – but
you thought that the porch was the palace and you started living there.”
Sooner or later you will even lose the porch, because the porch exists
for those who are going into the palace. It cannot be made an abode. If
you make an abode of it, sooner or later you will be thrown out: you are
not worthy. You are like a beggar who has started to live on somebody’s
porch.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to enter the palace; then the porch will remain available.
But if you stop at the porch even the porch will be taken away. And the
porch is very beautiful, and we have never known anything like that, so
certainly we misunderstand – we think the palace has come. We have lived
always in anxiety, misery, tension, and even the porch, even to be close
to the ultimate palace, to be so close</p><p>to the ultimate truth, is so silent, so peaceful, so blissful, such a
great benediction, that you cannot imagine that better than that is
possible. You would like to settle here.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says, “Remain aware.” That’s why he calls it a cloud. It
can blind you; you can be lost in it. If you can transcend this cloud –
TATAH KLESA-KARMA-NIVRTTIH – THEN FOLLOWS FREEDOM FROM AFFLICTIONS AND
KARMAS.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can transcend dharma megha samadhi, if you can transcend this
heavenly state, this paradise, then only... then follows freedom from
afflictions and karmas. Otherwise, you will fall back into the world.
Have you seen small children play a game called ludo, ladders and
snakes? From the ladders they go on rising, and from the snakes they go
on coming back. From point ninety-nine, if they reach a hundred they
have won the game, they are victorious. But from point ninety-nine there
is a snake. If you reach ninety-nine, you are suddenly back, back into
the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Dharma megha samadhi is the ninety-ninth point, but the snake is
there. Before the snake takes hold of you, you have to jump to the
hundredth point. Only then, there is abode. You have come back home; a
full circle.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN FOLLOWS FREEDOM FROM AFFLICTIONS AND KARMAS.</p><p><br></p><p>THAT WHICH CAN BE KNOWN THROUGH THE MIND IS VERY LITTLE COMPARED WITH
THE INFINITE KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED IN ENLIGHTENMENT, WHEN THE VEILS,
DISTORTIONS, AND IMPURITIES ARE REMOVED.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few sutras back, Patanjali said that the mind is infinitely
knowledgeable, the mind can know infinitely. Now he says that that which
can be known through the mind is very little compared with the infinite
knowledge obtained in enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>As you progress higher, each state is bigger than the first state
that you have transcended. When one is lost in his senses, the mind
functions in a crippled way. When one is no more lost in the senses and
no more attached to the body, the mind starts functioning in a perfectly
healthy way. An infinite apprehension happens to mind; it becomes
capable of knowing infinities. But that too is nothing compared to when
mind is completely dropped and you start functioning without mind. No
medium is now needed. All wheels disappear and you are immediate to
reality. Not even mind is there as an agent, as a go-between. Nothing is
in between. You and the reality are one. The knowledge that comes
through mind is nothing compared to the knowledge that happens through
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING FULFILLED THEIR OBJECT, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE THREE
GUNAS COMES TO AN END.</p><p><br></p><p>For the enlightened person the whole world stops, because now there
is no need for the world to go on. The ultimate has been achieved. The
world exists as a situation. The world exists for your growth. The
school exists for learning. When you have learned the lesson, the school
is no more for you; you have graduated. When somebody attains
enlightenment, he has graduated from the world. Now the school no longer
has any function for him. Now he can forget about the school, and the
school can forget about him. He has gone beyond, he has grown. The
situation is no longer needed.</p><p>The world is a situation: it is a situation for you to go astray and
come back home. It is a situation to be lost in and then come back. It
is a situation to forget God and then remember Him again.</p><p><br></p><p>But why this situation? – because there is a subtle law: if you
cannot forget God, you cannot remember Him. If there is no possibility
to forget Him, how will you remember, why will you remember? That which
is always available is easily forgotten. The fish in the ocean never
knows the ocean, never comes across it. He lives in it, is born in it,
dies in it, but never comes to know the ocean. There is only one
situation when the fish comes to know the ocean: when it is taken out of
the ocean. Then suddenly it becomes aware that this was the ocean, his
life. When the fish is thrown on the bank, on the sand, then she knows
what ocean is.</p><p><br></p><p>We needed to be thrown out of the ocean of God; there was no other
way to know Him. The world is a great situation to become aware. Anguish
is there, pain is there, but it is all meaningful. Nothing is
meaningless in the world. Suffering is meaningful. The suffering is just
like the fish suffering on the bank, in the sand, and making all efforts
to go back to the ocean. Now, if the fish goes back to the ocean she
will know. Nothing has changed – the ocean is the same, the fish is the
same – but their relationship has tremendously changed. Now she will
know, “This is the ocean.” Now she will know how grateful she is to the
ocean. The suffering has created a new understanding. Before also she
was in the same ocean, but now the same ocean is no more the same
because a new understanding exists, a new awareness, a new
recognition.</p><p><br></p><p>Man needs to be thrown out of God. To be thrown into the world is
nothing but to be thrown out of God. And it is out of compassion, out of
the compassion of the whole that you are thrown out, so that you try to
find the way back. By effort, by arduous effort you will be able to
reach, and then you will understand. You have to pay for it by your
efforts, otherwise God would be too cheap. And when a thing is too
cheap, you cannot enjoy it. Otherwise, God would be too obvious. When a
thing is too obvious you tend to forget. Otherwise, God would be too
close to you and there would be no space to know Him. That will be the
real misery, not to know Him. The misery of the world is not a misery;
it is a blessing in disguise because only through this misery will you
come to know the tremendous blissfulness of recognizing, of seeing face
to face... the divine truth.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING FULFILLED THEIR OBJECT, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE THREE
GUNAS COMES TO AN END.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world of the three gunas: sattva, rajas, tamas, comes to an
end. Whenever somebody becomes enlightened, for him the world comes to
an end. Of course, others go on dreaming. If there are too many fish
suffering on the bank, in the hot sand, in the burning sun, and one fish
tries and tries and jumps into the ocean, again back home, for her, or
for him, the hot sun and the burning sand and all the misery has
disappeared. It is already a nightmare of the past; but for others, it
exists.</p><p><br></p><p>When a fish like Buddha, Patanjali, jumps into the ocean, for them
the world has disappeared. They are again back in the cool womb of the
ocean. They are back again, joined, connected to the infinite life. They
are no longer disconnected; they are no longer alienated. They have
become aware. They have come back with a new understanding: alert,
enlightened – but for others the world continues.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras of Patanjali are nothing but messages of a fish who has
reached home, trying to jump and say something to the people who are
still on the bank and suffering. Maybe they are very close</p><p>to the ocean, just on the border, but they don’t know how to enter
into it. They are not making enough effort, or, are making them in the
wrong directions, or, are simply lost in misery and have accepted that
this is what life is, or, are so frustrated, discouraged, that they are
not making any effort. Yoga is the effort to reach to that reality with
which we have become disconnected. To be reconnected is to be a yogi.
Yoga means: re-connection, re-union, re-merging.</p><p><br></p><p>KRAMAHA, THE PROCESS, IS THE SUCCESSION OF CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM
MOMENT TO MOMENT, WHICH BECOME APPREHENSIBLE AT THE FINAL END OF THE
TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.</p><p><br></p><p>In this small sutra Patanjali has said everything that modern physics
has come to discover. Just thirty or forty years ago, it would have been
impossible to understand this sutra because the whole quantum physics is
present, in seed form, in this small sutra. And this is good, because
this is just the last-but-one. So Patanjali summarizes the whole world
of physics in this last-but-one sutra: then, the METAphysics. This is
the essential physics. The greatest insight that has come to physics in
this century is the theory of quantum.</p><p><br></p><p>Max Planck discovered a very unbelievable thing. He discovered that
life is not a continuity; everything is discontinuous. One moment of
time is separate from another moment of time, and between the two
moments of time there is a space. They are not connected; they are
disconnected. One atom is separate from another atom, and between the
two atoms there is great space. They are not connected. This is what he
calls ‘quanta’: distinct, separate atoms not bridged with each other,
floating in infinite space, but separate – just as you pour peas from
one carton into another and the peas all fall, separate, distinct, or,
if you pour oil from one container into another, the oil falls in a
continuity.</p><p><br></p><p>The existence is like peas, separate. Why does Patanjali mention
this? – because he says, “One atom, another atom: these are two things
the world consists of. Just between the two is the space. That is what
the whole consists of, the God. Call it space, call it brahma, call it
purusa or whatsoever you like; the world consists of distinct atoms, and
the whole consists of the infinite space between the two.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now physicists say that if we press the whole world and press the
space out of it, all the stars and all the suns can be pressed into just
a small ball. Only that much matter exists. It is really space. Matter
is very rare, here and there. If we press the earth very much, we can
put it into a matchbox. If all the space is thrown out, unbelievable!
“And that too, if we go on pressing it still more,” Patanjali says,
“then even that small quantity will disappear.” Now physicists say that
when matter disappears it leaves black holes.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything comes out of nothingness, plays around, disappears again
into nothingness. As there are material bodies: earth, sun, stars, there
are, just similar to them, empty holes, black holes. Those black holes
are nothingness condensed. It is not simply nothingness; it is very
dynamic – whirlpools of nothingness. If a star comes by a black hole,
the black hole will suck it in. So it is very dynamic, but it is nothing
– no matter in it, simply absence of matter; just pure space, but
tremendously powerful. It can suck any star in, and the star will
disappear into nothingness; it will be reduced to nothingness. So
ultimately, if we try, then all matter will disappear. It comes out of a
tremendous nothingness, and it drops again into a tremendous
nothingness: out of nothingness, and back into nothingness.</p><p>KRAMAHA, THE PROCESS – THE PROCESS OF QUANTUM – IS THE SUCCESSION OF
CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT WHICH BECOMES APPREHENSIBLE AT
THE FINAL END OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE THREE GUNAS.</p><p><br></p><p>This the yogi comes to see at the final stage, when all the three
gunas are disappearing into black holes, disappearing into nothingness.
That’s why yogis have called the world maya, a magic show.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen a magician producing a mango tree within seconds, and
then it goes on growing; and not only that – within seconds mangoes have
appeared... out of nothing? It is just illusory; he creates illusion.
Maybe he sends deep messages to your unconscious. It is just like deep
hypnosis. He creates the idea, but he visualizes his idea so deeply and
he impresses it on your unconscious so deeply that you also start seeing
it as he wants you to see it. Nothing is happening. The tree is not
there, the mango is not there. And it is possible, just out of great
imagination, to create a mango tree, and mangoes come. Not only that,
but he can pluck one mango and give it to you and you will say, “Very
sweet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus call the world maya, a magic show. It is God’s imagination.
The whole is dreaming, the whole is projecting.</p><p><br></p><p>You go to a movie: on a wide screen you see a great story being
enacted, and you see that everything seems to be continuous, but it is
not. If the film is moved a little slower, you will see that everything
is discontinuous – quanta. One picture goes, another comes, another
goes, another comes, but between two pictures there is a gap. In that
gap you can see the real screen. When the pictures are moving very fast,
they create an illusion of movement. Of course, a movie film is not a
moving film. It is as static a photograph as any other. The movement is
illusory because those static photographs are running after each other
so fast, the gap between them is so small, that you cannot see the gap.
So everything looks as if it is continuous.</p><p><br></p><p>I move my hand: to show this hand moving in a film. thousands of
pictures will be needed of each state of stasis – from this point to
this, from this point to this, from this point to this. The one simple
movement of the hand will be divided into thousands of small static
movements. Then all those pictures move fast: the hand seems to be
moving. It is an illusion. Deep down, between two pictures, it is a
white screen, empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says, “The world is nothing but a cinematograph, a
projection.” But this understanding arises only when one achieves to the
last point of understanding. When he sees all gunas stopped, nothing is
moving, suddenly he becomes aware that the whole story was created by
illusory movement, by fast movement. This is what is happening to modern
physics.</p><p><br></p><p>First they said when they had come to the atom, “Now this is the
ultimate; it cannot be divided any more.” Then they also divided the
atom. Then they came to electrons: “Now it cannot be divided any more.”
Now they have divided that too. Now they have come to nothingness; now
they don’t know what has come. Division, division, division, and a point
has come in modern physics where matter has completely disappeared.
Modern physics has reached via matter, and Patanjali and the yogis have
reached to the same point via consciousness. Up to this last-but-one
sutra, physics has reached. Up to this last-but-one sutra, scientists
can have an approach, an understanding, a penetration. The last sutra is
not possible for scientists, because that last sutra can be achieved</p><p>only if you move through consciousness, not through matter; not
through objects, but directly through subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>PURUSARTHA-SUNYANAM GUNANAM PRATIPRASAVAH KAIVALYAM SVARUPA-PRATISTHA
VA CITI-SAKTER ITI. KAIVALYA IS THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT THAT FOLLOWS
THE REMERGENCE OF THE GUNAS, DUE TO THEIR BECOMING DEVOID OF THE OBJECT
OF THE PURUSA. IN THIS STATE, THE PURUSA IS ESTABLISHED IN HIS REAL
NATURE, WHICH IS PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. FINISH.</p><p><br></p><p>KAIVALYA is the state of enlightenment that follows the remergence of
the three gunas... when the world stops, when the process, the kramaha
of the world stops, when you become able to see between two moments of
time and two atoms of matter, and you can move into space, and you can
see that everything has arisen out of space and is moving back into
space; when you have become so aware that suddenly the illusory world
disappears like a dream, then kaivalya. Then you are left as pure
consciousness – with no identity, with no name, no form. Then you are
the purest of the pure. Then you are the most fundamental, the most
essential, the most existential, and you are established in this purity,
aloneness.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says, “kaivalya is the state of enlightenment that follows
the remergence of the gunas, due to their becoming devoid of the object
of the Purusa. In this state the Purusa is established in his real
nature.” You have come back home. The journey has been long, torturous,
arduous, but you have come back home. The fish has jumped into the ocean
which is pure consciousness. Patanjali does not say anything more about
it, because more cannot be said. And when Patanjali says, “Finish; the
end,” he does not only mean that the YOGA SUTRAS finish here. He says,
“All possibility to express ends here. All possibility to say anything
about the ultimate reality ends here. Beyond this is only experience.
Expression ends here.” And nobody has been able to go beyond it –
nobody. Not a single exception exists in the whole history of human
consciousness. People have tried. Very few have even reached to where
Patanjali had reached, but nobody has been able to go beyond
Patanjali.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say he’s the alpha and the omega. He starts from the
very beginning; nobody has been able to find a better beginning than
him. He begins from the very beginning and he comes to the very end.
When he says, “Finish,” he’s simply saying expression is finished,
definition is finished, description is finished. If you have really come
with him up to now, there is only experience beyond. Now starts the
existential. One can be it, but one cannot say it. One can live in it,
but one cannot define it. Words won’t help. All language is impotent
beyond this point. Simply saying this much: that one achieves to one’s
own true nature – Patanjali stops. That’s the goal: to know one’s nature
and to live in it – because unless we reach to our own natures we will
be in misery. All misery is indicative that we are living somehow
unnaturally. All misery is simply symptomatic that somehow our nature is
not being fulfilled, that somehow we are not in tune with our reality.
The misery is not your enemy; it is just a symptom. It indicates. It is
like a thermometer; it simply shows that you are going wrong somewhere.
Put it all right, put yourself right; bring yourself in harmony, come
back, tune yourself. When every misery disappears one is in tune with
one’s nature. That nature Lao Tzu calls tao, Patanjali calls kaivalya,
Mahavir calls moksha, Buddha calls nirvana. But whatsoever you want to
call it – it has no name and it has no form – it is in you, present,
right this moment. You have lost the ocean because you have come out of
your self. You have moved too much in the outer world. Move inwards.
Now, let this be your pilgrimage: move inwards.</p><p>It happened: A Sufi mystic, Bayazid, was going on a pilgrimage to
Mecca. It was difficult. He was poor and somehow he had managed the
travelling expenses by begging for years. Now he was very happy. He had
almost the necessary money to go to Mecca, and then he travelled. By the
time he reached near Mecca, just outside the town he met a fakir, his
Master. He was sitting there just under a tree, and he said, “Oh fool,
where are you going?” Bayazid looked at him; he had never seen such a
luminous being. He came near him and the man said, “Give me whatsoever
you have! Where are you going?” He said, “I am going to Mecca for a
pilgrimage.” He said, “Finish. There is now no need; you just worship
me. You can move around me as many times as you like. You can do your
parikrama, your circumlocution, around me. I am Mecca.” And Bayazid was
so filled with this person’s magnetism that he gave all his money, he
worshipped. Then the old man said, “Now go back home”; and he went back
home.</p><p><br></p><p>When he went into his town people gathered and said, “Something seems
to have happened to you. So really it works, going to Mecca works? You
are looking luminous, so full of light.” He said, “Stop this nonsense!
One old man met me – he changed my whole pilgrimage. He says, ‘Go home,’
and since then I have been going home, inwards. I have arrived. I have
arrived, I have reached to my Mecca.”</p><p><br></p><p>The outer Mecca is not the real Mecca. The real Mecca is inside you.
You are the temple of God. You are the abode of the ultimate. So the
question is not where to find truth, the question is: how have you lost
it? The question is not where to go; you are already there – stop
going.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop from all the paths. All paths are of desire, extensions of
desire, projections of desire: going somewhere, going somewhere, always
somewhere else, never here.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeker, leave all paths, because all paths lead there, and He is
here.</p><p><br></p><p>PURUSARTHA-SUNYANAM GUNANAM PRATIPRASAVAH KAIVALYAM SVARUPA-PRATISTHA

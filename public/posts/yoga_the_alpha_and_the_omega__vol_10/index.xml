‌CHAPTER 1
Dropping the artificial mind
1 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
NOW BEGINS THE LAST SECTION OF PATANJALI’S SUTRAS, KAIVALYA PADA.
1. THE POWERS ARE REVEALED AT BIRTH, OR ACQUIRED THROUGH DRUGS, REPEATING SACRED WORDS, AUSTERITIES, OR SAMADHI
2. THE TRANSFORMATION FROM ONE CLASS, SPECIES, OR KIND, INTO ANOTHER, IS BY THE OVERFLOW OF NATURAL TENDENCIES OF POTENTIALITIES.
3. THE INCIDENTAL CAUSE DOES NOT STIR THE NATURAL TENDENCIES INTO ACTIVITY; IT MERELY REMOVES THE OBSTACELS – LIKE A FARMER IRRIGATING A FIELD: HE REMOVES THE OBSTACLES, AND THEN THE WATER FLOWS FREELY BY ITSELF.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
I am in favor of love
10 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY IS EVERY HUMAN BEING FULL OF PROBLEMS AND UNHAPPY?
THE FIRST THING: because man can be tremendously happy, the possibility exists, hence, his unhappiness. Nobody else – no animal, no bird, no tree, no rock – can be so happy as man. The possibility, the tremendous possibility that you can be happy, eternally happy, that you can be at the top of a bliss mountain, creates unhappiness.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Aloneness is the last achievement
2 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
DOES A DISCIPLE STEAL SOMETHING FROM HIS MASTER?
Everything!
Because the truth cannot be taught, it has to be learned. The Master can only tempt you, make you more and more thirsty for it; but he cannot deliver it to you – it is not a thing.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Returning to the original mind
3 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
6. ONLY THE ORIGINAL MIND WHICH IS BORN OF MEDITATION IS FREE FROM DESIRES.
7. THE YOGI’S KARMAS ARE NEITHER PURE NOR IMPURE, BUT ALL OTHERS ARE THREE- FOLD: PURE, IMPURE AND MIXED.
8. DESIRES ARISE FROM THESE THREE-FOLD KARMAS WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FAVORABLE FOR THEIR FULFILLMENT.
9. BECAUSE MEMORIES AND IMPRESSIONS RETAIN THE SAME FORM, THE RELATIONSHIP OF CAUSE AND EFFECT CONTINUES, EVEN THOUGH SEPARATED BY CLASS, LOCALITY, AND TIME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Everything is interdependent
4 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHILE TALKING ABOUT WISDOM, INSIGHTS, AND ENLIGHTENMENT, YOU OFTEN SAY ‘WE IN THE EAST’. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF THIS PHRASE.
THE EAST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EAST. The East is just symbolic of the inner space, of the inner world of consciousness. East is symbolic of religion, West is symbolic of science.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
This is it!
5 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
11. BEING BOUND TOGETHER AS CAUSE-EFFECT, THE EFFECTS DISAPPEAR WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CAUSES.
12. PAST AND FUTURE EXIST IN THE PRESENT, BUT THEY ARE NOT EXPERIENCED IN THE PRESENT BECAUSE THEY ARE ON IDFFERENT PLANES.
13. WHETHER MANIFEST OR UNMANIFEST, THE PAST, THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE ARE OF THE NATURE OF GUNAS: STABILITY, ACTION AND INERTIA.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Without any choice of your own
6 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE TEACHINGS OF RUDOLPH STEINER, BUT I COULD NOT YET BREAK THROUGH MY BARRIERS TOWARDS HIM. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE HIM TO BE RIGHT IN THE WAY HE SHOWS THAT FOR THE WEST, THE POSSIBILITY TO FREE OURSELVES FROM ‘MAYA’ IS TO LEARN TO THINK IN THE RIGHT WAY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The witness is self-illuminating
7 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
18. THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE MIND ARE ALWAYS KNOWN BY ITS LORD, DUE TO THE CONSTANCY OF THE PURUSA, PURE CONSCIOUSNESS.
19. THE MIND IS NOT SELF-ILLUMINATING, BECAUSE IT IS ITSELF PERCEPTIBLE.
20. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MIND TO KNOW ITSELF AND ANY OTHER OBJECT AT THE SAME TIME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Trust is unaddressed
8 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IN ONE OF YOUR LECTURES SOMETHING HAS HIT ME HARD. IT IS THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN TRUSTING MYSELF AND TRUSTING YOU. THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT SAYS: IF I TRUST MY OWN SELF AND FOLLOW MY OWN SELF, THEN I HAVE SURRENDERED AND SAID YES TO YOU.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Kaivalya
9 May 1976 am in Buddha Hall
25. WHEN ONE HAS SEEN THIS DISTINCTION, THERE IS A CESSATION OF DESIRE FOR DWELLING IN THE ATMA, THE SELF.
26. THEN THE MIND IS INCLINED TOWARDS DISCRIMINATION, AND GRAVITATES TOWARDS LIBERATION.
27. IN BREAKES OF DISCRIMINATION, OTHER PRATYAYAS, CONCEPTS, ARISE THROUGH THE FORCE OF PREVIOUS IMPRESSIONS. THESE SHOULD BE REMOVED IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER AFFLICTIONS.</description>

That is one of the greatest hindrances\nIn the spiritual search.\nNothing is needed from the outside God has provided you with everything That you will need on the journey.\nThe light is there\nAnd only your own inner light can help you\nTo distinguish the right From the wrong\nCan help you not to go astray\nCan help you to always be moving towards god. Those who depend on others\nAre simply wasting their opportunity. My effort here is not to guide you Not to give you directions\nNot to give you certain character styles Structures, patterns\nBut only to help you to be yourself.\nI am not here to distract you from your being. That is what is being done all over the world By all the so-called organised religions.\nThe past of humanity has been very uncreative 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- For the simple reason that religions Were teaching renunciation, not creativity. Religions were teaching that the world\nIs illusory. If the world is illusory What is the point of creating anything? The religions were teaching people\nTo become drop-outs\nThey were teaching people to become escapists. And their impact has been great\nThey have poisoned the whole humanity. Otherwise every child is born\nWith a tremendous capacity to be creative. But we destroy him, we cripple him\nWe paralyse him.\nMy approach is just the opposite.\nI would like you to be more and more creative Because only by being creative\nCan you participate with god. Whenever you are creative\nYou are part of god, the creator.\nThere is no other way to participate with him. So what you create is immaterial,\nThat is up to you, but create something.\nAnyone creative -- a potter -- is far closer to god.\nThan a professor, than a priest. A shoemaker is far closer to god\nThan a politician, than a prime minister Or a president.\nIf god is a creator, then of course\nAll his blessings are for those who are creators. Every sannyasin who belongs to me\nHas to prove his mettle by creating something, Whatsoever it is. Find out what you would love to create.\nThere is no need to become world-famous There is no need to become a Nobel laureate There is no need that everybody should know And appreciate your creativity;\nThat is not the point. If you are enjoying it\nIf you are delighted in doing it that's enough. That means god is happy with you.\nIf you are delighted that means god is delighted. It is his delight that reaches to you.\nPrayer\nHas been very much misunderstood down the ages 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So much so that it has taken on A totally wrong meaning.\nNow prayer means saying something to god. Even a man like Martin buber thinks\nPrayer as a dialogue with god. What to say about ordinary people?\nMartin Buber is a rare, intelligent human being One of the greatest philosophers of this age.\nBut even he goes on carrying the same old Rotten meaning of having a dialogue with god -- As if something has to be said to god.\nThere is nothing to say.\nPrayer is not saying something to god It is listening to god.\nWhen you are all ears, just ears -- Open, available, ready to listen\nReady to be guided, surrendered, in a let-go -- That is prayer.\nIf this meaning is understood\nThen prayer and meditation\nAre no more different at all, then they are\nTwo different names for the same phenomenon. Both mean silence.\nBoth mean a receptivity, an availability to god. What can you say?\nAnd whatsoever you do say will be stupid. All prayers are stupid!\nMan is stupid, so whatsoever he can bring forth From his mind is going to be stupid.\nIt will be part of his ignorance\nOf his unawareness, of his unconsciousness. It will be nothing but his desires, demands Complaints.\nOne has to be silent Before existence.\nThat is prayer. Sitting silently by a river Or sitting silently by a rosebush\nOr sitting silently under the moon\nOr sitting silently with a friend holding hands That is prayer... because god is everywhere.\nWherever you are silent you are in prayer.\nBasically prayer is gratitude -- gratitude For all that god has done for you already. It is gratefulness, it is a deep feeling\nOf thankfulness. Reduced to the minimum It is a non-verbal thank-you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You need not say it, you have only to feel it. The prayerful person is constantly feeling That everything is a gift of god.\nLife is a gift, love is a gift Consciousness is a gift.\nYou are here\nAnd becoming a sannyasin is gift!\nWhen each moment of your life becomes permeated By an unspoken thank you, that is prayer.\nThen it goes on resounding in you;\nEven while you are asleep it goes on and on Deep inside you like an undercurrent.\nYou are not saying it\nIt is not addressed to anybody in particular Because god has no address\nAt least no postal address!\nIt is unaddressed, unspoken , but it is there Throbbing in every beat of your heart.\nThat is prayer.\nFeel it, be it, and you will come to know The greatest experience of your life\nThe greatest ecstasy.\nBy worship I don't mean any ritual. Ritual is not worship.\nLove is worship and love is never a ritual. Rituals are repetitive, formal.\nLove is informal, non-repetitive, spontaneous. Be in love with existence -- that is worship.\nAnd love in as many ways as possible Don't hold back.\nThat's my whole teaching. Jump into life totally, wholly.\nWhen you are wholly in life, totally in life You become religious, you become holy.\nThat is the only way to be holy. Your so-called saints are not holy They are simply dead.\nDance is the most symbolic act.\nNothing represents god better than dance. God is a dancer.\nAnd why do I say 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That nothing represents him better? Because dance is the only activity known to us In which the actor and the action are one.\nIf you paint\nThe painter becomes different from the painting. If you sculpt\nYou become separate from your creation. Dance is the only activity\nWhich is inseparable from the dancer;\nYou cannot take the dance away from the dancer. Existence is the dance of god;\nThey are together.\nHence he has to be found in this dance:\nThe wind passing through the pine trees The sound of running water\nThe song of the birds in the morning The freedom of the clouds\nThe beauty of the flowers.\nGod has to be found now and here In this very dance.\nThis whole existence is his temple. There is no need to make any churches\nAny temples, any mosques. The are all false And they go on distracting people\nfrom the true religion. True religion\nIs a devotion towards life and existence. Remember it: in every leaf of grass is god. It is his gesture.\nIn thousand of moods and in thousands of gestures He is dancing all over. He is dancing within you and without you.\nHence I teach my sannyasins to dance\nAnd to dance with such abundance That you are lost in it.\nThat will give you the first taste\nOf what it is to have a meeting with god To have a date with god.\nMy sannyas is not to be serious It is not to be sad.\nMy sannyas has to be a song, a celebration A rejoicing in life.\nI don't teach renunciation because to me\nGod is life, and if you cannot find him in life You will not find him anywhere else.\nGod is not to be found in the monasteries Or in Himalayan caves;\nHe is to be found in life In all kinds of situations 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Which one has to encounter in life. God has to be found in all\nThe bitter experiences and the sweet experiences That life makes available to you;\nIn the days, in the nights\nIn the summers, in the winters In the thorns, in the flowers.\nGod has to be found here in the thick of life. A sannyasin is one who goes\nWith a singing heart into the darkest night. And if you can go with a singing heart\nIn the darkest night\nEven the darkness becomes luminous. Light is pure energy\nLife has nothing but light in it.\nThe whole existence consists of light. Matter is an illusion\nIt only appears because we cannot see clearly Because we cannot penetrate deeply --\nThat's why it appears, otherwise it disappears.\nThere is only light, an immense ocean of light And we are waves in that immense ocean.\nTo know it is not only to be transformed To know it is to be reborn.\nThe old dies totally\nAnd something absolutely new arrives\nWhich is not connected with the other at all -- It is disconnected, discontinuous.\nIt is the death of the old\nAnd the resurrection of the new.\nAnd once you feel yourself as just light\nYou will start feeling others also as pure light. Then life is a dance of light, an eternal dance. And to know this is to know what delight is.\nDelight is the experience\nThat life is made of the stuff called light. Then there is only celebration.\nWhen there is no darkness\nThere is no death, no hell, no misery. There is eternal celebration, halleluja! We have been here forever\nAnd we are going to be here forever. Every person is born with a divine voice Although we never hear it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is a still small voice. It is the voice of god.\nBut our heads are so full of other voices -- Voice of America...\nAnd there are a thousand and one voices. We can't hear the still small voice.\nAnd in our heads all the stations are on Simultaneously;\nIt is so noisy inside that even if god shouts You won't hear.\nAnd he never shouts, he whispers. Love always whispers\nBecause to shout is a little violent. Love knows to wait, hence god waits. Love knows to hope, hence god hopes. If not today, then tomorrow...\nSome dau you are going to hear. Sannyas is nothing but an effort\nTo make your noisy mind a little quieter\nSo that you can hear your own voice.\nOnce you have heard it your life is transfomed. Then you don't need any Bible, any Gita, any Koran. You have your own Bible, your own Gita\nYour own Koran.\nThere is no need to depend on others.\nThere is no need to depend on borrowed knowledge. So become more and more silent;\nLess and less noisy so that you can hear The whisper of god within you.\nThat's the beginning of a new life Of a life that is eternal.\nIt is tenderness that makes you vulnerable\nThat makes you open, that makes you sensitive To the mysterious that surrounds us.\nPeople who are not tender\nWho are hard like rock, go on missing life. Life passes by: it cannot penetrate them They are impenetrable.\nOne should be like a rose flower, very tender: The one comes to know The mysterious and the miraculous.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Life is full of surprises But only for those who have a tender heart. But we all have been brought up in such a way\nThat we become hard, because we have been told That life is a struggle, it is a conflict\nIt is a constant struggle for survival So one has to be hard.\nIf you are not hard you will not be able to compete.\nAnd that is true: You will not be able to compete But competition leads nowhere. It is a sheer wastage.\nOne should live a non-competitive life Then only does one know what god is. Jesus says:\nThose who are the last in this world Will be the first in my kingdom of god.\nNow he is teaching non-competitiveness: Those who are the last in this world\nWill be the first in my kingdom of god.\nBut remember\nDon't be the last in order to be the first Otherwise you miss the whole point.\nEnjoy being the last.\nAnd to be the first in the kingdom of god Is a consequence, it is not a goal.\nLife is such a joy for those who are tender Soft, loving, compassionate, sensitive.\nThat life itself is proof\nIn thousands of ways it proves that god is. But to the hard, to the rocklike person, There is no proof for god.\nGod cannot be proved for him Because he has no sensitivity to feel. He has lost all feeling\nHe lives only in the thinking.\nHe has lost his heart, he is just a head. And the head is just rubbish!\nBe a heart.\nEven if you have to lose the head lose the head -- It is worth it.\nIt is beautiful to be headless But it is ugly to be heartless.\nMy sannyasins have to be heartful and headless. That is the very definition of my sannyas.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- There is a peace That is not imposed form the outside. One can pretend to be peaceful -- That is hypocrisy, that is ugly.\nReal peace arises from within, it arises\nOut of understanding, awareness, meditation. It is not something imposed\nIt is not like a mask that you wear.\nIt radiates from the very centre of your being. One cannot cultivate it.\nA cultivated peace is false, is not even skin-deep. Scratch a little and immediately the ugly\nThe animal-like, the angry person is there. All peace is gone.\nBut a really peaceful person is peaceful all over From the circumference to the centre.\nYou can go digging\nYou will find more and more peace. The more you dig into him\nThe more you will find fresh layers of peace. When you reach the very centre of his being You will find ultimate peace.\nThat is another name for god. Bliss is possible\nOnly to those few people who are courages; In cannot happen to the cowards.\nCourage is the price we have to pay for it. A coward is bound to remain in misery Because a coward cannot drop his clinging To old patterns; it feels safer to be\nWith the old, known, familiar.\nEven though they are creating misery It feels more safe, comfortable, cosy Than moving into the unknown\nInto the unpredictable.\nHence cowards go on crawling within their limits Within their small holes. Bliss is possible\nOnly when you go beyond your known limits. When you go beyond the boundaries\nWhen you start adventuring into the unknown. That needs tremendous courage\nHence I say courage\nIs the most fundamental religious quality. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Jesus is courageous, that is the meaning Of carrying his cross on his own shoulders. That means one is ready to die any moment For one's convictions, for one's commitments For one's promises.\nOne is even ready to sacrifice one's life Joyously, with no complaint, with no grudge. Just the other day in Rome, the pope Enacted the carrying of the cross to the hill. It is a drama.\nThousands of pilgrims were following him With torches and flags and crosses of their own. And he carried a beautifully carved cross\nOn his shoulders.\nAnd it was thought that something Tremendously beautiful was happening. It is simply ugly.\nIt is befooling yourself and others. Carrying one's own cross is not a drama It is a risk.\nYou cannot enact it, you have to live it. And the drama was not even completed -- At least they should have crucified him!\nWhat is the point\nOf carrying the cross to the hill and coming back All happy that it was a good picnic!\nBliss is not a human achievement, It is a gift from god.\nIt comes from the beyond. We cannot manufacture it\nIt is beyond our capacities to create it.\nBut we can be available to it We can be ready for it\nWe can be a host for it.\nAmd that's what meditation is all about:\nBeing a host for god\nWaiting with great longing but with no anxiety With great expectancy but no expectation.\nThe difference is subtle but of tremendous import. If one can wait in hope, in trust\nAnd one can surrender and say yes to god One day it happens.\nIt happens suddenly, it never happens gradually. It is not that it comes slowly slowly, in parts.\nIt suddenly explodes.\nIt suddenly takes possession of you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- From all directions You are engulfed, encompassed by it The experience of bliss\nIs an encompassing experience. One is drowned in it!\nThe ego disappears totally\nAnd when you come back you are no more the same, The old person is nowhere to be found\nNot even a trace is found.\nIn fact it never existed in the first place.\nIt was just a dream... and you are awakened. Hence, never make bliss a goal.\nPeople start making bliss a goal. That is the first step in missing it. You are moving in a wrong direction.\nBliss is not a goal; nobody has ever achieved it. It has come to many, but it has always come:\nIt comes of its own accord.\nThat does not mean that we have nothing to do -- We do have something to do.\nWe have to prepare the ground, we have to be Utterly empty so that it can penetrate us.\nWe have to open all the doors and all the windows We have to drop all fear of the unknown\nOf the mysterious, of the miraculous.\nAnd we have to be ready to be surprised. That means we have to drop all knowledge And we have to start functioning from a state Of not-knowing.\nWe have to be innocent.\nIn a single word 'innocence' Is the essence of religion.\nAnd then it comes, surely it comes Absolutely it comes, inevitably it comes And possesses you so totally\nThat it does not leave\nA single nook or corner within you Where misery or darkness can hide.

the simple reason that religions</span></h3><p>Were teaching renunciation, not creativity. Religions were teaching
that the world</p><p>Is illusory. If the world is illusory What is the point of creating
anything? The religions were teaching people</p><p>To become drop-outs</p><p>They were teaching people to become escapists. And their impact has
been great</p><p>They have poisoned the whole humanity. Otherwise every child is
born</p><p>With a tremendous capacity to be creative. But we destroy him, we
cripple him</p><p>We paralyse him.</p><p>My approach is just the opposite.</p><p>I would like you to be more and more creative Because only by being
creative</p><p>Can you participate with god. Whenever you are creative</p><p>You are part of god, the creator.</p><p>There is no other way to participate with him. So what you create is
immaterial,</p><p>That is up to you, but create something.</p><p>Anyone creative -- a potter -- is far closer to god.</p><p>Than a professor, than a priest. A shoemaker is far closer to god</p><p>Than a politician, than a prime minister Or a president.</p><p>If god is a creator, then of course</p><p>All his blessings are for those who are creators. Every sannyasin who
belongs to me</p><p>Has to prove his mettle by creating something, Whatsoever it is. Find
out what you would love to create.</p><p>There is no need to become world-famous There is no need to become a
Nobel laureate There is no need that everybody should know And
appreciate your creativity;</p><p>That is not the point. If you are enjoying it</p><p>If you are delighted in doing it that's enough. That means god is
happy with you.</p><p>If you are delighted that means god is delighted. It is his delight

philosophers of this age.</p><p>But even he goes on carrying the same old Rotten meaning of having a
dialogue with god -- As if something has to be said to god.</p><p>There is nothing to say.</p><p>Prayer is not saying something to god It is listening to god.</p><p>When you are all ears, just ears -- Open, available, ready to
listen</p><p>Ready to be guided, surrendered, in a let-go -- That is prayer.</p><p>If this meaning is understood</p><p>Then prayer and meditation</p><p>Are no more different at all, then they are</p><p>Two different names for the same phenomenon.

say?</p><p>And whatsoever you do say will be stupid. All prayers are stupid!</p><p>Man is stupid, so whatsoever he can bring forth From his mind is
going to be stupid.</p><p>It will be part of his ignorance</p><p>Of his unawareness, of his unconsciousness. It will be nothing but
his desires, demands Complaints.</p><p>One has to be silent Before existence.</p><p>That is prayer. Sitting silently by a river Or sitting silently by a
rosebush</p><p>Or sitting silently under the moon</p><p>Or sitting silently with a friend holding hands That is prayer...
because god is everywhere.</p><p>Wherever you are silent you are in prayer.</p><p>Basically prayer is gratitude -- gratitude For all that god has done
for you already. It is gratefulness, it is a deep feeling</p><p>Of thankfulness. Reduced to the minimum It is a non-verbal

the action are one.</p><p>If you paint</p><p>The painter becomes different from the painting. If you sculpt</p><p>You become separate from your creation. Dance is the only
activity</p><p>Which is inseparable from the dancer;</p><p>You cannot take the dance away from the dancer. Existence is the
dance of god;</p><p>They are together.</p><p>Hence he has to be found in this dance:</p><p>The wind passing through the pine trees The sound of running
water</p><p>The song of the birds in the morning The freedom of the clouds</p><p>The beauty of the flowers.</p><p>God has to be found now and here In this very dance.</p><p>This whole existence is his temple. There is no need to make any
churches</p><p>Any temples, any mosques. The are all false And they go on
distracting people</p><p>from the true religion. True religion</p><p>Is a devotion towards life and existence. Remember it: in every leaf
of grass is god. It is his gesture.</p><p>In thousand of moods and in thousands of gestures He is dancing all
over. He is dancing within you and without you.</p><p>Hence I teach my sannyasins to dance</p><p>And to dance with such abundance That you are lost in it.</p><p>That will give you the first taste</p><p>Of what it is to have a meeting with god To have a date with god.</p><p>My sannyas is not to be serious It is not to be sad.</p><p>My sannyas has to be a song, a celebration A rejoicing in life.</p><p>I don't teach renunciation because to me</p><p>God <em>is</em> life, and if you cannot find him in life You will not
find him anywhere else.</p><p>God is not to be found in the monasteries Or in Himalayan caves;</p><p>He is to be found in life In all kinds of situations 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--which-one-has-to-encounter-in-life.>Osho's

available to you;</p><p>In the days, in the nights</p><p>In the summers, in the winters In the thorns, in the flowers.</p><p>God has to be found here in the thick of life. A sannyasin is one who
goes</p><p>With a singing heart into the darkest night. And if you can go with a
singing heart</p><p>In the darkest night</p><p>Even the darkness becomes luminous. Light is pure energy</p><p>Life has nothing but light in it.</p><p>The whole existence consists of light. Matter is an illusion</p><p>It only appears because we cannot see clearly Because we cannot
penetrate deeply --</p><p>That's why it appears, otherwise it disappears.</p><p>There is only light, an immense ocean of light And we are waves in
that immense ocean.</p><p>To know it is not only to be transformed To know it is to be
reborn.</p><p>The old dies totally</p><p>And something absolutely new arrives</p><p>Which is not connected with the other at all -- It is disconnected,
discontinuous.</p><p>It is the death of the old</p><p>And the resurrection of the new.</p><p>And once you feel yourself as just light</p><p>You will start feeling others also as pure light. Then life is a
dance of light, an eternal dance. And to know this is to know what
delight is.</p><p>Delight is the experience</p><p>That life is made of the stuff called light. Then there is only
celebration.</p><p>When there is no darkness</p><p>There is no death, no hell, no misery. There is eternal celebration,

It is for reference purposes only.]\nPrayer, grace and mercy are three dimensions Of a really religious life.\nA religious life begins in prayer and ends in mercy. A religious life means a deep \"Yes\" to god --\nThat is prayer:\nA total yes to god, not holding yourself back, A whole-hearted \"Yes\". And once that \"Yes\" has happened\nYour life becomes full of grace.\nIt attains to a beauty that is not of this world That belongs to the beyond That starts showering on you.\nAnd not only you feel it Even others start feeling it. It surrounds you.\nIt is like an aroma, an aura, a fragrance. It is true beauty.\nAnd when grace has started descending in your life All your energy becomes compassion, mercy.\nIt transform your energy.\nIt makes your life full of love. There is nothing else to do.\nAll desires disappear and you are so full of energy That you start sharing your life, your love,\nWhatsoever you have.\nThat sharing is compassion. These are the three dimensions. Between these three is born The religious consciousness.\nYour name contains the whole art of religion. Matthias was one of the disciples of Jesus One of the twelve apostles.\nHe is symbolically represented by a young angel To signify Jesus Christ's humanity.\nHe was the most human disciple Out of all the disciples of Jesus. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Once you become interested in god You start becoming more and more super-human. It happens naturally:\nYou start transcending humanity You start surpassing humanity.\nMatthias remained utterly a human being\nAnd became a representative of Jesus' humanity. All the twelve disciples represent something.\nThey are twelve aspects of Jesus.\nNobody represents Jesus in his wholeness He is so vast\nBut each disciple can represent him at least In a single aspect.\nMatthias represents his humanity\nAnd that is of great significance Because in the East\nBuddha is thought to be absolutely super-human.\nAll the stories that we have written about Buddha Have taken away everything human from him.\nHe is just an abstraction He is almost intangible.\nHe looks more like a myth than like a reality. And so is the case with Krishna and Mahavira: Everything human has been taken away.\nIt is not that they were not human, They were human, very human, But the idea was that a ,am of god Has to go beyond humanity.\nFor example\nMahavira is said not to have perspired Because that is too human.\nNow, in India not to perspire... It is a super-human feat!\nIt is easier to walk on water Than not to perspire in India!\nAnd he lived in the hottest part of the country, In Bihar, and he lived naked And he walked bare-footed on muddy paths\nIn dirt and dust and in the burning sun. But the stories say that he never perspired Never urinated, never defecated.\nThese are human things too human!\nThe followers of Mahavira, cannot conceive Him urinating.\nThat looks below Mahavira, too below:\nHe is a god! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You can always think of him sitting In deep meditation.\nThat's the only activity left for him. In that way Jesus is far more human. He enjoys eating and drinking\nAnd mixing with people and laughing and joking.\nHe enjoyed company, and the company of all kinds Of people -- gamblers, drunkards, prostitutes.\nHe is really human!\nAnd Matthias is the most human of all His disciples, he represents his humanity. My effort here\nIs to make religion as human as possible. It should not be airy-fairy!\nWe have to bring it down to earth.\nAnd I allow my sannyasins to perspire!\nThere is nothing wrong in it, no sin is committed. Even a sauna bath is perfectly virtuous!\nPerspire as much as you can.\nRemember that religion has not to be unearthly. It has to be rooted in the earth\nOnly then is it alive.\nWhen it becomes too cloudy, uprooted\nIt looses all greenness, it looses all aliveness. It becomes just an abstract philosophy.\nThat's what has happened in the East. Hence Jainas cannot believe in Jesus, Neither can Buddhists believe in Jesus Because he is too human.\nBut I am all for Jesus\nSimply because he is so human! We want a religion which is human.\nOf course one has not to end with humanity\nOne has to go beyond it, one has to transcend it But one should remain rooted. A tree is rooted in the earth\nYet it goes above the earth. It reaches into the sky\nIt whispers with the clouds\nIt has a dialogue with the winds.\nIt blooms, but it remains rooted in the earth. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- A truly religious person will have wings And will also have roots\nRoots in the earth and wings in the sky. That is the true synthesis.\nAnd then religion is complete, total, whole. God loves playfulness.\nThis whole existence is out of his playfulness.\nHe loves celebration. This whole existence\nIs in a continuous celebration. He loves songs and dances.\nBut our so-called religious people are very sad Very serious -- pathologically serious.\nAnd I know why they cannot find god:\nGod avoids them!\nWho would like their company? The moment god gets any news\nThat they are coming close, he escapes! He abhors saints like people abhor death.\nEven sinners are far better company than saints For the simple reason that At least the sinners can sing and dance\nAnd laugh and love. Saints can't do anything.\nThey can only remain serious, dead, cold. God is utterly afraid of your saints!\nMy sannyasins\nAre not to become so-called saints.\nThey have to become singers and dancers.\nI believe in a god who is a dancer Who is a singer, who is a musician. His existence is not a business project. It is out of fun that he creates.\nAnd when you also start living life as fun You start growing.\nWhen life becomes a non-serious affair Then you have no limits\nThen the whole sky is yours. That we are beloveds of god\nIs something to be constantly remembered. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Man has forgotten it completely, hence There is so much a feeling of being outsiders As if we don't belong to the existence\nAs if the existence does not care As if the existence is indifferent\nAs if we are just accidental, not essential. The whole world\nIs dominated ba a dark cloud of alienation. And the reason is that we have forgotten\nA simple truth: God loves us, hence we are. We are his love-products.\nHis love is the very base of our life. We can't breathe without his love\nOur hearts will stop beating without his love His love is our existence.\nBut because it is so close tu us It is easy to forget about it.\nThere is no distance between it and us\nHence we can't see it and we become oblivious Of anything we can't see.\nIt has to be consciously remembered, and as\nThe remembrance deepens all alienation disappears. The dark cloud is found no more and the world\nIs full of sunshine. It is a joy to be\nBecause this is our home and we are not accidental We are absolutely essential, we are needed.\nWe are serving some grater purpose, something Greater than we are, something bigger than we are.\nMan unaware of himself is a beggar. Man aware of himself\nIs the greatest emperor possible\nBecause the moment you become aware of yourself The whole kingdom of god is yours.\nIt has already been given to you It is just that you are asleep.\nIt is there, but you are not looking at it. Your eyes are focussed on the outside. The whole effort here is\nTo help your eyes turn inwards. Sannyas is an inner pilgrimage. We are born with a great treasure 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So vast, so great that it is inexhaustible. But we live in utter poverty\nBecause we never dig within our own being. We go on looking everywhere else.\nThis is the most strange thing about man\nThat he searches and seeks everywhere. He is ready to go to Everest\nHe is ready to go to the moon But he is not ready to go within. The moment you say \"Go within\" It falls on deaf ears.\nAnd it is there the treasure is.\nSo we go on carrying the treasure with us And still remain beggars.\nSannyas means a radical change From this stupid approach From this idiotic behavior; Your reality is within\nAnd you go on seeking and searching without. The first enquiry should be made within.\nIf you don't find it there, then of course You can go on exploring the whole world. But that has never happened.\nThose who have gone within have always found it. Meditation is a simple process\nOf watching your own mind.\nNot fighting with the mind Not trying to control it either\nJust remaining there, a choiceless witness. Whatsoever passes you simply take note of it With no prejudice for or against.\nYou don't call it names\nThat this should not come to my mind That this is an ugly thought and\nThis is a very beautiful and virtuous thought. You should not judge\nYou should remain non-judgmental\nBecause the moment you judge, you lose meditation. You become identified.\nEither you become a friend or you become a foe. You create relationships.\nMeditation means\nRemaining unrelated with your thought process Utterly unrelated, cool, calm\nWatching whatsoever is passing. And then a miracle happens: 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Slowly slowly one becomes aware That less and less thoughts are passing.\nThe more alert you are, the less thoughts pass The less alert you are, the more thoughts pass.\nIt is as if traffic depends on your awareness. When you are perfectly aware\nEven for a single moment, all thinking stops. Immediately, there is a sudden stop\nAnd the road is empty, there is no traffic. That moment is meditation.\nSlowly slowly those moments come more and more Those empty spaces come again and again\nAnd stay longer.\nAnd you become capable of moving easily Into those empty spaces with no effort.\nSo whenever you want you can move Into those empty spaces with no effort. They are refreshing, rejuvenating\nAnd they make you aware of who you are. Freed from the mind you are freed\nFrom all ideas about yourself.\nNow you can see who you are without any prejudice. And to know oneself\nIs to know all that is worth knowing.\nAnd to miss self-knowledge is to miss all. A man my know everything in the world But if he does not know himself\nHe is utterly ignorant\nHe is just a walking Encyclopaedia Britannica. Freedom without awareness is only an empty idea. It contains nothing.\nOne cannot be really free without being aware\nBecause your unconscious goes on dominating you Your unconscious goes on pulling your strings.\nYou may think, you may believe that you are free But you are not free, you are just a victim\nOf natural forces, blind forces.\nSo there are two types of people. The majority Follows the tradition, the society, the state.\nThe orthodox people, the conventional The conformists -- they follow the crowd They are not free.\nAnd then there are a few rebellious spirits Drop-outs, bohemians, artists\nPainters, musicians, poets;\nThey think they are living in freedom 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But they only think. Just by rebellion Against the tradition you don't become free. You are still under the rule of natural instincts.\nYou are possessed by lust, by greed, by ambitions. And you are not a master of these things\nYou are a slave. Hence I say\nFreedom is only possible through awareness. Unless one transforms ones unconsciousness Into consciousness there is no freedom.\nAnd that is where only very few people Have succeeded -- a Jesus, a Lao Tzu A Zarathustra, a Buddha\nJust a few people\nWho can be counted on one's fingers.\nThey have really lived in freedom Because they lived out of awareness.\nThat has to be the work for every sannyasin:\nTo create more and more awareness. Then freedom comes of its own accord.\nFreedom is the fragrance of the flower of awareness. Decisiveness is a very essential quality.\nThere are many people who are incapable Of deciding, who go on thinking.\nThey waste their whole life in thinking Whether to do this or not to do,\nTo be or not to be.\nAnd they are always hesitating, they can't act And without action life is futile. They can't decide, and without decision\nThere is no possibility of your growth. Yes, one should look\nAt all the possible alternatives But not for too long.\nIt should not become a habit.\nOne should look at all the alternatives And then one should be able to decide.\nOne should not wait for a perfect decision Remember, because in life\nThere can never be any perfect decision. I have heard about a man\nWho was searching for a perfect wife. He died unmarried obviously.\nWhen he was dying somebody asked 'You travelled all over the world 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You searched for a perfect wife. Couldn't you find a single woman who was perfect?' He said,'Yes, I came across a few\nBut they were searching for perfect husbands!. If one is a perfectionist\nOne is doomed to fail. Perfectionists are indecisive people.\nNothing satisfies them, everything falls short. Their ideal is too high.\nEverything seems to be unsatisfactory.\nDecisiveness means knowing\nThat life is imperfect and life is short Knowing that we have limitations Yet we have to decide.\nAlternatives are limited, we cannot wait forever.\nOne you decide then you go wholeheartedly into it You risk all. One has to be a gambler\nThen only something is possible: Growth is possible\nA new birth is possible, a new being is possible. Otherwise nothing is possible.\nDecisiveness is absolutely necessary. And it is good that you have decided t To be a sannyasin.\nNow go into it totally, wholeheartedly.\nLet it be a commitment, a deep involvement. Don't remain on the periphery\nMove towards the very centre of it. Only then some revolution\nSome transformation can be hoped for.\nGod has no form, neither do we have any form.\nThe form belongs to the body.\nIt is as if you look out of your window\nAnd the sky seems to be framed be the frame Of the window, although the sky has no frame. If you come away from the window\nYou will be surprised:\nThere is no frame around the sky.\nHence a few modern painters have dropped\nFraming their paintings, for the simple reason 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That the frame is arbitrary. If you paint a sunset there is no frame But when you paint a painting you put A frame on it; it begins somewhere And ends somewhere.\nBut the real sunset does not begin anywhere And does not end anywhere. It is infinite.\nOur body and our mind give us a certain form But that is not our truth. We are formless.\nOne has to know it; unless one knows it\nOne is not aware of god One cannot be aware of god.\nGod is not somebody sitting there\nIn the seventh heaven, directing, guiding... A super-boss or something like that.\nGod is within you!\nIf you look in and if you can find\nSomething which is formless, you have found god. And then you will come across him everywhere.\nIn the trees, in the mountains, in the people You will be able to see the formless.\nAll forms are arbitrary: reality is formless. And when one is formless one is oceanic. That vastness gives so much ecstasy\nIt brings such blessing, such benediction That one cannot imagine it.\nUnless it has happened.\nThe sky is not really blue, it has no colour But because it is infinite it appears blue.\nThe blue is only an appearance.\nWhenever the river is deep it will appear blue Although the water has no colour.\nDepth gives it an appearance of blueness. That's why in India you will come across Krishna painted as if he were blue.\nNow, nobody is born blue.\nThere are black people and there are white People and there are red people and yellow People.\nBut nobody is born blue\nExcept a few blue children who die Who cannot survive.\nBut Krishna is painted as if he were blue. The very word 'krishna' means the blue one. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He is painted blue for the simple reason that Blueness represents depth, infinity, vastness. Remember it, the body is not our reality.\nIt is just a caravanserai, an overnights's stay. Nor is the mind our reality.\nWe are as vast as the sky.\nOnce you know this vastness as your real being You are freed from all small identities.\nFrom all mediocre, mundane confinements. You are freed from all prisons.\nAnd that freedom is sannyas.

books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished <span class=p>Query:- Once
you become interested in god</span></h3><p>You start becoming more and more super-human. It happens
naturally:</p><p>You start transcending humanity You start surpassing humanity.</p><p>Matthias remained utterly a human being</p><p>And became a representative of Jesus' humanity. All the twelve
disciples represent something.</p><p>They are twelve aspects of Jesus.</p><p>Nobody represents Jesus in his wholeness He is so vast</p><p>But each disciple can represent him at least In a single aspect.</p><p>Matthias represents his humanity</p><p>And that is of great significance Because in the East</p><p>Buddha is thought to be absolutely super-human.</p><p>All the stories that we have written about Buddha Have taken away
everything human from him.</p><p>He is just an abstraction He is almost intangible.</p><p>He looks more like a myth than like a reality. And so is the case
with Krishna and Mahavira: Everything human has been taken away.</p><p>It is not that they were not human, They were human, very human, But
the idea was that a ,am of god Has to go beyond humanity.</p><p>For example</p><p>Mahavira is said not to have perspired Because that is too human.</p><p>Now, in India not to perspire... It is a super-human feat!</p><p>It is easier to walk on water Than not to perspire in India!</p><p>And he lived in the hottest part of the country, In Bihar, and he
lived naked And he walked bare-footed on muddy paths</p><p>In dirt and dust and in the burning sun. But the stories say that he
never perspired Never urinated, never defecated.</p><p>These are human things too human!</p><p>The followers of Mahavira, cannot conceive Him urinating.</p><p>That looks below Mahavira, too below:</p><p>He is a god! 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--you-can-always-think-of-him-sitting>Osho's

can always think of him sitting</span></h3><p>In deep meditation.</p><p>That's the only activity left for him. In that way Jesus is far more
human. He enjoys eating and drinking</p><p>And mixing with people and laughing and joking.</p><p>He enjoyed company, and the company of all kinds Of people --
gamblers, drunkards, prostitutes.</p><p>He is really human!</p><p>And Matthias is the most human of all His disciples, he represents
his humanity. My effort here</p><p>Is to make religion as human as possible. It should not be
airy-fairy!</p><p>We have to bring it down to earth.</p><p>And I allow my sannyasins to perspire!</p><p>There is nothing wrong in it, no sin is committed. Even a sauna bath
is perfectly virtuous!</p><p>Perspire as much as you can.</p><p>Remember that religion has not to be unearthly. It has to be rooted
in the earth</p><p>Only then is it alive.</p><p>When it becomes too cloudy, uprooted</p><p>It looses all greenness, it looses all aliveness. It becomes just an
abstract philosophy.</p><p>That's what has happened in the East. Hence Jainas cannot believe in
Jesus, Neither can Buddhists believe in Jesus Because he is too
human.</p><p>But I am all for Jesus</p><p>Simply because he is so human! We want a religion which is human.</p><p>Of course one has not to end with humanity</p><p>One has to go beyond it, one has to transcend it But one should
remain rooted. A tree is rooted in the earth</p><p>Yet it goes above the earth. It reaches into the sky</p><p>It whispers with the clouds</p><p>It has a dialogue with the winds.</p><p>It blooms, but it remains rooted in the earth. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--a-truly-religious-person-will-have-wings>Osho's

that At least the sinners can sing and dance</p><p>And laugh and love. Saints can't do anything.</p><p>They can only remain serious, dead, cold. God is utterly afraid of
your saints!</p><p>My sannyasins</p><p>Are not to become so-called saints.</p><p>They have to become singers and dancers.</p><p>I believe in a god who is a dancer Who is a singer, who is a
musician. His existence is not a business project. It is out of fun that
he creates.</p><p>And when you also start living life as fun You start growing.</p><p>When life becomes a non-serious affair Then you have no limits</p><p>Then the whole sky is yours.

freed</p><p>From all ideas about yourself.</p><p>Now you can see who you are without any prejudice. And to know

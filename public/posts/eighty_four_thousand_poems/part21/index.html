Unless one is free completely of the past 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One never knows what life is. The past encapsulates one against life. It surrounds you like the China Wall\nIt doe not allow you to penetrate the present.\nRebellion means destroying all these walls.\nTo live in the present is the greatest rebellion And to live in the present\nIs to live in meditation, and to become capable Of living totally in the present Is to be able to enter god.\nRebellion against the priests Helps you to commune with god. Rebellion against the scriptures Helps you to commune with truth. Meditation\nIs the only anchor in the ocean of life. Without it one is always just driftwood. With meditation you are anchored.\nYou can stay centred\nAnd you can choose your direction. With meditation\nYou start becoming a master of yourself. Without meditation\nYou are at the mercy of unconscious forces. That's how millions of people go on living: Victims of the winds. They don't know Where they are going, why they are going\nIt is just that the wind\nIs blowing in that direction.\nMeditation is the most essential thing in life. It is food, nourishment for the soul.\nWithout it man is without a soul. Devote your energies more and more Towards getting deeper into meditation.\nAnd by meditation I simply mean awareness. A three-dimensional awareness is needed First, you have to be aware of your actions Second, you have to be aware of your thoughts Third, you have to be aware\nOf your Emotions, feelings. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Once you become aware of these three dimensions The fourth awareness happens on its own.\nOnce these three awarenesses are there You become aware of your being\nYou need not make any effort for that.\nYou just prepare the ground\nBy being aware of these three things And the fourth comes as a gift from god. People are living in their egos\nAnd that is the root cause of misery. To live in the ego is to live in darkness\nTo remain in the ego is to remain blind. One has to come out of the ego.\nThe idea of god is only a device\nSo that you can surrender your ego.\nIt will be difficult for you to surrender it Without someone there to receive it.\nThere have been people\nWho have surrendered without a god. Buddha did it.\nThere is no problem in it Intrinsically it is not imossible But it is very difficult, certainly. With the idea of god...\nAnd god is simply an idea\nIt is a device to help you surrender your ego.\nIt feels easier to surrender your ego With the idea that god will take care. There is no need to be taken care of. You are not insecure.\nYou are not a stranger to existence You are part of it.\nExistence is constantly nursing you Helping you in a thousand and one ways.\nBut one is afraid. One thinks 'I have to take care of myself\nOtherwise who will take care of me?' Hence people cling to the ego.\nBut once the idea is there that there is a god And you can surrender your ego That he is omnipotent\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And you will be in far better hands That he is omnipresent and he is omniscient... Your ego is very limited and small\nHis powers are infinite\nSo it is a good bargain:\nDrop the ego and let him take care of you! It appeals to the mind\nTo our businesslike intellect To our arithmetic, to our logic. It seems to be convincing.\nBut in fact god is not a person\nIt is only a device to help you to drop the ego. Once the ego is dropped you will know\nThat it was a device. But it worked! Your thorn was false in the first place No real needle was needed to take it out.\nOnly a false needle was needed to take it out. Your disease was false in the first place Hence homeopathic sugar pills will do.\nSeventy per cent of illnesses are false\nThat's why with seventy per cent of illnesses\nany pathy succeeds.\nIt depends on whether you believe in the pathy: Homeopathy, naturopathy, ayurvedic...\nOr you can invent your own.\nAny pathy works if you believe in it Because in the first place the illness is false. All that you need is a support\nSo that you can drop it\nA place somewhere to drop it\nJust a wastepaper basket to throw in. That's what Patanjali,\nOne of the greatest seers of the world Has said, 'God is a device'.\nAnd I perfectly agree with him\nAnd it is one of the most beautiful devices Because it makes it easy\nIt makes surrender smooth. But the whole purpose is:\nOne has to drop the ego any way; This way or that is irrelevant.\nRemember this much\nThat the ego has to be surrendered. Don't cling to the ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And the very surrender transforms you Opens your eyes, the darkness disappears. You are full of light, you are light\nYou are transmuted; you are no more part Of the mundane, ordinary world.\nSuddenly, doors of all the mysteries\nAre open for you, the miraculous is yours. Your life starts taking on\nA new colour, a new joy, a new song. It starts becoming a new dance.\nIn the East,\nwe have always looked at existence as if everything is divine.\nIn the beginning it is 'as if'.\nWhen you start the journey it is 'as if'.\nBut when you end the journey it is the truth:\nthe sun is god, the moon is god,\nthe rivers are goddesses,\nthe stars are gods, the trees are gods.\nChristianity has condemned this idea very much; they think this is paganism. It has a tremendous beauty, this paganism.\nIn fact the pagan is the only religious person because he lives surrounded by gods.\nHe transforms everything into the divine.\nAnd of course when the whole existence is divine, you are also divine. You cannot exclude yourself.\nThe whole existence is divine inclusive of you. God is no more a person in the East.\nIt is a quality.\nIt is life itself, it is existence itself.\nSo in the East people worship everything. And that has a beauty --\na tremendous sacredness about it. They will worship the moon, they will worship the river --\nany excuse is enough!\nThe point is not the object of worship the point is worshipping.\nWhom you worship is irrelevant. So in the East,\nthe father is worshipped; the mother is worshipped.\nThere have even been people like Ramakrishna who used to worship his own wife!\nOnce in a while he would call to Sharda, his wife, \"Become a goddess, sit upon a throne!\"\nHe had a small throne for her; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and of course the wife had to follow the orders because in the East the husband is a god!\nYou cannot say no to the husband. So she would sit on the throne and he would worship her.\nPeople would think that he had gone mad, completely mad.\nBut he was the most sane person of those times in the East.\nYou see the beauty of it? Any day he would say,\n\"Sharda, I feel like worshipping you -- come here and become a goddess!\"\nIt is fun, it is play:\nthere is no need to be fanatics;\nin that you can worship only Christ. You can worship your own child!\nThere is no question, as the Mohammedans say, that there is only one god and no other god.\nThe pagan attitude is that everything is divine. There is no god because everything is divine. There is no god but everyone is a god.\nRemember it -- the moon is only one of the gods.\nThe Indian scriptures say\nthere are three hundred and thirty million gods. How they manage to count is a puzzle!\nIt seems to be just any figure --\nthe biggest figure that they could think of. In those days India had that size population; so the idea of so many gods is very good.\nGods everywhere; in the marketplace,\nat the railway station, in the buses.\nGods fighting, gods quarrelling,\ngods talking, gods getting married and divorced -- all gods!\nThis is a totally different view\nthan that which Judaism has given to the world; and Christianity and Mohammedanism\nare simply offshoots of Judaism.\nThere are only two religions in the world:\nJudaism and Hinduism. Judaism believes in one god;\nit is very non-democratic, it is dictatorial.\nGod seems to be like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse Tung.\nHinduism believes in a very democratic existence: everybody is the same, all are divine!\nRemember it,\nlet it become your very feeling about everything -- trees, moon, sun, stars.\nAnd that will help you immediately to go into deep meditation.\nBe here as long as possible. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You will not find more beautiful gods anywhere... and crazy too! Love is more like a fragrance Than like a flower or a seed.\nThese three things have to be understood deeply: The seed, the flower. the fragrance.\nSex is more like a seed -- very gross\nAll is just potential. nothing is actual yet. And the flower, the ordinary love, Which is a little higher,\nGoes a little beyond sex.\nIt has no sexual overtones any more. It can be just friendship\nIt can exist between two friends.\nIt can exist between husband and wife\nIn fact unless it does there is no intimacy.\nSex never makes you intimate. Animals are never intimate.\nSexuality never brings you really together. It brings your bodies together but not you. You are far bigger than the body\nFar more than the body. When your psyche\nStarts coming into close intimacy\nThat is the beginning of love, the ordinary love. Sex remains but becomes secondary\nLove becomes primary.\nThis is the state of the flower. And the third state is\nWhen sex simply disappears and love remains Just a pure fragrance, not even a flower.\nYou can catch hold of a flower.\nBut you cannot catch hold of a fragrance. You can very well possess a seed\nYou can even keep it locked in a box. You cannot lock up a flower.\nIf you do it will die.\nThe seed will remain but the flower will die. It is far more fragile.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You have to be a little more careful. It is a higher phenomenon, more delicate.\nBut a fragrance you cannot even catch hold of. It is already free, it is freedom.\nThat is the ultimate in love\nWhere love takes the flavour of prayer.\nThe majority of people remain at the seed stage. Only a few arrive at the second stage and\nVery rarely does a person arrive\nAt the third stage; only once in a while A Jesus, a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Krishna. But that should remain the goal.\nUnless you attain to the fragrance of love You have not known life in its totality\nIn its wholeness you have not explored it. You have remained just on the periphery\nYou have not entered the very core of it. And at the very core of it is the treasure The kingdom of god.\nHappiness is temporal:\nOne moment it is there, another moment it is gone. Hankering for it is futile. Whatsoever you do\nIt is not going to stay with you.\nIt is a prostitute, it cannot be yours forever It promises, it is very generous in promising\nBut it betrays you every day. And people are such fools:\nThey go on believing in the promises Again and again -- the same promises For the same kind of happiness.\nTo become aware of this fact\nIs the beginning of the real search for bliss. Then one does not want happiness Because what is the point of having it When tomorrow it will be lost\nAnd again you will be in the same despair? In fact, in more despair than before\nBecause you would have tasted something of joy And that will make you even sadder.\nThe real search\nHas to be the search for something eternal 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Something abiding. And it is there, but one cannot find it Looking out from oneself -- it is not there. There you will find only temporary relief,\nMoments of happiness And then long periods of misery. It is a totally futile exercise.\nFor those small moments one pays so much -- It is not worth it.\nWith the same energy turning in You can find eternal bliss.\nIt is your intrinsic nature.\nThe whole thing depends on where you are looking. If you are looking in the outside world\nYou can find only moments\nOnly oases in the desert of life. But if you look in\nYou will find eternal bliss, Eternal peace, eternal life. Once found it is yours forever, Even death cannot take it away.\nA sannyasin has to learn pure acting.\nHe has to look at the world as a great drama. A thousand and one plays are going on\nAnd you have to participate in many games. You are constantly moving\nFrom one stage to another:\nFrom the house to the office From the office to the church\nFrom the church to the club And so on, so forth. They are all different stages, different sets\nAnd you have to play different roles But they are all roles --\nDon't take them seriously.\nThere is no need to renounce them. To renounce them means\nYou have -- taken them seriously.\nThat's why I say never to renounce anything. Live your role, enjoy it, it is fun\nBut take it lightly, take it easily. It is not worth worrying about. So whatsoever role\nYou have to play in a certain circumstance Play to your utmost ability, play it totally But once it is finished\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Whether you have succeeded or failed Is irrelevant. Don't look back, go ahead:\nThere are other plays you have to play. Failure or success are unimportant.\nWhat is important is the awareness That everything is a game.\nWhen your whole life Becomes full of this awareness\nYou are freed, then nothing binds you\nThen you are no more tethered to anything Then you don't have any chains on your hands Then you are no more imprisoned by anything. You use masks but you know\nThat that is not your original face And you can remove the mask Because now you know it is a mask It can be removed, it is removeable.\nAnd now you can know your original face too. The man who is aware that life is a game Comes to know his original face.\nAnd to know one's original face\nIs to know all that is worth knowing Because that is the face of god\nThat is the face of truth That is the face of love That is the face of freedom. Sugata means well-gone\nOne who is no more part of this world Who has really gone;\nWhat exists here is just a shadow.\nHe is no more earthly\nHe exists no more in the body because\nHe is no more the body, he is no more the mind He eats, but he eats not He drinks, but he drinks not\nHe talks, but he talks not, because even while He is talking he is absolutely silent And even when he is eating he is just\nA watcher of it, he is not the eater. While walking he is just a witness Not the walker.\nDoing all kinds of things he is never a doer Because there is no ego any more.\nThe ego is gone forever, hence He is called well-gone\nGone to the farther shore. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He lingers on this shore a little while To help those who are seeking and searching For the way\nTo tell them that he has found it\nTo convey the message\nTo tell them that they can also find it To encourage them\nTo give them a few indications and hints. To share his experience he tries to linger A little bit on this shore, but in fact Ninety-nine per cent of his being\nIs already gone.\nWhen Buddha was dying\nHis disciples started crying -- naturally. Even his closest disciple, Ananda Started crying, tears started coming.\nHe was older than Buddha,\nBuddha was eighty-two, he was eighty-four: A man of eighty-four crying like a small child. Buddha said 'Stop this nonsense, Ananda!\nWhat are you doing?'\nAnd Ananda said, 'I can't listen to you any more. At least in this last moment allow me\nTo do whatsoever I feel like doing. Don't say anything.\nI am feeling miserable.\nYou are dying, I have not become enlightened yet And once you are gone, all hope is gone.\nYou were my hope!' Buddha said, 'I am dying? --\nWhat nonsense are you talking? I died forty years ago,\nI died the very day I became enlightened. Since then only a shadow\nHas been lingering with you.'\nThis is the meaning of Sugatas well-gone.\nAnd that is the ultimate goal for every sannyasin: He should become a well- gone.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Eighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #22\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3114","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3114 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

seems to be convincing.</p><p>But in fact god is not a person</p><p>It is only a device to help you to drop the ego. Once the ego is
dropped you will know</p><p>That it was a device. But it worked! Your thorn was false in the

device'.</p><p>And I perfectly agree with him</p><p>And it is one of the most beautiful devices Because it makes it
easy</p><p>It makes surrender smooth.

on</p><p>A new colour, a new joy, a new song. It starts becoming a new
dance.</p><p>In the East,</p><p>we have always looked at existence as if everything is divine.</p><p>In the beginning it is 'as if'.</p><p>When you start the journey it is 'as if'.</p><p>But when you end the journey it is the truth:</p><p>the sun is god, the moon is god,</p><p>the rivers are goddesses,</p><p>the stars are gods, the trees are gods.</p><p>Christianity has condemned this idea very much; they think this is
paganism. It has a tremendous beauty, this paganism.</p><p>In fact the pagan is the only religious person because he lives
surrounded by gods.</p><p>He transforms everything into the divine.</p><p>And of course when the whole existence is divine, you are also
divine. You cannot exclude yourself.</p><p>The whole existence is divine inclusive of you. God is no more a
person in the East.</p><p>It is a quality.</p><p>It is life itself, it is existence itself.</p><p>So in the East people worship everything. And that has a beauty
--</p><p>a tremendous sacredness about it. They will worship the moon, they
will worship the river --</p><p>any excuse is enough!</p><p>The point is not the object of worship the point is worshipping.</p><p>Whom you worship is irrelevant. So in the East,</p><p>the father is worshipped; the mother is worshipped.</p><p>There have even been people like Ramakrishna who used to worship his
own wife!</p><p>Once in a while he would call to Sharda, his wife, "Become a goddess,

the husband is a god!</p><p>You cannot say no to the husband. So she would sit on the throne and
he would worship her.</p><p>People would think that he had gone mad, completely mad.</p><p>But he was the most sane person of those times in the East.</p><p>You see the beauty of it? Any day he would say,</p><p>"Sharda, I feel like worshipping you -- come here and become a
goddess!"</p><p>It is fun, it is play:</p><p>there is no need to be fanatics;</p><p>in that you can worship only Christ. You can worship your own
child!</p><p>There is no question, as the Mohammedans say, that there is only one
god and no other god.</p><p>The pagan attitude is that everything is divine. There is no god
because everything is divine. There is no god but everyone is a god.</p><p>Remember it -- the moon is only one of the gods.</p><p>The Indian scriptures say</p><p>there are three hundred and thirty million gods. How they manage to
count is a puzzle!</p><p>It seems to be just any figure --</p><p>the biggest figure that they could think of. In those days India had
that size population; so the idea of so many gods is very good.</p><p>Gods everywhere; in the marketplace,</p><p>at the railway station, in the buses.</p><p>Gods fighting, gods quarrelling,</p><p>gods talking, gods getting married and divorced -- all gods!</p><p>This is a totally different view</p><p>than that which Judaism has given to the world; and Christianity and
Mohammedanism</p><p>are simply offshoots of Judaism.</p><p>There are only two religions in the world:</p><p>Judaism and Hinduism. Judaism believes in one god;</p><p>it is very non-democratic, it is dictatorial.</p><p>God seems to be like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse
Tung.</p><p>Hinduism believes in a very democratic existence: everybody is the
same, all are divine!</p><p>Remember it,</p><p>let it become your very feeling about everything -- trees, moon, sun,
stars.</p><p>And that will help you immediately to go into deep meditation.</p><p>Be here as long as possible. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--you-will-not-find-more-beautiful-gods-anywhere...-and-crazy-too>Osho's

It is for reference purposes only.]\nSannyas is a growth process. Very few people grow at all.\nThe average mental age is only twelve years. The person may be eighty\nBut he carries the mind of a twelve-year-old. This is a very strange situation:\nHe only appears mature\nDeep down he remains immature, utterly immature. Without meditation there is no way.\nIt is only through meditation\nThat one becomes really mature, integrated.\nIt is through meditation\nThat one becomes really mature, integrated. It is through meditation\nThat your consciousness starts rising upwards That you start creating a bridge to the beyond. A man is really grown up\nWhen he starts feeling the presence of god. That is the only criterion.\nRemember that as a goal And put your total energy 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Your whole heart into it. It can still be achieved, it is never too late. All that is needed is a great intensity.\nAnd if one can know god before death comes Then death never comes.\nThe body dies\nBut now you know that you cannot die. You are eternal.\nEveryone brings a truth in his being. The truth has not to be invented\nIt has only to be discovered Or rather, REdiscovered.\nWe are already in possession of it\nBut we have become completely oblivious Of the fact.\nWe have only fallen asleep And forgotten who we are.\nAll that is needed is a remembering. George Gurdjieff used to teach his disciples\nOnly one method, the method of self-remembering. Buddha calls it right-mindfulness\nKrishnamurti calls it awareness Christ calls it watchfulness Shankara calls it witnessing.\nBut it is the same phenomenon. You have to become alert\nYou have to become more conscious. Nothing is missing\nIt is only that you are dreaming\nDreaming that you are a beggar And you are not a beggar.\nOnce the dream is broken, once you wake up Suddenly you find what ridiculous dreams You have been in.\nThe greatest treasure is yours The eternal life is yours\nThe kingdom of god is yours The ultimate truth is yours.\nAnd we have brought it with ourselves.\nWe are it!\nSo it is not a question\nOf seeking and searching somewhere else It is simply a question\nOf putting your total energy into waking up. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Life is like a nightmare: If you are suffering in a nightmare\nAll that you need is to put your total energy\nInto waking up. Nothing else is needed.\nIf you are being chased by a lion You need not kill the lion Because there is no lion at all.\nIf you are being crushed under a rock You need not remove the rock.\nIt may be just your own pillow. All that you need is to wake up!\nA middle-aged American woman presents herself for sannyas. She had written to Osho earlier in the year telling of her eight years's involvement with a community of Gurdjieff followers.\nSomething was still missing, she felt; now she was reaching out and 'planning for a miracle.'\nOsho explains that her sannyas name, Anubhuti, means experiencing. Truth cannot be contemplated on\nIt can only be experienced. It is nothing intellectual\nIt is something existential.\nYou have to know the taste of it.\nYou cannot conclude by philosophising. There are thousands of people in the world\nWho go on thinking about truth And about and about they go\nAround and around they go in circles. Their conclusions are futile.\nHowsoever beautiful those conclusions may appear They don't have any life, any soul in them.\nTo be a sannyasin means\nYou are dropping philosophising\nYou are renouncing the ways of the mind and\nYou are moving into a totally different gestalt: The ways of the heart The way of love, not of logic.\nSinging is far closer to truth Than the process of thinking. It looks very absurd:\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- How can you come to know truth by dancing? But there have been people\nWho have come to know truth through dancing. Jalaluddin Rumi came to know truth\nSimply by dancing.\nHe danced and danced and he danced for hours; It is said, for thirty-six hours\nWithout any break.\nHe fell into a kind of total drunkenness. He became so drunk from dancing!\nAnd when he came back\nHe was totally a different man. Hence he invented a new method. The whirling dervishes\nAre the followers of Jalaluddin Rumi. Through dancing he arrived.\nNobody before had arrived through dancing. Rumi stumbled upon a new truth.\nDancing is more existential. Through singing many have arrived. Just by sitting silently, doing nothing Many have arrived.\nBut if you are thinking, you are doing something. A state of no-thought is needed to experience.\nSo I am giving you the name 'experiencing'\nTo remind you again and again\nNot to go into the old grooves of the mind. Metaphorically, symbolically, be headless! And here you can see so many headless people Running hither and thither!\nPeople like Christ cannot be followed. You can become a Christ\nBut you cannot be a follower of Christ. To be a follower is to be an imitation. It is not the real thing\nSo it may look paradoxical but this is how it is: To really be a follower of Christ One has to cease to be a follower\nOne has to be a Christ oneself. And the same is true about Buddha And Krishna and Zarathustra.\nThese people can easily be followed. Their personalities are hypnotic\nThey have a magnetic charm, a charisma. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One would like to follow in their footsteps. But they are unique people,\nNobody can follow in their footsteps. All followers look pathetic.\nMm? -- you wearing the shoes of Christ Or his garments and carrying his cross... It may be okay in a drama but in life You will be simply crazy!\nYou have to be a Christ yourself.\nAnd remember: Christ does not mean a Jesus. Christ simply means one who has come home One who has attained\nThe full flowering of consciousness. You can call Buddha a Christ\nAnd you can call Christ a Buddha. There is no difference.\nRemember it\nLove Christ, love Buddha, love Lao Tzu Imbibe their spirit\nBut don't follow their lives in detail. Never be a follower.\nAlways be authentic, true, yourself.\nAnd I say that is the only way to follow them. God can be your strength only if you surrender. If you dissolve yourself totally\nIf you are no more, then god is your strength. Then he is the one who exists within you.\nHe is your consciousness\nAnd he is your life and he is your love. He is all in all.\nBut you have to disappear, you have to give way. We are so full of ourselves;\nThat's why god is not our strength. And we cannot be strong on our own. How can a leaf be strong on its own? Without the nourishment\nThe constant nourishment of the tree? How can the tree be strong on its own Without being nourished\nBy the earth and the sun and the moon? We are part of this immense existence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But we go on keeping ourselves separate. We create a boundary around ourselves -- We defend that boundary.\nWe say, \"Trespassers will be prosecuted.\"\nWe don't allow anybody to trespass across our boundary. Even if god comes, if he want to come in\nYou won't allow him.\nBecause his coming in means only one thing:\nYour going out.\nYou both cannot occupy the same space. You can be there only if he is not allowed in. He is vast.\nWhen he comes, he comes like a storm. When he comes, he comes like a flood.\nIt takes away all garbage, all rubbish from you; It cleanses you of yourself -- Of the very idea of the ego.\nBut then a beautiful phenomenon starts happening: For the first time you don't feel weak\nFor the first time you are nourished\nBy inexhaustible sources.\nYou are as strong as god himself Because you have become part of him. Peace is something that you have lost. It has been stolen by the world,\nYou have to steal it back.\nIt has been destroyed by the world, You have to claim it back.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say\nThat the true seeker has to be a little sly\nBecause the world is very cunning, very deceptive.\nIf you are not alert it will go on deceiving you, It will go on cheating you. It has cheated you of all your treasures,\nAnd it has handed over to you All kinds of rubbish instead.\nYou have to be alert, Very alert and a little sly,\nSo that you cannot be deceived any more So that you can detect\nWhenever the world is trying to deceive you. And you also have to be sly\nTo escape from all kinds of entanglements, Without creating too much fuss.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is like a prisoner trying to escape From goal.\nIf he makes too much fuss he will be caught. He has to be very silent, utterly silent\nAs if nothing is happening. And he has to do much; He has to break the wall,\nMaybe he has to cut the bars of the window. He has to make some connections outside. Maybe he has to throw a rope over the wall, Beyond the wall,\nClimb the rope and jump from the wall. And everything has to happen\nIn such a silent way, as if nothing is happening, As if everything is normal. Of course he has to be sly --\nHe has to be a thief!\nOf course he is only trying\nTo gain what has been robbed from him. But he has to be a thief,\nTo steal that which belongs to him.\nHence all the methods need great intelligence. Stupid people cannot get out of the world, Cannot get out of the traps.\nTremendous intelligence is needed. And meditation\nCertainly releases great intelligence. It is the only method\nWhich releases intelligence in you, Which makes you bright,\nWhich sharpens your consciousness, Which helps you to see clearly,\nWhich makes you more alert, more conscious. Which keeps you always on guard.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- One week\n-- Then come back again. One week is not enough to get out of the jail.\nOne week is enough if you want to get into the jail but to get out of it takes time!\nSadhvi means one who is innocent. That is the secret of knowing the truth:\nTo be innocent, innocent like a child. Unlearning is the whole process.\nWe have learned too much\nWe are burdened with knowledge And that is all rubbish\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because it is all borrowed. Unless something is your own It has no value, no meaning So put aside all that is not your own experience.\nSave only that which is your own experience, Howsoever little it is. But it is enough.\nBase your life on that\nAnd you will be putting down a right foundation. Basing your life on borrowed knowledge\nIs making a house on the sands:\nIt is bound to fall.\nIt is trying to get to the farther shore\nIn a paper boat. Scriptures are paper boats. And now the time has come\nWhen you have to know something on your own Because only that will be going with you.\nAll that is borrowed\nWill have to left on this shore But that which is known by you Cannot be taken away from you.\nEven death cannot destroy it -- it is eternal. And the only way to become innocent\nIs to be watchful of the mind -- Non-judgmental watchfulness.\nDon't judge: 'This is good, this is bad' Because the moment you judge\nYou lose your awareness.\nSimply watch the whole process of the thoughts Whatsoever is passing has nothing to do with you.\nYou are separate from it. Don't get identified\nEither with good or with bad. Simply remain aloof, distant A watcher on the hill\nAnd slowly slowly the procession of thoughts And memories and desires start disappearing. One day it happens, the road is empty\nThere is no traffic.\nIn that very moment turning in happens. When there is nothing to observe in the mind The observer turns upon itself.\nThat is the meaning of the ancient symbol... Many mysteries schools have used that symbol: The snake swallowing itself.\nIt represents this process. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- When there is nothing to swallow The snake swallows itself.\nWhen there is nothing to observe\nThe observer starts observing himself.\nAnd that is the beginning of enlightenment. Then for the first time\nYour light falls upon yourself And it liberates\nIt liberates you from all kinds of bondage. So innocence has to be your golden key.\nFor centuries the religious person Has been missing a sense of humour.\nThe saints have not laughed for centuries. Laughter has lost all connections with spirituality. Laughter has not been a loser\nBut spirituality has lost much. Spirituality has become dull, sad Serious, ill, pathological.\nIt has become more and more deathlike It has lost aliveness.\nWithout laughter there is no life\nAnd without laughter there is no love either. My whole effort here is to bring laughter Back to the spiritual dimension.\nThe saints should be able\nIn fact only he should be able to laugh totally. But the so-called saints\nAre very afraid of laughter. They go on keeping long faces\nLong faces are being worshipped. To laugh seems to be mundane.\nIn fact, laughter\nIs one of the greatest spiritual qualities. In deep laughter the ego disappears\nJust as in deep dance the ego disappears. When you really have a belly laugh\nYou are no more there, only laughter is happening You are not there as an observer\nYou are totally immersed in it.\nAnd that gives you a taste of meditation. That's how your whole life should be: Whatsoever you are doing\nYou should be totally immersed in it\nThen only can meditation become like breathing. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It can spread all over your life. Even in sleep it remains with you Like a subtle undercurrent\nOf joy, of peace, of silence. The ultimate law itself is god.\nThere is no god as a person somewhere. 'God' is only a way of speaking.\nWhat really is, is a fundamental law That keeps the whole existence together. The universe is a great harmony.\nIt is not a chaos, it is a cosmos. There is great order\nAnd this order is possible only\nIf there is something that keeps everything Connected and joined together.\nThat something is called dharma, the law. To know it and to be in tune with it\nIs to be blissful.\nNot to know it is to be miserable Because without knowing it\nYou cannot be in tune with it. Maybe once in a while Accidentally you may be in tune\nThen there will be a little glimpse of happiness But that is accidental -- you cannot depend on it.\nMeditation brings you a clear vision of the law And helps you to surrender to the law\nHelps you to drop all resistance to the law. And once you are consciously in tune With the ultimate law\nYour life is bliss, pure bliss And nothing but bliss.\nThe moon represents two things\nWhich are very essential for a sannyasin. One is that the moon is a mirror:\nIt simply reflects the rays of the sun. A sannyasin has to be a mirror\nJust a clean mirror so he can reflect That which is.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And the second thing is that the moon Not only reflects the rays of the sun,\nIn reflecting them it transforms their quality. The very process of reflecting is such\nThat those rays go through an alchemical change. When they come from the sun\nThey are hot, burning hot\nWhen they come reflected through the moon They are cool. That is the miracle of the moon.\nThe world is very hot -- it is hot because of lust Because of anger, because of hatred.\nIt is hot because of a thousand and one passions. It is boiling.\nA sannyasin has to live in this world\nBut he can live in it only if he comes to know The alchemical process Of transforming everything\nThat comes to him Into a cool experience.\nYou can insult the Buddha\nBut when it is reflected back to you It comes as a fragrance of a flower.\nYou can throw an arrow at the Buddha But when it comes back to you\nIt is a rose flower.\nThat's what a sannyasin has to be, These two things: a mirror...\nAnd not only a mirror but also an\nAlchemical process of constantly transforming Al that is hot, ugly, violent, into cool energy.\nThe sannyasin lives in tremendous coolness. He lives in the fire of the world\nBut he remains cool. The day it happens\nThen you know that your meditation has succeeded You have achieved the fruit of meditation.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Eighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #15\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3060","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3060 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

can you come to know truth by dancing?</span></h3><p>But there have been people</p><p>Who have come to know truth through dancing. Jalaluddin Rumi came to
know truth</p><p>Simply by dancing.</p><p>He danced and danced and he danced for hours; It is said, for
thirty-six hours</p><p>Without any break.</p><p>He fell into a kind of total drunkenness. He became so drunk from
dancing!</p><p>And when he came back</p><p>He was totally a different man. Hence he invented a new method. The
whirling dervishes</p><p>Are the followers of Jalaluddin Rumi. Through dancing he arrived.</p><p>Nobody before had arrived through dancing. Rumi stumbled upon a new
truth.</p><p>Dancing is more existential. Through singing many have arrived. Just
by sitting silently, doing nothing Many have arrived.</p><p>But if you are thinking, you are doing something. A state of
no-thought is needed to experience.</p><p>So I am giving you the name 'experiencing'</p><p>To remind you again and again</p><p>Not to go into the old grooves of the mind. Metaphorically,
symbolically, be headless! And here you can see so many headless people
Running hither and thither!</p><p>People like Christ cannot be followed. You can become a Christ</p><p>But you cannot be a follower of Christ. To be a follower is to be an
imitation. It is not the real thing</p><p>So it may look paradoxical but this is how it is: To really be a
follower of Christ One has to cease to be a follower</p><p>One has to be a Christ oneself. And the same is true about Buddha And
Krishna and Zarathustra.</p><p>These people can easily be followed. Their personalities are

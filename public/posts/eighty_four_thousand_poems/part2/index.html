It is for reference purposes only.]\nBy going beyond all religions One becomes religious.\nThe true religion\nIs neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan. The true religion is a transcendence\nOf all creeds, dogmas, scriptures.\nThe true religion is not a religion in fact But a kind of religiousness.\nIt is not a noun but a verb.\nIt has nothing to do with organisation.\nIt has something to do with the individual. It is something inner.\nNot that you go to a particular church\nAnd you become a Catholic or you go to the temple And you become a Hindu -- no.\nYou go into your own being And you become religious. And to be religious is enough.\nThere is no need for any adjective. Jesus is not a Christian, remember And Buddha is not a Buddhist.\nAnd Krishna is not a Hindu.\nThese people are far beyond beyond all these Small small sects, doctrines, creeds, churches. These people live in a kind of\nBoundaryless existence, without boundaries. When you live in a world of no limits\nThen you are truly religious. My sannyas is not a religion.\nTi is a new type of vision: it is religiousness. You love, you meditate\nYou make every effort to be authentic. You try to be responsible, not according\nTo any commandments given by somebody else But according to your own inner light.\nYou become a light unto yourself.\nUp to now you have been only formally a follower of Christ. Now you are really becoming one.\nRemember, Christ has nothing to do with Christianity.\nThe Jews and the Romans only destroyed the body of Jesus. But Christianity has destroyed his very soul. He was not really crucified in Jerusalem, he has been crucified in the Vatican.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So if somebody really wants to be a Christian now, he should not be a Christian at all in the first place.\nAvoid Christianity, because it is a fabrication of the priests. Follow anyone who is awakened and you are following Christ. Never follow the priests, follow the prophet.\nPeople follow the priests because they are born in a certain community.\nTo follow a prophet means to choose. It is risky, it is dangerous. One can never be certain, there is no guarantee.\nTo go with a prophet is going into the unknown.\nAnd this is what is happening right now: You are moving now into a dangerous journey.\nBut to live dangerously is the only way to live. All other ways are ways of dying.\nIn my vision courage is the most divine quality.\nEverything else is secondary, courage is primary Because if courage is there Everything else follows.\nIf courage is missing, then all is missing. Only a courageous person can be sincere Truthful, loving, religious.\nOnly a courageous person can go In search of the ultimate\nBecause the search is arduous It is an uphill task.\nIt is easy to go downwards Gravitation helps you\nBut to go uphill is difficult. And the higher you move\nThe more and more difficult it becomes.\nBefore the ultimate is reached One is tested to the utmost.\nOnly a few courages people have passed\nThe ultimate examination of life and existence. These are the Buddhas, the Christs, the Krishnas. But everyone has the capacity\nTo become a Buddha.\nIf anything is missing it is courage And courage can be gathered.\nEven a cowardly person can gather courage. He has the ingredients.\nHe just has to pt them together. Sannyas is a courageous step.\nIt may lead you into many difficulties. Face them joyously, enjoy facing them. And you will be surprised\nThat each difficulty becomes a blessing\nAnd each challenge proves a tremendous gift of god 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because it integrates you It makes you more and more solid. It gives steel to your spine\nIt makes you a man of steel.\nA man of courage is always a king. Only cowards are slaves.\nBut to really be a king one has to be A master of oneself -- not of others. That is very easy and cheap\nBecause there are millions of cowards in the world Who are really hankering for somebody\nTo enslave them, who cannot live on their own. They are always longing\nTor somebody to dictate to them.\nThey cannot move even an inch in their lives By their own light.\nThey want to cling.\nThey want to be guided, led, like sheep They always need shepherds.\nHence it is very easy to become\nA ruler of people -- that is not worth much. The real problem, the real challenge, is\nTo be a master of oneself.\nAnd that is the whole purpose of sannyas: To make you a master of yourself.\nOne should not be a slave of one's own unconscious. That's what people are.\nEverybody believes he is a master. In fact that belief is very dangerous\nBecause it never allows you to see the truth. It keeps you befooled.\nSomebody insults you and you are angry And you say, ' I was angry.'\nThat is wrong because you can say 'I was angry!' Only if you are capable of not being angry.\nBut you were not capable of not being angry. You were possessed by anger\nYou were not a chooser, there was no choice. Somebody insulted you, he pushed a button And the anger came\nJust as you push a button and light comes.\nIt was mechanical. You were not the Master of it. You behaved like a machine.\nWhen somebody insults you and you are the chooser Of wether to be angry or not\nThen you are a master. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And the same is true for all your instincts: Greed, lust, ego.\nIf you are a chooser, then there is no problem. But if you are not a chooser\nBut only reacting in a mechanical way Then you are not yet a man.\nOnly by becoming master of your own consciousness Do you become a man. It happens only through meditation.\nThere is no other way.\nMeditation is the alchemy of transforming The unconscious into the conscious.\nIt gives you a tremendous power\nFar greater than anger, greed and lust. Then you can control without repressing.\nThen you can direct, channelize your forces.\nYou can transform your energies into higher realms. Then life really becomes\nA great experiment in growth.\nMan remains almost unaware of his glory\nOf the great splendor that he brings into the world. Because he never looks inwards.\nHe remains a beggar Although in fact he is a king. He remains a beggar\nBecause he goes on looking outside, hankering For this and that and always for more...\nAnd there is no end to it.\nHence our so-called emperors are also beggars. Nobody is ever satisfied.\nBut a person who turns in\nSuddenly bedtime contented because he comes across The immeasurable treasure of his own being.\nAnd the glory is so tremendous The ecstasy so incredible\nThe joy so overflowing\nThat not only does it make one contented.\nWhosoever comes in contact with such a person Starts feeling something of the unknown Something of the mysterious.\nThat's how masters have been able To transform millions of people.\nThey have become aware of their splendor And everybody who comes close to them Becomes aware of the splendor\nNot only of the master\nBut finally of his own self also. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The beginning of disciplehood Is to be aware of the glory of the master.\nAnd the end is to be aware of your own glory. They are not two different things.\nOne can be full of justice\nOnly if one is free from one's mind, otherwise not. The mind is always prejudiced for or against Hence it can never be just.\nThe mind lives with conclusions.\nEven before looking at facts it has already decided. The mind has decided wether there is a god or not. A few people are atheists, many are theists\nBut all are in the same boat The boat of the mind.\nThey have decided without ever exploring. That is the way of the mind\nIt decides without enquiring. Enquiry needs intelligence.\nEnquiry needs tremendous love for truth. And enquiry needs as a basic requirement That the mind be put aside so that you Can look directly without any prejudice Coloring your eyes.\nAnd that's what meditation is all about. Putting the mind aside.\nThen one is just, always just.\nOne cannot be unjust, that is impossible.\nBe meditative, be more and more meditative So that you can know what no-mind is.\nOut of no-mind blooms the flower of justice. A divine voice is always there in the heart Always calling you.\nBut you are not available\nYou are engaged in some mundane affairs In some ordinary things.\nYour mind is full of unnecessary rubbish Busy without business.\nSo you go on missing the still small voice within.\nOnce the mind is silent, once thoughts disappear Once you are left without any thoughts\nSuddenly the voice is heard.\nAnd to hear god directly from your hart 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Is the beginning of transformation It is revelation.\nGod always comes as a revelation\nNever as knowledge but always as revelation. Remember it.\nAnd it is not far away. He is always there Twenty-four hours a day\nWaiting for you.\nBut people go on running hither and thither. They waste their whole life\nIn such stupid nonsense that it seems unimaginable That man can be so unintelligent.\nBut he is.\nA sannyasin has to be intelligent.\nHe has to reconsider his whole life-style. This is the beginning of a great pilgrimage. I am not in favour of renouncing the world. I want my sannyasins to live in the world But very skillfully.\nTo live in such a way That nothing affects you To live in such a way\nThat you are in the world an yet not of it. That is non-attachment.\nRenouncing is very easy.\nOne can escape to the mountains, to a monastery And forget all about the world and its worries.\nThat is very easy; any coward can do that. And to live in the world and be worried\nIs also easy; everybody is doing that. I am telling you to do something\nTotally different from both these extremes. I don't want you to be a worldly man Although I want you to be in the world.\nI don't want you to go to a monastery Although I am initiating you into a monkhood. I am trying to give you\nA very paradoxical way of life\nBut it is only through paradox that one grows. Life is a dialectical process\nSo the more paradoxically you live The higher the peaks you will achieve. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Eighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1946","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1946 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

repressing.</p><p>Then you can direct, channelize your forces.</p><p>You can transform your energies into higher realms. Then life really
becomes</p><p>A great experiment in growth.</p><p>Man remains almost unaware of his glory</p><p>Of the great splendor that he brings into the world. Because he never
looks inwards.</p><p>He remains a beggar Although in fact he is a king. He remains a
beggar</p><p>Because he goes on looking outside, hankering For this and that and
always for more...</p><p>And there is no end to it.</p><p>Hence our so-called emperors are also beggars. Nobody is ever
satisfied.</p><p>But a person who turns in</p><p>Suddenly bedtime contented because he comes across The immeasurable
treasure of his own being.</p><p>And the glory is so tremendous The ecstasy so incredible</p><p>The joy so overflowing</p><p>That not only does it make one contented.</p><p>Whosoever comes in contact with such a person Starts feeling
something of the unknown Something of the mysterious.</p><p>That's how masters have been able To transform millions of
people.</p><p>They have become aware of their splendor And everybody who comes
close to them Becomes aware of the splendor</p><p>Not only of the master</p><p>But finally of his own self also. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--the-beginning-of-disciplehood>Osho's

beginning of disciplehood</span></h3><p>Is to be aware of the glory of the master.</p><p>And the end is to be aware of your own glory. They are not two
different things.</p><p>One can be full of justice</p><p>Only if one is free from one's mind, otherwise not. The mind is
always prejudiced for or against Hence it can never be just.</p><p>The mind lives with conclusions.</p><p>Even before looking at facts it has already decided. The mind has
decided wether there is a god or not. A few people are atheists, many
are theists</p><p>But all are in the same boat The boat of the mind.</p><p>They have decided without ever exploring. That is the way of the
mind</p><p>It decides without enquiring. Enquiry needs intelligence.</p><p>Enquiry needs tremendous love for truth. And enquiry needs as a basic
requirement That the mind be put aside so that you Can look directly
without any prejudice Coloring your eyes.</p><p>And that's what meditation is all about. Putting the mind aside.</p><p>Then one is just, always just.</p><p>One cannot be unjust, that is impossible.</p><p>Be meditative, be more and more meditative So that you can know what
no-mind is.</p><p>Out of no-mind blooms the flower of justice. A divine voice is always
there in the heart Always calling you.</p><p>But you are not available</p><p>You are engaged in some mundane affairs In some ordinary things.</p><p>Your mind is full of unnecessary rubbish Busy without business.</p><p>So you go on missing the still small voice within.</p><p>Once the mind is silent, once thoughts disappear Once you are left
without any thoughts</p><p>Suddenly the voice is heard.</p><p>And to hear god directly from your hart 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--is-the-beginning-of-transformation>Osho's

day</p><p>Waiting for you.</p><p>But people go on running hither and thither. They waste their whole
life</p><p>In such stupid nonsense that it seems unimaginable That man can be so
unintelligent.</p><p>But he is.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be intelligent.</p><p>He has to reconsider his whole life-style. This is the beginning of a
great pilgrimage. I am not in favour of renouncing the world. I want my
sannyasins to live in the world But very skillfully.</p><p>To live in such a way That nothing affects you To live in such a
way</p><p>That you are in the world an yet not of it. That is
non-attachment.</p><p>Renouncing is very easy.</p><p>One can escape to the mountains, to a monastery And forget all about
the world and its worries.</p><p>That is very easy; any coward can do that. And to live in the world
and be worried</p><p>Is also easy; everybody is doing that. I am telling you to do
something</p><p>Totally different from both these extremes. I don't want you to be a
worldly man Although I want you to be in the world.</p><p>I don't want you to go to a monastery Although I am initiating you
into a monkhood. I am trying to give you</p><p>A very paradoxical way of life</p><p>But it is only through paradox that one grows. Life is a dialectical
process</p><p>So the more paradoxically you live The higher the peaks you will
achieve. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--2>Osho's

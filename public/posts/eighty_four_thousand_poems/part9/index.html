Then love comes the way to god.\nAll these things are not different things They are aspects of the same phenomenon. In short it can be said\nThat your love should not be ego-rooted. Your love should be ego-free\nThen love is the surest way to god. Nothing succeeds like love\nIn finding god, in finding bliss\nIn finding freedom, in finding truth. Gautam the Buddha has called his religion\nThe noble religion, the religion of the Aryans. By Aryans he does not mean any race\nBy Aryans he means the people Who have attained enlightenment.\nAdolf Hitler also used the word 'Arya' But with a totally different meaning, He used it as the most noble race: The Nordics are the Aryans\nThe purest Aryans, the noblest. No race is great in itself\nAnd no race has any hierarchy over others.\nBlood cannot be decisive, only inner intelligence. And that can happen to anybody.\nTo anybody who is ready to work for it To prepare for it, to strive for it\nTo anybody who is ready to work for it To prepare for it, to strive for it\nTo anybody who is ready to accept the challenge It can happen. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The challenge is great Because the world does not like intelligent people.\nIt likes mediocre people because the mediocre are Very easily enslaved, very easily dominated\nVery easily manipulated.\nThey are good people but they are pure cow dung! They don't have any soul.\nYou can call them holy cow dung That doesn't make much difference. Intelligence is rebellious.\nIntelligence tries to live\nAccording to its own light And the crowd does not like it.\nThe crowd wants you to be a part of the crowd. It does not like individuals.\nThat is the challenge.\nAnd if one really wants to be noble\nOne has to get rid of the crowd psychology\nOne has to free oneself from all mob attitudes Rotten traditions, the ugly past, Stupid institutions, all kinds of superstitions.\nAnd this whole garbage is being forced upon you From the very childhood. The day one decides to from it all\nOne feels so light, one can almost fly.\nOne feels so weightless, as if wings have grown. Then you are becoming noble.\nMy sannyasins have to be noble Noble in the sense of being\nIntelligent, rebellious, non-conformists Individuals, free in every sense.\nFreedom has to be your god\nIf you really want to become noble. Worship freedom\nAnd sacrifice everything for freedom And then nobility is born.\nWe have to pay that price for it. But the treasure is so immense That it is cheap at any cost.\nEven if the whole life is lost for it\nIt is far more valuable than life itself. It is better to die a noble death\nThan to live an ignoble life. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One is not born noble, one has to become noble. It needs great intelligence\nGreat meditativeness, great love To become noble.\nIt has nothing to do with birth.\nIt is one of the rarer achievements in life. Jesus is noble.\nOf course he cannot claim a noble birth. He is not an aristocrat\nHe is the son of a poor carpenter.\nIf he had not been born to a poor carpenter\nNobody would have ever heard about Joseph and Mary. Of course later on people tried to connect\nHis lineage with King David.\nBut that is sheer nonsense, it is simply fiction. To avoid the fact\nThat he was a poor carpenter's son\nThey invented the theory of virgin birth. People can go to extreme lengths\nFor some stupid ideas.\nA simple thing needed to be accepted: That nobility has nothing to do with birth. But that would have gone against\nAll the aristocrats of the world And they are powerful people.\nThose who wield power manage everything. They manage history, what should be written And what should not be written.\nThey distort history, they invent history They change history.\nHence history becomes almost fictitious. It becomes all bunk.\nIt is more hysteria than history. Remember it\nBy becoming a sannyasin you CAn become noble A door opens up for you.\nMeditation creates that right milieu That right climate, that perspective In which one can find bliss Because meditation\nMakes you more and more conscious. Ultimately you become pure consciousness. At that very moment you are bliss too.\nThen consciousness and bliss 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Are not separate any more They are one phenomenon.\nWhether the gift is god's or not will be decided Only by your own experience. But one thing is certain:\nThat gift is of tremendous significance, of immense value, Immeasurable value, inestimable value.\nWhat can be more precious than life? What can be more precious than love? What can be more precious than\nThe experience of bliss or silence Or poetry or music?\nThere cannot be anything more precious Than these things.\nAnd life is full of\nSo many beautiful experiences, one cannot count them. The whole path of life is studded\nWith diamonds and emeralds and pearls. Eighty-four thousand poems every day...\nIn fact every moment poems are showering on you From every direction, every dimension.\nBut we are so utterly insensitive That we are not aware of anything. We go on living in our dark misery In our dark holes.\nThere are very few men in the world. There are millions of mice but not men\nBecause everybody is living In his small, dark hole.\nAnd if you tell them to come out\nThey ask: How? How can one come out? The dark hole is so comfortable, so cosy And they have decorated it\nAnd they have done great work. And not only they but their parents\nAnd their parent's parents, they have all lived there; And they have prepared it for their children.\nHow can they leave such great work\nTo which for centuries they have devoted Their time and energy to create?\nAnd what is the outcome? -- just misery. And outside there is the whole sky Available for them.\nAnd the stars are waiting for them But they will not come out.\nAnd even if they come 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- They will come with closed eyes Because they have become so accustomed to darkness That when they come into the light\nTheir eyes go blind.\nThey are so dazzled by the light That they close their eyes.\nBecome aware of all this that surrounds you. And by becoming aware of it\nYou will become aware of the great giver. Call it nature, call it god.\nThey mean the same thing. Man is like a dewdrop Existence is like the ocean\nAnd we are trying to keep ourselves Separate from it.\nThat is the root cause of our misery. Only one thing is needed:\nA jump into the ocean so the dewdrop disappears. It does not really disappear\nIt only loses its small boundaries.\nIt becomes oceanic, it becomes the ocean itself. But in a sense it disappears.\nYou cannot find it any more. It loses its old identity\nIts old nameplate and its old address. It has become part of such vastness That there is no way to find it.\nIt cannot stand out, that is the fear. That's why we go on keeping ourselves Away from the ocean.\nSannyas means an effort to gather courage To disappear into the ocean.\nAnd that day is the greatest day in life When you die into the ultimate Because then you become the ultimate. It is not death, it is resurrection.\nTime dies, eternity is born. Finitude dies but infinity is born.\nSmallness dies but greatness is born. It is worth truing!\nPurity comes through dropping the ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The ego is the course of all inner impurity; It is the cancer of the soul.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are moving Into a totally different way of life --\nThe life of egolessness.\nFrom this moment onwards be alert Not to feed your old ego, starve it. Don't co-operate with it\nBecause it lives with your co-operation. If you stop co-operating with it\nIt dies of its own accord.\nSooner or later it loses its strength Its power, its grip over you, Because in itself it has no substance It is a shadow.\nYou pour substance into it. So once you stop pouring...\nYes, it will go on for a few days\nOut of the old momentum.\nBut soon that old momentum is finished\nAnd then arises a pure paradise within your heart. Its beauty is indescribable.\nIts joy inexpressible.\nSo remember, this is the sutra for you.\nYou have to from the ego and then purity will happen. I am ton saying anything about moral purity;\nThat is an egoistic effort. It is ego decorating itself\nWith morality, character, and all that nonsense. I am simply saying drop the ego\nCut the tree from the very root\nAnd then comes a tremendous emptiness in you And that emptiness is pure.\nAnd out of that purity arises The experience of god.\nPrayer has been very much misunderstood In the past.\nIt has become part of the belief in a god\nHence those who don't believe in god can't pray.\nThat has deprived millions of people of prayer. Prayer has to be freed from the belief in god.\nIn fact prayer comes first, god comes later on. God is not a prerequisite to praying\nIt is a consequence of prayer. If you are in prayer\nYou will become aware of the existence of god. Then there will be no need to believe in god.\nAll beliefs are false.\nYou may believe for your whole life 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But you cannot make a belief true Through meditation, awareness, love, intelligence You can be twice born, you can be born anew\nOnly then will you be noble.\nAnd everybody should achieve nobility. Without achieving it if one lives and dies One has lived in vain and died in vain.\nBliss is the fundamental principle of life.\nAnimals, birds, trees\nWherever life exists, in whatsoever form, It is seeking and searching for bliss.\nBliss is the regulating principle. But it is the privilege of man To seek bliss consciously.\nOtherwise one seeks bliss and finds misery. Everybody seeks bliss and everybody finds misery.\nThe reason is not that there is no bliss in life The reason is that we start in a wrong direction.\nAnd we cannot do otherwise Unless we become more conscious.\nSannyas means bringing consciousness To your fundamental search\nMaking your search a conscious, deliberate effort. Then bliss is found. It is not very far away\nAll that is needed is a conscious seeker Not one who is just groping in darkness. Just by believing in it.\nYou can hypnotise yourself\nYou can think it is the truth but it remains a lie.\nGod should not be made a prerequisite for prayer. Prayer is a totally different phenomenon.\nIt has nothing to do with god. there is no need to believe in god.\nPrayer means thankfulness, gratitude. What is the need of believing in god To feel grateful?\nCan't you feel grateful for your life Grateful to existence?\nCan't you feel grateful for all these flowers And the stars and the people and the birds And this mysterious existence?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It does not matter to whom; that is irrelevant. The question is not to whom to feel grateful The question is to feel grateful\nTo xyz, it doesn't matter.\nCall it god, call it existence, call it nature. Or if you don't want to give it any name\nThere is no need. But feel grateful Because so much has been given to us. Who has given, we don't know.\nWhy he has given, we don't know. Wether there is somebody as a person Who is giving us all this, we don't know. But one thing is certain\nThat there are beautiful sunsets. Whether anybody paints them or not\nIs beside the point; they are beautiful They are immensely beautiful That not to feel grateful is to show insensitivity.\nPrayer has nothing to do with religion Prayer is basically the approach of an artist. Prayer is an aesthetic phenomenon\nNot o religious phenomenon. But if you start feeling grateful And thankful towards existence Slowly slowly you are surprised\nThat a presence starts surrounding you Which you had never felt before.\nIt is only a thankful heart\nThat starts feeling a new vibe. That vibe is god.\nGod only comes at a later stage But then it comes as an experience,\nThen god is liberation, then god is nirvana. But start by prayer, never start by god Because that god will be false.\nAnd if you are believing in a false god Your prayer is false.\nFirst make your prayer as deep as possible As heartfelt as possible\nAnd then god comes of his own accord. I am not worried about god\nBut I am certainly worried about prayer. If people miss prayer\nThen there is no possibility, no hope. If god is dead that is not our business. But if prayer is dead\nThen it is certainly a question of great concern Because without prayer all will be lost-1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- All that is beautiful, all that is great. So learn to be prayerful.\nA sannyasin has to go beyond all hardness He has to surpass hardness.\nThe quality of being hard\nHas been much praised in the past Because it was the quality\nThat made a man a soldier.\nAnd the soldiers were the most important people. They still are, unfortunately.\nA sannyasin is just the opposite of a soldier. So whatsoever are the qualities of a soldier Are DISqualifications for a sannyasin.\nThe soldier has to be hard like a rock\nAnd the sannyasin has to be soft like a rose. The soldier has to kill, hence he has to be hard. His whole profession is that of murder\nHe is a professional murderer. Destruction is his way of life.\nThe sannyasin is not destructive, he is creative He is non-violent.\nHe is love.\nNot violence, not hatred, not anger. How can he be hard?\nThe soldier has to live constantly in fear Hence he has to protect himself\nIn thousands of ways\nBecause if you are going to murder people Then you can be murdered\nThe sannyasin is vulnerable.\nEven if he is murdered, and many sannyasins Have been murdered down the ages,\nHe dies joyously, with a dance in his heart. But he does not become hard.\nHe dies with a song in his being. His death also is a poem.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So remember that. Hardness has to be dropped. Become a little more soft, tender,\nVulnerable, open\nBecause we are not going to conquer anybody. In fact we are inviting god to conquer us.\nThe bee does not cling to any flower. It gathers from all kinds of flowers But it remains unattached.\nIt will go to the rose\nIt will go to the marigold It will go to the lotus\nIt will move from flower to flower gathering honey But it is not attached, it does not cling.\nAnd that's how a sannyasin has to be. In fact Buddha told his sannyasins Never to beg from only one house...\nBecause his sannyasins were renunciates,\nThey had renounced life. They lived like beggars Hence they are known as bhikkhus.\nBhikkhu means a beggar.\nHe had told them never to beg from one house But to beg from many houses:\nA little bit from here, a little bit from there So you are not a burden to anybody. Because of that the Buddhist monks' begging\nIs called madhukari.\nMadhukari means begging like a bee. Literally it means begging like a bee.\nThe second thing to be remembered is that\nAlthough the bee gathers honey from many flowers It never destroys any flower.\nIt is very artful, very gracious, it does not hurt In fact the flower feels tremendously joyous\nWhen a bee comes to it. It is really a compliment. And the bee is never destructive.\nIt collects whatsoever it needs\nBut in such an artful way, with such skill That the flower remains absolutely the same. That's how a sannyasin has to be.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Live in such a way that nobody is harmed by you. Live in a creative way, with skill and art Live in a sensitive way.\nAnd never become attached.\nEnjoy all kinds of experiences, all kinds of flowers But remain moving, don't get caught anywhere\nAnd then you are bound to reach god. In ancient mythology\nThe wolf represents two things. First, it represents courage\nAnd secondly, it represents grace.\nThe walk of the wolf is a graceful phenomenon. To watch it is to watch something beautiful.\nIn fact animals have a certain grace Which man has lost.\nBecause animals still live spontaneously Moment to moment.\nThey don't carry the past\nThey don't have a burden on their head Hence their walk is light\nHence their walk has the quality of dance. Man drags, he does not walk.\nIt is very rare to find a man\nWhose walk has the quality of dance.\nBut that's what a sannyasin is supposed to find. He has to become again spontaneous\nHe has to live in the same innocence as animals With only one difference: he has\nto be conscious.\nAnimals are unconscious.\nAnd the same is true about courage:\nAnimals are courageous The wolf is courageous\nBut his courage is instinctive.\nMan has to be courageous consciously. Instinctive courage can't help much.\nIt is better than being a coward It is far better\nBut it will land you in many difficulties.\nIt will make your life more and more difficult Because it will be unconscious. If your courage becomes conscious\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Then you start moving Towards the ultimate peaks of life. And slowly slowly\nYour life becomes an integrated phenomenon. It has grace, it has beauty,\nIt has courage, it has joy. It is no more mundane\nIt is holy, it is sacred.\nLife is music, mind is noise.\nAnd because of the noisy mind we are unable to hear The music of life. Unless we stop the mind and its noise\nWe will never come to know The beautiful music of life. So the whole effort here\nIs to help you in two things. First is the negative part:\nHow to stop the noisy mind.\nAnd the second is the positive part:\nHow to train your ears so that you can hear Your own inner music.\nIf these two things are fulfilled Nothing else remains.\nLife achieves its ultimate peak Its bliss and its benediction.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #10\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3382","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3382 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

unconditional</p><p>That your love should be non-possessive That your love should be</p><p>For the sheer joy of sharing.</p><p>It should not ba a bargain and a business. Then love comes the way to
god.</p><p>All these things are not different things They are aspects of the

ego-free</p><p>Then love is the surest way to god. Nothing succeeds like love</p><p>In finding god, in finding bliss</p><p>In finding freedom, in finding truth. Gautam the Buddha has called

soul.</p><p>You can call them holy cow dung That doesn't make much difference.
Intelligence is rebellious.</p><p>Intelligence tries to live</p><p>According to its own light And the crowd does not like it.</p><p>The crowd wants you to be a part of the crowd. It does not like
individuals.</p><p>That is the challenge.</p><p>And if one really wants to be noble</p><p>One has to get rid of the crowd psychology</p><p>One has to free oneself from all mob attitudes Rotten traditions, the
ugly past, Stupid institutions, all kinds of superstitions.</p><p>And this whole garbage is being forced upon you From the very
childhood. The day one decides to from it all</p><p>One feels so light, one can almost fly.</p><p>One feels so weightless, as if wings have grown. Then you are
becoming noble.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be noble Noble in the sense of being</p><p>Intelligent, rebellious, non-conformists Individuals, free in every
sense.</p><p>Freedom has to be your god</p><p>If you really want to become noble. Worship freedom</p><p>And sacrifice everything for freedom And then nobility is born.</p><p>We have to pay that price for it. But the treasure is so immense That
it is cheap at any cost.</p><p>Even if the whole life is lost for it</p><p>It is far more valuable than life itself. It is better to die a noble

Jesus is noble.</p><p>Of course he cannot claim a noble birth. He is not an aristocrat</p><p>He is the son of a poor carpenter.</p><p>If he had not been born to a poor carpenter</p><p>Nobody would have ever heard about Joseph and Mary. Of course later
on people tried to connect</p><p>His lineage with King David.</p><p>But that is sheer nonsense, it is simply fiction. To avoid the
fact</p><p>That he was a poor carpenter's son</p><p>They invented the theory of virgin birth. People can go to extreme
lengths</p><p>For some stupid ideas.</p><p>A simple thing needed to be accepted: That nobility has nothing to do
with birth. But that would have gone against</p><p>All the aristocrats of the world And they are powerful people.</p><p>Those who wield power manage everything. They manage history, what
should be written And what should not be written.</p><p>They distort history, they invent history They change history.</p><p>Hence history becomes almost fictitious.

you.</p><p>Meditation creates that right milieu That right climate, that

Millions only live on this first plane\nThe gross. They don't know that they have Other possibilities inside them\nOther heights inside them\nThey are not aware at all. The second plane is\nThat of the mind, of thoughts.\nA few people move into the second plane. They become great thinkers, philosophers Idealists, scientists\nThey use the faculty of their mind The live in the mind.\nThe third plane is that of the heart The world of feelings.\nEven less people move to that. Those are the poets, the painters\nThe sculptors, the dancers, the musicians -- The people who live in a world of feelings Of sensitivity, not of thoughts.\nAnd beyond these three is the fourth,\nThe world of consciousness, pure consciousness Only the mystics move into it. And that is where the sannyasins have to go.\nAll the other three\nHave to be slowly slowly left behind So you can move to the fourth.\nTuriyo means the fourth\nIt means pure consciousness, your very being, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Neither the body nor the mind nor the feeling But simple being Your pure existence, your isness. It is called the fourth for the simple reason\nThat it is not advisable to give it any name. Hence 'the fourth's it is not a name\nJust a number, to keep it unlimited and open Because any name will become a limitation. The fourth is only an indicator.\nGo beyond the three which have names -- The physical, the mental, the emotional They have names, they have their definitions But the fourth has no definition.\nIt is indefinable\nHence it is called the fourth.\nBut that is the goal of the mystics Of the sannyasins\nThat is the goal of Christ, Buddha Krishna, Lao Tzu\nAnd that is the goal here.\nGautam the Buddha was called well-gone Because he would not be coming back again, That was his last life.\nOne becomes a well-gone\nOnly when one becomes enlightened Then there is no more birth, death\nNo more the vicious circle of birth and death The wheel of birth and death.\nOne has gone beyond, to the farther shore Beyond the beyond.\nOne has disappeared into the universal One need not be born in a body again. People are born in a body again and again Because they have desires.\nIt is because of desires\nThat they have to come into the body Because those desires can be fulfilled Only through the body.\nOnce all desires have been seen for What they actually are\nOnce their meaninglessness is understood One withdraws oneself from all desiring One stops desiring.\nSeeing the futility of desire, seeing that\nIt always brings pain and anxiety and anguish Seeing that desire is hell One becomes free of desire\nOne simply lives with no desire for the future, Neither in this world nor in the other.\nThen one becomes a well-gone. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That is the ultimate category. Remember it -- everybody has to become a well-gone.\nIf one puts one's total energy into meditation It is bound to happen, it is inevitable.\nOnly a man of meditation lives in freedom. Others pretend, others believe\nBut the belief does not correspond to reality. Political freedom is not real freedom\nEconomic freedom is also not real freedom. They are good -- I am not against them\nBut one should not be satisfied with them. The real freedom is spiritual freedom\nAnd spiritual freedom comes only through one way, There is no alternative way to arrive at it,\nAnd that is creating\nMore and more meditative energy in yourself Becoming more silent, alert, watchful.\nOrdinarily man lives like a machine. The meditator has to learn\nNot to live as a machine\nHe has to de-automatise himself\nHe has to become something more than a machine Something more than a computer.\nAnd that miracle can happen.\nIt has happened to a few people in the past It can happen to many more people now Because humanity has come of age.\nIf in the past there could be only A few Buddhas and a few Christs\nNow there can be many more. The time is ripe\nFor a great explosion of consciousness.\nIt has never been ripe, because life is evolving And we are coming to a climax.\nIf we don't attain to a radical transformation Then this same state of evolved humanity\nWill become a strain on us. Man is no more a child\nAnd if he continues to wear the old clothes Which were made for children\nHe is bound to be in difficulty.\nHe will remain unnecessarily crippled\nFor the simple reason that the clothes are small And he has become big. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Mohammedanism These are all clothes Made for another state of humanity When man was more childish.\nNow they don't fit, they are utterly out of date It is ridiculous to see Christians and Hindus\nAnd Mohammedans -- absolutely ridiculous! They are not contemporaries\nThey are living a thousand years back\nAnd trying to fit themselves into clothes Which are not meant for them.\nThey have grown huge, they have become adults Those clothes were right for a certain time\nNow they are not right at all. But we have become so attached To the old, to the traditional\nWe love antiques so much!\nThat anything old seems like gold. Anything new we are suspicious of. That's why people are suspicious of me Because I am saying something new Which has never been said in this way. The time is right to change all clothes\nThe time is ripe to change the whole of man A total overhauling is needed.\nAnd that's what sannyas is all about.\nOne is strong really, only when one is not. This is one of the paradoxes of life:\nThe ego is never strong.\nIt pretends to be strong but it is very weak.\nIt is bound to be weak because it is false.\nIt has no substance to it, it is only a shadow. How can the shadow be strong?\nMan cannot be strong on his own.\nHe will remain weak, he will remain poor. He can be strong only if he disappears And gives way to god.\nIf he allows god to descend in him Then he is as strong as god himself.\nThen a totally different quality of strength Arises in you, which is yours in a way 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because it is coming through you And yet it is not yours Because it is coming from god.\nYou are just a vehicle, a medium.\nA sannyasin has to become a medium for god.\nHe has to be utterly empty so there is no hindrance To god's energy flowing through him.\nHe has to remove all the rocks\nSo that the stream of god's energy. Can flow through him unhindered. Then you are strong\nBut there is no claim of strength on your part There is no bragging on your part There is no pride on your part.\nYou have immense intelligence available Great insight is yours, but you remain humble. The more the strength flows through you\nThe more humble you become.\nThe more you become aware that god\nIs penetrating you, the more grateful you feel. Through meditation one dies as an ego\nAnd allows god to live through one. That's my whole work heres\nTo help you die as an ego. That's the only way to know god\nAnd that's the only way to be in communion With the whole.\nAnd the only way to be blissful, to be peaceful. The courageous person always leaves the known\nFor the unknown, each moment. And then his life goes on widening.\nGoes on becoming vast as the ocean, as the sky. And when there are no boundaries left\nWhen you have not only left the known\nBut you have even gone beyond the unknown Into the unknowable...\nThat is the last ultimate step of courage:\nTaking the jump, the plunge into the unknowable Knowing perfectly well that it cannot be known That i is impossible to know it,\nNobody has ever known it\nThat its very nature is unknowable That it is intrinsically unknowable\nThere is no way to reduce it to the known. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But first start learning To move from the known towards the unknown And your life will become a great excitement A great joy, a great surprise,\nEvery moment there is something new happening. And then take the ultimate risk one days\nLove from the unknown to the unknowable. The difference is that\nThe unknown will become known\nAnd the unknowable will never become the known. That unknowable is god.\nBut first learn to\nMove from the known to the unknown. That is learning to swim in shallow water. And when you have learned swimming Then go into the ocean with no fear\nWith absolute fearlessness\nAnd then your life will know what ecstasy is. With the unknown\nYou will know excitement With the unknowable\nYou will come to know ecstasy. One of the most essential qualities\nFor a sannyasin is to be anonymous, a nobody To forget all desire for name and fame\nTo live ordinarily, naturally authentically, spontaneously Not to bother about what others say\nNot to be worried about other's opinions; Their opinions carry no value at all.\nThey are all asleep, fast asleep.\nIn sleep they go on saying something They don't know what they are saying.\nThey don't mean it either; it is all gibberish. They are blind, they see nothing.\nThat is the value of their opinion? But people hanker for name and fame They hanker to convince blind people That 'I am beautiful.'\nThey hanker to convince madmen That 'I am a great creator.'\nIf you understand the situation\nIn which humanity is and has always been 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You will not be bothered about all these things. There is no need to put any effort into it. Just live your life\nAs peacefully and silently as possible As if you are non-existent.\nTo live anonymously, to live like a nobody Is the exact definition of sannyas.\nIt is dropping the whole ego trip.\nAnd all trips are ego trips -- remember it. The moment you drop the ego trip\nAll trips are dropped you relax You start resting in your being\nAnd in that very rest great joy arises Overflooding bliss arises\nLife becomes a benediction, a sacred phenomenon. Remember only one thing:\nMy idea of sannyas is very simple It has nothing esoteric about it,\nIt is very scientific Nothing is hidden in it,\nEverything is an open secret. There is no ritual\nBut a simple process of meditation -- That is its foundation.\nNot even prayer is needed, just meditation. Prayer is not scientific\nAnd can never be scientific.\nBut meditation is utterly scientific. Just as the scientist\nWatches, observes the objective phenomenon\nThe meditator watches the psychological phenomenon. It is the same process: a detached watching\nUnprejudiced observation, with no conclusions, Because if you have a conclusion already\nThen there is no point in watching.\nThen you will manage to prove your conclusion Then the whole process is unscientific.\nThe essential core of science is that\nIt depends not on prejudices but on experiments Experience, on facts, observed facts.\nHence a person who is trained scientifically Can very easily understand meditation.\nIt has no superstition about it\nIt is as simple as two plus two is four.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The only difference between science and religion Is that science is concerned with the objective With that which is outside. There.\nAnd religion is concerned with who observes With that which is inner, the subjective.\nThe same process of observation\nHas to be turned towards your own mind.\nOne becomes oneself a lab, a great experiment Of observation: one watches one's thoughts Desires, memories, anger, greed, lust\nWith no a priori conclusion, with no judgement: This is good, this is bad,.. non- judgmental\nThen a miracle happens.\nWhen you are absolutely non-judgmental, With no prejudice, no conclusion,\nWhen your observation is pure, simple, innocent, That which you observe starts disappearing.\nThat's where science and religion Start differing:\nThe more you observe in science The more real the fact becomes.\nIt was not so real before observation. You may have missed it\nBut now you cannot miss it, it is there. It becomes more solid.\nWhen you watch your mind this is the difference: If you watch your anger it starts evaporating\nIt cannot exist.\nSlowly slowly the whole mind ceases to be. When there is no mind left to watch,\nThe watcher turns upon itself. That is the moment of realisation Self-realisation, samadhi.\nThat if the ultimate goal Of all mystical approaches.\nTo know oneself is to know all.\nAnd that is the only thing that I emphasise: No belief, no dogma, no creed\nNo church, no religion.\nBy a simple process of inner observation You come to realise yourself.\nAnd the moment you know who you are\nImmediately you know the essential core Of the whole existence, of life itself 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because you are part of it. If we can understand a single drop of water We have understood all the water\nThat exists anywhere.\nAnd each man is a dewdrop of god If we can understand one man And the easiest and the closest\nIs your own existence.\nOnce the mystery is understood Once the door is open\nYou know now that you are just a dewdrop Of the same ultimate reality\nThat pervades the whole existence.\nThen there is no death, no fear, no greed, no lust. One lives in absolute freedom\nBliss and benediction.\nSo make it a point that now meditation\nHas to be your constant work upon yourself.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2504","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2504 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

non-existent.</p><p>To live anonymously, to live like a nobody Is the exact definition of
sannyas.</p><p>It is dropping the whole ego trip.</p><p>And all trips are ego trips -- remember it. The moment you drop the

thing:</p><p>My idea of sannyas is very simple It has nothing esoteric about
it,</p><p>It is very scientific Nothing is hidden in it,</p><p>Everything is an open secret. There is no ritual</p><p>But a simple process of meditation -- That is its foundation.</p><p>Not even prayer is needed, just meditation. Prayer is not
scientific</p><p>And can never be scientific.</p><p>But meditation is utterly scientific. Just as the scientist</p><p>Watches, observes the objective phenomenon</p><p>The meditator watches the psychological phenomenon. It is the same
process: a detached watching</p><p>Unprejudiced observation, with no conclusions, Because if you have a
conclusion already</p><p>Then there is no point in watching.</p><p>Then you will manage to prove your conclusion Then the whole process
is unscientific.</p><p>The essential core of science is that</p><p>It depends not on prejudices but on experiments Experience, on facts,
observed facts.</p><p>Hence a person who is trained scientifically Can very easily

is inner, the subjective.</p><p>The same process of observation</p><p>Has to be turned towards your own mind.</p><p>One becomes oneself a lab, a great experiment Of observation: one
watches one's thoughts Desires, memories, anger, greed, lust</p><p>With no a priori conclusion, with no judgement: This is good, this is

anger it starts evaporating</p><p>It cannot exist.</p><p>Slowly slowly the whole mind ceases to be. When there is no mind left

It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand means bliss. Ingo means creativity.\nCreativity is one of the fundamentals of my sannyas. A sannyasin should not be uncreative -- that has been the traditional way. In all the religions all over the world monks and nuns have been very uncreative. The very idea of religion was to renounce life, and if you renounce life, creativity is renounced automatically.\nTo be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it. You love life so much that you would like to leave it a little better than you found it. But if you are against life, there is no question of making it better, beautiful, rich prosperous.\nYou can ignore it, you can neglect it. It is just as if you are staying in a hotel -- who cares about the hotel? You are not going to stay there forever, so why bother? That was the old idea of all the religions: that we are only here for a few days so why bother? Just pass these days somehow --\npraying for a better world, the other world -- not for the betterment of this world,\nnot any prayer to create a paradise now and here. The goal of the old sannyas was beyond death.\nMy sannyas knows only the present -- the now and the here. Of course the other shore is there, but it will take its own course. In the course of time it will arrive. And we have to learn here to be able to live there. If we are uncreative here, how can you be creative in paradise?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Life is a school of learning. The old saints and the old mahatmas remain the same -- in heaven too! Even if they reach heaven --\nand I suspect, I doubt very much that they can! If by some accident they do, they will start renouncing paradise because that's all that they are accustomed to, that's all that they have practised for their whole life -- and not one life but for many lives they have been practising and practising renunciation.\nEven in paradise they will find a thousand and one faults. That has been their way here, to find faults\n-- not to try to make life a little better, but just to find faults so it can be condemned. They will condemn paradise. I don't think they will ever be allowed in paradise -- they are not good company!\nIf they don't go to hell, they must be somewhere in limbo, hanging between the two, which is far worse -- neither here nor there because nobody wants to take them in.\nOne has to love life enough to beautify it, to pour one's energy into it. Yes, we are here for a few days, but a few days are more then enough. It is not a question of time, you have to do something in these days.\nTry to make it a little cleaner. Try to make it a little healthier, try to make it a\nlittle hygienic, try to make it a little happier. That very effort will change you. That very idea is what service is.\nTo be creative is to really be in the service of God. And that is the only true way of prayer and meditation.\nIf God is a creator, then we can participate with him only when we are creators. In our own small way, painting or poetry or pottery, whatsoever small thing we can do. But while we are creating it, we are participating in the vast process of creation. In those moments we disappear and God is.\nCreativity certainly brings peace. And if there is creativity and there is peace, one starts feeling existence is full of Godliness. Then there is no need to go to the church, or the temple, or the mosque.\nThe whole of life is your temple. The whole earth is sacred.\nWherever you are, you are on sacred ground. Anand Tom\nOne can go into the inquiry of truth either out of misery, or out of bliss. If one goes into the exploration out of misery, one has taken a wrong step from the very beginning. The miserable person will never be able to know truth because in fact, he is not interested in truth. All that he is interested in is how to get rid of misery, so whatsoever will help him to get rid of misery he will cling to as truth.\nAnd lies are very comfortable, particularly when you are in misery, lies are very consolatory. So the person who is miserable cannot reach truth... He will find many miseries surrounding him hankering to be consoled, to be covered, to be repressed, to be forgotten. Hence he will quickly choose any lie that can help him. Maybe the help can only be temporary, it can be only temporary. But the miserable person, the drowning person cannot be bothered about whether the lie is only temporary or is a truth that is going to be eternal. He is drowning: Anything that can save him right now, even a straw, he will cling to. Just the very hope that something is there to cling to, that will keep him afloat a little longer.\nThat's why millions of people are living in lies. For them god is a lie. They believe in god not because they know, but because they are in misery. They believe in after-life not because they know but because they are in misery, and they are afraid of death. They believe in the immortality of the soul, not because they know -- they know nothing of the soul, they have never tasted anything of the soul. They have never gone inwards, but they believe in the immortality of the soul because their life is such a failure; if there is only one life then when are they going to make it? This life is gone, or almost gone, and they know that this much time is not enough for them to make any success out of it. They need more time, hence they create theories of reincarnation, of coming again and again back 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- into life, of the soul going on, being reincarnated again and again. I am not saying that these things are not true, but for people these are only lies -- they are believing in them. Every belief is a lie. Even if you believe in the truth it becomes a lie. Belief makes everything a lie. Truth has not to be believed, truth has to be experienced, only then it is true.\nHence the first step has to be taken very carefully. It should not be taken out of misery, it should be taken out of bliss. That's why my effort here is to help you dance, sing, love, laugh. Only then can spirituality have a beginning in your life. It has to be rooted in laughter, in joy, it has to be rooted in your healthy rejoicing in life. Rejoice in everything that surrounds you: the beauty of the sunset and the flowers and the stars; the beauty of a bird on the wing, lonely, far away in the sky, beyond the clouds. Just watching it is such a joy.\nAllow every possibility in your life so that you can feel a little more dancing, singing, humming, then only start the inquiry for truth. First clear the ground misery.\nBut the old religions have depended much on misery because people are in misery, you need not prepare any ground. They are already available, they are miserable. When you say, \"We are here to save you, to save you from your misery, and Jesus is the saviour and Buddha is the saviour, and Krishna is the saviour\", they are ready to fall victims of whatsoever you say. They want any\nremedy. They are ill, they are tired, they are weary, they want any support. They are not much concerned whether the support is true or false: they are ready to be exploited. But give them any support and they go on moving from one exploiter to another exploiter: The Hindus become Christians, and Christians become Hindus. This is sheer stupidity. You are simply changing your prisons. The game is the same, only the name changes. The name-plates change, the inside content is exactly the same. But it is easier for the priests because then there is no work to be done in preparation. People are already miserable, and you start exploiting their misery.\nMy work is hard because the first thing is that I would like you to be uprooted from your misery, then only can my work start. This is a prerequisite, an absolutely necessary requisite. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be put aside, it has to be fulfilled. First you have to become a little happier, you have to learn to be a little more love-full, joyful; your life has to have the color of a little happiness.\nThen go into the search for truth and you will be moving in the right direction, because then no lie can ever deceive you. You are no more interested in lies, because you are no more interested in consolation and comfort. Now you are ready to know the naked truth as it is. And to be a seeker of truth is the greatest thing in life.\nSatbodh\nOne cannot find truth by mere thinking. Thinking is not the process that leads you to the truth. It leads only to inference. And inferences are just inferences, they are hypothetical. They may be true, they may not be true. They are just conjectures, not real conclusions. But the mind lives in thinking and it goes on believing that its conjectures are conclusions. They are not conclusions.\nTruth is achieved only by awareness. It is not a mind process at all, it is a totally different phenomenon. You are not to think the truth, you have to stop all thinking to know truth; you have to forget all about truth, to know truth. You have to unburden yourself of all the theories, hypothesizes, philosophies, ideologies, that you have learned.\nThe process of achieving the truth is a process of unlearning, it is a process of unconditioning.\nSlowly, slowly one has to get out of the mind, to slip out of the mind; and one\nhas to become just a pool of consciousness, a pure awareness. Just a sheer watchfulness: doing nothing, just watching, watching all that is happening in the outside world and in the inside world.\nWhen one can just watch without any judgement interfering, without any old ideas coming in, then truth is revealed. And the miracle is: it does not come from somewhere else to you, it does not descend from above; it is found within you -- it is your intrinsic nature. It is really a great revelation to know truth because you are it and you have never lost it -- even for a single moment. You have always been it. It is impossible to lose it, because it is your nature and your nature cannot be lost.\nThat's why we call it nature. That which cannot be lost is the very definition of nature. That which can be lost is not nature but nurture.\nTruth is your nature, your very being, your very existence, your very center. It is through awareness 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that slowly slowly you reach your own center. When you have arrived at your own center, then you know what truth is. And it is not just knowledge of something objective, something there , but something subjective, something in here . And once known, it is known forever, once discovered, it cannot be forgotten. And to know truth is to be liberated, truth liberates, but remember: only your own truth liberates. Nobody else's truth can liberate you, Somebody else's truth will always become a bondage to you.\nSo the real master helps you to discover your own truth. He does not hand over to you a theory, a dogma, a creed. He does not hand to you anything at all. He never gives you anything; on the contrary, he goes on taking away all that you have been carrying with you for many many lives.\nSlowly slowly, he dismantles your mind, he cuts off your head. The day your head disappears you have arrived home. The master does not give you the truth, but he does take away all the lies from you. And once all the lies are taken away, truth is found within yourself. It was lying there, covered underneath the rubbish of thousands of lies.\nSannyas means, putting your head at the feet of the master and praying to him: \"Please cut it off!\" It is a strange prayer, but that's exactly what it is!\nTo be a disciple is a great art.\nOne can even say the greatest, because Its requirement is the surrender of the ego Which is the hardest thing in life.\nOne can do everything for the ego:\nOne can climb mountains and go to the moon. Everything is easy if it is for the ego.\nBut to drop the ego is really an uphill task It goes against our natural instinct.\nBut it is the beginning of real spirituality. The first requirement for a disciple\nIs to surrender, to say to the master 'Now I am no more, only you are!'\nA total yes to the master, an absolute trust -- That's what makes a disciple.\nThere are many students but very few disciples. And only disciples can be transformed Students can only be informed.\nBecoming a sannyasin\nMeans you are taking a great step Towards the dissolution of the ego. If one consciously tries to drop it One can drop it.\nCertainly it is difficult But it is not impossible.\nAnd that is a great challenge for the disciple. It has a great excitement and ecstasy too Because the moment it is fulfilled\nYou start blooming like a lotus. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The moment the ego is surrendered The master and the disciple Are no more separate entities. There starts transpiring\nSomething between one heart and another heart Something invisible.\nWords become more and more irrelevant, Silence become more and more significant.\nIt is the ultimate love affair --\nA love affair with one's own death Because in the beginning Dropping the ego looks like death\nBut only after that death is resurrection. When one is born anew\nOne is born in one's total reality\nOne achieves the peak of one's potential.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #24\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2590","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2590 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

misery. They believe in after-life not because they know but because
they are in misery, and they are afraid of death. They believe in the
immortality of the soul, not because they know -- they know nothing of
the soul, they have never tasted anything of the soul. They have never
gone inwards, but they believe in the immortality of the soul because
their life is such a failure; if there is only one life then when are
they going to make it? This life is gone, or almost gone, and they know
that this much time is not enough for them to make any success out of
it. They need more time, hence they create theories of reincarnation, of
coming again and again back 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--into-life-of-the-soul-going-on-being-reincarnated-again-and-again.>Osho's

life, of the soul going on, being reincarnated again and
again.</span></h3><p>I am not saying that these things are not true, but for people these
are only lies -- they are believing in them. Every belief is a lie. Even
if you believe in the truth it becomes a lie. Belief makes everything a
lie. Truth has not to be believed, truth has to be experienced, only
then it is true.</p><p>Hence the first step has to be taken very carefully. It should not be
taken out of misery, it should be taken out of bliss. That's why my
effort here is to help you dance, sing, love, laugh. Only then can
spirituality have a beginning in your life. It has to be rooted in
laughter, in joy, it has to be rooted in your healthy rejoicing in life.
Rejoice in everything that surrounds you: the beauty of the sunset and
the flowers and the stars; the beauty of a bird on the wing, lonely, far
away in the sky, beyond the clouds. Just watching it is such a joy.</p><p>Allow every possibility in your life so that you can feel a little
more dancing, singing, humming, then only start the inquiry for truth.
First clear the ground misery.</p><p>But the old religions have depended much on misery because people are
in misery, you need not prepare any ground. They are already available,
they are miserable. When you say, "We are here to save you, to save you
from your misery, and Jesus is the saviour and Buddha is the saviour,
and Krishna is the saviour", they are ready to fall victims of
whatsoever you say. They want any</p><p>remedy. They are ill, they are tired, they are weary, they want any
support. They are not much concerned whether the support is true or
false: they are ready to be exploited. But give them any support and
they go on moving from one exploiter to another exploiter: The Hindus
become Christians, and Christians become Hindus. This is sheer
stupidity. You are simply changing your prisons. The game is the same,
only the name changes. The name-plates change, the inside content is
exactly the same. But it is easier for the priests because then there is
no work to be done in preparation. People are already miserable, and you
start exploiting their misery.</p><p>My work is hard because the first thing is that I would like you to
be uprooted from your misery, then only can my work start. This is a
prerequisite, an absolutely necessary requisite. It cannot be avoided.
It cannot be put aside, it has to be fulfilled. First you have to become
a little happier, you have to learn to be a little more love-full,
joyful; your life has to have the color of a little happiness.</p><p>Then go into the search for truth and you will be moving in the right
direction, because then no lie can ever deceive you. You are no more
interested in lies, because you are no more interested in consolation
and comfort. Now you are ready to know the naked truth as it is. And to
be a seeker of truth is the greatest thing in life.</p><p>Satbodh</p><p>One cannot find truth by mere thinking. Thinking is not the process
that leads you to the truth. It leads only to inference. And inferences
are just inferences, they are hypothetical. They may be true, they may
not be true. They are just conjectures, not real conclusions. But the
mind lives in thinking and it goes on believing that its conjectures are
conclusions. They are not conclusions.</p><p>Truth is achieved only by awareness. It is not a mind process at all,
it is a totally different phenomenon. You are not to think the truth,
you have to stop all thinking to know truth; you have to forget all
about truth, to know truth. You have to unburden yourself of all the
theories, hypothesizes, philosophies, ideologies, that you have
learned.</p><p>The process of achieving the truth is a process of unlearning, it is
a process of unconditioning.</p><p>Slowly, slowly one has to get out of the mind, to slip out of the
mind; and one</p><p>has to become just a pool of consciousness, a pure awareness. Just a
sheer watchfulness: doing nothing, just watching, watching all that is
happening in the outside world and in the inside world.</p><p>When one can just watch without any judgement interfering, without
any old ideas coming in, then truth is revealed. And the miracle is: it
does not come from somewhere else to you, it does not descend from
above; it is found within you -- it is your intrinsic nature. It is
really a great revelation to know truth because you are it and you have
never lost it -- even for a single moment. You have always been it. It
is impossible to lose it, because it is your nature and your nature
cannot be lost.</p><p>That's why we call it nature. That which cannot be lost is the very
definition of nature. That which can be lost is not nature but
nurture.</p><p>Truth is your nature, your very being, your very existence, your very
center. It is through awareness 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query->Osho's books
on CD-ROM, published and unpublished <span class=p>Query:-</span></h3><p>that slowly slowly you reach your own center. When you have arrived
at your own center, then you know what truth is. And it is not just
knowledge of something objective, something there , but something
subjective, something in here . And once known, it is known forever,
once discovered, it cannot be forgotten. And to know truth is to be
liberated, truth liberates, but remember: only your own truth liberates.
Nobody else's truth can liberate you, Somebody else's truth will always
become a bondage to you.</p><p>So the real master helps you to discover your own truth. He does not
hand over to you a theory, a dogma, a creed. He does not hand to you
anything at all. He never gives you anything; on the contrary, he goes
on taking away all that you have been carrying with you for many many
lives.</p><p>Slowly slowly, he dismantles your mind, he cuts off your head. The
day your head disappears you have arrived home. The master does not give
you the truth, but he does take away all the lies from you. And once all
the lies are taken away, truth is found within yourself. It was lying
there, covered underneath the rubbish of thousands of lies.</p><p>Sannyas means, putting your head at the feet of the master and
praying to him: "Please cut it off!" It is a strange prayer, but that's
exactly what it is!</p><p>To be a disciple is a great art.</p><p>One can even say the greatest, because Its requirement is the
surrender of the ego Which is the hardest thing in life.</p><p>One can do everything <em>for</em> the ego:</p><p>One can climb mountains and go to the moon. Everything is easy if it
is for the ego.</p><p>But to drop the ego is really an uphill task It goes against our
natural instinct.</p><p>But it is the beginning of real spirituality. The first requirement
for a disciple</p><p>Is to surrender, to say to the master 'Now I am no more, only you
are!'</p><p>A total yes to the master, an absolute trust -- That's what makes a
disciple.</p><p>There are many students but very few disciples. And only disciples
can be transformed Students can only be informed.</p><p>Becoming a sannyasin</p><p>Means you are taking a great step Towards the dissolution of the ego.
If one consciously tries to drop it One <em>can</em> drop it.</p><p>Certainly it is difficult But it is not impossible.</p><p>And that is a great challenge for the disciple. It has a great
excitement and ecstasy too Because the moment it is fulfilled</p><p>You start blooming like a lotus. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--the-moment-the-ego-is-surrendered>Osho's

It is not an effort to force you According to some pattern.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is just to help you to be totally free So that you can be yourself. My effort here is\nTo give you a taste of freedom.\nOnce you have tasted freedom Nobody can enslave you.\nAnd the politicians and the priests Are all for enslaving people.\nThey don't want people who are intelligent People who are free, people who are rebels. They want slaves because slaves can be Exploited easily, oppressed easily, Manipulated easily, dominated easily.\nAnd I am creating fire here!\nEach of my sannyasin has to prove a danger To all the old rotten structures of society.\nEach sannyasin has to be a sabotage. That's why I have chosen\nThe colour of fire for sannyas.\nAnd we have to make so many sannyasins\nThat they cannot manage so many fire brigades!\nSannyas is a rebellion against all conventions Against all conformities, against all ideologies Against all traditions,\nIn short against the whole past. Unless one gets rid of the past\nOne is never available to the present And only the present exists\nAnd only in the present can god be found, Not in the past, not in the future either.\nBoth are non-existential.\nPast is no more, future is not yet. This moment, this now is all there is. To rebel against the past means\nTo be herenow And then life has\nA totally different significance:\nIt is divine, it is ecstatic, it knows no death. We are all forms of god.\nEverything is a form of god Because nothing else exists. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- God and existence are synonymous, Remember it.\nLooking at a tree remind yourself\nThat you are looking at a god.\nLooking at a mountain remind yourself. Even looking at a dog remind yourself. Maybe the dog is god a little bit upside down But the energy is the same\nIt is one energy.\nAnd the more you remind yourself The more you will start feeling it.\nIt is only a question of constant hammering. And one day when it explodes one is surprised Utterly surprised that one has been living Amidst so many forms of god\nAnd yet missing him.\nThere is no need to go anywhere to search for him He is all around you. He is within\nHe is without.\nMake it your meditation.\nGod has no form although all forms are his. He has no colour although all colours are his. He does not exist in some particular place Because he exists everywhere.\nOnly because he has no form\nCan he manifest himself in millions of forms. If you have a certain form\nThen you are bound to that form\nThen you cannot be multi-dimensional.\nIf you are a man then you cannot be a woman. If you are a woman you cannot be a man.\nIf you are a tree you cannot be a rock. If you are a rock you cannot be a river. But he is all\nBecause he is no one in particular.\nThese two things have to be remembered.\nAll images are false because god has no form. Worship him in his formlessness\nWorship him an all forms\nBut don't become attached to any particular form: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan.\nLet the whole existence be his temple. I teach a religionless religion\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- A godless godliness. I don't make any division between God the creator and the creation. It is the same: god is his creation. God is like a dancer.\nYou cannot separate the dance and the dancer. So love him an all forms\nAnd remember that he has no form. So don't become attached to any form. If this mindfulness can be carried\nYou will be surprised:\nIt will bring you many many precious experiences And ultimately the goal will be fulfilled,\nThe goal of realising the formless. You will realise it within yourself Because you are also formless.\nThe body is not you, nor is the mind. You are the consciousness\nWhich has no form, no limitation. It is as vast as the sky.\nA humble heart is one of the greatest virtues For one who is in search of truth.\nOnly those who are humble can know truth. The egoists are prohibited.\nThe ego itself becomes the barrier. It cuts you away from existence.\nEgo means you are thinking\nYou are separate form the whole. And you are not!\nWe are not islands, no man is an island. We are part of an infinite continent.\nThe ego gives us a false feeling of separation And because of that false feeling of separation Slowly slowly we become enclosed in ourselves.\nWe become too self-conscious, self-centred Utterly closed to the world.\nClosed to the sun, to the moon To the wind, to the rain.\nWe become encapsulated. That is a kind of living death.\nWe start carrying our grave around ourselves. It is a very invisible grave\nBut it is a grave all the same. Sannyas means dropping that grave Coming out of the grave\nJust as Lazarus came out of the grave 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- When Jesus called him, 'Lazarus, come out!' That has been the function\nOf all the masters down the ages: Calling Lazaruses to come out of graves. It is a beautiful parable, not history\nBot one of the most is significant myths, Of tremendous import.\nEvery sannyasin has to go through that myth He has to live it.\nWhen you come to me you are in the grave. When you come to me you are Lazarus, dead. When you start dropping your deadness When you start dropping your ego\nWhich is the cause of your death\nYou start attaining to a new vision of life A new style of life.\nYou are resurrected.\nBut it needs a humble heart, One who is not egoistic\nOne who is ready to surrender One who can say to god,\n'Let thy will be done.' Jesus says god is love. I say love is god\nBecause when you say god is love\nIt means god may be many more things too. Love may be one of his qualities\nAmong other qualities, with other qualities. But I say love is god, there is no other quality. So to be loving is to be religious.\nTo be in real love with existence Is to be in prayer.\nThere is no need to go into the scriptures And no need to learn theology\nAnd no need to ponder over stupid nonsense\nCalled philosophy. There is no need.\nOne has to love the flowers and the birds And the trees and the stars and the people, And that's enough!\nOne has to go on improving one's quality of love. One has to make it more and more Unconditional, unmotivated, undemanding\nNon-dominating, non-egoistic. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- When your love is absolutely pure You have attained to god. There is nothing more to it. You have attained\nTo the ultimate perfection of life. Love is the essence\nSo let that become your path. Loyalty is one of the qualities\nThat has disappeared from the world.\nPeople have forgotten loyalty They have forgotten commitment\nThey don't know what involvement is any more.\nAll their relationships are hit and run affairs Hence they don't know what intimacy is.\nAnd intimacy grows only in time, it takes time. It is not a seasonal flower\nIt takes one's whole life.\nAnd one needs to be loyal, only then can one grow. Maturity means the decisiveness\nTo commit yourself to something With your totality.\nYes, think as much as you can Before you take the jump\nBut don't go on thinking and thinking forever. Thinking is only secondary.\nIt should be a help for the jump, not a hindrance. And once you have taken a jump\nDon't look back, that is below dignity. Risk all and go ahead. Don't be worried. Then whatsoever the consequence\nWhatsoever the sacrifice...\nOnly then can one create a soul within oneself. It comes only at a certain height of effort\nAt a certain peak of your will.\nWhen you are not holding back anything Then only does it happen.\nBut when it happens it is a joy.\nIt is as if thousands of lowers have bloomed In your being.\nYou become full of fragrance Overflowing with ecstasy.\nUnbounded bliss is yours\nBut the price has to be paid with loyalty. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Silence has two aspects to it. One is silence of the mind When thoughts disappear. That is the first step.\nAs you start meditating you have to begin\nBy watching the thoughts.\nJust by watching, one day they disappear. Then begins the second step:\nThe silence of the heart\nThat comes by watching the feelings. It is a more subtle phenomenon\nFar deeper than the first But the process is the same. If one succeeds in the first\nOne will be able to succeed in the second too, It is the same method of watching. And one day feelings disappear too.\nThen the second silence is achieved. And when both these silences are there Then for the first time you know\nThat the watcher also has disappeared Because there is nothing to watch.\nWhen there is nothing to know The knower disappears.\nThat is the ultimate silence.\nThe first two are steps towards the ultimate And it is only that silence\nWhich Buddha calls nirvana\nAnd Jesus calls the kingdom of god. There are only two conditions\nTo truly be a follower of Christ.\nOne is: you should not be a Christian Because Christ was not a Christian. Neither was he a Jew.\nIf he had been a Jew\nHe would not have been crucified.\nHe behaved in a very non-Jewish way He rebelled against the Jewish tradition. And he was certainly not a Christian\nHe had never heard even the word Christian. And if he comes back again\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He will be crucified by the Christians, This time in the Vatican.\nThat time it was through the Romans And this time again it will be\nThrough the Italians, the same people. These Italians are dangerous people The Mafia is very ancient!\nSo the first condition is: don't be a Christian Don't be a Hindu. Don't be a Mohammedan.\nIf one really wants to be a follower of Christ-To be religious-one has to drop all religions.\nAnd the second condition is... Christ became Christ\nOnly because he dropped his being a Jesus. One has to drop one's small identity\nWith the body, with the mind, with the birth Only then does one become vast.\nChrist is no more a Jesus Buddha is no more a Gautam. Those were their old names.\nWhen Gautam Buddha came back After his enlightenment\nHis father was very angry\nBecause he had escaped from the house And after twelve years roaming like a hippie He came back home.\nHe was the son of a king\nAnd the king was really furious. He was the only son.\nThe old man shouted an told him 'I never thought that you would do Such a thing to me in my old age. Feel ashamed of yourself!\nAnd Buddha laughed and he said 'But who are you talking to?\nThe man who left your palace has died. I am no more Gautam, your son is dead I have risen out of his corpse.\nI am a totally new person. Just look again at me!' 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- When the father became a little cooler He looked again:\n'Yes, this man looks different He appears the same:\nThe same features, the same body But the depth of the eyes\nThe joy on the face\nThe aroma, the fragrance that surrounds him Is totally different.'\nHe recognised that.\nHe bowed down and touched Buddha's feet. He said,'Yes, now I can see\nI am unnecessarily getting furious at you.\nYou have changed, you are radically different. The same and yet not the same.'\nSo with these two things fulfilled\nOne really becomes a follower of Christ. Why say a follower of Christ?\nOne becomes a Christ oneself.\nAnd never settle for anything second-rate When you can be first-rate!\nA man without meditation becomes mediocre. His consciousness gathers rust.\nHis consciousness becomes covered with dust He loses all brightness, all intelligence.\nSlowly slowly he completely forgets who he is. He becomes so stupid.\nThat is the utmost in stupidity, To forget who you are.\nAnd that has happened to the whole humanity. Through meditation\nConsciousness ban be again sharpened Dust can be removed\nRust can be washed away.\nYour mirror can again become bright. And when your consciousness is bright It reflects reality.\nAnd god is another name for reality. To know god is to know all\nNot to know god\nIs to live in ignorance, darkness, death. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Bliss is the goal of all life. Consciously or unconsciously\nWe are all searching for bliss. To search unconsciously means One is not going to find it.\nIt is groping in the dark\nNot knowing what exactly you are searching for Where you are searching, how you are searching.\nOne is walking in deep sleep, leke a somnambulist. Everybody seeks bliss\nBut very few people have found it\nFor the simple reason that very few people Have searched for it consciously.\nTo be a sannyasin means Changing your search for bliss into a deliberate, conscious effort.\nSo from this very moment you have to seek bliss In a very conscious way: Watchful, alert, meditatively.\nAnd we have arranged every kind of device here To help you to become more alert, more watchful So that you don't go on falling asleep.\nSleep is your old habit\nIt takes a little time to get rid of it. But once you have got rid of it\nLife becomes a dance, a benediction.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #9\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2502","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2502 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

yourself Because you are also formless.</p><p>The body is not you, nor is the mind. You are the consciousness</p><p>Which has no form, no limitation. It is as vast as the sky.</p><p>A humble heart is one of the greatest virtues For one who is in

false feeling of separation Slowly slowly we become enclosed in

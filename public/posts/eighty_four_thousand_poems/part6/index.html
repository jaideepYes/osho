Your life becomes a drag.\nYou can't experience beauty You can't experience ecstasy You can't experience love.\nNo computer will ever be able to feel love 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Or to experience beauty or attain to ecstasy. The computer can do everything That Albert Einstein can do\nBut the computer cannot become enlightened. It cannot do that which only a Buddha can do. Humanity is dying, and dying so slowly\nThat we are not even becoming aware of it. The death is happening\nThrough a very slow poisoning.\nMan is transformed more and more into a biocomputer. Sannyas is a rebellion\nAgainst this whole nonsense.\nMy effort here is to bring to your notice That the heart is your real centre.\nDon't neglect it, don't be indifferent to it. Use the mind but don't be used by the mind. Use the mind as a beautiful machine:\nAs a car, as a computer, as a friend\nAs an air conditioner... but not more than that! Remain rooted in the heart\nFunction from the heart. Let feelings be decisive.\nHowsoever illogical they appear, let them be decisive And your life will have a dance of its own\nA beauty of its own, a bliss of its own A benediction of its own.\nOrdinarily people only think, they don't feel. Even when they say that they are feeling They are only thinking that they are feeling.\nThe mind has possessed everybody so totally that It has not left any space For the heart to function.\nThe mind is a dictator:\nIt has pushed the heart completely Out of existence.\nAnd the heart is your real treasure.\nGod cannot be thought, god can only be felt. Love cannot be thought, love can only be felt. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- All that is significant All that makes life meaningful Can only be felt.\nAnd we have stopped the heart from functioning. That is our misery, the root cause of our misery. My sannyasins have to change\nThis whole structure, the whole gestalt: Think less, feel more.\nSlowly slowly let the heart be the master\nAnd the mind, the servant -- that's its right place. It is good as a servant but very bad as a master.\nThe heart is always true. The heart is never untrue And the head is never true.\nThe head lives in lies, it lives on lies. It exists in all kinds of falsehoods.\nThe heart is authentic, it is sincere. It is simple, it is not cunning.\nIt is tremendously intelligent but not cunning.\nIt simply reflects that which is. That's its beauty and its truth.\nGod is never known through the head. Anything that has any value\nIs never known through the head. Love, beauty, god\nThey are all known through the heart. The heart is the gateless gate to reality. Move from the head to the heart.\nWe are all hung up in the head.\nThat is our only problem, the only one problem And there is only one solution: Get down from the head into the heart\nAnd all problems disappear. They are created by the head.\nAnd suddenly everything is so clear And so transparent that one is surprised\nHow one was continuously inventing problems. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Mysteries remain but problems disappear. Mysteries abound but problems evaporate. And mysteries are beautiful.\nThey are not to be solved They have to be lived.\nLove is the only nourishment for the soul. Without love the soul remains weak.\nJust as without food the body will be weak Love is food for the soul.\nThe ore you love, the stronger becomes your spirit.\nAnd the beauty of the strength that love brings Is that it is non-egoistic.\nOne can be strong, but if one becomes egoistic Then the whole point is missed. Egoistic strength is self-destructive\nBecause ego is your enemy.\nMaking it stronger is cutting your own throat. It is digging a ditch\nInto which you are going to fall.\nBut when your spirit becomes stronger Through love a miracle happens:\nEgo cannot function with love.\nThe first requirement of love is egolessness So the ego is cut from the very root.\nAnd when the spirit is strong without ego\nAnd overflowing with love, you have arrived home. God is no more a far-away phenomenon\nHe is as close as your own breathing. That's why Jesus says god is love.\nLoneliness is a negative state It is the negative aspect:\nYou are missing the other You are feeling empty\nYou are hankering for the other You are longing for the other.\nYou are nothing but a longing and a waiting Hence loneliness is misery.\nBut aloneness is joy, it is the positive aspect. You are not missing anybody,\nYou are feeling your own presence.\nYou are so full of your own presence that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- There is no question of missing anybody at all. Very few people know what aloneness is. Millions know what loneliness is.\nThat is very ordinary\nAs common as the common cold. Everybody suffers from loneliness.\nBut only a Jesus or a Buddha or a Lao Tzu reach to the highest peak of aloneness.\nThe same difference exists between Solitariness and solitude.\nSolitariness is ugly, solitude is beautiful. Solitariness is dark and dismal\nSolitude is full of light and joy and bliss.\nUnless one is absolutely present, alert and aware One will not know what aloneness or solitude are.\nThe only way to know them is meditation. Meditation is the method to transform Your loneliness into aloneness.\nAnd that is the greatest miracle That can happen to anybody: Darkness becomes luminous Emptiness becomes fulfilment.\nTo be in total rest is to be in prayer. Prayer has not to be done.\nIt is not an activity, it is absolute rest.\nOne can be in prayer but one cannot do prayer. Learn to relax.\nThe more relaxed you are, the closer you are To your innermost core\nBecause all activity is on the circumference. The centre of the cyclone.\nAnd it is at the centre That one realises oneself\nAnd one also discovers god.\nEvery human being brings a truth into the world. Every human being is a messenger of god,\nNot only Jesus Christ or Buddha or Zarathustra. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- They know they are. Others don't know that they are. But the moment you are born\nYou bring a truth in your being. And unless that truth is expressed You will not feel contented.\nUnless you deliver the message to the world You will feel a deep is comfort because\nYou are not fulfilling your duty towards god. You have to sing the song of your heart.\nYou have to dance your dance. You have to be utterly individual,\nNot an imitation, not a carbon copy.\nYou have to bring out your original face. The moment you are able to reveal Your original face to the world\nYour life is fulfilled. Tremendous joy arises out of it. The moon\nIs one of the most significant metaphors. It represents cool energy.\nThe sun is very hot, feverishly hot; it can burn. The moon is very soothing.\nThe sun is passion, mad passion. The moon is compassion.\nThe moon represents Buddha energy The energy of an enlightened one.\nOne has to move from the sun to the moon. We are all born with sun energy\nBecause we are born out of passion.\nWe have to transform passion into compassion. We have to bring this heated, feverish state\nOf our being to a calm and quiet and cool space. That's the whole endeavour of sannyas.\nSannyas is a process of surrendering the will Because the will\nIs nothing but an expression of the ego. And unless you surrender your will You can't allow god's will\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- To function through you. When you surrender your will When you drop it totally Then god's will\nCan start functioning through you. You become a vehicle.\nThat's what Jesus means when he says 'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done':\nNot mine but thine, not I but thou. That's the difference between\nAn ordinary person and a religious person:\nThe ordinary person is full of I and I and I. And the religious person\nIs full of thou, thou, thou.\nOnly a little difference on the surface but deep down There is the biggest difference\nAs big as one can imagine.\nRemember it: the will has to be dropped. It is difficult because we have been trained To cling to our will, to enforce it\nTo strengthen it.\nAnd there are stupid people around the world\nWho go on teaching how to increase your will-power. There are thousands of books in existence\nWhich sell in millions, teaching people\nHow will-power can be increased\nAnd how you can succeed in everything Through the will-power.\nIt is will-power that brings man\nTo utter frustration, to utter failure.\nMan has to be absolutely empty of his own power. That power trip has to be dropped.\nWhen you are empty\nAnd you can say 'Thy will be done' You have entered into a new path A new style of life.\nThat's what sannyas is all about. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- A song of joy Is exactly the definition of sannyas, Nothing more, nothing less.\nIt is precisely the definition: a song of joy. Sannyas is not renunciation\nIt is not against life, it is all for life.\nI don't divide the ordinary life From the spiritual life.\nThey are one, they are inseparably one.\nTo separate them is to create a split humanity A schizophrenic humanity. Life is a unity, an organic unity, indivisible.\nNothing is higher and nothing is lower. There is no hierarchy.\nEverything exists simultaneously On the same plane.\nSo nothing has to be renounced Nothing has to be rejected.\nOf course everything has to be transformed And transformed through love\nTransformed through bliss, transformed through joy. If you can bring dance to your life\nYou are a sannyasin.\nThere is no need to think of god There is no need to go to the churches And the temples.\nIf you can bring dance to your life\nIf each moment of your life can become a melody If it can become a rhythmic\nexperience\nThen god is bound to come to you. Everything is a gift.\nWe have not earned it, we don't even deserve it. Seeing a beautiful sunset\nHave you ever pondered over the matter:\nDo you deserve it?\nListening to a distant call of the cuckoo Have you ever thought: do you deserve it? Or the wind passing through the pine trees 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Or the river dancing towards the ocean And the sky full of stars... What have we done\nTo have this beautiful universe?\nWe have not paid for it, we are not worthy of it. It is out of this experience-\nThat we don't deserve it Yet it has been given to us-\nThat religious consciousness arises Gratitude arises.\nOne starts feeling tremendously grateful To the unknown hands, the invisible hands that have created this beautiful,\nThis tremendously, unbelievably Beautiful existence.\nIn that gratitude one is religious, Not by being a Christian or a Hindu Or a Mohammedan\nBut just by being grateful. Learn the art of being grateful.\nAnd there are so many situations Millions of them.\nEvery moment you come across something or other Which can make you feel immensely grateful.\nBut we have forgotten the language of gratefulness. Our minds go on complaining and complaining Asking for more.\nThe religious person has no complaint But only gratitude.\nHe does not ask for more.\nHe simply bows down to the unknown energy That has given so much already...\nAnd we had not asked for it.\nIt has been given out of god's abundance.\nHis overflowing delight is the cause of creation.\nIt is out of his blissfulness, his playfulness That existence has arisen. Remember:\nIf you can start feeling more and more grateful You will be transformed by that gratefulness.\nThat is the secret formula of inner change Of a radical change.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One needs to be industrious One needs to accept challenges which provoke one For the upward journey. It is hard, it is dangerous\nBut it brings out the best in you. It creates integrity\nUltimately it creates a soul in you.\nGeorges Gurdjieff used to say\nThat everybody is not born with a soul. He is right. Everybody is born only with The possibility of a soul;\nVery few actually attain it.\nTo actualize your being means tremendous effort.\nOne has to put one's total energies to the task Only then... One has to risk all, only then...\nBut then life blooms, flowers.\nIt becomes a joy, a fulfilment, a contentment A blessing.\nOsho asks Gogo, a young German: What is the meaning of your name? Are you a go-go boy?\nGogo: IT WAS THE FIRST WORD I SAID WHEN I WAS A BABY. MY PARENTS GAVE ME\nTHE NAME.\nOsho: No, it is beautiful -- it sounds good!\nIn fact this is the best German name I have come across! It has some poetry in it, some music in it, some laughter in it otherwise German names are so serious: Wolfgang... And in every name there is something concerned with war, battle... It is good -- be a go-go boy!...\nNow you have to make it a point To be constantly blissful.\nThat is the meaning of anand.\nLife should be a dance, a song, a celebration. And come back -- this is your home!\nMan is homeless in this world unless he finds god. Man is homeless unless he becomes enlightened Because only in ultimate awakening\nIs there shelter.\nOtherwise we go on passing From one caravanserai to another From one life to another.\nIt is a long, long weary pilgrimage Utterly futile, meaningless; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- We almost go on in circles Reaching nowhere, finding nothing; Always hoping, dreaming\nBut ultimately\nThere is only frustration in the hands. The home certainly exists\nBut only very few people have found it up to now. And the few who have found\nHave found it in the most unexpected place: They have found it within themselves.\nThat's why we remain homeless.

beautiful.</p><p>They are not to be solved They have to be lived.</p><p>Love is the only nourishment for the soul. Without love the soul
remains weak.</p><p>Just as without food the body will be weak Love is food for the
soul.</p><p>The ore you love, the stronger becomes your spirit.</p><p>And the beauty of the strength that love brings Is that it is
non-egoistic.</p><p>One can be strong, but if one becomes egoistic Then the whole point
is missed. Egoistic strength is self-destructive</p><p>Because ego is your enemy.</p><p>Making it stronger is cutting your own throat. It is digging a
ditch</p><p>Into which <em>you</em> are going to fall.</p><p>But when your spirit becomes stronger Through love a miracle
happens:</p><p>Ego cannot function with love.</p><p>The first requirement of love is egolessness So the ego is cut from
the very root.</p><p>And when the spirit is strong without ego</p><p>And overflowing with love, you have arrived home. God is no more a
far-away phenomenon</p><p>He is as close as your own breathing. That's why Jesus says god is
love.</p><p>Loneliness is a negative state It is the negative aspect:</p><p>You are missing the other You are feeling empty</p><p>You are hankering for the other You are longing for the other.</p><p>You are nothing but a longing and a waiting Hence loneliness is
misery.</p><p>But aloneness is joy, it is the positive aspect. You are not missing

of aloneness.</p><p>The same difference exists between Solitariness and solitude.</p><p>Solitariness is ugly, solitude is beautiful. Solitariness is dark and
dismal</p><p>Solitude is full of light and joy and bliss.</p><p>Unless one is absolutely present, alert and aware One will not know
what aloneness or solitude are.</p><p>The only way to know them is meditation. Meditation is the method to
transform Your loneliness into aloneness.</p><p>And that is the greatest miracle That can happen to anybody: Darkness
becomes luminous Emptiness becomes fulfilment.</p><p>To be in total rest is to be in prayer. Prayer has not to be
done.</p><p>It is not an activity, it is absolute rest.</p><p>One can be in prayer but one cannot do prayer. Learn to relax.</p><p>The more relaxed you are, the closer you are To your innermost
core</p><p>Because all activity is on the circumference. The centre of the

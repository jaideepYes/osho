It is for reference purposes only) Bliss is the most godly quality in existence\nAnd misery the most ungodly.\nBut the irony is that people remember god only When they are in misery. And that is the most difficult moment\nTo have any connection with god.\nYou are as distant from god as possible. In misery one becomes closed\nIn misery one becomes without windows\nThere is no opening and there is no possibility Of making a bridge with god. In bliss one opens up\nLike a lotus opening its petals.\nThen there is a communion with the sun And the wind and the rain.\nThe most precious moment\nIs when you are feeling blissful -- That is the time to remember god. But unfortunately that is the time When nobody remembers god.\nWho cares about god\nWhen you are feeling blissful? For what? This has to be remembered:\nWhen you are feeling blissful, That is the time to pray\nThat is the time to meditate.\nYou are as close to god as you ever will be. Just a little effort...\nAnd a sudden meeting and a sudden light And a sudden opening of the heart.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Make it a point not to remember god when you are in misery. The natural tendency\nIs to remember god when you are in misery. Millions of people remember god\nBut very few people have found him For the simple reason\nThat they remember him at the wrong time. Whenever you are feeling good, healthy Peaceful, happy, cheerful\nWhen you are feeling like dancing and singing that is the moment -- don't miss that moment! Make it a moment of prayer and remembrance And meditation\nAnd god will become a reality to you. Swami East West.\nJust West is half and just East is too And both have lived separately so long. You become the meeting place!\nMan will be total only when East and West meet. My sannyasins have to become a synthesis.\nThey have to absorb\nAll that is beautiful in the East\nAnd all that is beautiful in the West. There is much\nWhich both the hemispheres have contributed But there is much which is ugly too\nAnd the ugly has to be dropped. And if they remain separate The ugly cannot be dropped.\nThat is something to be understood. The West is basically\nScientific, materialistic, objective. Nothing is wrong in being scientific\nBut to think that science is the end is wrong.\nNothing is wrong in knowing the secrets of matter But to think that by knowing matter\nYou have known all that is worth knowing Is absolutely wrong.\nBut if the West remains the West\nThen that is going to continue, that old idea\nOf the materialistic, objective, scientific approach. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The East believes in and has experienced too Something more than matter, but it became So infatuated with that something more That it simply became indifferent to matter, Which is wrong.\nThat's why the East is suffering so much From poverty, starvation, disease:\nFor the simple reason that the East\nHas given its total attention to the spiritual, Neglecting the material.\nIt is religious, it is mystical, it is subjective But at the cost of being scientific. It goes beyond science\nBut science is needed, it is a must. There is a great difference Between a song and a pice of bread\nIn fact there seems to be no connection.\nBut if you are hungry, the song will disappear. The song is possible only\nWhen you are not hungry When your body is satisfied;\nOnly then\nDo higher satisfactions become possible. The East has to learn\nWestern materialism and the scientific approach And the West has to learn Eastern mysticism and the subjective approach.\nThen only can the whole man be created. In my vision, up to now the whole man Has not existed; he has yet to come.\nAnd my sannyasins have to become\nThe herald of the new man, of the whole man. Man can know god only\nIf he is utterly vulnerable, soft and tender Almost feminine.\nOnly then can you soak up the presence of god Only then can you allow it to sink deep\nInto your being. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- God surrounds you, god is everywhere But we are so hard, impenetrable, rocklike\nAnd we go on asking, 'Where is god? What is the proof?'\nTo the person who lives\nIn a rocklike, enclosed existence,\nEncapsulated in hardness, god cannot be proved Because god is not an argument It is an experience.\nYou have to be very soft, utterly soft. Then there is no need to ask for the proof.\nEach moment there are a thousand and one proofs. Wherever you turn you will find god Encountering you, facing you:\nIn the sun, in the moon, in the flowers In the birds, in people, in animals.\nOnce you are soft god is everywhere. If you are hard god is nowhere.\nAll depends on your being soft. Dhyan means meditation.\nRosie has two meanings; one is German. That you have to avoid, that you have to drop completely; it means horse.\nBut that's how the German language is: so many wolves\nand so many horses, bears... and all kinds of things\nI have to come across every day! Remember the Latin meanings.\nThe Latin meanings are very beautiful.\nThere are two -- one: the flower rose, and the second: giver of love -- which are both beautiful.\nMeditation will help your heart to become a rose. Ordinarily the heart is like a bud\nAs if the rose is closed.\nWhen you start becoming a little more aware A little more silent, a little more peaceful That bud starts opening its petals.\nAnd when the rose opens, fragrance is released. When your heart releases its fragrance\nThat is love.\nThe heart is a rose 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And the open heart is a giver of love. It gives for the sheer joy of giving. Wen love becomes a joy in itself, Not as a means to get something But as an end unto itself\nThen life is fulfilled.\nThen love is synonymous with god Then they don't mean different things. Jesus says god is love, and he is right And he is the first person\nIn the whole history of humanity Who has said it so clearly.\nSonja has four meanings\nAll the meanings come from different languages and yet are interrelated The Greek meaning is wisdom,\nthe Persian meaning is purity, the Hebrew meaning is a seer, the Hindi meaning is golden. Wisdom arises out of purity.\nIt arises out of innocence.\nAnd when wisdom arises you become a seer You start seeing things\nWhich you have never seen before. For the first time you have eyes.\nBefore it you were blind.\nAnd this is the most golden experience. So start with the Persian meaning:\nBecome innocent.\nAnd the Greek meaning\nWill come out of that innocence; wisdom. And it will open you closed eyes --\nThat is the Hebrew meaning: You will become a seer. The whole experience is the most precious one.\nThat is the Hindi meaning. It is the ultimate experience The golden experience.\nOne of the greatest meditations is\nTo be contented with everything as it is. Naturally, the mind starts stopping..\nThe mind can live only in discontent. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- In contentment it dies\nIt cannot survive with contentment. Create the climate of contentment And mind surely dies, inevitably dies. Essentially you are divine\nSo anything that happens to you Is only a passing moment -- Don't be distracted by it.\nIf it is pleasure, watch it. If it is pain, watch it.\nPleasure passes, pain passes. These are just like clouds\nMoving in the infinite sky of your being. The sky is not affected by the clouds.\nThey may be dark clouds\nThey may be beautiful white clouds\nIt doesn't matter -- the sky remains unscratched. To remember that 'I am god'\nMeans to remember 'I am the sky.'\nAnd all the experiences that happen in life Are like small clouds: they come and go.\nThey are not worth paying much attention to. Take no notice. Let that be your meditation. Remember always\nYou are the sky, the infinite sky No clouds can distort you.\nSlowly slowly the clouds will not come to you. They never come uninvited.\nYou may not have invited the pain\nBut you invite the pleasure, and the pain Is the other side of the same phenomenon:\nInvite one and the other comes.\nThey cannot be divorced, they are always together. When you stop inviting them\nThese guests start disappearing.\nSoon a moment comes when you remain unclouded And that's what Buddha calls nirvana\nAnd Jesus calls the kingdom of god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- God is available only to the wise ones Never to the knowledgeable ones. The ignorant person may know god But the knowledgeable person cannot.\nThat is impossible, that has never happened.\nThe knowledgeable thinks that he already knows And he knows nothing, he is deceiving himself.\nHe lives in a great deception. The seeker of truth\nFirst has to destroy all deceptions\nAnd the fundamental deception is that 'I know.' The seeker of truth has to start\nFrom a state of not-knowing, of 'I don't know.' He is neither a believer nor a non-believer\nHe is neither a theist nor an atheist He is neither Hindu nor Christian -- He cannot be!\nHow can a seeker become identified With any ideology?\nHe keeps himself free. He is ready to enquire But he remains unprejudiced.\nThat's what I call a state of not-knowing.\nHe always functions from a state of not-knowing And this state of not-knowing Slowly grows into wisdom.\nWisdom does not come\nFrom scriptures or from others. It grows within you.\nIf you are capable\nOf keeping yourself undeceived by the mind Wisdom is bound to happen.\nIt is your intrinsic nature\nWe just never give it an opportunity. We go on stuffing in knowledge\nSo there is no space for the wisdom to grow. Throw all knowledge out\nMake yourself spacious enough For the wisdom to take place For the wisdom to happen.\nAnd it is wisdom\nThat brings you ultimately to god. Meditation\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Is only a negative method: it simply helps you To throw the knowledge out, that's all.\nIt is like medicine:\nMedicine simply throws the disease out, It does not help you to be healthy.\nHealth arises in you -- that is your nature.\nMedicine only keeps the disease out\nt cuts the roots of the disease, that's all, Then your nature starts functioning.\nWhen your nature starts functioning Then health is not difficult\nIt is a natural outcome. So is wisdom: it is health. Meditation is medicine.\nIt keeps the disease of knowledge out of you It prevents the disease from getting in\nFrom getting roots in you From making roads in you.\nIt uproots the weeds, and once the soil is clean Roses start sprouting of their own accord.\nThe ultimate music does not consist of sounds\nIt consists of silence.\nIt does not consist of words It is utterly wordless.\nIt has nothing to do with any instrument. The Zen people call it\nThe sound of one hand clapping.\nThat is impossible: one hand cannot create sound. You will need two things;\nOnly then, by friction, can sound be created. But one hand can create silence\nAnd that is the meaning of the Zen expression. And silence is more musical than any sound.\nIn taoist circles in China it is said\nThat when the musician becomes perfect He throws away his instruments.\nWhen the archer becomes perfect\nHe throws away his bow and arrows -- They are only for the beginners\nFor those who are trying to learn. But when one becomes a master Then nothing is needed.\nOne's own being is enough unto itself. It is the music, the music of all music. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is the poetry, the poetry of all poetry. It is the art of all art.\nSeek and search for it -- it is not far away. You just have to learn\nHow to dive within yourself.\nAnd that's what meditation is all about.

nowhere.</p><p>All depends on your being soft. Dhyan means meditation.</p><p>Rosie has two meanings; one is German. That you have to avoid, that
you have to drop completely; it means horse.</p><p>But that's how the German language is: so many wolves</p><p>and so many horses, bears... and all kinds of things</p><p>I have to come across every day! Remember the Latin meanings.</p><p>The Latin meanings are very beautiful.</p><p>There are two -- one: the flower rose, and the second: giver of love
-- which are both beautiful.</p><p>Meditation will help your heart to become a rose. Ordinarily the
heart is like a bud</p><p>As if the rose is closed.</p><p>When you start becoming a little more aware A little more silent, a
little more peaceful That bud starts opening its petals.</p><p>And when the rose opens, fragrance is released. When your heart
releases its fragrance</p><p>That is love.</p><p>The heart is a rose 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--and-the-open-heart-is-a-giver-of-love.>Osho's

interrelated The Greek meaning is wisdom,</p><p>the Persian meaning is purity, the Hebrew meaning is a seer, the
Hindi meaning is golden. Wisdom arises out of purity.</p><p>It arises out of innocence.</p><p>And when wisdom arises you become a seer You start seeing things</p><p>Which you have never seen before. For the first time you have
eyes.</p><p>Before it you were blind.</p><p>And this is the most golden experience. So start with the Persian
meaning:</p><p>Become innocent.</p><p>And the Greek meaning</p><p>Will come out of that innocence; wisdom. And it will open you closed
eyes --</p><p>That is the Hebrew meaning: You will become a seer. The whole
experience is the most precious one.</p><p>That is the Hindi meaning. It is the ultimate experience The golden
experience.</p><p>One of the greatest meditations is</p><p>To be contented with everything as it is. Naturally, the mind starts

the clouds.</p><p>They may be dark clouds</p><p>They may be beautiful white clouds</p><p>It doesn't matter -- the sky remains unscratched. To remember that 'I
am god'</p><p>Means to remember 'I am the sky.'</p><p>And all the experiences that happen in life Are like small clouds:
they come and go.</p><p>They are not worth paying much attention to. Take no notice. Let that
be your meditation. Remember always</p><p>You are the sky, the infinite sky No clouds can distort you.</p><p>Slowly slowly the clouds will not come to you. They never come
uninvited.</p><p>You may not have invited the pain</p><p>But you invite the pleasure, and the pain Is the other side of the
same phenomenon:</p><p>Invite one and the other comes.</p><p>They cannot be divorced, they are always together. When you stop
inviting them</p><p>These guests start disappearing.</p><p>Soon a moment comes when you remain unclouded And that's what Buddha

Hence no religious person\nCan be Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan. These names are just political strategies Political games in the name of religion.\nTrue religion has no adjectives True religion is simply like love.\nCan love be Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan? Can joy be Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan? Can beauty be Hindu, Christian or Mohammedan? It would be nonsense to talk of Hindu beauty\nOr Hindu love or Hindu joy. The same is true about religion.\nTrue religion is not religion at all But a feeling of religiousness\nA feeling of gratitude towards the whole. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- My effort here is to help you to be religious. I teach a religionless religion, a godless god. That you are becoming a sannyasin\nIs enough to prove your courage. To be with me is dangerous.\nIt has always been so:\nTo be with any master is dangerous. While the master is alive it is dangerous\nWhen the master is dead it is very convenient.\nWhen Jesus was alive\nThere were only a few people with him Very courageous ones.\nBut after his death thousands gathered. Now almost half of the earth is Christian. But it is pointless.\nWhen the master is dead you can worship And you can enjoy the feeling\nThat you are religious But you are not religious.\nReligion transpires only when the master is alive. It is something that happens\nBetween an alive master and the disciple.\nIt can't happen when the master has disappeared And to be with me is even more courageous\nThan to be with Jesus or to be with Buddha Because they were still talking\nIn terms of tradition\nThey were still using the past heritage. The time has come for humanity\nTo be discontinuous with the past.\nIt is absolutely disgusting!\nWe have to disconnect ourselves from the past Only then is there a future\nOtherwise humanity on this earth is finished. Within these twenty years it will be decided:\nEither\nWe disconnect ourselves from the ugly past, Then there is a future and there is hope, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Or We cling to the dead past and we die with it. Just as there is a sun on the outside\nThere is a sun inside too.\nThe outside sun rises and sets\nBut the inside sun is always there.\nIt never rises, it never sets -- it is eternal. Unless we know the inner light\nAnd the source of it We live in darkness.\nMake every possible effort to move inwards. In the beginning it is arduous\nBut only in the beginning.\nIt is just like learning any art.\nLearning to swim is difficult in the beginning But once you know the knack of it It is so easy that one wonders later on\nWhy it was so difficult.\nOne can simply float in the river. No need to do anything.\nAnd that's how it starts happening inside: Just in the beginning there is\nA little effort involved, a little struggle. Soon one can simply float\nIn the river that moves inwards. And it takes you\nTo deeper and deeper realms af bliss\nTo more and more light, to eternity, to god. Diligence is what is needed to be a sannyasin. Only two things are needed:\nIntelligence and diligence.\nIntelligence without diligence is impotent.\nDiligence without intelligence is blind. One is not enough, both have to be together Only then is your life enriched.\nSo be intelligently diligent. Act, but act through awareness.\nDo a thousand and one things in life\nBut don't be controlled by unconscious instincts. Then slowly slowly life becomes\nSuch a divine experience. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is delicious! But one has to learn the art of tasting it. And all other arts are small\nCompared to the art of living.\nThese two things have to be remembered: Be intelligent and be diligent.\nThey very rarely happen together. Intelligent people are not diligent Then their intelligence is\nJust an exercise in futility.\nThey go on thinking and thinking and thinking And by thinking nothing is ever achieved.\nAnd then there are people who are very diligent But without any intelligence. They go on doing harm to others and to themselves.\nThey do much, but not knowing what they are doing They are bound to create more misery in the world For themselves and for others too.\nRemember this\nThat these two things have to be two aspects Simultaneous aspects of your growth.\nAnd then life starts growing so fast\nThat in moments one can make quantum leaps. Egolessness is the goal of all meditation.\nThat is the goal of sannyas itself. the ego is the only problem\nAnd then it creates a thousand and one problems. It creates greed, it creates anger\nIt creates lust, it creates jealousy And so on, so forth.\nAnd people go on fighting\nWith greed, with anger, with lust\nBut it is futile. Unless the root is cut\nNew branches will always be coming up.\nYou can go on pruning the branches and leaves. That is not going to help.\nIn fact by your pruning\nThe tree will become more and more thick The foliage will become more and more thick. The tree will become stronger.\nMy insistence is: don't fight with the symptoms Go to the very root of the matter And that is simply one -- it is the ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Cut it from there and all other problems Disappear as if they had never existed before. If you can learn only one thing here\nJust to be without an ego To be as if one is not\nTo be a nobody, a nothingness Then the ultimate is achieved.\nThere is no higher goal than that. And it can easily be done\nBecause ego is a false phenomenon Hence it can be dropped.\nIt is not a real thing.\nIt is imaginary, it is a shadow.\nIf you go on believing in it, it is. If you look deeply into it\nIt is not found at all. Meditation simply means\nLooking deeply inside for the ego\nSearching every nook and corner of your being For where it is.\nIt is not found anywhere.\nThe moment it is not found anywhere It is finished and you are born anew. My effort here is\nTo teach you not righteousness, but awareness. As awareness deepens, righteousness comes But it does not become an ego trip.\nIt can't become an ego trip\nBecause the first condition for awareness Is the dropping of the ego.\nIf one is not aware and tries to be righteous Then naturally\nThat righteousness will be exploited by the ego. It will make you a puritan\nA moralist, a pious egoist. And that is far more dangerous Than the ordinary ego.\nThe ordinary ego is easy to drop\nBut the spiritual ego is very difficult to drop Because it is very subtle, it goes deep in you.\nIt has to be uprooted from your very depth. The ordinary ego is only on the surface\nIt is very easily removeable. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Hence I don't teach righteousness I teach awareness\nAnd righteousness comes of its own accord.\nOnly the wise can be settled.\nThe unwise man is always restless.\nThe unwise is always running hither and thither Knowing not where he wants to go\nWhy he wants to go\nKnowing nothing, he feels he has to do something. He can't sit silently.\nIt is impossible for him to sit silently. The greatest difficulty for him\nIs to do nothing. Only the wise man\nIs capable of living a settled life. Wisdom arises out of meditation.\nIt is a fragrance of the flower of meditation. Then one is always at home wherever one is And always at rest\nAnd life starts having roots in existence Hence a feeling of settlement...\nAll the chaos\nAnd the smoke of the chaos disappear. Instead there arises a clarity.\nYou can see things as they are and you can act accordingly.\nAnd any act coming out of wisdom is liberating. Purity has nothing to do with morality.\nA moral person is never pure. The pure person is always moral. Morality is pseudo, it is imposed\nIt is cultivated, it is a facade, it is a mask. It does not really purify you\nIt only paints purity on your face. It makes you a good actor.\nAnd you have to be very alert about it Because the Japanese culture\nMakes people very good actors. For centuries Japan\nHas lived with a beautiful facade. People are taught to smile.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Even when they could hit you, they smile. It is a very polished culture, but very false. One has to be more authentic.\nA little uncivilisedness is not bad\nIf it brings your natural flavour back to you. And there is a different kind of purity,\nThe true purity.\nIt always comes from meditation. It is nothing to do with morality. It comes from inner silence.\nAs you become\nMore and more silent and centred inside Your life starts having an aura of purity. But that is a by-product.\nYou are not cultivating it\nIt is happening of its own accord.\nWhen these things happen of their own accord They have a beautiful colour, shape, form.\nWhen they are cultivated they are ugly. Thomas was one of the disciples of Jesus -- One of the twelve apostles.\nHe has become well-known\nAs 'Doubting Thomas'.\nThis time, please don't do that! The name Thomas is beautiful.\nIt has to be relieved of the burden of doubt. Literally it means a seeker of truth.\nBut one cannot seek truth If one is full of doubt;\nIt is impossible.\nDoubt is not a bridge, it is a barrier. It is not a bridge, it is a wall;\nIt closes you.\nIt does not make you available to the truth That is present everywhere.\nAnd because you are constantly doubting You cannot act; doubt is impotent.\nAction needs trust; only a man of trust can act. And the journey towards truth\nIs the greatest act of life. Tremendous trust is needed. So try!\nLast time you missed -- This time don't miss it!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Rest, relaxation has to be your path. Relax and rest more and more int yourself. Don't be in a hurry.\nThere is no need to be in a hurry. the whole eternity is available\nIt is all ours.\nDon't be impatient. Enjoy each moment. Enjoy it totally\nWithout any worry about the future. The best moments are those\nWhen you are utterly relaxed. Doing nothing, sitting silently\nSpring comes and the grass grows by itself. Man ordinarily gathers dust around his being And loses the brightness which is his birthright. Everybody is born bright\nAnd everybody becomes mediocre.\nBy the time one dies, one is almost stupid.\nThis is a strange phenomenon.\nAnd people call it evolution -- it is involution. Children are more bright, more alive\nMore clear about everything Without any confusion.\nAs they start growing\nThey start gathering confusion from everywhere.\nWe wait until they become twenty-one years of age Then we give them the right to vote\nBecause be that time everybody loses brightness Everybody becomes dull, stupid.\nThen you are called adult. You are really adulterated Completely adulterated\nBut people say 'now you have become adult You have come of age.'\nCertainly politicians are afraid To give voting rights to children\nBecause they will see through and through. Voting rights can be given to you\nOnly when you have lost all capacity to see, When you are utterly blind.\nMy effort here 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Is to help you to drop your rust, your dust To cleanse your mirror\nSo you can again be your original face. Just as a river dissolves into the ocean Dissolve into the divine.\nDon't think yourself separate from existence.\nMeet, merge more and more. We go on insisting that we are separate. That is the only irreligious act:\nTo emphasise Separation.\nTo emphasise unity is religion.\nIt has to become a conscious effort. Seeing a sunset, dissolve into it.\nDon't just remain an observer\nLet the observer and observed become one. Slowly slowly you will learn the knack of it.\nThen sitting by the side of a tree you can have A deep feeling of unity with the\ntree.\nAnd these small experiments can lead you Ultimately to feel oneness with the whole. And that experience is god.\nMy sannyasins have to become songs. They have to learn playfulness\nLight-heartedness, a sense of humour. And they have to learn how to rejoice In the small things of life.\nThere are no great things in life Life consists of small things.\nBut if you know how to rejoice in them You transform them into great things.\nIn the hands of a Buddha\nEven ordinary water becomes wine. That's exactly the meaning of the miracle That is said to have been done by Jesus: That he turned water into wine.\nOnly fools think that it is literally true. It is symbolically true.\nIn the hands of Jesus water is wine.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You can get drunk on simple, pure water. It depends on how you drink. It does not depend on the drink It depends on the drinker.\nAnd I am telling you from my experience. I don't mix soda and whisky\nI mix soda and soda -- and it works!

small</p><p>Compared to the art of living.</p><p>These two things have to be remembered: Be intelligent and be
diligent.</p><p>They very rarely happen together. Intelligent people are not diligent
Then their intelligence is</p><p>Just an exercise in futility.</p><p>They go on thinking and thinking and thinking And by thinking nothing
is ever achieved.</p><p>And then there are people who are very diligent But without any
intelligence. They go on doing harm to others and to themselves.</p><p>They do much, but not knowing what they are doing They are bound to
create more misery in the world For themselves and for others too.</p><p>Remember this</p><p>That these two things have to be two aspects Simultaneous aspects of
your growth.</p><p>And then life starts growing so fast</p><p>That in moments one can make quantum leaps. Egolessness is the goal

creates anger</p><p>It creates lust, it creates jealousy And so on, so forth.</p><p>And people go on fighting</p><p>With greed, with anger, with lust</p><p>But it is futile.

of the matter And that is simply one -- it is the ego.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--cut-it-from-there-and-all-other-problems>Osho's

righteousness comes But it does not become an ego trip.</p><p>It can't become an ego trip</p><p>Because the first condition for awareness Is the dropping of the
ego.</p><p>If one is not aware and tries to be righteous Then naturally</p><p>That righteousness will be exploited by the ego. It will make you a

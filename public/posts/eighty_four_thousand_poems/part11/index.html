It is for reference purposes only.]\nLove is the door to the divine. It is the only way\nTo relate oneself to the ultimate.\nBut before you can know what love is\nYou have to go through many purifications Because what is ordinarily known as love Is not only love,\nMany other things are mixed in it.\nIt is very much polluted, it is not pure. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Maybe one per cent of it is love But ninety-nine per cent is something else. And that ninety-nine per cent\nIs dominating, overpowering, overwhelming. The one per cent is crushed, destroyed\nBy that ninety-nine per cent.\nOne has to drop that ninety-nine per cent. There is so much jealousy in your love And jealousy is poison.\nThere is so much possessiveness in your love And possessiveness is destructive.\nLove is a very delicate flower And to be possessive\nMeans throwing a rock on the flower. There is a deep desire to dominate the other It is very unconscious, but it is there\nAnd it is very powerful.\nThen love becomes just a facade and behind it You are just on an ego trip.\nAnd the same is also the case\nWith the person with whom you are in love. So quarrel arises, fighting arises.\nBoth become destructive to each other. After a few experiences of love affairs\nOne becomes weary, tired. One starts feeling That love is the greatest nuisance in life.\nOne feels one's fingers are burnt One starts avoiding it.\nThat's what is happening in the West. People are going far more towards pure sex And avoiding love, because at least pure sex\nDoes not have that much trouble, it is simple. Of course it cannot take you to the heights But neither does your so called love\nTake you to the heights. On the contrary\nYour so-called love takes you to such hells. Sex cannot take you to such hells either.\nIt simply keeps you healthy.\nIt is hygienic, healthy, normal.\nIt keeps you a fit animal, that's all.\nIt has always happened in the past also:\nWhenever a society allows freedom for love People become tired of love\nBecause in the name of love\nSo much ugliness starts happening that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- People start leaning towards pure sex. It seems more convenient, more comfortable With no risk.\nIt can be purchased easily. It is sellable, purchasable.\nLove cannot be sold and cannot be purchased. It is not a commodity.\nSex is a commodity\nIt is part of our materialistic world. Either this happens or\nSociety becomes very repressive towards love And forces marriage upon people\nSo that they stick to one person\nAnd that too not for love but for other reasons: For progeny, to give birth to children\nSo that they can take care of your properties When you are no more\nAnd they can carry your name down the ages. Love is no more a consideration\nBecause people have become so afraid of it. People think of the family, of richness\nOf culture, of education, of nobility, aristocracy And all kinds of things. They consult astrologers and palmists\nBut they don't think of love at all They avoid love.\nThey take everything else into consideration Except love -- that's what an arranged marriage is. So these two things happen again and again.\nWhenever love is free\nWhenever there is more freedom Society becomes tired of love.\nPeople start moving towards sex.\nThen sooner or later they become tired of sex too Because it is unfulfilling. Then they fall back upon the old patterns.\nAgain they forget the old lessons They decide to go into marriage.\nThis is how it moves in a vicious circle. India has completed th circle manu times\nBecause it is one of the most ancient societies. Many times it has seen freedom of love\nMany times it has seen freedom of sex. Then a puritanical, repressive society Then again a rebellion.\nAnd the same thing goes on and on.\nBut the reason, the basic reason nobody looks for. The basic reason is not love\nThe basic reason is that love 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Is mixed with other things. We have to learn to drop those other things. Love is beautiful\nLove is the greatest gift of god. But it is like a raw phenomenon.\nIt has to be polished, refined, cut. It is like a diamond:\nMuch has to be done before people can know Its beauty and its splendour.\nAnd that's my whole work here:\nTo help you refine your raw love\nInto a refined, polished, cultured phenomenon So that it can become\nA source of upliftment for your soul\nSo that it can become a door to the divine. Compassion is the transformation of passion. Passion is using the other as a means\nFor your own fulfilment.\nCompassion is sharing your being, your joy Your bliss, your love, with others\nFor the sheer joy of sharing\nBecause each individual is an end unto himself. No individual should be used as a means.\nThat is cruelty, that is animality.\nCompassion is the highest form of your energy And passion, the lowest form of your energy.\nThe same energy passing through meditation Becomes compassion.\nMeditation is the transforming force. And when a person lives in compassion He lives in pure love.\nThat is true prayer, true godliness. There is no other god than that purity\nWhich love brings, which compassion brings. God is only a symbol\nThat represents many beautiful things. Freedom, love, bliss, truth, compassion All that is valuable\nAll that has intrinsic value\nIs represented by the name god. God is not a person at all 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is the ultimate crescendo Of all the beautiful qualities of life Of all the virtues, of all the values.\nAnd compassion is one of the most important, The most significant parts,\nTo be evolved by the seeker.\nBe friendly, be loving, be compassionate. Help in every possible way that you can And you will be helped.\nAnd you will be helped a thousandfold!\n-- What is the meaning of your name, Maji?\n-- It came to me in a dream. It's good.\nIn Hindi 'maji' means the boatman, the ferryman One who takes you to the other shore.\nAnand means bliss -- a blissful boatman. Everybody has to take himself to the other shore. He has to be a boat for himself.\nHe is the boat and he is the boatman too. They are not separate.\nAnd once you have been to the other shore You can help others also.\nThose who go to the other shore And never come back\nAnd forget all about this shore Are called Arhatas.\nThose who come back to help others To show the way\nAre called Bodhisatvas.\nThey create bigger boats so many people Can be taken to the other shore.\nWhen Buddha died\nHis religion was divided into two parts.\nIt was bound to happen because the Arhats Behaved in a totally different way.\nThey wouldn't help.\nAnd the Bodhisatvas were so concerned For others, for their misery\nThat they were ready\nTo go make any sacrifice, to go through any suffering To help others. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- These two sections were known as Hinayana The section that belonged to the Arhats\nWas called Hinayana; the small boat people. The boat is so small, only you can sit in it You cannot carry anybody else in it.\nAnd the other section was called Mahayana: The great boat people.\nThey created big ships\nSo thousands could be taken to the other shore. First become a boat for yourself\nAnd then you can decide\nWether to come back to this shore Or forget all about it!\nA beautiful name has come in your dream! The lion represents two things.\nOne: it never moves in a crowd.\nIt is always alone, it loves solitude.\nIt is an individual, utterly an individual. It is not like sheep.The sheep can exist Only with the crowd, with the mob.\nAlone it is very frightened Alone it is very nervous.\nIt does not know what to do, where to go.\nIt depends on the crowd to be led, to be guided. And the irony is\nThat others are also dependent on the same crowd. So everybody is dependent on everybody else Thinking that others know better.\nThey all live in an illusion. But that's the situation\nOf the ordinary human being too.\nThey live as part of the mob psychology They don't have their own psyche yet.\nHindu -- yes, Mohammedan -- yes, Christian -- yes But it is very rare to find an individual.\nThey can become Communistic very easily. That is another crowd.\nMy sannyasins have to be individuals. Each sannyasin has to depend on himself. That's why I am not giving\nDetailed instructions to you\nSo you cannot depend on anything. You have to fall upon yourself.\nSometimes it looks cruel\nBut that's the only compassionate way to help: 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Unless you are thrown back again and again You are not going to be an individual You will remain part of a crowd.\nYou can change crowds, that's not difficult. You can change your affiliations, your labels But the basic thing is missing:\nYou don't have an independent soul. The lion represents individuality.\nAnd secondly\nThe lion represents immense courage. It never escapes from any challenge. It may die but\nIt will not turn its back.\nIt is better to die than to be a coward.\nTo be a coward is a far uglier phenomenon. Death is not ugly.\nDeath can be beautiful if you die courageously. If you die accepting a challenge\nJoyously, dancingly,\nAs Socrates died, as Jesus died, as Mansoor died, It is one of the most beautiful phenomena On the earth.\nDeath depends on you.\nIf you are a coward even life is ugly What to say about death?\nIf you are courageous even death is beautiful What to say about life?\nSo remember these two things.\nBe an individual and be absolutely courageous. That's the way of sannyas:\nIndividuality and courage. Unless one is ready to risk all One cannot find god.\nGod is freedom.\nFreedom is another name for god And a far better name!\nThe priests have used god to create a slavery In people's minds. In the name of god\nThey have exploited humanity for centuries. Hence I insist again and again\nThat god is freedom, religion is freedom. And if anything makes you a slave\nThen its not religion\nAnd it has nothing to do with god. Let freedom be the criterion 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Always judge be freedom. Whatever gives you freedom Will make you more religious. And whatever gives you freedom Will bring you closer to god.\nAnd when you are capable of being totally free You become one with god. Hence in India we don't talk\nAbout the ultimate as god, but as moksha. Moksha means absolute freedom.\nBuddha never talked about god. Mahavira never mentioned god For the simple reason that they saw\nWhat priests have done in the name of god.\nThey only talked about freedom.\nSo be free -- free from all traditions Free from all dogmas, free from all churches Free from all priests, scriptures\nFree from all ideologies.\nAnd start living in freedom -- that's sannyas. To live in freedom is sannyas.\n-- What is the meaning of your name?\n-- It's a short form of a name of a magic mushroom.\n-- Mm! That's good. That's perfectly good! Now you will be an orange mushroom!\nAn orange mushroom becomes more magical, it becomes more psychedelic. Good, Swami Filpz -- be psychedelic!\nEnjoy life like a drunkard.\nAnd there is no higher psychedelic Than meditation.\nThere is no greater magic than meditation Because it releases your inner sources\nOf tremendous joy, insight. It makes life colourful\nIt makes life a dreamland.\nIn fact it is because of meditation\nAnd a desire for deeper experiences Of one's own being\nThat people are attracted to magic mushrooms And marijuana and hashish and alcohol.\nAnd from the very ancient days, even in\nThe ancientmost scripture of the world, Rigveda They talk about a certain mushroom called soma.\nAnd the ancient seers were mad about soma. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Aldous Huxley has said When LSD is perfected totally It should be again called soma. His suggestion is beautiful.\nBut he was in an illusion:\nHe thought that by taking LSD\nHe was experiencing the same ecstasy\nAs Buddha experienced and Kabir experienced And Al Hillaj experienced.\nThere he was wrong.\nIt was not the same ecstasy. What he was experiencing\nWas just a chemical imitation of it A chemical carbon copy of it.\nIt was a deception. It was not real gold. It was glittering like gold.\nBut it was not real gold.\nReal gold has to be found within oneself. You cannot take it in from the outside.\nAnd it is already there. Every being is born\nWith an infinite capacity to be ecstatic But we never search for it.\nWe always go for cheaper things. They are easier and available,\nYou can purchase them and you can inject them. Meditation seems to be a long long journey.\nAnd we are in such a hurry.\nDrop the impatient mind and search within And become as silent as possible.\nYou will come across a source of nectar in you Which is the greatest magic in\nthe world\nBecause it releases\nThe most miraculous experiences in you It opens the doors af all the mysteries.\nMind lives in time.\nMind divides reality into past, present and future. Mind functions like a prism.\nA ray of light passing through a prism Becomes divided into seven colours. That's how the rainbow is created.\nThe rainbow is created by small raindrops Hanging in the air.\nThey function like a prism:\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Sunrays passing through those raindrops Become divided. Otherwise sunrays are white. But once the white ray passes through a prism It goes through a great division, a great split.\nIt becomes seven.\nIn the same way mind functions like a prism. Eternity passing through the mind becomes time. It is divided into three:\nPast present and future.\nBut the whole thing is illusory.\nYou cannot catch hold of a rainbow. It is empty, there is nothing.\nSo is time: time is empty, there is nothing.\nOne has to go beyond the mind to know the real. The real is eternal, the real is always now.\nThe real is never past, never future It is always present.\nAnd that's the beauty of meditation: It brings you to the present.\nSlowly slowly you settle into the present. You settle in your own being\nSo silently that you forget\nAll about the past and the future.\nAnd this moment becomes so overwhelming So tremendously overwhelming\nThat there is nothing beyond it.\nTo know this moment's totality is to know god. To go beyond time is to go into god.\nTo remain in time is to remain in mind. Meditation means getting out of the mind. Mind is synonymous with no-time.\nGet out of mind and time.\nRest and relax into the now and here So totally that nothing else is left:\nNo dust of the past, no smoke of the future. In that clarity, in that transparent clarity You become able to see that which is.\nIn fact god is an ancient symbol. G used to stand for that\nO for which, and D for is.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is a code word for that which is.

become</p><p>A source of upliftment for your soul</p><p>So that it can become a door to the divine. Compassion is the
transformation of passion. Passion is using the other as a means</p><p>For your own fulfilment.</p><p>Compassion is sharing your being, your joy Your bliss, your love,
with others</p><p>For the sheer joy of sharing</p><p>Because each individual is an end unto himself. No individual should
be used as a means.</p><p>That is cruelty, that is animality.</p><p>Compassion is the highest form of your energy And passion, the lowest
form of your energy.</p><p>The same energy passing through meditation Becomes compassion.</p><p>Meditation is the transforming force. And when a person lives in
compassion He lives in pure love.</p><p>That is true prayer, true godliness. There is no other god than that
purity</p><p>Which love brings, which compassion brings. God is only a symbol</p><p>That represents many beautiful things. Freedom, love, bliss, truth,

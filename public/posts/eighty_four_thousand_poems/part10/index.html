It contains all that is precious in life\nAll that is valuable.\nThat which is not contained in love Is not of any worth.\nLet love be your religion, your god.\nWorship love -- and the only way to worship love Is to be loving.\nBe loving to everyone for no reason at all Just for the joy of loving.\nLove the trees and the animals and the people The stars, the birds, the rocks.\nThis whole existence is our home And we are an intrinsic part of it.\nIt gives us so much and we don't respond. The moment you start loving it\nYou will be surprised:\nYour love is returned in a thousandfold way. It starts pouring from all directions\nAnd in all dimensions.\nYou are simply bathed every moment. It goes on and on showering.\nThen life is a celebration.\nAnd unless life becomes a celebration, remember You have not known life yet. It has to be discovered.\n(Osho gives sannyas to a young blind woman) Premdevi means goddess of love.\nIn fact there is no other god except love. Love more and more, become love.\nLove whatsoever surrounds you. Love yourself, love others.\nMake it a point that every breath, slowly slowly Becomes full of the fragrance of love.\nThat is going to be your path to god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And don't be worried about the outer eyes, They are insignificant\nLove will open the inner eye\nWhich is the real eye because only through that Can god be seen. And you will be able to see god -- rest assured!\nI cannot give that much guarantee To people who have outer eyes\nBecause they have a thousand and one distractions. You are fortunate, you have nothing to distract you. You can easily go in, you are already there.\nWhile you are here enjoy the time as much as you can. Feel it as your home.\nGod does not exist\nUnless your heart is full of love. Without love there is no bridge Between you and god.\nSo wether he exists or does not exist Makes no difference to you.\nHence the real problem\nIs not wether god exists or not. The real problem\nIs wether the bridge exists or not.\nPeople go on talking about god, arguing about god. All those arguments are futile.\nExercises in utter futility.\nThe authentic seeker will create a bridge.\nLove is the bridge between you and that which is, Whatsoever it is. God, nature, tao, dhamma, logos\nThe universe, existence... They are different names But the reality is the same. One thing is certain\nThat there is something that surrounds you: The vast universe.\nOne thing is certain\nThat it existed before we were born And it will exist when we are gone. What it is, there is no way to know\nUnless love creates a bridge between you And the reality.\nOnly the heart full of love comes to know. Knowing does not happen through the head It happens through the heart\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Not through logic but through love. Love has to be your path, your way, your practice. There are two paths and there are only two paths. Either one has to follow awareness\nOr one has to follow love. Both reach the same goal\nBut they move through different territories. The path of awareness is a masculine path. The path of love is a feminine path:\nIt is far more beautiful, it is far more joyous. It is full of greenery\nAnd many flowers bloom on the path.\nThe path of awareness is dry, more like a desert. But both reach the same point.\nA few people love deserts.\nThen it is perfectly good for them To follow the path of awareness.\nBuddha follows the path of awareness. Jesus follows the path of love.\nBoth reach the same peak.\nBut if one can follow the path of love\nThen why bother about going into a desert?\nIf it is impossible to follow the path of love Then only do I suggest the bitter pill. The path of love is a sugar-coated pill.\nWisdom is a by-product of meditation. It does not come through learning\nOn the contrary it comes through unlearning. Unlearn whatsoever you know.\nFirst become completely empty through unlearning, Just a clean slat, and then suddenly\nA writing starts appearing on your clean slate. And the handwriting is not yours -- it is god's! Suddenly from your own inner being\nYou start having new insights, new visions. And they are so fresh and so alive\nThat just to have them is to have The greatest treasure in the world. And those insights\nWhich arise within your own being\nAre always right because they are not borrowed. They are coming from a source deeper than you Higher than you, far beyond you.\nThat wisdom liberates. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Knowledge becomes a bondage Because it is borrowed. Wisdom liberates\nBecause it is your own inner nature. The only condition\nThat a seeker of truth has to fulfil is:\nHe should start with an absolutely empty mind With no belief, with no prejudice,\nWith no ideology.\nNothing should be accepted a priori. Everything should be experienced, lived, And only then accepted.\nThose who believe never find truth. They are not seekers, they are believers; They deceive themselves.\nBelief is a deception; and it is cheap. You don't have to do anything -- You can simply believe.\nThat's why millions of people believe, Only very few people seek.\nBut unless you seek you cannot find. Belief is the greatest barrier\nIn seeking and searching.\nDrop believing, start experimenting.\nAnd always start from a state of not-knowing And then truth is not far away.\nBut that basic condition has to be fulfilled. Patience\nIs a fundamental quality of the seeker. Impatience is a barrier in the search.\nYou can't be in a hurry as far as god is concerned Because god lives in eternity, and hurry means You are counting minutes and seconds and hours.\nThat won't do.\nIf you want to know god, if you want to know truth You have to know the way of eternity.\nThat's why patience is needed.\nForget all about time, don't be in a hurry Don't be impatient. Wait. Wait lovingly With great expectancy but no expectation Full of joy that the guest\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- May be coming any moment.\nBut don't feel frustrated if he has not come yet. Keep everything ready to receive him.\nGo on preparing. If he has not come\nThat simply means you are not yet ready. So there is nothing to feel frustrated about.\nJust look around, prepare and prepare and prepare The moment your preparation is perfect\nYour silence is perfect, your emptiness is perfect He comes -- immediately he comes!\nA sannyasin has to be absolutely peaceful Amongst all the turmoil of the world\nHe has to be peaceful in the marketplace. Because I am against escapism.\nIt is easy to be peaceful in a monastery.\nWhat else can you do there except be peaceful? But that peace is dead.\nIt is closer to impotence. Then if one is impotent\nOne can be a celibate very easily\nIn fact what else is he supposed to do? But not to be impotent and to be a celibate Is a totally different phenomenon.\nMy sannyasins have to live in the world They have to be part of the world\nAnd yet utterly silent, peaceful.\nThe world is a great challenge if you can learn The art of being silent amongst all distractions.\nOnly then is your silence true, authentic, alive Can god come to you. God is life. A dead peace is absolutely worthless.\nSo be in the world but don't be of the world. Live in the world\nBut don't let the world enter in you.\nMove, pass through the world, but remain unaffected. It is possible.\nIt is the greatest miracle but it is possible. And when it becomes possible\nOne knows for the first time what ecstasy is. Sannyas is not for the coward.\nIt is for the courageous one\nBecause it is going into your inner world.\nNo map exists and nobody can accompany you there. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You will be alone, absolutely alone And it is very dark there\nAt least in the beginning.\nAs you go deeper, it becomes lighter.\nWhen you reach the very centre of your being It is full of light.\nBut the first experience\nIs of immense darkness and aloneness:\nNo map, no friend, no companion. Courage is certainly needed.\nSo gather courage for the journey. Everybody has that much courage People just never use it.\nThe difference between the coward and the courageous Is not that the courageous has some quality\nWhich is lacking in the coward -- no. Both have the same qualities.\nThe coward does not use it And the courageous uses it.\nAnd when you use a certain quality You become capable of using it more. When you don't use it\nWhen it remains out of use for a long time\nIt gathers rust, it stops functioning. Our real being is in our innermost core It is not somewhere outside.\nOne need not go anywhere\nOne has simply to come back home. Sannyas is not a journey from here to there On the contrary\nIt is a journey from there to here.\nWe are already there and we have to be here We are always then and we have to be now.\nSo whether your mind starts moving somewhere Bring it back here.\nWhen it starts moving to the past, to the future Bring it to the now. Remember these two words: 'now' and 'here'.\nThat is going to be your practice. Slowly slowly one starts living herenow\nAnd that is the only way we can meet god Because he is always herenow\nAnd we are never herenow.\nThe moment we are also herenow 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The meeting happens, is bound to happen.\nMadhav is one of the names of Krishna. Krishna is one of the rarest human beings Who has walked on the earth,\nOne of the very few enlightened persons. But literally it means the sweet one.\nKrishna has been called Madhava\nBecause the words of an enlightened person are sweet, they are pure poetry\nBecause they come from his inner silence.\nEven though they may not have the form of poetry Their spirit is poetic Their very essence is poetic\nTheir soul is poetic.\nAnd they are as sweet as honey Because they quench the thirst The eternal thirst for truth.\nThey are a nourishment.\nBecome silent, so silent that your inner being Also explodes into eighty-four thousand poems\nOf peace, love, sweetness, joy, ecstasy. My sannyasins have to be poets\nNot literally but metaphorically.\nNot that they have to compose poetry But that they have to live poetry.\nThey have to make life a graceful art They have to live it skilfully.\nPeople live in a very gross way.\nWith anger, with jealousy, with possessiveness With ego, how can you be a poet? You can be a murderer but you can't be a poet.\nAnd even if you write poetry Your poetry will be full of blood. One should remove\nAll these gross elements from one's being Because they are destroying so much energy Wasting so much opportunity.\nAll these energies should be transformed Into songs, into joy, into love, into peace. Then life becomes poetry.\nThen it is a sheer joy to be. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Just to be is more than one can ask for Just to breathe is enough proof that god exists Because each single breath Brings so much ecstasy with it.\nLife becomes such a harmony and melody Such a dance\nThat one cannot believe it is possible. One can believe it only when it happens. I say it to you on my own authority\nI have experienced life that way\nI am experiencing it that way every moment. And I would like you also to experience it\nIn the same way.\nBecome more meditative and it will happen. It is bound to happen, it is inevitable.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2214","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2214 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Knowledge becomes a bondage</span></h3><p>Because it is borrowed. Wisdom liberates</p><p>Because it is your own inner nature. The only condition</p><p>That a seeker of truth has to fulfil is:</p><p>He should start with an absolutely empty mind With no belief, with no
prejudice,</p><p>With no ideology.</p><p>Nothing should be accepted a priori. Everything should be
experienced, lived, And only then accepted.</p><p>Those who believe never find truth. They are not seekers, they are
believers; They deceive themselves.</p><p>Belief is a deception; and it is cheap. You don't have to do anything
-- You can simply believe.</p><p>That's why millions of people believe, Only very few people seek.</p><p>But unless you seek you cannot find. Belief is the greatest
barrier</p><p>In seeking and searching.</p><p>Drop believing, start experimenting.</p><p>And always start from a state of not-knowing And then truth is not
far away.</p><p>But that basic condition has to be fulfilled. Patience</p><p>Is a fundamental quality of the seeker. Impatience is a barrier in
the search.</p><p>You can't be in a hurry as far as god is concerned Because god lives
in eternity, and hurry means You are counting minutes and seconds and
hours.</p><p>That won't do.</p><p>If you want to know god, if you want to know truth You have to know
the way of eternity.</p><p>That's why patience is needed.</p><p>Forget all about time, don't be in a hurry Don't be impatient. Wait.
Wait lovingly With great expectancy but no expectation Full of joy that

Query:- May be coming <em>any</em> moment.</p><p>But don't feel frustrated if he has not come yet. Keep everything
ready to receive him.</p><p>Go on preparing. If he has not come</p><p>That simply means you are not yet ready. So there is nothing to feel
frustrated about.</p><p>Just look around, prepare and prepare and prepare The moment your
preparation is perfect</p><p>Your silence is perfect, your emptiness is perfect He comes --
immediately he comes!</p><p>A sannyasin has to be absolutely peaceful Amongst all the turmoil of
the world</p><p>He has to be peaceful in the marketplace. Because I am against
escapism.</p><p>It is easy to be peaceful in a monastery.</p><p>What else can you do there except be peaceful? But that peace is
dead.</p><p>It is closer to impotence. Then if one is impotent</p><p>One can be a celibate very easily</p><p>In fact what else is he supposed to do? But not to be impotent and to
be a celibate Is a totally different phenomenon.</p><p>My sannyasins have to live in the world They have to be part of the
world</p><p>And yet utterly silent, peaceful.</p><p>The world is a great challenge if you can learn The art of being
silent amongst all distractions.</p><p>Only then is your silence true, authentic, alive Can god come to you.
God <em>is</em> life. A dead peace is absolutely worthless.</p><p>So be in the world but don't be of the world. Live in the world</p><p>But don't let the world enter in you.</p><p>Move, pass through the world, but remain unaffected. It is
possible.</p><p>It is the greatest miracle but it is possible. And when it becomes
possible</p><p>One knows for the first time what ecstasy is. Sannyas is not for the
coward.</p><p>It is for the courageous one</p><p>Because it is going into your inner world.</p><p>No map exists and nobody can accompany you there. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--you-will-be-alone-absolutely-alone>Osho's

will be alone, absolutely alone</span></h3><p>And it is very dark there</p><p>At least in the beginning.</p><p>As you go deeper, it becomes lighter.</p><p>When you reach the very centre of your being It is full of light.</p><p>But the first experience</p><p>Is of immense darkness and aloneness:</p><p>No map, no friend, no companion. Courage is certainly needed.</p><p>So gather courage for the journey. Everybody has that much courage
People just never use it.</p><p>The difference between the coward and the courageous Is not that the
courageous has some quality</p><p>Which is lacking in the coward -- no. Both have the same
qualities.</p><p>The coward does not use it And the courageous uses it.</p><p>And when you use a certain quality You become capable of using it
more. When you don't use it</p><p>When it remains out of use for a long time</p><p>It gathers rust, it stops functioning. Our real being is in our
innermost core It is not somewhere outside.</p><p>One need not go anywhere</p><p>One has simply to come back home. Sannyas is not a journey from here
to there On the contrary</p><p>It is a journey from there to here.</p><p>We are already there and we have to be here We are always then and we
have to be now.</p><p>So whether your mind starts moving somewhere Bring it back here.</p><p>When it starts moving to the past, to the future Bring it to the now.
Remember these two words: 'now' and 'here'.</p><p>That is going to be your practice. Slowly slowly one starts living
herenow</p><p>And that is the only way we can meet god Because he is always
herenow</p><p>And we are never herenow.</p><p>The moment we are also herenow 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><p><strong>Osho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished</strong>
Query:- The meeting happens, is <em>bound</em> to happen.</p><p>Madhav is one of the names of Krishna. Krishna is one of the rarest
human beings Who has walked on the earth,</p><p>One of the very few enlightened persons. But literally it means the
sweet one.</p><p>Krishna has been called Madhava</p><p>Because the words of an enlightened person are sweet, they are pure
poetry</p><p>Because they come from his inner silence.</p><p>Even though they may not have the form of poetry Their spirit is
poetic Their very essence is poetic</p><p>Their soul is poetic.</p><p>And they are as sweet as honey Because they quench the thirst The
eternal thirst for truth.</p><p>They are a nourishment.</p><p>Become silent, so silent that your inner being Also explodes into
eighty-four thousand poems</p><p>Of peace, love, sweetness, joy, ecstasy. My sannyasins have to be
poets</p><p>Not literally but metaphorically.</p><p>Not that they have to compose poetry But that they have to live
poetry.</p><p>They have to make life a graceful art They have to live it
skilfully.</p><p>People live in a very gross way.</p><p>With anger, with jealousy, with possessiveness With ego, how can you
be a poet? You can be a murderer but you can't be a poet.</p><p>And even if you write poetry Your poetry will be full of blood. One
should remove</p><p>All these gross elements from one's being Because they are destroying
so much energy Wasting so much opportunity.</p><p>All these energies should be transformed Into songs, into joy, into

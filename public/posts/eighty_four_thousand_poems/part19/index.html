The ultimate goal of all meditation is\nTo hear the unhearable, to see the unseeable To touch the untouchable\nTo experience the unexperiencable.\nThe ultimate experience of life is a paradox. It is the sound of silence.\nNow, logically that is absurd: either something Can be sound or it can be silence\n--\nIt can't be both together.\nBut those who have known all agree about it That it is the sound of silence\nIt is the sound of one hand clapping. All those who have known agree about\nThe paradoxical nature of the ultimate reality Because it contains the polar opposites.\nIt is night and day simultaneously It is life and death together.\nLogic divides, experience unites. Logic creates opposites Experience makes you aware that\nThere are no opposites at all, not at all. All opposites are just complementaries. Bliss is really the search of everyone Not only of human beings\nBut of animals, of trees, of rivers, of stars. Knowingly or unknowingly\nEverybody is groping for bliss. A sannyasin is one\nWho makes it a conscious, deliberate search. And only those few people have arrived\nWho have made it a conscious search. Unconsciously you can seek bliss\nBut you will find misery. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is only through a conscious search that One can avoid misery and can attain to bliss. Become a conscious seeker of bliss.\nLet meditation be your nest, your home Your refuge, your shelter\nBecause without meditation One simply gropes in darkness\nOne goes on stumbling, one goes on falling In the same ditches again and again.\nWithout meditation one is blind.\nIt is meditation that gives you eyes Inner eyes to see, and a clarity.\nIt creates a perspective, the right perspective In which things can be seen as they are.\nYou are no more clouded\nThe sky is clear, unclouded.\nThe sun is bright. You are full of light. Without meditation you live in thoughts\nWithout meditation you make your home in the mind There is no other place. These are the only two alternatives available: Mind or meditation.\nEither make your nest in the mind Or make your nest in the meditation. If you make your nest in the mind\nAs millions have chosen -- because it is cheap It is easy, it is not arduous, it is downhill...\nBut then you will miss something\nThat can give your life meaning, significance Grandeur, splendour: you will miss godliness. You will simply drag from one event to another. Your life will be such boredom,\nA tiring phenomenon.\nNothing will ever happen to you Which can make you ecstatic.\nYou will live at the minimum, a very lukewarm life. One can say only that you will not be dead\nYou will just be living somehow, managing somehow But there cannot be any rejoicing.\nMake meditation your nest, your home:\nMove from mind to meditation. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Mind is the process of thought Meditation is awareness, simple awareness. Just be aware of your mind\nAnd the process of thoughts And slowly slowly\nYou will move away from the mind\nAnd you will enter into a new world of no-mind. That is meditation.\nThe day you enter meditation\nYou have entered the temple of god. Meditation creates ecstasy in you Such joy that you cannot contain it. It starts overflowing.\nIt is so much that you disappear in it. You are no more -- there is only joy. That is rapture.\nThe ego drowns in the rapture And is never found again:\nIt dissolves, disappears, evaporates.\nYou are left with only a deep joy in the heart A joy which is not of time A joy which is not of this earth\nA joy which belongs to the beyond To the farther shore.\nAnd only out of that joy, that rapture That ecstasy, does reverence arise:\nReverence for existence. In religious terms\nYou can call it reverence for god.\nReverence is far more important than god itself. Without reverence there is no god\nIf there is reverence, god is bound to happen It is inevitable.\nSo my effort here is to create reverence in you. If reverence arises in your heart, god is:\nSuddenly you start feeling his presence. Everywhere, all around, within and without.\nIn the moment of reverence the whole existence Is transformed into godliness.\nThen trees are divine and rocks are divine.\nWherever you look with a heart full of reverence You can only find god and nothing else.\nWithout reverence\nEverything is there except god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- With reverence Only god is there and nothing else. The nectar which makes you immortal Is meditation, it is nothing chemical.\nIt is your inner awareness.\nOnce you become awake, you know you are immortal. It does not make you immortal in reality,\nYou are immortal;\nIt simply reveals the fact to you. It makes you aware of it.\nIt is a revelation, it is a discovery\nOf something that has always been there. But people are profoundly asleep.\nThey know not who they are\nThey know not what they are doing. They go on doing something or other Just to keep themselves engaged.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you have to learn\nThe art of being UNengaged, of being unoccupied Of remaining alone. Whenever you can find time\nDon't waste it in unnecessary occupations. Don't kill time,\nIt is the most precious thing in life. Once gone, it gone forever.\nThere is no way to recapture it. Whenever\nYou can find time to be alone, to be silent Be silent, be alone.\nDive deep within yourself Because it is by knowing yourself\nThat you will know you are beyond time You are eternal, you are deathless.\nKnowing it, one becomes free of all fear And to be free af fear is freedom.\nAbraham is one of the most important names In the history of human consciousness.\nThe mythology is that god chose Abraham To be the father of a new race of man.\nIt is as if with Abraham humanity reached\nA new height, a new peak: Abraham became 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The end of the old and the beginning of the new. That has to be remembered.\nEach sannyasin in a certain sense IS Abraham: He has to end the old and begin the new.\nHe has to move into the unknown Into a new dimension\nInto something which has no map, no measure Into something which is not conceivable\nTo the mind.\nEach sannyasin has to herald a new consciousness. And particularly\nAt this moment in the history of man\nSomething tremendously radical is needed. The whole humanity is rotten\nIt has lived its course, it is finished. There is no hope for it, it has to die. The hope lies in something new.\nBefore the old dies, the new has to be born. And that's my whole effort here:\nTo create as many Abrahams as possible. They will release humanity from the bondage Of the old, the traditional, the conventional. They will free humanity\nFrom all kinds of beliefs and ideologies. Man needs a new impetus to live\nA new meaning to live for\nA new poetry to resound in his being And a new dance and a new celebration.

<em>has</em> to die. The hope lies in something new.</p><p>Before the old dies, the new has to be born. And that's my whole
effort here:</p><p>To create as many Abrahams as possible. They will release humanity
from the bondage Of the old, the traditional, the conventional. They
will free humanity</p><p>From all kinds of beliefs and ideologies. Man needs a new impetus to
live</p><p>A new meaning to live for</p><p>A new poetry to resound in his being And a new dance and a new
celebration. <strong>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</strong></p><p>Chapter #20</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

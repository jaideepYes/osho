It is for reference purposes only.]\nThe only experience on the earth Which can be called divine or godly\nIs that of meditation; it is the only experience That is not of the world, it is of the beyond\nHence it is the only bridge Between the world and the beyond. It is something that joins this shore With the farther shore.\nEverything else is worldly.\nUnless one enters deeply into meditation One knows nothing of god.\nOne may believe but belief is a lie. One may believe very staunchly\nBut that does not make much difference:\nDeep down doubt will always persist. You can repress it\nIn such deep corners of your unconscious That you yourself will become unaware of it. But still it is there and at any moment\nIn any situation, it can surface again. Hence god is not a question of belief. Those who believe\nAre simply deceiving themselves. God has to be experienced.\nPrayer requires that you first believe in god, Meditation has no such requirement. Meditation is a scientific procedure.\nIt simply says: Become more silent More conscious, more aware.\nNo implication is there that you have to\nBelieve in god, in heaven, in an afterlife.\nNo belief is required, no prerequisite. Just become more quiet and calm More centred in yourself\nAnd then slowly slowly\nGlimpses start arriving, windows start opening. And the first glimpse of god is enough --\nYou are overwhelmed, you are transformed A new man is born.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Meditation is both a flowering -- A flowering of your consciousness A flowering of your inner being -- And it is also humbleness because\nIn meditation the ego dies and disappears. What is left is humbleness.\nMeditation is a miracle, In fact the only miracle\nBecause it transforms you totally from\nAn unconscious being into a conscious being From machine to man and from man to superman. And because the first thing that happens\nIn meditation is the death of the ego Many things disappear from your life\nOf their own accord: anger, greed, jealousy Possessiveness -- they are all tentacles\nOf the octopus called the ego. Once the ego is dead\nAll these different expressions of it disappear. Life becomes tremendously humble\nAnd tremendously beautiful.\nIn humbleness the ultimate descends in you In humbleness god knocks on your door\nIn humbleness you become the host And god becomes the guest.\nAll that you have to do\nIs go deeper into meditation, into awareness. Shift your energy from mind to no-mind From sound to silence\nAnd the miracle will start happening.\nMan remains just a rosebush without any roses\nIf there is no love. And a rosebush without roses Is empty, is unfulfilled. Its essential. most important, significant\nContribution to existence is missing. It is impotent, it is frigid.\nWhen the rosebush is full of roses there is joy There is dance, there is celebration.\nAnd the same happens to man. Man is certainly a rosebush Capable of millions of roses:\nRoses of consciousness. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But they all bloom when you are full of love. It is the climate of love\nThat functions like spring -- suddenly one blooms. Those who live without love\nHave not known what Spring is\nThey have not known the peak of their life. They have dragged, they have vegetated\nBut they have not truly lived. Remember, it is through love\nThat you will bloom, that you will grow That you will attain to your glory\nAnd to your splendour.\nNever forget love, never neglect love Never miss an opportunity to be loving\nUse every possible opportunity to be loving So that slowly slowly, you become love.\nWhen you are love, you are really a rose! Love brings grace.\nLove makes you capable\nOf receiving grace from god. If you give love to the world God gives you grace.\nLove is the price for attaining grace.\nWithout giving love, you will not attain to grace. Empty yourself totally in love\nAnd you will be filled again and again With more and more grace.\nSuddenly one day you discover\nThe inexhaustible source. And the more grace you have\nThe more love you can give to the world. And the more you give\nThe more god goes on pouring in you. Suddenly you become a vehicles\nGod starts loving the world through you. That's what grace is.\nYour hands become god's hands Your eyes become god's eyes Your heart becomes god's heart.\nYou disappear, you are no more -- only god is!\nThat is grace, that is beauty, that is freedom 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That is truth. All that we can conceive And all that which is inconceivable Is contained in it.\nIt is the most mysterious phenomenon. But learn to love!\nNobleness is a by-product of blissfulness\nA natural consequence.\nOne need not practise nobleness.\nA practised nobleness is false, superficial It is only a mannerism, etiquette\nNothing much more than that. It is not even skin-deep\nIt is just something painted on your face. A little hit, a little insult\nAnd you will forget all about your nobleness. There is another kind of nobleness\nThat happens when you are blissful. It comes as a shadow of bliss.\nThe miserable person cannot be noble, He radiates misery, he radiates complaint\nHe radiates negativity, he radiates darkness. All around him there is a black hole.\nYou will not find a white aura around him. It is impossible\nBecause if the heart is not dancing, from where Can he get that white aura of being noble?\nSo my effort here is\nNot to teach you anything cultivated\nBut to transform you from your very roots. Learn to dance, sing, enjoy, love\nAnd slowly slowly, you will be surprised:\nYou are becoming noble\nYou are becoming less miserly, less greedy You are becoming more kind-hearted\nYou are becoming more compassionate You have started enjoying sharing Giving, just for giving's sake.\nAnd that's what a ..noble spirit is. It never harms anybody, it helps\nIt never hurts anybody, it always soothes.\nIt is a blessing to be noble, a blessing to all 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- A blessing to existence itself. Sunrise is exactly the colour of sannyas That's precisely the meaning of sannyas. It is a declaration\nThat the night is over:\nPrepare for the day\nThe sunrise has knocked on the door. Come out of your sleep.\nDon't go on hiding yourself under the blanket Any more, howsoever cosy it feels\nAnd howsoever much your mind says, 'Just turn over a little more\nJust a little more, a few minutes.' Don't listen to the mind because Those few minutes will never end The mind always goes on postponing. It wants you to remain asleep because\nMind can exist only when you are asleep. When you are awake, mind disappears\nJust like dreams disappear when you are awake. Mind is a dream phenomenon\nMade of the same stuff as dreams are made of. So no more postponement -- wake up!\nA loyal heart is what is required. Sannyas is a commitment,\nNot a commitment to me\nBut a commitment to your own growth.\nA commitment, a decision that you will make Every possible effort to change yourself.\nAnd of course, a deeply loyal heart Will be needed.\nThe cunning mind cannot do it because\nThe cunning mind goes on changing every moment It is not reliable; one moment it is one thing Another moment it is another thing.\nIt goes on changing its colours.\nYou cannot make a solid foundation On the basis of your mind\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because mind consists of sand And to make a sandcastle is dangerous, It is going to collapse sooner or later.\nAnd the danger is\nYou may be destroyed when it collapses Because you will be living in it.\nNever live in a house made by the mind.\nBut the loyal heart\nCan become the right foundation. It is like a rock, unchanging.\nSo let your sannyas be a decision Of the heart, not of the mind.\nI am not interested\nIn people who become convinced intellectually That what I am saying is right.\nThey are not the right people. Today they are convinced\nTomorrow they may be unconvinced again. The mind is a flux.\nI only trust people\nWho come to me through the heart. Who have a conviction of the heart Who are in a deep love affair.\nIt has nothing to do with intellectuality.\nIt is closer to love than to logic\nfar closer to love. Once the heart is ready\nThen nothing can prevent it.\nThen it goes on risking everything. It can pass through all kinds of fire\nAnd it will come out of all fires purified, More glorious, more victorious.\nEach fire makes it more and more pure And each risk gives it\nA new dimension, a new quality. Sannyas is fire\nBut that is the only way to purify the gold. Sannyas is a search for the truth.\nNot a direct search for god\nBecause we don't know whether god is or is not. To start searching for god means\nYou have already believed that there is a god. The search is unscientific\nFrom the very beginning, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You have taken something a priori -- That is not the right way to enquire.\nThe right way to enquire is:\nOne should search for truth Whatsoever the truth is.\nMaybe there is no god -- that may be the truth Or maybe there is a god -- that may be the truth.\nTruth is vast.\nIt can either be the existence of god Or it can be the non-existence of god. Truth is bigger than god because\nIt can contain even the non-existence of god, So it is an open thing.\nSearching for truth needs no a priori belief. Seek and search for the truth.\nOf course when you find truth\nYou will find god -- but that is another matter! That we can leave for the time being\nWe can put it aside, that happens on its own. When you have found truth\nYou have found god too.\nBut those who start searching for god From the very very beginning,\nAre never going to find truth\nAnd they are never going to find god either. Their very first step has gone wrong.\nSo I am here to help you to enquire But not to believe\nBecause I trust so much in truth that\nThere is no need to believe -- you can enquire You can go deep in exploration And you will find it.\nThe people who preach belief\nAre the people who are not really trusting. They are afraid that if people don't believe Then they will become godless\nThey will become irreligious They will become immoral.\nThese are cowards -- they don't know that\nGod does not exist, because you believe in him God exists whether you believe in him or not.\nSo why believe? Enquire.\nIf he is there, you will discover him.\nI know he is there, but that is my knowing And my knowing cannot be your knowing.\nAnd I have stumbled upon this knowing; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Through enquiry, not through belief. So one has to be courageous enough So drop all beliefs.\nGo utterly empty and naked, open, available With no prejudice for or against\nAnd you are bound to find the truth Whatsoever it is, x y z,\nRight now it is x y z; ultimately it is god. When you have arrived, then it is god Not before that.\nAnugito\nA sannyasin is supposed to be a song. The only requirement from my side is that you become a song, rejoice in life, dance with the wind and the sun and the rain.\nIt is sacred ground you are walking on -- it is all divine, all around. Not to be a song is to be ungrateful. Not to dance is to be ungrateful.\nAll that we can do in thankfulness to God is to sing small songs, to dance small dances.\nWe can celebrate in our own small way.\nSo let life become a celebration, a rejoicing, an \"Hallelujah!\"\n[ Osho had mentioned astrology in the morning discourse in response to a sannyasin who said that an astrologer told him he wouldn't become enlightened this lifetime.\nEnlightenment is unpredictable, Osho said, and neither the stars nor the astrologer are enlightened anyway. And, he said, for the fools who are interested we have our own astrologer in sannyasin, Kabir, so why bother going further afield?]\nAnd now you can help them more! First talk about astrology and then finally tell them to go beyond it. So help them to go beyond.\nIt is good -- for whatsoever reason they come. Don't be bothered by their reason, use that opportunity to help them to go beyond. I will be helping you!\nToday you are becoming god's own. Up to now it has been only a name Now it can be a reality.\nAll that is required on your part\nIs to drop the ego -- that's the only hindrance That keeps people away from god. And the farther away you are\nThe more miserable you are.\nMy measuring a person's misery, the distance Between him and god can be inferred.\nAs you come closer, misery starts disappearing. When you really become god's own\nThere is no misery -- all is bliss and joy.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Make it a reality. It is not difficult,\nJust a little courage is needed To let the ego drop.\nAnd it is absolutely worthless\nHence any intelligent person can do it. I don't teach any philosophy here\nI only help you to be a little more intelligent Because once you are a little more sharp\nYou can see it for yourself -- I need not say it to you.\nYou can see the utter futility of the ego And in that very seeing it drops.\nAnd that is the greatest moment in one's life Because from there real life begins.\nJoachim\nEveryone is appointed by God. Everyone is given a certain message which has to be fulfilled, although everybody has forgotten the message. Not only has the message been forgotten we have even forgotten the message-giver. We have forgotten that we are messengers, that we bring a seed of great potential into the\nworld; that the world needs our contribution, that we have to bloom, that we have to release our fragrance. And unless we release our fragrance our life mission is unfulfilled.\nOnce this is understood life starts taking on meaning. Then it is no more the same meaningless jumble of accidents. It starts becoming a rhythm, it starts having a sense of direction.\nSannyas is to give you a sense of direction, a togetherness, a rootedness, an awareness of what you are and what you can be. It is immensely significant to remember that sannyas is not a formality. It is not just a formal thing like being a Christian - because you were born in a Christian home; or a formal thing like being a Hindu.\nSannyas is exactly like when Jesus was on the earth, and a few people started walking with him started moving into danger with him; or when Buddha was on the earth and a few people gathered together around him and risked all! The same drama is being played here again.\nYou are fortunate to become part of it. Feel blessed. And then slowly slowly you will start remembering what the meaning is of being appointed by God, what the meaning is of every man bringing a message into the world. No man comes empty-handed but very few people ever deliver the message. Those who do are the buddhas, the awakened ones.\nMy effort here is to make thousands of Buddhas. Less than that won't do!\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #26\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2820","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2820 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

loving</p><p>Use every possible opportunity to be loving So that slowly slowly,
you become love.</p><p>When you are love, you are really a rose! Love brings grace.</p><p>Love makes you capable</p><p>Of receiving grace from god. If you give love to the world God gives
you grace.</p><p>Love is the price for attaining grace.</p><p>Without giving love, you will not attain to grace. Empty yourself
totally in love</p><p>And you will be filled again and again With more and more grace.</p><p>Suddenly one day you discover</p><p>The inexhaustible source.

But learn to love!</p><p>Nobleness is a by-product of blissfulness</p><p>A natural consequence.</p><p>One need not practise nobleness.</p><p>A practised nobleness is false, superficial It is only a mannerism,
etiquette</p><p>Nothing much more than that. It is not even skin-deep</p><p>It is just something painted on your face. A little hit, a little
insult</p><p>And you will forget all about your nobleness. There is another kind
of nobleness</p><p>That happens when you are blissful. It comes as a shadow of
bliss.</p><p>The miserable person cannot be noble, He radiates misery, he radiates
complaint</p><p>He radiates negativity, he radiates darkness. All around him there is
a black hole.</p><p>You will not find a white aura around him. It is impossible</p><p>Because if the heart is not dancing, from <em>where</em> Can he get
that white aura of being noble?</p><p>So my effort here is</p><p>Not to teach you anything cultivated</p><p>But to transform you from your very roots. Learn to dance, sing,
enjoy, love</p><p>And slowly slowly, you will be surprised:</p><p>You are becoming noble</p><p>You are becoming less miserly, less greedy You are becoming more
kind-hearted</p><p>You are becoming more compassionate You have started enjoying sharing
Giving, just for giving's sake.</p><p>And that's what a ..noble spirit is. It never harms anybody, it

side is that you become a song, rejoice in life, dance with the wind and
the sun and the rain.</p><p>It is sacred ground you are walking on -- it is all divine, all
around. Not to be a song is to be ungrateful. Not to dance is to be
ungrateful.</p><p>All that we can do in thankfulness to God is to sing small songs, to
dance small dances.</p><p>We can celebrate in our own small way.</p><p>So let life become a celebration, a rejoicing, an "Hallelujah!"</p><p>[ Osho had mentioned astrology in the morning discourse in response
to a sannyasin who said that an astrologer told him he wouldn't become
enlightened this lifetime.</p><p>Enlightenment is unpredictable, Osho said, and neither the stars nor
the astrologer are enlightened anyway. And, he said, for the fools who
are interested we have our own astrologer in sannyasin, Kabir, so why
bother going further afield?]</p><p>And now you can help them more! First talk about astrology and then
finally tell them to go beyond it. So help them to go beyond.</p><p>It is good -- for whatsoever reason they come. Don't be bothered by
their reason, use that opportunity to help them to go beyond. I will be
helping you!</p><p>Today you are becoming god's own. Up to now it has been only a name

here</p><p>I only help you to be a little more intelligent Because once you are
a little more sharp</p><p>You can see it for yourself -- I need not say it to you.</p><p>You can see the utter futility of the ego And in that very seeing it
drops.</p><p>And that is the greatest moment in one's life Because from there real
life begins.</p><p>Joachim</p><p>Everyone is appointed by God. Everyone is given a certain message
which has to be fulfilled, although everybody has forgotten the message.
Not only has the message been forgotten we have even forgotten the
message-giver. We have forgotten that we are messengers, that we bring a
seed of great potential into the</p><p>world; that the world needs our contribution, that we have to bloom,
that we have to release our fragrance. And unless we release our
fragrance our life mission is unfulfilled.</p><p>Once this is understood life starts taking on meaning. Then it is no
more the same meaningless jumble of accidents. It starts becoming a
rhythm, it starts having a sense of direction.</p><p>Sannyas is to give you a sense of direction, a togetherness, a
rootedness, an awareness of what you are and what you can be. It is
immensely significant to remember that sannyas is not a formality. It is
not just a formal thing like being a Christian - because you were born
in a Christian home; or a formal thing like being a Hindu.</p><p>Sannyas is exactly like when Jesus was on the earth, and a few people
started walking with him started moving into danger with him; or when
Buddha was on the earth and a few people gathered together around him
and risked all! The same drama is being played here again.</p><p>You are fortunate to become part of it. Feel blessed. And then slowly
slowly you will start remembering what the meaning is of being appointed
by God, what the meaning is of every man bringing a message into the
world. No man comes empty-handed but very few people ever deliver the
message. Those who do are the buddhas, the awakened ones.</p><p>My effort here is to make thousands of Buddhas. Less than that won't
do!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=eighty-four-thousand-poems>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</h3><p>Chapter #26</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

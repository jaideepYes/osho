It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan can live life either as prose or as poetry. If you live life as prose\nLife remains business, arithmetic. If you live life as poetry\nLife becomes an incredible experience\nOf beauty, of love, of joy and ultimately of god. Poetry is a way towards god.\nProse takes you away from all that is significant From all that is intrinsically beautiful.\nIt keeps you engaged with the utilitarian .\nBut beauty has no utility, love has no utility 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Bliss has no utility, meditation has no utility. They are all part of a poetic vision. Poetry is non-utilitarian.\nI would like my sannyasins\nTo be absolutely non-utilitarian Because that is the only possible door To enter into the divine.\nLife can be lived either\nAs a downhill phenomenon or as an uphill task. If you are moving downhill\nIt is convenient, comfortable.\nNo effort is needed on your part, no risk No challenge -- but no gain either.\nYou simply drift from birth to death. Life remains a vast emptiness.\nNow you have to make it a point To be constantly blissful.\nThat is the meaning of anand.\nLife should be a dance, a song, a celebration.\nAnd come back -- this is your home!\nMan is homeless in this world unless he finds god. Man is homeless unless he becomes enlightened Because only in ultimate awakening\nIs there shelter.\nOtherwise we go on passing From one caravanserai to another From one life to another.\nIt is a long, long weary pilgrimage Utterly futile, meaningless;\nWe almost go on in circles Reaching nowhere, finding nothing; Always hoping, dreaming\nBut ultimately\nThere is only frustration in the hands. The home certainly exists\nBut only very few people have found it up to now.\nAnd the few who have found have found it in the most unexpected place: They have found it within themselves.\nAnd everybody is searching for it Everywhere else except within themselves.\nThat's why we remain homeless. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- We are not aware of how precious we are. We are not aware of the inexhaustible treasure That we are carrying within us. And because we are not aware of it\nWe go on desiring small things Quarrelling about mundane things Fighting, competing for something trivial. The moment you become aware\nOf your own inner beauty\nAll this struggle on the outside disappears. Life becomes calm and cool\nLife attains to a grace.\nOne is no more interested in the non-essential. That's what sannyas is all about:\nAwareness of the inner, and the transformation That it brings on the outside. Inside you become more and more meditative\nOutside you become more compassionate. The universe is vast, unbounded\nAnd so are we because we are part of it.\nAnd the part is indivisibly one with the whole So whatsoever is the quality of the whole\nThat is the quality of th part too. Just remember a very small formula: That if all the parts are finite\nThen the total cannot be infinite. If the total is infinite\nThen all the parts must be infinite too. And we are part of this infinite existence We are also infinite.\nHence the Eastern seers have declared 'Aham Brahmasmi' -- I am god.\nAl Hillaj Mansoor says 'Ana'l Haq' -- I am truth. These are tremendously important declarations. They have declared it\nOn behalf of the whole humanity. These are not egoistic assertions They are simply statements of facts. And just to feel it,\nThat you are part of an infinite existence\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Which begins nowhere, ends nowhere You immediately feel uplifted, weightless. Your small worries and small problems drop. they become so insignificant\nCompared to the vastness that you are. They lose all meaning\nThey simply become irrelevant. So remember it again and again:\nSeeing the sky know that you are also the sky. Seeing the stars know that the stars are within you. As much as you are within the sky\nThe sky is within you.\nSlowly slowly your whole gestalt will change And in that next gestalt\nSmall problems can't arise They become ridiculous. Somebody has insulted you --\nNow can anybody insult the sky?\nIf you spit on the sky\nThe spit will fall upon you. It is absurd, it is ridiculous,\nThe person is stupid, that's all.\nYou will feel all compassion for the person You will not be angered by his insult.\nThat's how the real man of religion Passes through life:\nUnaffected, calm and cool and tranquil Centred and rooted in his being.\nNothing can make him waver, not even death Because even death\nCannot take anything away from him. He has become one\nWith that which is eternally abiding. Rosemary is a flower\nWhich symbolises remembrance. It is very significant to understand The word 'remembrance'.\nThe whole religion\nIs contained in that small word.\nGod is not lost but only forgotten. We have only to remember him.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is not a question of seeking and searching. He is already here, he is with us He is our very life, our very being.\nWe cannot lose him, there is no way to lose him. The only possiblility is that we can\nForget all about him and he is so close That it is very easy to forget him.\nThere is no distance, hence we become oblivious. All meditations, all prayers, all methods Developed down the ages are nothing but Devices to make you remember\nThat which you have forgotten.\nThe moment you remember it you cannot believe How for so long you remained in darkness\nWhile the light was waiting within you. How did it happen in the first place\nThat you remained a beggar\nWhen the whole kingdom of god was yours? It is the ultimate puzzle, with no solution.\nBut it is a fact that we have forgotten.\nBuddha was asked again and again ' How have we forgotten?'\nHe said,'Don't ask that Ask how to remember.'\nWhen you have remembered\nThen you can enquire how you forgot\nBecause nobody knows how we have forgotten. But there are methods to remember.\nAnd that is the real thing.\nSannyas means now it is going to be\nA twenty-four-hour-a-day remembrance In every possible way.\nSeeing a flower remember god.\nNot only rosemary, but each flower and each tree And each cloud and each person\nShould represent him\nBecause in fact only he exists and nothing else.\nOne has to learn to see Divineness even in darkness. It is easy to see light as god\nIt does not need much intelligence. But to see darkness as god\nNeeds tremendous insight.\nIt is easy to see life as divine 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But to see death as divine needs A total transformation of your vision.\nOnly very few religions have achieved that peak. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Zorastrianism -- They all remain confined to the duality\nThe fight between good and evil, god and devil. They have not been able to reconcile this conflict.\nAnd this conflict has to be reconciled Because the universe is one It can't be divided into two.\nDarkness and light are not two different forces. Darkness simply beans less light,\nLight simply means less darkness; The difference is only of degree. The difference is exactly like that Between cold and hot.\nThey are not two things.\nIt is the same phenomenon, so you can measure it By the same method, by the same thermometer.\nThe good and the bad, the sinner and the saint Are not separate but two sides of the same coin.\nThis is one of the greatest synthesis That has been achieved in the East. This is the ultimate synthesis Where god and the devil\nAre no more thought to be enemies; They disappear into each other They become one energy.\nAnd that's what I would like you To see, feel, understand:\nThat darkness too is divine, death too is divine. Even the sinner is a phase of divine energy.\nThere is nothing bad in existence Because all is god\nAll are manifestations of one energy. The cloud represents a few things.\nOne: it represents absolute freedom. It is not tethered to anything.\nIt is completely free, it floats in freedom. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That's how a sannyasin has to be: Like a cloud, untethered.\nSecondly, the cloud has no fixed form. It is not static\nIt is constantly moving and changing.\nNot even for the consecutive seconds is it the same. That represents something very essential:\nLife is movement; only death is not a movement. Only dead thins don't change\nThings which are alive are constantly changing. That's how a sannyasin has to be:\nAlways on the move, changing REaching for newer horizons\nExploring for newer pastures.\nA sannyasin is as unpredictable as a cloud; Nobody can say what form\nIt is going to take next moment.\nAnd thirdly, the cloud has no ego of its own. It is utterly surrendered to the winds\nSo wherever the winds take the cloud It moves without any resistance.\nIt has no will of its own It does not insist that\n'I want to go to the East or to the West' It simply goes with the wind Wherever the wind goes.\nThat also has to be an essential quality Of a sannyasin.\nHe should not have his own will. His will is surrendered to god.\nHe says to god, every moment, with every breath 'Thy will be done.'\nGratitude is in essence\nThe very foundation of all religion.\nGratitude is prayer. It is trough gratitude\nThat one becomes aware of the presence of god; Not vice versa.\nPeople thing that when they become aware of god They will feel very grateful towards him.\nThat's nonsense! It can't happen that way. First you have to learn how to be grateful 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Only then can you become aware Of the presence of god.\nGratitude means that you have become Aware of one thing:\nThat the existence has done so much for you And you have not even thanked it.\nOn the contrary\nYou have been continuously complaining. This is my experience here\nWorking with thousands of sannyasins: You go on doing everything for them\nBut they don't have any sense of gratitude. And every day I receive letters of complaint That this has not been done for them\nThat they are not being taken care of That nobody is taking any note\nThat they are here. But very rarely\nDoes somebody come to feel gratitude.\nWe have lost the very sense of gratefulness. So whatsoever happens to us we accept it\nAs if we deserve it. We don't deserve a thing! But we start taking everything for granted.\nI am always surprised\nBy the insensitivity of human beings.\nFor a few people I have done so much for years But no sense of gratitude ever arises in them.\nAnd there seems to be no possibility That it will ever arise.\nAnd if whatsoever has been done for them Is dropped, if something is no more done Then they are there immediately\nTo make a complaint. They take it for granted\nThey think they have earned it:\nIt has to be given to them.\nAnd man has not earned anything We have not earned these trees And these flowers and these birds\nAnd these stars and these mountains. This immensely beautiful existence Has been given to us.\nStart feeling grateful for it!\nIt is not a question of to whom, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That is not the point, it is irrelevant. Just start feeling grateful\nThat you have been showered with so many gifts From some unknown energy, x y x,\nWhatsoever it is.\nCall it god, or if that word annoys you\nThen call it something else. But some unknown force\nHas been showering its love on you. Start feeling grateful\nAnd soon you will be connected with it And soon you will be bridged\nAnd more will start happening. And you will be surprised\nThat one cannot feel grateful enough.\nIt is never enough because the existence Goes on doing so much for you.\nWe cannot repay it\nBut at least we can be thankful. That is prayer and that is sannyas.

to see death as divine needs</span></h3><p>A total transformation of your vision.</p><p>Only very few religions have achieved that peak. Christianity, Islam,
Judaism, Zorastrianism -- They all remain confined to the duality</p><p>The fight between good and evil, god and devil. They have not been
able to reconcile this conflict.</p><p>And this conflict <em>has</em> to be reconciled Because the universe
is one It can't be divided into two.</p><p>Darkness and light are not two different forces. Darkness simply
beans less light,</p><p>Light simply means less darkness; The difference is only of degree.
The difference is exactly like that Between cold and hot.</p><p>They are not two things.</p><p>It is the same phenomenon, so you can measure it By the same method,
by the same thermometer.</p><p>The good and the bad, the sinner and the saint Are not separate but
two sides of the same coin.</p><p>This is one of the greatest synthesis That has been achieved in the
East. This is the ultimate synthesis Where god and the devil</p><p>Are no more thought to be enemies; They disappear into each other
They become one energy.</p><p>And that's what I would like you To see, feel, understand:</p><p>That darkness too is divine, death too is divine. Even the sinner is
a phase of divine energy.</p><p>There is nothing bad in existence Because all is god</p><p>All are manifestations of one energy. The cloud represents a few
things.</p><p>One: it represents absolute freedom. It is not tethered to
anything.</p><p>It is completely free, it floats in freedom. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--thats-how-a-sannyasin-has-to-be>Osho's

That's how a sannyasin has to be:</span></h3><p>Like a cloud, untethered.</p><p>Secondly, the cloud has no fixed form. It is not static</p><p>It is constantly moving and changing.</p><p>Not even for the consecutive seconds is it the same. That represents
something very essential:</p><p>Life is movement; only death is not a movement. Only dead thins don't
change</p><p>Things which are alive are constantly changing. That's how a
sannyasin has to be:</p><p>Always on the move, changing REaching for newer horizons</p><p>Exploring for newer pastures.</p><p>A sannyasin is as unpredictable as a cloud; Nobody can say what
form</p><p>It is going to take next moment.</p><p>And thirdly, the cloud has no ego of its own. It is utterly
surrendered to the winds</p><p>So wherever the winds take the cloud It moves without any
resistance.</p><p>It has no will of its own It does not insist that</p><p>'I want to go to the East or to the West' It simply goes with the
wind Wherever the wind goes.</p><p>That also has to be an essential quality Of a sannyasin.</p><p>He should not have his own will. His will is surrendered to god.</p><p>He says to god, every moment, with every breath 'Thy will be
done.'</p><p>Gratitude is in essence</p><p>The very foundation of all religion.</p><p>Gratitude is prayer. It is trough gratitude</p><p>That one becomes aware of the presence of god; Not vice versa.</p><p>People thing that when they become aware of god They will feel very
grateful towards him.</p><p>That's nonsense! It can't happen that way. First you have to learn

thanked it.</p><p>On the contrary</p><p>You have been continuously complaining. This is my experience
here</p><p>Working with thousands of sannyasins: You go on doing everything for
them</p><p>But they don't have any sense of gratitude. And every day I receive
letters of complaint That this has not been done for them</p><p>That they are not being taken care of That nobody is taking any
note</p><p>That they are here. But very rarely</p><p>Does somebody come to feel gratitude.</p><p>We have lost the very sense of gratefulness. So whatsoever happens to
us we accept it</p><p>As if we deserve it. We don't deserve a thing! But we start taking
everything for granted.</p><p>I am always surprised</p><p>By the insensitivity of human beings.</p><p>For a few people I have done so much for years But no sense of
gratitude ever arises in them.</p><p>And there seems to be no possibility That it will ever arise.</p><p>And if whatsoever has been done for them Is dropped, if something is
no more done Then they are there immediately</p><p>To make a complaint. They take it for granted</p><p>They think they have earned it:</p><p>It has to be given to them.</p><p>And man has not earned anything We have not earned these trees And
these flowers and these birds</p><p>And these stars and these mountains. This immensely beautiful

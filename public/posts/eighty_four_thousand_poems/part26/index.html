That's the dilemma.\nGod seems to be just an abstract idea And misery seems so real.\nOne can force the belief upon oneself. And miserable people want something\nAs a support, as a consolation, as a refuge Hence they start believing in god\n3ut basically they cannot trust that god is. They don't have any proof.\nThe proof comes only when you are blissful. The moment bliss explodes in your being You know god is.\nAnd there is no need to believe:\nOne simply knows god is, it is an intuitive feel Your whole being is overwhelmed with the proof, Now it is your experience.\nEven if the whole world says there is no god\nIt is not going to make any difference to you; You know it. They can deny\nThey can go on finding all kinds of arguments But how can they prove that god is not\nWhen you have tasted something of bliss?\nJust as misery disproves god, bliss proves god And because millions of people live in misery\nMillions of people only think they are religious. They are not, they cannot be.\nOnly very rarely will you come across A person who knows that god is.\nSo my effort here\nIs not to prove, not to argue for god 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Not to convince you that god exists But to help you to be blissful. God can be put aside\nThe whole problem is irrelevant.\nOnce you start moving in the direction of bliss - Which is your potential...\nYou are miserable because\nYou are doing something wrong with your energies You are miserable because you have not been able To create a harmony of your energies\nThere is a discord, a deep discord in your being Hence the misery. Misery simply means you are fragmentary\nAnd all the fragments\nAre in constant conflict, in constant friction You are falling apart. Your whole life is nothing but an effort\nTo go on keeping yourself together.\nThe same energies can become a great harmony. It is only a question of learning the art.\nIf you don't know how to play On some musical instrument You will create only noise\nYou will disturb people, that's all You can drive people mad!\nAnd the same instrument and the same hands And the same person\nCan create such celestial music\nBut he has to learn the art of playing Just by being alive\nOne does not know how to live Just by being born\nYou don't know the art of life. Meditation is the art of life\nIt is the fundamental art.\nOne who misses meditation misses all.\nThen he can have everything of the world But he will never have any experience\nOf peace, of bliss, of benediction.\nAnd god will remain just an abstract idea. Once you have started playing rightly\nWith your energies, creating an accord, a harmony A cosmos out of this chaos that you are\nSuddenly, thousands of proofs 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That god is become available to you,\nNot only that god is, but that only god is. Everything becomes divine\nEverything becomes godly.\nLet bliss be the goal -- forget all about god.\nOnce bliss is achieved god is experienced As a consequence, a natural consequence.\nJesus says, 'Blessed are the meek For theirs is the kingdom of god.'\nBecause he said that millions of people since Have tried to be meek, to be humble\nBut their effort has been wrong From the very beginning.\nFirst, they tried to be meek so that they Could enter into the kingdom of god.\nMeekness cannot be made a means. They misunderstood Jesus.\nHe was not saying, 'Be meek so that You can enter into the kingdom of god.' He was saying, 'Blessed are the meek For theirs is the kingdom of god.'\nThe kingdom of god is not the end And being meek is not the means. Being meek is an end unto itself; The kingdom of god is its fragrance.\nWhen the flower opens up there is fragrance But because people are always listening\nThrough a layer of sleep, they always go on Misunderstanding the Buddhas, the awakened ones. Many times it happens here:\nI say that if you meditate with a goal in mind Your meditation, from the very beginning\nHas gone wrong.\nIf you are trying to attain peace Through meditation\nYou will not even attain meditation itself. Meditation has to be done\nFor the sheer joy of doing it And then peace follows.\nI am not saying that peace does not come,\nIt comes, but it is not a question of your longing. If you are longing for it\nYou are not in meditation, you are in a desire. Now the desire is for peace.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So people say to me, 'Okay, then we will not desire peace But are you sure: if we do meditation\nWithout desiring peace, will we attain to it?' They are still persisting in their stupidity They are again bringing the same thing in From the backdoor.\nA person who wants\nTo enter into the kingdom of god\nIs not a meek person, he is not humble. Jesus says, 'Blessed are those\nWho are the last in this world, because\nThey will be the first in my kingdom of god.' But if somebody wants\nTo be first in the kingdom of god\nHe has missed the point. He can stand last He can be the very last in the world\nJust waiting for his chance in the other world And then he will show all these fools\nWho are standing in the queue ahead of him, 'Now see what happened -- you were presidents And prime ministers and this and that\nAnd I was just a humble person, the very last. Now this is my reward!\nI am the first and where are you? Now all the Nobel Prize winners\nGo and stand at the back of the queue.' But this is the same game\nPlayed on a different plane.\nThe message is tremendously significant But it is bound to be misunderstood.\nIt is bound to be misunderstood because people Are not listening to it through meditation\nThey are listening to it through mind. Let your meekness\nCome out of meditation, out of silence -- Let it come of its own accord\nThen it has a beauty of its own.\nIt is the most beautiful experience\nJust to be nobody, just to be utterly nobody. When one is utterly nobody\nWhen one has effaced oneself, One is just a pure emptiness.\nOf course, god enters into that emptiness. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He is simply waiting for that moment When you are is empty of yourself\nSo that he can enter you\nSo that he can abide in you. Become a lover,\nNot of somebody in particular Just become a lover in general. Let love become your quality\nNot just a relationship with somebody Because whenever love becomes relationship\nIt includes one but excludes the whole universe. It is a very dangerous bargain:\nChoosing one and excluding the whole universe. And the whole universe belongs to you\nYou belong to it. The whole universe Goes on showering its love to you\nAnd it is very ungrateful not to respond. So love the sun, the moon, the stars\nThe trees, the rivers, the mountains\nThe people, the animals -- simply be a lover And let the whole be your beloved.\nThat's exactly what makes a person religious. When your love spreads all over space\nWhen it knows no boundary\nWhen nothing confines it, when it is unlimited When it is not focussed on any object\nBut is just a state of being.\nThen love is prayer, then love is meditation And then love liberates.\nThe ordinary love binds, it creates a bondage. Of course, the chains are golden\nBut chains are chains, and golden chains Are far more dangerous than ordinary chains Because you become attached to them.\nYou think they are very precious\nYou think they are ornaments, not chains. The ordinary love is a relationship\nThe real love is a state of being. That's exactly the meaning of a lover\nA love not addressed to anybody in particular But addressed to the whole.\nSo whatsoever you touch You touch with deep love.\nAnd whatsoever you see, you see with deep love.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Wherever you are, you go on radiating love. Then there is no need to go To any church, to any temple\nBecause the whole existence becomes your temple. And then there is no need to bother about\nThe Bible and the Koran and the Vedas; The whole existence becomes your Bible. Then you can read god's messages\nIn the flowers, in the song of birds.\nEverywhere you will come across immense mysteries. Love opens doors upon doors, it goes on opening.\nThere is no end to mysteries.\nFor a real lover it is an unending journey Tremendously ecstatic.\nEach moment is full of bliss and benediction. Prem Niraj\nLove has many qualities which are also the qualities of a cloud. Hence the cloud can be used as a metaphor. The most fundamental quality of love is that it gives freedom; it is freedom. If it is not freedom then it is not love; it is something else\n-- beware of it! Something else is masquerading as love. It may even be hatred pretending to be love. It may be jealousy, possessiveness, domination, ego -- it may be any thing, but not love. The criterion to be used is freedom; if it gives you freedom, then only is it love.\nLove makes you free. The more you love, the more you are free. Ultimately you have the freedom of a cloud. The cloud is totally free, it has no fixed form, it is constantly changing, it is unpredictable.\nOne moment it looks like an elephant, another moment it looks like a tiger; one never knows. One moment it is moving towards the east, another moment it is moving towards the west. It is absolutely free, it is not rooted somewhere. It has no roots in the earth, hence it has no clinging, it is not attached; it is not obsessed with anything.\nLove is also just like that: without any roots without any clinging; floating like a cloud in absolute freedom.\nThe cloud is full of rain: it wants to share, it wants to rain. And that's what love is too: it is full of joy, peace, and it wants to shower it. It is full of juice and it wants to rain. And to whomsoever is ready to receive love is over-willing to give. It does not feel that the person who receives has any obligation towards it. No, not at all. On the contrary, love feels obliged. that the other helped it to be unburdened. The cloud feels obliged to the earth because the earth helped it to be unburdened. Love is always feeling obliged to everybody. And love never bothers much about whether the other is worthy of receiving it or not. These are miserly things, miserly attitudes. Love is never a miser.\nThe cloud never bothers about whether the earth is worthy. It rains on the mountains, it rains on the rocks; it rains everywhere and anywhere. It gives without any conditions attached, without any strings attached.\nAnd that's how love is: it simply gives, it enjoys giving. Whosoever is willing to receive, receives it.\nHe need not be worthy, he need not be in any special category, he need not fulfill any qualifications.\nIf all these things are required then what you are giving is not love. It must be something else, and you have not yet known what love is. Once you know what\nlove is you are ready to give; because you know the more you give, the more you have it. The more you go on showering on others, the more it goes on springing up in your being. Once this secret is known...\nThis is very strange economics. Ordinary economics is totally different: if you give something, you lose it. If you want to have it, avoid giving it. Collect it, be miserly. Just the opposite is the case with love: if you want to have it, don't be miserly; otherwise it will go dead, it will become stale; it will 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- stink, it will die. Go on giving, and fresh sources will become available Fresh streams will flow into your being. The whole existence starts pouring into you when your giving is unconditional, total.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #27\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2299","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2299 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

people say to me,</span></h3><p>'Okay, then we will not desire peace But are you sure: if we do
meditation</p><p>Without desiring peace, will we attain to it?' They are still
persisting in their stupidity They are again bringing the same thing in
From the backdoor.</p><p>A person who wants</p><p>To enter into the kingdom of god</p><p>Is not a meek person, he is not humble. Jesus says, 'Blessed are
those</p><p>Who are the last in this world, because</p><p>They will be the first in my kingdom of god.' But if somebody
wants</p><p>To be first in the kingdom of god</p><p>He has missed the point. He can stand last He can be the very last in
the world</p><p>Just waiting for his chance in the other world And then he will show
all these fools</p><p>Who are standing in the queue ahead of him, 'Now see what happened --
you were presidents And prime ministers and this and that</p><p>And I was just a humble person, the very last. Now this is my
reward!</p><p>I am the first and where are you? Now all the Nobel Prize winners</p><p>Go and stand at the back of the queue.' But this is the same game</p><p>Played on a different plane.</p><p>The message is tremendously significant But it is bound to be
misunderstood.</p><p>It is bound to be misunderstood because people Are not listening to
it through meditation</p><p>They are listening to it through mind. Let your meekness</p><p>Come out of meditation, out of silence -- Let it come of its own
accord</p><p>Then it has a beauty of its own.</p><p>It is the most beautiful experience</p><p>Just to be nobody, just to be utterly nobody. When one is utterly
nobody</p><p>When one has effaced oneself, One is just a pure emptiness.</p><p>Of course, god enters into that emptiness. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--he-is-simply-waiting-for-that-moment>Osho's

love become your quality</p><p>Not just a relationship with somebody Because whenever love becomes
relationship</p><p>It includes one but excludes the whole universe. It is a very
dangerous bargain:</p><p>Choosing one and excluding the whole universe. And the whole universe
belongs to you</p><p>You belong to it. The whole universe Goes on showering its love to
you</p><p>And it is very ungrateful not to respond. So love the sun, the moon,
the stars</p><p>The trees, the rivers, the mountains</p><p>The people, the animals -- simply be a lover And let the whole be
your beloved.</p><p>That's exactly what makes a person religious. When your love spreads
all over space</p><p>When it knows no boundary</p><p>When nothing confines it, when it is unlimited When it is not
focussed on any object</p><p>But is just a state of being.</p><p>Then love is prayer, then love is meditation And then love
liberates.</p><p>The ordinary love binds, it creates a bondage. Of course, the chains
are golden</p><p>But chains are chains, and golden chains Are far more dangerous than
ordinary chains Because you become attached to them.</p><p>You think they are very precious</p><p>You think they are ornaments, not chains. The ordinary love is a
relationship</p><p>The real love is a state of being. That's exactly the meaning of a
lover</p><p>A love not addressed to anybody in particular But addressed to the
whole.</p><p>So whatsoever you touch You touch with deep love.</p><p>And whatsoever you see, you see with deep love.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--wherever-you-are-you-go-on-radiating-love.>Osho's
books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished <span class=p>Query:-
Wherever you are, you go on radiating love.</span></h3><p>Then there is no need to go To any church, to any temple</p><p>Because the whole existence becomes your temple. And then there is no
need to bother about</p><p>The Bible and the Koran and the Vedas; The whole existence becomes
your Bible. Then you can read god's messages</p><p>In the flowers, in the song of birds.</p><p>Everywhere you will come across immense mysteries. Love opens doors
upon doors, it goes on opening.</p><p>There is no end to mysteries.</p><p>For a real lover it is an unending journey Tremendously ecstatic.</p><p>Each moment is full of bliss and benediction. Prem Niraj</p><p>Love has many qualities which are also the qualities of a cloud.
Hence the cloud can be used as a metaphor. The most fundamental quality
of love is that it gives freedom; it is freedom. If it is not freedom
then it is not love; it is something else</p><p>-- beware of it! Something else is masquerading as love. It may even
be hatred pretending to be love. It may be jealousy, possessiveness,
domination, ego -- it may be any thing, but not love. The criterion to
be used is freedom; if it gives you freedom, then only is it love.</p><p>Love makes you free. The more you love, the more you are free.
Ultimately you have the freedom of a cloud. The cloud is totally free,
it has no fixed form, it is constantly changing, it is
unpredictable.</p><p>One moment it looks like an elephant, another moment it looks like a
tiger; one never knows. One moment it is moving towards the east,
another moment it is moving towards the west. It is absolutely free, it
is not rooted somewhere. It has no roots in the earth, hence it has no
clinging, it is not attached; it is not obsessed with anything.</p><p>Love is also just like that: without any roots without any clinging;
floating like a cloud in absolute freedom.</p><p>The cloud is full of rain: it wants to share, it wants to rain. And
that's what love is too: it is full of joy, peace, and it wants to
shower it. It is full of juice and it wants to rain. And to whomsoever
is ready to receive love is over-willing to give. It does not feel that
the person who receives has any obligation towards it. No, not at all.
On the contrary, love feels obliged. that the other helped it to be
unburdened. The cloud feels obliged to the earth because the earth
helped it to be unburdened. Love is always feeling obliged to everybody.
And love never bothers much about whether the other is worthy of
receiving it or not. These are miserly things, miserly attitudes. Love
is never a miser.</p><p>The cloud never bothers about whether the earth is worthy. It rains
on the mountains, it rains on the rocks; it rains everywhere and
anywhere. It gives without any conditions attached, without any strings
attached.</p><p>And that's how love is: it simply gives, it enjoys giving. Whosoever
is willing to receive, receives it.</p><p>He need not be worthy, he need not be in any special category, he
need not fulfill any qualifications.</p><p>If all these things are required then what you are giving is not
love. It must be something else, and you have not yet known what love
is. Once you know what</p><p>love is you are ready to give; because you know the more you give,
the more you have it. The more you go on showering on others, the more
it goes on springing up in your being. Once this secret is known...</p><p>This is very strange economics. Ordinary economics is totally
different: if you give something, you lose it. If you want to have it,
avoid giving it. Collect it, be miserly. Just the opposite is the case
with love: if you want to have it, don't be miserly; otherwise it will
go dead, it will become stale; it will 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query->Osho's books

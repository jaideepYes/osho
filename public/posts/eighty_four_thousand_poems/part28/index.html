It is for reference purposes only.]\nMeditation is the real beginning of life. The first birth is not the beginning of life, The first birth is only\nThe beginning of an opportunity to live.\nThe first birth only makes you potentially alive Not actually alive. That potentiality\nHas to be transformed into actuality Then only do you become really alive. And meditation is the art\nOf transforming the potential into the actual, Of transforming the seed into the flower.\nIt is through meditation\nThat one attains the second birth. With the first birth the body is born With the second, the soul.\nAnd only when we come to know that we are a soul Is our life fulfilled, Otherwise it is a sheer wastage.\nThe seed remained a seed, it never sprouted It never became a tree, it never flowered.\nNobody rested under its shade No birds ever came to visit it No winds danced around it.\nThere was no dialogue with\nThe clouds, the sun, the moon, the stars.\nThe seed cannot communicate with existence. It is closed, encapsulated within itself.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Meditation opens you up. Meditation is nothing but\nOpening multi-dimensionally to all that is\nTo the beauty of existence To the music of the winds To the freedom of the clouds\nTo all the mysteries that surround you To all that is without and within.\nWhen you become open and available to all this For the first time you realise that\nLife is not what you used to think it was. It is immensely valuable\nEach moment of it is sacred\nAnd each moment there is the possibility\nOf meeting the divine, of meeting the ultimate. All that is needed is an opening on our side.\nThe divine is always available But we are not available.\nGod is always knocking on our door But we are deaf.\nHe is standing in front of us, but we are blind. And when you become aware\nThat existence is divine, it is not just matter, You also become aware that it is immortal\nIt is deathless, it is eternal.\nThen all fear disappears.\nLife for the first time becomes A dance and a celebration.\nAnd when life is a celebration I call it religious.\nMy sannyasins have to become Songs and dances and celebrations. A man without meditation\nIs a failure, an utter failure. Even though he may be\nThe riches man in the world, he is a failure. He may be Alexander the Great\nHe may have conquered the whole world -- 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He is still a failure. Nothing succeeds except meditation. Everything fails, sooner or later.\nAnd the sooner it fails, the better, because Then you have time to do something.\nYou have time to find ways to be victorious. The unfortunate ones are those\nWho realise their failure\nWhen life has slipped out of their hands. Alexander himself realised it\nBut at the last moment.\nHe died a very disappointed, disillusioned man. But there was no way out.\nNow nothing could be done. He had been to India\nHe had met many mystics here\nAnd he had been impressed by one mystic very much. His biographers remember that mystic.\nThey call him 'Dandamis' --\nIt does not seem to be exactly the name, It must be some mispronunciation\nOf an Indian name.\nBut they say Alexander was Tremendously influenced by Dandamis. Dandamis was a naked fakir\nAnd Alexander was so impressed\nThat he wanted Dandamis to go with him. He offered him all luxury, all comfort.\nHe would be a royal guest.\nBut Dandamis laughed and he said, 'You cannot persuade me\nBecause I have found the treasure\nWhich nobody can offer to me any more. Nothing better can be offered to me.\nWhat you are talking about are toys. I am finished with all that\nAnd it is better that you also finish Otherwise you will repent later on.' Alexander was angry -- he said,\n'I am inviting you and if you don't come with me I can force you to come.' Dandamis said, 'Nobody can force me.\nYou can kill me but you cannot force me And remember, while killing me 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You will think you are killing me, But you will be deceived. You can kill the body --\nI am not my body.\nTake out your sword and cut off my head:\nWhen my head falls on the ground You will see it falling\nAnd I will also see it falling on the ground. You will be a witness to it\nI will also be a witness to it. It is not me!'\nWhen he was dying\nThen he remembered this man. But it was too late.\nHe had never realised that he was not his body. The body was dying and he had always lived With the idea that he was the body.\nNow death was too much for him. And he had seen this man laughing\nInviting death, asking him to take out his sword And kill him. He said to his people who were around him,\n'I am remembering that man --\nHe certainly realised something Which I have missed.\nI am a failure and he was victorious.'\nIt is through meditation that one realises that, 'I am not the body, not the mind either\nBut just a witness.'\nAnd that witness knows no failure, no frustration. That witness is god himself.\nSeek it and remember Jesus:\nSeek, and ye shall find\nKnock, and the doors shall be opened unto you. Consciousness has no boundaries,\nIt is not bounded by the body or the mind. It is unbounded\nIt is as vast as the whole universe.\nBut because we have become identified with the body We are suffering. The root cause of our suffering is that\nSuch a vast entity is being forced Into such a small space.\nWe are imprisoned. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- We have to become free of this prison. And it is only a question\nOf changing our attitude -- nothing else. You will remain in the body\nThe body will remain there, Just your identifying changes:\nYou are no more identified with the body. You start using the body as a vehicle, Just as you use a car.\nYou don't become your car.\nJust think of the misery of the man Who becomes his car.\nHe will immediately say that he has gone mad. Something goes wrong in the engine\nAnd he starts crying and weeping And he goes to the doctor saying, 'Do something.\nSomething seems to be wrong with me,' Because he cannot distinguish\nBetween his car and himself. That's exactly the case:\nThe body is only a vehicle.\nUse it but don't become identified with it. And so is the case with the mind.\nThe mind is only a computer: use it But don't become identified with it. Remain a witness.\nAnd the more you are a witness The more you are free\nThe more you are unbounded\nThe more you start becoming oceanic. Then even the sky is not your limit.\nTo feel that unlimitedness is to feel god. That's the ultimate goal of meditation.\nThe secret of immortality is not such a secret That it cannot be discovered. In fact it is an open secret:\nJust a little bit of digging inside yourself And you can discover it.\nJust a few layers of garbage have to be removed; We call that garbage the mind. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Thoughts and desires and memories Are crowding inside\nAnd because of the crowd We cannot see our own truth.\nOnce we are able to create a little gap A little space\nThe truth is discovered.\nThe truth is that we are immortal The truth is that we were never born And we will never die\nThat birth and death are episodes In our eternal life.\nThousands of times we have taken birth\nAnd thousands of times we have left the body. It is because of this mind\nWe go on coming back again and again. It is because of the mind that\nThe wheel of birth and death goes on moving. If we drop out of the mind the wheel stops.\nAnd that's the whole art of meditation How to drop out of this mind and\nHow to enter the space called no-mind. Mind is arbitrary. accidental\nNo-mind is your real nature, your very being. To discover it is to discover the Buddha within. And once you have tasted\nSomething of your innermost core You have tasted the sweetest\nThe-most delicious experience of life. There is nothing higher than that Nothing more precious than that,\n[Her name, Christa, is a beautiful one, Bhagwan tells a German woman taking sannyas. But it has lost its real meaning and had something imposed on it which is incorrect: the dictionaries say it means a follower of Christ. That's not its true meaning.]\nA Christa means Christ himself, not a follower. It is not a question of following\nIt is a question of becoming\nIt is a question of being a Christ.\nFriedrich Nietzsche used to say again and again That the first and the last Christian\nDied on the cross two thousand years ago,\nThe first and the last -- and he was right Because only Christ was a true Christian. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Others have been only followers And followers are imitators Followers are carbon copies.\nNever be carbon copy; be your original face. And that's the way of being a Christ or a Buddha. These words don't belong to any individual.\nChrist has nothing to do with Jesus Buddha has nothing to do with Gautam. Gautam is one of the Buddhas\nAnd Jesus is one of the Christs. One can call Jesus a Buddha\nAnd one can call Gautam the Christ -- There is no difference, no problem.\nAnybody who has realised himself is a Christ. Christ simply means the crowned one\nOne who has been crowned by god himself\nOne who has come home, one who has been Received back into the Garden of Eden.\nAdam was expelled. When he returns\nFinds out his mistake, his error\nRemembers the joys and the beauties of paradise And comes back, he is received, welcomed.\nThat welcome makes him a Christ. Everybody is an Adam and everybody Has the potential to become a Christ.\nAdam means Christ gone astray Christ means Adam has come back home.\nBecome a Christ -- never be a follower. That's the only way to love\nPeople like Christ and Buddha. Followers don't love\nThey are not courageous enough to be lovers. They are cowards, they are hoping to be saved. They want to throw the responsibility\nOn somebody else.\nThey worship in order not to change themselves.\nIt is Christ's duty to save them. Their duty is to go astray\nAnd Christ's duty is to save them. What kind of logic is this?\nWhy should Christ save you?\nYou should save yourself. Learn from Christ 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Learn the art of saving yourself Learn the fact that one man has saved himself Hence you can also save yourself.\nThis is the way of the lover Not the way of the follower.\n[His name has two meanings, Bhagwan tells Oscar, an Italian.\nThe Teutonic meaning is divine spirit, the Celtic, a leaping, bounding warrior. Just a little change\nAnd both names will fit together. Leaping, bounding warrior\nHas to be changed a little bit:\nLeaping, bounding sannyasin! And then there is no problem -- Then it fits with divine spirit.\nA warrior does not fit with divine spirit, A warrior is basically an evil spirit.\nThe soldier and the sannyasin are two poles. The soldier is the ugliest possibility\nAnd the sannyasin, the most beautiful. The soldier means destruction\nAnd the sannyasin means creativity.\nThe soldier is violence, the sannyasin is love. The soldier cannot be divine\nOnly a sannyasin can be divine. So we will have to change\nThe meaning of the word a little bit. It can be done because no language Has any absoluteness about it.\nAll languages are arbitrary So one can play around!\nIt is just our agreement\nAs to what a word should mean.\nFor me, Oscar will means divine spirit, A leaping, bounding sannyasin.\nTry your best!\n[During the course of his talking to Oscar Bhagwan has registered that Oscar is minus one or two teeth.]\n[A chuckle overrides his words as he adds]\nAnd don't lose more teeth -- leap and bound, but carefully! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Love is the only thing that is really precious. All else is mundane.\nLove is sacred because it is through love That one attains to prayer.\nIt is through love that one creates the bridge Between oneself and god. It is through love that we become aware that\nLife is tremendously significant, meaningful. Without love life is empty, meaningless\nIn fact, absurd.\nWithout love there is no reason to live -- Why? For what?\nOne of the greatest existential philosophers, Marcel, used to say that\nThe most important problem in life is suicide. Why not commit suicide?\nHe used to think that that was\nThe most important thing to be decided. Existentialists think that it is just\nBecause of our cowardliness that we go on living And they are right About ninety-nine point nine per cent of people.\nIt is simply because of cowardliness That people go on dragging.\nThey have no meaning in their life But they are also afraid of death.\nWho knows? -- it may be even worse. At least life seems to be familiar.\nAnd we are not alone:\nSo many fools are all around. The ship of life is full of fools.\nAnd there is so much hustle and bustle And so much occupation that one Tends to forget all real problems of life.\nSmall problems are so many\nDaily, routine problems are so many -- How to manage bread and butter\nAnd how to manage the ordinary life --\nAnd life's ordinary challenges are so many that There is no time left to think about whether\nLife has any meaning or not. That's why poor people\nHave no problem as far as meaning is concerned. It is only the rich people\nWho start thinking about 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- What the meaning of life is. It is the rich countries\nFor whom the problem becomes really big. The richer a country becomes\nThe more and more people start thinking 'What is the meaning of it all?'\nHence I say that\nExistentialists are right.\nAbout ninety-nine point nine per cent of people. But they are not really right,\nBecause that point one per cent Has the master key.\nBuddhas are not many, Christs are not many Krishnas are not many\nBut their life has tremendous significance Meaning, overflowing joy\nTheir each breath is a song\nTheir each moment is full of splendour Their whole life is nothing but a dance.\nTheir life (words missing) cannot be contained In any song, in any music; Everything falls short.\nTheir grace is so infinite Their bliss is so vast.\nAnd this is possible for everybody, We just have to work for it.\nI perfectly agree with Marcel:\nSuicide is one of the greatest problems\nBut only one; the second problem Which is even bigger than suicide Is sannyas.\nAnd one has to choose between the two: Either suicide or sannyas.\nSuicide is simply stupid.\nSannyas is the art of transforming your life From meaninglessness into meaning.\nIt gives dance to your feet It changes your life\nInto eighty-four thousand songs.\nImmeasurable joy, unaccountable bliss is yours. Just a little work is needed upon on self.\nIt is worth it -- that work has to be done.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"2786","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2786 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark54>‌</span>Chapter title:

It is for reference purposes only.]\nBliss is a moon.\nIt is far closer to the moon than to the sun Because bliss is peace, silence, calmness And these are the qualities of the moon.\nThe sun is hot, passionate.\nThe moon is compassionate, cool. Happiness is closer to the sun --\nIt is an excitement. So is pleasure. It is even hotter than happiness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Happiness is just in between pleasure and bliss. But bliss is absolutely cool, not cold -- remember. Fully alive but absolutely peaceful\nUtterly peaceful.\nWe cannot understand it Unless we have experienced it\nBecause we have known many kinds of joys But they are all hot.\nThey are all kinds of excitement. And that is the difference Between bliss and pleasure\nBliss is not hot at all.\nIt is so cool that not only the person Who experiences it becomes cool, Whosoever comes close to him Also feels the coolness\nAs if a subtle cool breeze Surrounds the man of bliss. Remember it\nThat we have to move from the hot sun\nFrom the passionate, hot energies Towards the cool energies of the moon. The moon represents something spiritual The sun represents something sexual.\nThe sun represents life\nThe moon represents something higher than life Transcendental to life. Hence in many old cultures the sun was\nNever considered to be as important as the moon.\nAnd many ancient calenders are based on the moon Not on the sun For the simple reason that\nAlthough mathematically\nThe calender based on the sun Is far more scientific...\nThe calendar based on the moon is not so exact. In cannot be, it is far more poetic\nNot so arithmetical, not so scientific, It cannot be.\nBut if we look deep into the human body Then we will be surprised.\nNow researchers are working on it And they find there is a synchronisity\nBetween the human body and the moon. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The woman's monthly course, her monthly period Depends on the moon, not on the sun,\nHence it comes every twenty-eight days. And now researchers are finding\nThat there is something\nExactly like it in man's body too Something like a period, a monthly period. Of course there is no visible sign\nBut just as for four or five days The woman goes into a turmoil\nThe man also goes into a certain turmoil Every month, after twenty-eight days.\nAnd now they have found\nThat many more people commit suicide\nOn moon-lit nights than on no- moon nights. Many more people go mad on moon-lit nights Than on no-moon nights.\nAnd it has been a long, long established fact\nThat many more people have become enlightened On the full-moon night than on any other night.\nCertainly one has never heard\nOf a man becoming enlightened in the day. Up to now it has not happened.\nSomething seems to be very deeply connected With the moon and the phases of the moon.\nSo remember it, that bliss is a cool phenomenon And become more and more cool and calm\nAnd quiet and collected.\nThat is the preparation for bliss to descend. Remember always\nThat unless you have attained unshakeable bliss Life is a defeat, a failure. Even if you possess the whole world\nYou have failed.\nYou may be Alexander the Great Still, you miss the whole point. Bliss has to be attained.\nAnd bliss means a joy\nThat is not dependent on anybody else\nThat is not dependent on anything at all That is simply yours\nThat wells up within your being. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Pleasure is dependent on others Hence it is a kind of slavery.\nIt is sometimes nice and sometimes bitter But it is a slavery\nAnd a slavery cannot be very nice. Maybe we can manage to sugar-coat it We can make chains out of gold\nBut chains are chains.\nWe can decorate the prison\nBut a prison is a prison, it is not a home. Pleasure is dependent on others.\nBliss is independent, totally independent. That's is beauty.\nYou can be blissful all alone, by yourself. It gives you absolute freedom.\nThat is the goal of sannyas. Bliss is always unique.\nPleasure is the same -- it is not much different. You possess a beautiful house\nSomebody else possesses a beautiful house -- It is the same kind of thing\nNothing special about it.\nBecause the house is something outside you It is an objective thing.\nBut bliss is a subjective phenomenon. It is absolutely yours\nNobody can participate in it\nNobody can go with you to share it with you, You are all alone there.\nIt is utterly individual\nIt is absolutely unique , it is virgin. Everything else in life is used by others.\nIt is always second-hand, it is never virgin. But bliss is virgin: nobody can us it Nobody can have any approach to it.\nIt is simply unapproachable.\nOnly you can enter\nInto that innermost shrine of your being In your total aloneness.\nYou can't even take your friends there. That's the beauty of it: its utter virginity Its absolute individuality, its authenticity. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Seek and search for bliss And don't be distracted\nBy the small pleasures of life.\nPut your whole energy into the real search. Sannyas is a decision, a commitment\nA great commitment to this ultimate search, This search for bliss\nBliss is god; god is another name for bliss. The first half of your name, Holger, Comes from 'holmi'\nWhich means an island.\nAnd remember, no man is an island.\nWe are part of a vast continent.\nThe very idea of being an island is egoistic. We are not islands, we are part of infinity. Unbounded we are\nThere is no definition, no limit to us. So go beyond the idea of the island.\nAnd the second part, 'geirr,' means spear -- That is even more dangerous.\nBut the ego is always violent The ego always has a spear. Or if it is very modern\nThen it has an atom bomb.\nBut the ego is always destructive. The spear represents destructiveness. So you have to go beyond both\nYou have to go beyond holger. From now onwards remember Your name is VEET Holger:\nOne who is trying to go beyond holger. You are not to be a spear\nYou are not to be an island.\nYou have to be love and you have to be vast As vast as the whole sky is.\nLife can be either just a heap of flowers Or, it can be transformed into a garland. If it is just a heap of flowers\nIt has no organic unity, it is only a crowd Of many selves, of many I's\nAll struggling and fighting for supremacy.\nMan lives in a constant inner war, and every self 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Tries to pull you in a different direction. You are always falling to pieces.\nLife can be lived in a totally different way. Those flowers which are separate\nCan be connected by a thread,\nBy something that runs through all of them By a sense of direction, by awareness\nBy being more conscious. Then life is no more accidental Then it is no more a crowd,\nYou start having an integrated being.\nAnd the more crystallised and integrated you are, The more joy is possible. How much bliss you will be able to receive\nDepends on your integrity.\nThe fragmentary person remains miserable The integrated person attains to bliss.\nSannyas has to become the thread So that you can join all the flowers Of your life in a kind of togetherness So life becomes not just a noise\nBut an orchestra.\nThen there is great beauty and great bliss.\nLife in its reality is unbounded, it is infinite It is not confined to the body Not confined to the mind either.\nIt is not confined at all; it is oceanic. Even oceans have certain limits\nBut life has no limits at all,\nIt has no beginning and no end. But we have become too identified With the body and the mind.\nWe have completely forgotten\nThat this is not our reality.\nThe body is only a caravanserai. We have lived in many bodies, This is not the first time\nThat you are staying in a hotel, You have stayed in many hotels.\nAnd even though it is a five-star hotel It is only a hotel.\nAnd you are not it.\nYou are the traveller, the pilgrim, the life The consciousness that goes on moving 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- From one body to another, from One mind to another, from one form to another. The day we realise that we are formless\nIs a great day. That is the day of revelation. After that we are never the same again.\nAfter that we are part of god And god is part of us.\nWe don't know who we are, That's the only problem And out of that one problem\nA thousand and one other problems arise. And people go on trying\nTo solve those thousand and one problems. They cannot be solved\nBecause the root problem remains.\nAnd out of the root new sprouts go on coming up. We have to cut the root\nWe have to know the most fundamental thing Of ourselves, about ourselves: who we are.\nAnd the only way is meditation. When the mind is absolutely silent\nSuddenly, when the noise is no more there, All is clear, you are transparent to yourself. Suddenly you see you are godly\nAnd so is the whole existence.\nThen there is no problem, no anxiety Because there is no death.\nEverything\nThat was important before becomes unimportant And everything\nThat you had never thought was important Becomes important. It is a radical change. No one is less than a god\nBecause only god exists and nothing else. In the rock god exists as rock\nIn the sun god exists as the sun In man god exists as man\nIn woman god exists as woman.\nThese are all his forms. There is no hierarchy: Nobody is higher and nobody is lower.\nThe whole idea of hierarchy is egoistic. Man thinks himself\nThe highest manifestation of god. That is all bullshit!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- A rose flower is as high as anything can be. It is a different manifestation\nAnd a different dimension -- There is no comparison possible. To look at life as one existence\nIs the beginning of a great pilgrimage. And dropping the idea of hierarchy\nIs dropping the very foundation of the ego. Nobody is lower, nobody is higher.\nWe are made of the same stuff,\nHence the rock is as divine as you are. Treat the whole existence as divine.\nAnd the moment you start\nTreating the whole existence as divine New visions, new horizons open up Which were never available to you Because your eyes were too clouded With the ego and egoistic clouds\nAnd there was too much smoke:\nYou could not see clearly.\nIn the Upanishads the ancient mystics declared 'Aham Brahmasmi' -- I am god.\nThe great Sufi mystic, Al Hillaj Mansoor\nDeclared 'Ana'l Haq' -- I am truth.\nBut remember, they are using the word 'I' Not to represent the ego,\nIn their I all the 'I' of the world are included Nothing is excluded.\nSunrise is the color of sannyas, orange is the color of sannyas. It represents the end of the night and the beginning of a new day. Initiation into sannyas is a sunrise and a sunrise that never stops: once it has risen, it has risen. In fact it has always been there. We were just not aware of it. It is eternally there. The inner light is always there: it never rises, it never sets.\nBut metaphorically we can say it is a sunrise because the moment we become aware is the moment of the beginning for us at least.\nThink of sannyas as a discontinuity with the past. Let the whole past be the night and let it be lost in the darkness of the night. It was all a dream. Now start a new style of life, the life of awareness.\nEach gesture has its own significance. For example\nHitler made the fist his symbolic gesture. That represents violence\nThat represents the animal side of man. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That too is a mudra, but the ugliest possible. It is destructive.\nBuddha sitting silently Represents a divine gesture.\nAnd whatsoever he used to say to people Was at the same time\nAlso communicated by his hands.\nIf he was talking about love, his hands Were showing a certain gesture of love.\nIf he was talking about nirvana, then his hands Were showing something about nirvana.\nBuddha is the first person\nIn the whole history of humanity\nWho used body language to its utmost. Only now, recently, within twenty years\nScientists have started to discover body language. Without saying a word\nThe body goes on saying many things. You may be sitting with somebody Not saying a single word\nBut if you are not feeling good with his presence Your body is in a withdrawal posture.\nIt may not be possible to actually withdraw, Maybe you are sitting in a train or in a bus\nAnd you cannot escape anywhere But your whole body will show\nThat you are leaning away from him. If you love the company of the person You may not say a single word\nBut your body will be leaning towards him. These are all unconscious gestures.\nBut when a Buddha uses his body as language They are all conscious gestures\nThey are all divine gestures.\nThe way he walks, the way he moves his hands The way he eats, are all divine gestures\nThey are all mudras.\nAnd if one becomes conscious Of one's body language\nIt is a tremendous leap into meditation. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So be conscious of your body language Watch what your body is saying.\nStart by being aware of the body\nThen move towards a subtler awareness Of the mind\nThen move to the even more subtle awareness Of feelings.\nThese are the three layers: body, mind, heart. And when you have become aware\nOf all these three\nThen you can take the ultimate jump And become aware of your being.\nThat is the fourth\nThat is self-realisation or god-realisation. To be a disciple\nIs one of the greatest experiences in life Because it means dissolving yourself With the energy of your master\nLosing yourself in something Which is far bigger than you.\nIt is like a river disappearing in the ocean. Tremendous love is needed\nOnly then can one gather enough courage.\nTrust is needed, and not ordinary trust; Absolute trust is needed.\nIf it is not whole-hearted Then you will go only so far. And with a master\nYou have either to got totally or not at all; It is a question of either-or.\nThose who go half-heartedly\nAre cunning people, calculative people. They miss the whole opportunity.\nBy becoming a sannyasin You are becoming a disciple. This is the beginning\nOf a great experiment in your life Of dropping the ego\nOf dropping all attachments With your personality\nOf dropping all your identity And moving into the unknown. Once you have moved\nOnce you have tasted the freedom of the unknown 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Then there is no problem. Only the first step is the problem The second step follows easily.\nThe first is followed by the second Without any effort on your part.\nThe first step is the greatest problem Because the first step goes against All your past experience.\nA disciple\nHas to be ready to drop the whole past\nAnd in fact there is nothing much in the past. We unnecessarily cling to it.\nThere is only misery, but still we think 'It is our past', so we go on carrying it. Just look -- what is there to carry?\nWhat is there to cling to?\nSeeing that there is nothing to cling to The past drops out of your hands Suddenly you move in the present.\nAnd the master can be contacted only\nIn the present because he lives in the present He has no past and no future. Unless the disciple also lives in the present\nThere is no communion possible.

not on the sun,</p><p>Hence it comes every twenty-eight days. And now researchers are
finding</p><p>That there is something</p><p>Exactly like it in man's body too Something like a period, a monthly
period. Of course there is no visible sign</p><p>But just as for four or five days The woman goes into a turmoil</p><p>The man also goes into a certain turmoil Every month, after
twenty-eight days.</p><p>And now they have found</p><p>That many more people commit suicide</p><p>On moon-lit nights than on no- moon nights. Many more people go mad
on moon-lit nights Than on no-moon nights.</p><p>And it has been a long, long established fact</p><p>That many more people have become enlightened On the full-moon night
than on any other night.</p><p>Certainly one has never heard</p><p>Of a man becoming enlightened in the day. Up to now it has not
happened.</p><p>Something seems to be very deeply connected With the moon and the
phases of the moon.</p><p>So remember it, that bliss is a cool phenomenon And become more and
more cool and calm</p><p>And quiet and collected.</p><p>That is the preparation for bliss to descend. Remember always</p><p>That unless you have attained unshakeable bliss Life is a defeat, a
failure. Even if you possess the whole world</p><p>You have failed.</p><p>You may be Alexander the Great Still, you miss the whole point. Bliss
has to be attained.</p><p>And bliss means a joy</p><p>That is not dependent on anybody else</p><p>That is not dependent on anything at all That is simply yours</p><p>That wells up within your being. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--pleasure-is-dependent-on-others>Osho's

Pleasure is dependent on others</span></h3><p>Hence it is a kind of slavery.</p><p>It is sometimes nice and sometimes bitter But it is a slavery</p><p>And a slavery cannot be very nice. Maybe we can manage to sugar-coat
it We can make chains out of gold</p><p>But chains are chains.</p><p>We can decorate the prison</p><p>But a prison is a prison, it is not a home. Pleasure is dependent on
others.</p><p>Bliss is independent, totally independent. That's is beauty.</p><p>You can be blissful all alone, by yourself. It gives you absolute
freedom.</p><p>That is the goal of sannyas. Bliss is always unique.</p><p>Pleasure is the same -- it is not much different. You possess a
beautiful house</p><p>Somebody else possesses a beautiful house -- It is the same kind of
thing</p><p>Nothing special about it.</p><p>Because the house is something outside you It is an objective
thing.</p><p>But bliss is a subjective phenomenon. It is absolutely yours</p><p>Nobody can participate in it</p><p>Nobody can go with you to share it with you, You are all alone
there.</p><p>It is utterly individual</p><p>It is absolutely unique , it is virgin. Everything else in life is
used by others.</p><p>It is always second-hand, it is never virgin. But bliss is virgin:
nobody can us it Nobody can have any approach to it.</p><p>It is simply unapproachable.</p><p>Only you can enter</p><p>Into that innermost shrine of your being In your total aloneness.</p><p>You can't even take your friends there. That's the beauty of it: its
utter virginity Its absolute individuality, its authenticity.

at life as one existence</p><p>Is the beginning of a great pilgrimage. And dropping the idea of
hierarchy</p><p>Is dropping the very foundation of the ego. Nobody is lower, nobody
is higher.</p><p>We are made of the same stuff,</p><p>Hence the rock is as divine as you are. Treat the whole existence as
divine.</p><p>And the moment you start</p><p>Treating the whole existence as divine New visions, new horizons open
up Which were never available to you Because your eyes were too clouded
With the ego and egoistic clouds</p><p>And there was too much smoke:</p><p>You could not see clearly.</p><p>In the Upanishads the ancient mystics declared 'Aham Brahmasmi' -- I
am god.</p><p>The great Sufi mystic, Al Hillaj Mansoor</p><p>Declared 'Ana'l Haq' -- I am truth.</p><p>But remember, they are using the word 'I' Not to represent the
ego,</p><p>In their I <em>all</em> the 'I' of the world are included Nothing is
excluded.</p><p>Sunrise is the color of sannyas, orange is the color of sannyas. It
represents the end of the night and the beginning of a new day.
Initiation into sannyas is a sunrise and a sunrise that never stops:
once it has risen, it has risen. In fact it has always been there. We
were just not aware of it. It is eternally there. The inner light is
always there: it never rises, it never sets.</p><p>But metaphorically we can say it is a sunrise because the moment we
become aware is the moment of the beginning for us at least.</p><p>Think of sannyas as a discontinuity with the past. Let the whole past
be the night and let it be lost in the darkness of the night. It was all
a dream. Now start a new style of life, the life of awareness.</p><p>Each gesture has its own significance. For example</p><p>Hitler made the fist his symbolic gesture. That represents
violence</p><p>That represents the animal side of man. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--that-too-is-a-mudra-but-the-ugliest-possible.>Osho's

Not saying a single word</p><p>But if you are not feeling good with his presence Your body is in a

person You may not say a single word</p><p>But your body will be leaning towards him. These are all unconscious
gestures.</p><p>But when a Buddha uses his body as language They are all conscious
gestures</p><p>They are all divine gestures.</p><p>The way he walks, the way he moves his hands The way he eats, are all

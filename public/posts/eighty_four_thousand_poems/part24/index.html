The ego prevents him penetrating us The ego keeps him away from us.\nExcept for the ego\nThere is no distance between you and god. The ego is the only barrier, the only wall. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is of our creation\nAnd we can dismantle it any moment. We have put it together, brick by brick\nAnd brick by brick we have to dismantle it. We have to be very conscious\nNot to feed the ego any more Not to strengthen it any more Because it is our weakness.\nThe stronger the ego is, the weaker we are Because god is less and less available to us.\nAnd he is really our strength, our nourishment Our very being. We are rooted in him, but because of the ego\nWe are not totally rooted in him -- Only very partially;\nMaybe one root here and one root there But ninety-nine per cent of the roots Have come out of the soil.\nThat is the misery of man:\nMan has become an uprooted tree. The whole effort of religions is\nTo help you to get rooted again in god. God is our soil, is our strength\nIs our life, is our very being. But nothing can be done directly Unless you remove the ego.\nSo there is no need to worry about god No need even to think about god\nNo need to believe in god. Do only one thing:\nDon't believe in the ego\nAnd start dismantling it from this very moment. As you start dismantling it\nSmall windows will start opening\nAnd you will be able to see the sky beyond. Soon you will be surprised by\nHow much you were missing How much light was available Just knocking on the wall, How much life was available. It was just yours.\nIt was waiting for you\nBut you were hiding behind a wall Of your own creation.\nDropping the ego\nIs the only method to be really alive. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Sannyas means precisely that. God is known\nOnly when you are in deep peace In profound peace.\nPeace attained becomes his temple\nAnd he immediately enters into the temple. We need not invite him,\nIn fact how can we invite him? We don't know his address\nWe don't know his name.\nIn fact he has no name, no address, no form. But we can do one thing\nWe can make our being a beautiful temple. That is within our capacity.\nWe can make it spacious.\nWe can empty ourselves totally of our ego\nOur lust, our greed, our anger.\nWe can empty ourselves of all that continuously Goes on accumulating inside us. It is all junk!\nOnce we are utterly empty\nIn that purity of emptiness, the temple is ready. And immediately, instantly,\nNot even a single moment is lost, God enters into the temple.\nWhenever the temple is ready God immediately appears. Suddenly you are full of something unknown\nSomething mysterious, something blissful Something liberating, something transforming Something eternal.\nThat experience is multi-dimensional Hence it is indescribable.\nIt is so vast, no word can adequately express it But it can be experienced. My effort here is not to teach you\nCertain principles, morality, ideals, But to teach you only one thing: How to prepare the right ground\nIn which god appears of his own accord.\nI don't give you any philosophy\nBut only a simple technique to cleanse yourself To purify yourself. Once you are pure everything else follows.\nAll the morality\nThat you have always tried and failed Starts blooming on its own.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- All those beautiful qualities that you Have always hankered for and found impossible Simply become spontaneous.\nAnd when those qualities are spontaneous They have a beauty of their own.\nThey are not cultivated and artificial They are not planted from the outside.\nThey are welling up from your own inner being. They are like beautiful flowers growing in you. Man can become a tremendous flowering.\nAnd it is always spring We just have to be in tune\nWe just have to be attuned with the spring And immediately miracles become possible. And remember\nYou are entitled to all these miracles Everyone is entitled to all these miracles! Very few people are capable of seeing.\nThe ordinary eyes are not real eyes Because the ordinary eyes can only see The superficial, the mundane, the ordinary. We need a different kind of vision.\nWe need different eyes which can see deeper Which can see not only the superficial\nBut the essential\nWhich are capable of seeing the invisible The mysterious, the miraculous.\nMeditation is the art\nOf creating those new eyes, those inner eyes. We cannot open those inner eyes right now Because the inner world is so full of\nThoughts, desires, memories, imagination, dreams That there is no space. Our inner eyes are too burdened with dust.\nAll that dust has to be removed. That's what meditation is all about:\nRemoving the dust of thoughts From the inner consciousness, Cleansing the inner consciousness As one cleanses a mirror.\nJust a moment before\nWhen the layer of dust was there The mirror was not a mirror Because it was not mirroring 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It was not reflecting anything. It was non-existential.\nRemove the dust, clean the mirror and suddenly It starts reflecting that which is. The process is exactly the same.\nWe have to remove thoughts\nWe have to remove the whole mind The process of all that mind implies: The past, the future, the worries\nThe projections, the ideologies The hopes, the desires.\nThey are all different kinds of thoughts Different kinds of dust\nOnly colours differ, otherwise they are the same. Once your mirror is clean you become a seer And to be a seer\nIs the greatest experience in life Because then you see\nThat only god exists And nothing else\nAnd that realisation is liberation. There is no greater bliss than that That is the ultimate ecstasy.\nAnd unless it is achieved one has to wander In search, one has to remain thirsty\nAnd the thirst goes on becoming more and more And the desert seems to be unending\nAnd there seems to be no oasis at all. Once you have known that ecstasy You have come back home.\nThen there is rest and relaxation.\nThen each moment is pure celebration. Everyone is unique; uniqueness is universal. You are nat unique compared to somebody else You are as unique as the other is.\nWhen I use the word 'unique'\nI don't use it in a comparative sense I am simply stating a facts\nNo comparison i8 involved. Everyone is so unique, so individual That no two persons are ever alike. Not only right now\nIs there nobody who is like you,\nThere has never been and there will never be. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is impossible for the simple reason that God is not an assembly line; god is a creator And the creator never repeats.\nIf you go into the garden you will not find\nTwo leaves similar or two flowers similar. They may appear similar\nIf you don't look at them minutely But if you go into details\nEach leaf has its own individuality Its own authentic signature.\nRespect yourself\nBecause even god respects you.\nGod has tremendous respect for each individual But the priests have taught you just the opposite.\nThey have taught you to be condemnors: Condemn yourself, you are sinners.\nWhatsoever you do is wrong. And whatsoever you are is wrong.\nNothing is wrong with you except that You have believed in all kinds of fools. Except that you have not listened\nTo your own heart\nAnd you have listened to all kinds of people Who know nothing.\nDrop all that borrowed knowledge\nForget all about these stupid stories Of original sin\nAnd forget all about your being a sinner. Nobody is a sinner\nEverybody is part of god, an intrinsic part. Everybody is divine.\nYes, a few divine people are fast asleep -- That is their choice.\nAnd a few people are awake -- that is their choice. Nothing is wrong even in being asleep\nYou just have to suffer a few nightmares. But there is nothing much to worry about Because those nightmares are just imaginary. Sooner or later you will wake up.\nAnd if you are enjoying it, enjoy!\nIt is nobody else's business to interfere. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So I don't interfere in your sleep. I go on doing my thing and\nI allow you to sleep.\nI cannot stop myself doing my thing s\nI go on speaking and you go on sleeping! I hope some day you will listen Something may go into your sleep\nSomething may hit you, some day, in some moment And you may wake up! I would love you to wake up\nBut if you decide not to wake up, you are Not to be condemned and thrown into hell. You are suffering enough just by being asleep\nThere is no need to make you suffer more in hell. So this i8 the only difference\nBetween Buddhas and the ordinary people Otherwise they are all alike\nAlike in the sense they all have\nThe same potential to become awakened Not alike in the sense of being similar -- They are unique.\nRemember your uniqueness. Love yourself, respect yourself Respect your own voice;\nListen to it and follow it. It is better to go into hell Following your own voice\nThan to go to heaven following somebody else'5 Because even that heaven\nWon't prove much of a heaven; You will be just a blind follower.\nMy sannyasins are not my followers. They are in love with me\nJust as I am in love with them. They are my friends,\nAnd I respect them as much as I can.\nA real master always respects his disciples. The pseudo master has no respect\nFor the disciples.\nIn fact he lives by condemning them. The more he condemns them\nThe more he proves that you are lower The more high he feels;\nNaturally the difference becomes greater. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The pseudo master is simply suffering from An inferiority complex\nHence he tries to prove himself superior. But a Jesus or a Buddha or a Lao Tzu Had immense respect for others.\nYou respect yourself and you respect others too Love yourself and love others too\nAnd just this simple change in your attitude Can bring a radical revolution.\nIt can transform your whole being. Veet Marcella\nWarlike qualities are not good qualities, particularly in a woman.\nThey are not good even in a man, but in a woman warlike qualities are absolutely wrong.\nThey don't fit with her being.\nHer being is made of the stuff called love. She can only bloom as love.\nBut for centuries,\nwe have appreciated warlike qualities;\nhence all these names exist in almost all languages.\nThey have to disappear.\nWe can find beautiful names. So remember it:\nAll that creates conflict in life has to be transcended.\nThat is the way of the sannyasin: the way of love, the way of peace.\nOnly love and peace can lead you to god. The mind is mundane, the heart is sacred. The mind thinks, but never knows\nThe heart knows, but never thinks. The mind is blind, that's why\nIt goes on thinking and groping in the dark. But it cannot come\nTo any conclusive conclusions.\nAll its conclusions are only arbitrary:\nA little more thinking and they will change. It is all guesswork\nAnd one cannot depend on guesswork\nOne cannot risk one's life for guesswork. One has to move from the head to the heart Only then does real life begin,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Because the heart simply sees what is the case. There is no question of brooding over it. The heart\nKnows no process of arriving at a conclusion Because it has eyes to see.\nWhen a blind man wants to go out of the house He immediately starts thinking,\n'Where is the door? Whom to ask?\nOn whom to depend? Who is reliable?\nSomebody may play a trick upon me, May make me a laughing stock.\nSomeone may mislead me.'\nA thousand and one problems arise in his mind.\nBut the man who has eyes doesn't think about it. He simply gets up and goes out the door Because he sees the door.\nHe does not think even for a single moment About the door.\nThat's exactly the situation of the heart. Sannyas\nIs a radical shift from the head to the heart. And when you start living from the heart, Your life is holy.\nIt has tremendous beauty, grace, an infinite joy!\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #25\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2294","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2294 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\nTo be a disciple is something of immense value. It means surrender\nIt means putting your ego aside\nIt means a heart-to-heart communion With the master. It is a love affair.\nIt is not a question of being convinced By the ideas of the master.\nIt is being convinced by the presence, By the divine presence of the master.\nIt is being convinced that the master is no more But god is flowing through him. Then only can one become a disciple.\nTo be a student is easy.\nIt doesn't require much from your side. But to be a disciple is very demanding. It requires trust, tremendous trust\nBut once you have tasted The beauties of disciplehood\nThen there is nothing sweeter than that. It happened in many other times too:\nMany of the disciples of Buddha\nBecame enlightened but they wouldn't leave him.\nAnd he would insist\n'Now that you are enlightened\nYou have become Buddhas in your own right. You should go and spread the word, reach people! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But they would say, 'No. We still want to remain disciples We don't ant to be Buddhas.'\nThey said to Buddha...\nManjushree, the first disciple of Buddha Who became enlightened\nFell at his feet, cried and wept. He said,'I was not thinking\nThat enlightenment would happen so soon. Pleas let me hang around!\nI don't want to go anywhere.\nI am ready to drop this enlightenment\nBut I am not ready to drop my disciplehood.' Buddha said, 'That is impossible.\nOnce enlightened, you are enlightened forever. There is no going back!'\nBut there is significance In his crying and weeping:\nHe would still like to be a disciple\nHe would still like to be in the same communion In the same love affair. He does not want to come to the end\nOf that beautiful journey. So be truly a disciple.\nAnd the word 'disciple' simply means One who is capable of learning\nOne who is available to learn One who is receptive.\nA loyal heart is the beginning of sannyas:\nA heart that can trust\nAnd a heart that can be committed That can get involved\nA heart which is capable of dropping all doubt. Only such a heart\nCan become a boat to the farther shore Only a loyal heart can know what god is. The doubting person thinks much\nBut knows nothing.\nThe trusting person thinks nothing But knows all.\nThis is just the beginning, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The beginning of something That will go on becoming vaster and vaster. Even the greatest rivers\nStart with a tiny spring. But if one goes on working\nIf one goes on pouring one's energies Soon it becomes a vast river.\nAnd only big rivers can reach the ocean. Man has to become an increasing river Of faithfulness, of trust, of love\nOnly then is there a possibility to reach The ocean, god, the ultimate.\nSmall faith is bound\nTo be lost somewhere on the way.\nAnd people have such small faiths, like dewdrops Just a little heat is enough and they evaporate.\nIncreasing faithfulness means\nWhatsoever happens your faith remains unmoving. Even if everything goes against it\nYour faith remains unmoving. There is a Sufi parable:\nJunaid, the master of Al Hillaj Mansoor\nWas seen with a woman by the side of a river. The woman was pouring some liquid into a glass.\nIt appeared that he was drinking wine Because the container was like that of wine. A few people rushed to Al Hillaj\nCaught hold of him and said 'Come here. You trust this man?' They looked from far away Hidden behind the trees\nAl Hillaj saw the master drinking wine. He laughed.\nThose people said,'Now what do you say?' He said,'My eyes must have gone wrong.\nI don't trust my eyes but I trust my master!' This is faith!\nHe cannot deny: He is seeing a woman pouring something And Junaid is drinking\nAnd he seems to be almost drunk.\nBut those people were not going to leave him. They said,'Then you come close, come with us.' They forced him to go there\nBut when they went there it was nothing: The woman was nobody else\nBut the master's mother. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And there was no wine -- it was only a Wine flask -- it was pure water.\nBut Al Hillaj said. 'Even if it had been wine And the women had been a prostitute\nI would have still stuck to my first statement That my eyes are seeing something Which is not there, which is not possible.\nMy eyes can go wrong; my master cannot go wrong.\nIf such trust is possible, then miracles happen And miracles only happen with such trust.\nYoshimi means the lucky one.\nIt is really fortunate to be a sannyasin\nIt is a rare privilege. It is available to all But very few will be able to receive it, Only the lucky ones.\nFeel grateful to god that you have been able To gather enough courage to take this jump. Feel grateful to existence\nThat it has brought you here\nThat something immensely valuable Becomes possible now.\nSannyas is only a door to the divine But if you are at the door\nThe divine is not far away. Just go on remembering\nThat you have to go inwards, into the temple. Because there are a few people who return Even from the door -- the unlucky ones.\nProve that you are really a lucky one, Joshimi! And Yoshime also gas another meaning;\nIt means watchfulness. That has to be your method The work upon yourself.\nThe definition of a sannyasin\nIs one who is on guard, alert, aware. Watchful of the world around 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Watchful of the mind inside Watchful of all kinds of thoughts, desires Images that float in the mind\nWatchful of the watcher too.\nAnd that is the ultimate in watchfulness In vigilance: To be aware of\nAwareness itself.\nFirst become aware of the world -- Which is the easiest -- aware of the trees And the birds and the sun and the moon. Then become aware of your body\nThen become aware of your mind and\nYou are coming closer and closer to the centre. These are all concentric circles around the centre. Then become watchful of your feelings.\nAnd then finally\nBecome watchful of your watching. The day one is capable\nOf watching one's watchfulness Is the greatest day in life.\nParadise simply descends in you\nBliss starts showering like thousands of flowers.\nA sannyasin has to become a song A song in every possible way.\nHe has to be a celebration.\nHe has to live life in all its dimensions. He has to be a dance\nHe has to create music in his being. Unless one creates music in one's being Unless one starts living life as a dance Unless one celebrates existence\nThere is no possibility of knowing god Because god is the ultimate crescendo Of dance, song, celebration\nGod is not for the sad people. It is for those who are capable Of love and laughter.\nThis existence is a tremendous play. Don't take it seriously!\nTake it with a song in your heart 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Take it joyfully.\nMove in the world with a light foot With a laughter in your heart\nAnd then suddenly the whole existence Starts turning into a divine experience. The mundane becomes extraordinary.\nMy sannyas is not renunciation of the world. It is rejoicing about the world, in the world. Everyone is here to become a proof\nFor god's existence\nAnd unless one becomes a proof For god's existence\nLife is not fulfilled, life is empty and hollow Meaningless, without any significance.\nBecome aware of it, that life is carrying Something tremendously significant inside it But it is only a seed at the moment.\nSannyas can become the right soil for it.\nAnd in the right season, when the spring comes You can bloom, you can release fragrance.\nOnly then is there contentment. Otherwise people live in discontentment\nAnd die in discontentment. Their whole life is nothing But an exercise in futility.\nThe sooner one becomes aware of it, the better Because time is very short. One never knows about tomorrow:\nIt may come, it may not come.\nHence everything has to be done now. Now the real battle begins!\nIt is easy to fight with others.\nThe real fight is with one's own darkness The real fight is with one's own ego.\nThe ego is the only evil, the only devil. And if you can kill the devil\nYou become victorious.\nBut very few people enter into that fight. They fight with everybody else in the world They fight many kinds of battles\nBut the real battle remains unfought. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Sannyas means the beginning of the real war. It is a war between\nYour consciousness and your unconsciousness. Your consciousness is very tiny\nJust one-tenth of your being. And the unconsciousness is vast Nine-tenths of your being.\nSo be a mighty warrior\nOnly then can one hope to win.\nBut if one gives a good fight victory is certain. It may take time, patience will be needed.\nBut victory has happened.\nIf it has happened to a few people It can happen to everybody\nBecause we are all potentially the same. Victory can be ugly if it is violent\nIf it is forced upon somebody; then it stinks Stinks of blood, murder, death.\nBut victory can also be a fragrant phenomenon. Then the process is totally different.\nIt has not to be forced on somebody.\nYou have not to conquer somebody You have to conquer yourself\nYou have to become a master of your own being Then victory is fragrant, then it has\nThe fragrance that is not of this earth It has the fragrance of the beyond\nIt has divine fragrance.\nThe Buddha, the Christ, they are surrounded With the aura, with that fragrance.\nThey are victorious people\nreally victorious people --\nNot Alexander and Adolf Hitler. Their victory is ugly.\nAnything that is based on violence Is going to be ugly.\nUnless you have conquered all your ugly desires Of destructiveness, of ego, of greed\nOf jealousy, of hatred\nYou will not know what love is. When all these ugly things\nHave been dropped, transformed\nYou will be full of love 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Buddha also conquers other people But not with a sword, he conquers with his love. Jesus also conquers.\nHis victory is far more permanent than The victory of Alexander the Great.\nThat is very tiny, momentary. But the victory of Jesus\nWill go down the centuries. He will not be here\nBut his fragrance will continue. The fundamental is\nFirst to be a master of yourself Then you know what love is.\nAnd through love the whole world can be conquered. Love -- that one word\nContains all that is worth having in life, Worth possessing in life.\nOne can forget god, nothing is lost.\nBut if one forgets love then everything is lost. If love is there, god is bound to happen Because god is the ultimate peak\nOf the experience of love.\nBut without love even god is not possible, Without love nothing is possible:\nNo bliss, no benediction, no truth, no freedom. Love is nectar\nIt gives you the experience of immortal life, It is the bridge between time and eternity.\nPeace is a by-product fo meditation. It cannot be achieved directly.\nIf one tries to be peaceful Then the peace will be false. It will appear to be a flower But it will not be a true flower It won't have any fragrance.\nReal peace\nArises only as a by-product of meditation Hence only a man of meditation\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Can be a man of peace. The goal should be meditation\nThe effort should be for meditation. And when you achieve meditation\nWhen you become more and more calm and quiet When you become more and more thoughtless More and more conscious\nThen suddenly peace explodes. It is not that you achieve it\nIt comes as a gift from god, as a reward For your coming to your centre.\nYou have left the circumference of the mind And you have penetrated the very core\nOr your being.\nMake every possible effort to meditate So that your name can become a reality. There are two kinds of mercifulness.\nOne is when the other is in misery\nAnd you feel sorry and you would like to help. That is accidental.\nYou are not really merciful\nOnly in a certain situation are you affected. If the other had not been in misery\nIf the other had not been in a sad situation You would not have felt mercy.\nIt is not your state\nIt is only a momentary emotion.\nIt is sentimentality -- it is not of much value. The second kind of mercy is really valuable. Then it is a state of being.\nIt does not depend on other's misery You are simply merciful.\nWhether the other is in misery or not Is irrelevant.\nEven if the other is blissful Still you are merciful\nStill you are compassionate.\nTo be compassionate is your nature now So you are simply compassionate\nIrrespective of what is happening around. Then only it is no more sentimentality\nIt is no more just a passing phase An emotion, a good emotion.\nThen it is something solid and substantial. Then it is intrinsic, not accidental.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- This second kind of mercy is possible Only through deep meditation.\nThe first can be cultivated as a character The second cannot be cultivated.\nIt comes as a consequence of deep inner search. It is the ultimate result of an inner pilgrimage.\nAnd one thing more: The first kind of mercy Will make you egoistic, piously egoistic; Very holy, but egoistic all the same.\nAnd the holy ego is far more ugly Than any other kind of ego.\nThe second kind of mercy\nWill be absolutely egoless.\nIt can happen only when the ego has disappeared. It blooms only when the ego is no more found.\nThe first kind of mercy you will find\nIn Christian missionaries and public servants And the so-called do- gooders.\nThey are mischievous people.\nThey are exploiting other people's misery For their own virtue, for their own paradise. They are using others as stepping stones.\nThe second kind of mercy you will find Only in a Christ or a Buddha or a Krishna -- People who are fully awakened.\nI emphasise the second kind.\nMake a clear distinction between the two Because sometimes the pseudo coin\nCan go on deceiving you for your whole life. Nobody is born noble.\nThat idea is pure nonsense -- that a few people Are born noble, aristocratic, royal.\nThat is utter nonsense.\nEverybody is born alike Everybody is born unconscious.\nNobility is attained when you become conscious. Then one really becomes an aristocrat\nAn aristocrat of the soul,\nOne attains a certain aristocracy\nA certain nobleness, a certain grace and beauty But it comes through one's own efforts.\nIt is impossible to be noble If you are unconscious.\nIn unconsciousness how can one expect to behave In a noble way? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One is like a robot And robots are not noble, cannot be: Machines are machines.\nIt is only through becoming more conscious That you come out of your robotlike existence That glimpses of freedom, of love, of joy Start arising in you.\nAnd these are the things\nWhich transform your very being.\nThey give you a new form, a new flavour A new fragrance.\nThen you live in the world\nBut you are not of the world -- that is nobleness. You move through the world\nAnd all the fires of the world\nBut you keep your cool, it remains undisturbed. That is undistractedness, that centredness\nIs nobleness.\nEighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #16\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2844","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2844 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

drinking</p><p>And he seems to be almost drunk.</p><p>But those people were not going to leave him. They said,'Then you

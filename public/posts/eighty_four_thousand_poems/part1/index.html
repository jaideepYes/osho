It is like a taste. If you have tasted, you know If you have not tasted There is no way to convey it.\nA man who has not tasted honey cannot be made To know what sweetness is.\nThe man who has never seen light is incapable Of understanding anything said about light.\nThe person who has known and experienced\nEven he finds it almost impossible to express it Because language falls very short.\nThe experience is so vast And language is so small. The experience is so sacred And language is so mundane\nThat there is no possibility of any bridging. Hence truth has been known many times And all those who have known\nHave tried to express it But they have all failed.\nWe are grateful that they tried\nBecause out of that effort life has been enriched. We have beautiful scriptures: the sayings of Zarathustra, Jesus, Lao Tzu, Buddha\nAre so beautiful, so precious That without them there would Have been no humanity\nWe would have been utterly poor. But howsoever beautiful they are They have not been able to express it.\nAnd they all say that they have failed. They have tried with their heart\nThey have tried in thousands of ways In every possible way.\nBuddha spoke for forty-two years continuously But again and again the same cul-de-sac.\nSomething seems to be elusive, it escapes. Just this morning\nI was reading a Zen master, Sotoba. The day he experienced truth\nThe day he became enlightened He wrote these beautiful lines:\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- 'The mountain -- Buddha's body The torrent -- his preaching.\nLast night, eighty-four thousand poems. How, how make them understand?'\nThe experience is so vast\nAs if eighty-four thousand poems\nHave suddenly arisen in you.\nAnd you cannot express even a single poem! He says, 'How, how make them understand? Every awakened person has felt\nA tremendous compassion for people And he has tried his best.\nBut something in the very experience Is such that it cannot be expressed.\nIf one wants to know it One has to experience it.\nTruth can only be an experience. Then certainly\nEighty-four thousand poems arise in you. You are full of stars, full of flowers\nBut absolutely incapable of transferring it To anybody.\nIt is untransferrable, it cannot be taught. But those who are alert\nThey can catch a glimpse of it.\nIt cannot be taught but it can be caught. And that's the whole purpose\nOf being a sannyasin:\nBeing here around me to catch something Which I cannot teach.\nThis is a beginning\nThe beginning of a new life The beginning of a new vision\nThe beginning of a new way of being.\nYou will have to drop much, you will have To disconnect yourself from all that is gone, From the past.\nDon't carry it any more.\nIt is an unnecessary burden\nIt hinders growth, it paralyses.\nSlowly slowly it becomes such a mountain That one is crushed underneath the mountain. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- One should be capable of dying to the past Every moment so that it is never accumulated. That's the path of sannyas\nDying to the past every moment\nSo that you are always young and fresh and alive So that you are always present in the present.\nTo be present in the present Is to be present before god.\nThe first birth is an ordinary birth.\nIt is only the birth of the body-mind, Physiological, biological.\nThe second birth happens through meditation. Then the spirit is born\nThen one becomes a soul. And that is the real birth One becomes twice-born.\nRemember that sannyas is not something formal. It has to be such a deep commitment\nSuch an absolute surrender of the ego That it gives you a new birth\nThat you are no more the same\nThat you become discontinuous with your past. A new being arrives.\nMan is born only as an opportunity.\nHe has great potential But remember\nA potential is only a potential.\nIt has to be transformed into a reality It has to be actualized.\nAnd great effort is needed. It is an uphill task.\nOne has to be industrious. One cannot attain to bliss By just hoping for it.\nJust desiring it is not enough.\nYou have to put all your energies to the task. And it is the greatest achievement of life Hence it needs your total commitment.\nLess than that won't do.\nLove is the greatest, the suprememost religion. It is the very essence of religion.\nIf one is loving then nothing else is needed No church, no temple, no dogma\nNo creed, no scripture. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Love contains all. Love itself becomes the greatest temple And the greatest scripture.\nMy effort here is to help you\nTo become more and more loving. I don't want you to be Christians Or Hindus or Mohammedans.\nAll those ugly things have to be forgotten. Humanity has suffered much\nThrough those ideas.\nLove -- that is the message of Christ And that is the message of Buddha And that is the message\nOf all the awakened ones.\nThe religion of love needs no priests. And the religion of love needs nobody To teach you what it is.\nWe all have an intrinsic feel for it. Nobody teaches anybody what love is\nIn fact it cannot be taught\nBut everybody knows what love is.\nYet very few people make it their religion. It remains just a fragment of their life.\nLet it become the center of your life. Your whole life should be coloured by it. Then god is yours.\nYou need not go in search of him He will come in search of you.\nTo me goodness, or virtue, is not something moral\nIt has something to do with meditation Not with morality.\nIt is a by-product of meditation. The more silent you are\nThe more aware you are\nThe more meditative you are The more virtuous you become Without any cultivation\nOf virtue on your part.\nVirtue comes of its own accord.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Morality is a cultivation of virtue And a cultivated virtue is not virtue. It is only a facade, a pseudo coin.\nIt can deceive others\nBut it can't help you in an inner revolution.\nIn fact, it makes you a hypocrite one thing on the surface\nAnd just the opposite inside. Meditation functions\nIn a totally different way than morality. Meditation starts form your very centre. It is not concerned at all with virtue\nIt is concerned with awareness.\nBut the miracle is, when you are aware\nYou can't do wrong, you can't harm anybody You can't be cruel, you can't be violent.\nWhen you are aware you are naturally loving Naturally compassionate, naturally non-greedy.\nAnd when these things happen Naturally, spontaneously\nThey have a beauty of their own. My sannyasin has to be virtuous Not through morality\nBut via meditation.\nIt is only through awareness\nThat one becomes noble, one attains to glory That one comes to know the splendour of life. Otherwise life is a drag. Otherwise life\nIs nothing but a long long boredom. It is a suffering.\nBut it is our responsibility If it is a suffering.\nWe can change it into a blissing.\nAll that is needed is that we should bring three kinds of awareness to our life.\nThe first is about our actions,\nThat is the outermost circumference of our life. The second is about our thoughts,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That is a little closer to the inner world. The third is about our feelings, That is still more close to the inner.\nAnd the fourth is awareness of our being. The three you have to practise\nThe fourth happens of it own accord. When the three are fulfilled\nThe fourth is the reward.\nThere are only two possibilities open in life. One is what is known as politics.\nUt us ab effort to rule others It is ugly, violent.\nThe very idea of dominating someone is inhuman. The very idea of possessing people\nIn your power, in your grip, is to destroy them. It is to reduce them to things.\nHence there is nothing more ugly Than power politics.\nAnd all politics are power politics,\nThere is no other kind.\nThe other alternative is religion.\nIt is an effort to be a master of oneself Not to be a slave of unconscious forces Instincts, biological urges, emotions.\nMan is a slave.\nSo many unknown, unconscious forces. He goes on thinking that he is the master. That is very ego-fulfilling.\nBut he is not.\nWhen anger arises, are you the master? Con you turn it off.? Can you say no, and it disappears?\nOr when thoughts are moving in your mind Can you turn the whole process off?\nIs it in your power to turn it on or off? Or are you just a victim?\nYou cannot even get rid of a dream What to say of anything else?\nIf it persists, it persists.\nOne of the great Russian novelists, Turgenyev Suffered for his whole life from a single dream.\nAnd a man of the quality of Turgenyev is rare He was very intelligent.\nIn fact, if you try to find\nten great names in literature in this century 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You will have to find a place for Turgenyev. One out of ten great names of this century As far as literature is concerned\nis bound to be his.\nHe has written a few of the greatest works But he could not get rid of a single dream! And he tried hard. It became a nightmare.\nIt was a simple dream, but very nightmarish.\nEvery night in his dream he would see a vast desert, unending\nAs far as he could see, just desert And nothing else\nNot enen a single tree\nNo Shade, no shelter, no oasis.\nAnd two feet, not the whole man just two feet\nWith no shoes on, walking, going towards the horizon And this would go and on. It became a torture to him.\nBut it depicts his life\nAnd the life of millions of people. It depicts life as a desert4rt.\nAs people live it, it is futile, meaningless Utterly absurd, ridiculous.\nPeople are going, but not knowing where. They go on and on\nFor the simple reason theat they cannot stop They don't know how to stop.\nThere seems to be no break in their mechanism Just an accelerator\nSo they go on accelerating. And the second thing it says is\nThat man is not whole, just parts Just legs walking, head thinking Hands doing something else.\nThere is no co-ordination. Man is not a unity. So the head may be dong one thing\nAnd the legs may be doing something else Just the opposite.\nOne hand may be compassionate your other hand may be cruel.\nWith one hand you may be creative With the other you may be destructive. But the dream persisted\nAnd the more he tried to get rid of it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The more impossible it became. Nobody could help him.\nA simple thing would have helped him:\nIf he had enjoyed it, it would have disappeared! But because he was antagonistic, afraid\nThe whole day he was afraid\nConstantly thinking that the night was com ing And the dream would occur. So he was hypnotized g himself the whole time.\nFor twenty-four hours a day he was talking to people; About his dream and how to get rid of it.\nHe was so obsessed,\nThat very obsession was its root cause. Man is just a victim\nOf so many unconscious forces. One can become a master\nBut then one has to transform one's unconscious Into a conscious phenomenon. That's the whole purpose\nOf sannyas and meditation.\nIt is an alchemy, a simple method\nTo bring more awareness to your being. The more aware you are\nThe more you are a master. When you are fully aware\nYou have attained to the kingdom of god. There is nothing more divine than light. Light is a scientific name for god\nGod is a poetic name for light But they are really synonymous.\nWe are born of light, we are made of light. The whole existence consists of light\nAnd nothing else.\nExcept for light all is unreal. To know it is to be transformed To know it is to be enlightened. When there is no darkness There is no fear, no death.\nThe devil exists only in darkness Ti is another name for darkness.\nAnd because we are living with closed eyes 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- We are living in darkness. Open your eyes and all is full of light. Sannyas is a process of opening your eyes. Not only the outer but the inner too.\nThe ultimate sound is heard only When the mind is completely silent. It is the sound of silence.\nIt is silence dancing, it is silence vibrating. To hear it is the goal of all meditation.\nONce you have heard it\nYou are transformed into a totally new being Transmuted in a new dimension.\nYou are no more a mind, you become a no-mind. And that is the most beautiful experience\nTo be a no-mind, to be utterly silent. But that silence is not dead\nIt is so musical that all music is nothing but noise. Make every effort to be silent\nSo that you can hear the ultimate sound. It is this sound\nThat the Bible talks about\nIn the beginning was the word,\nThe Word was with god and the word was god. To translate it as word is wrong\nIt would have been far more true and closer To truth if it were translated as sound:\nIn the beginning was sound. Or even silence\nWould have been better than word. 'Word' is not the right word.\nThe people who were writing the Bible\nMust have experienced the tremendous silence That comes out of meditation.\nLife is full of divine glory But we are unconscious. We are so deeply asleep\nThat we go on missing the glory of it.\nIt is the most perfect existence possible, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The most beautiful, the most magnificent. It cannot be improved upon. But we are asleep\nHence we cannot have any connection with it. It is as if it is spring\nAnd the trees are flowering And the birds are singing\nAnd the wind is dancing through the trees And you are asleep.\nYou will not know the sunrays coming to you Through the trees\nAnd the beautiful patterns They are creating around you.\nYou will not see the flowers, their colours. You will not see the dance\nOf the trees and the wind.\nYou will not even know that you are in a garden! You will have no connection with the spring.\nYou will be enclosed within yourself. You may be having a nightmare\nAnd you may be suffering in your nightmare. You may be suffering in your nightmare.\nYou may be screaming, crying and weeping. It has no relationship with the reality Surrounding you.\nThat's exactly the situation of man. Existence is always in spring\nBut one has to be awake\nTo know it, to feel it, to live it.\nAnd once you have tasted of the joy That surrounds you, you are religious Because great gratitude arises in you\nAnd thankfulness and prayer.

twice-born.</p><p>Remember that sannyas is not something formal. It has to be such a
deep commitment</p><p>Such an absolute surrender of the ego That it gives you a new
birth</p><p>That you are no more the same</p><p>That you become discontinuous with your past. A new being
arrives.</p><p>Man is born only as an opportunity.</p><p>He has great potential But remember</p><p>A potential is only a potential.</p><p>It has to be transformed into a reality It has to be actualized.</p><p>And great effort is needed.

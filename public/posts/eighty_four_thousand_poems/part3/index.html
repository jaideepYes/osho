It is for reference purposes only.]\nThe lotus represents\nThe ultimate unfolding of consciousness. The lotus is the biggest flower in the world And in the East the most respected flower For two reasons/\nOne: it grows in the mud, in the dirty mud.\nOne cannot conceive that out of such dirty mud Such a beautiful flower is possible.\nHence it represents something in man. Man ordinarily is nothing but dirt\nJust dirty mud\nBut hidden in it is the possibility Of a lotus flower.\nSo just don't condemn the dirt\nAnd don't condemn ordinary humanity. Secondly: the lotus grows in water.\nOut of dirty mud it rises and floats on the water. It has a very miraculous quality:\nIt is so velvety that the water cannot touch it. It remains in the water\nBut remains untouched by the water. That is the quality of a sannyasin.\nA sannyasin has to live in the world. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Where else to live? There is no other world, this is the only world. One has to live here and yet\nOne can live like a lotus, untouched, unaffected. Pleasure comes, pain comes,\nOne simply watches and everything passes by.\nPleasure passes by, pain also passes by. Soon you realise that nothing remains Only you abide.\nThe consciousness abides, your witnessing abides. That is your true self,\nThat is your real being that abides.\nEverything else is like a cloud coming and going You are the sun. Many clouds will come and go Don't be affected by them.\nThe day you don't cling to pleasure And you are not afraid of pain and You take both as if they are the same... In fact they are\nThey are two aspects of the same coin. When you are absolutely indifferent to both Whatsoever comes you accept\nWhatsoever goes you say good-by to. When it comes you say hello\nWhen it goes you say goodbye Then you are a real sannyasin.\nOnce Picasso was asked the meaning of one Of gis paintings that he was just finishing.\nHe remained silent for a few moments Then he took the hand of the man\nWho had asked the question, a great critic, Took him outside the house in the garden Pointed to a rose, and said\n'What meaning does the rose have?'\nOf course the critic said\n'There is no meaning in a rose.'\nAnd Picasso said ;If the rose can exist Without any meaning why can't my paintings Exist without any meaning at all?\nIf god can create things with no meaning Why can't I create things in the same way?'\nIt is a beautiful anecdote, of tremendous import. A rose is beautiful, but it has no meaning\nIn the sense that a commodity has meaning. It is not a commodity, it has\nNo utilitarian purpose, it is non-utilitarian. You can enjoy it.\nBut it is not bread, it is not butter You cannot live on it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is sheer joy to see it There is no end to it; it is an end unto itself. And that's how life is.\nIt is not a means to anything else It is an end unto itself.\nIt exists for no other purpose It simply exists.\nGod creates non-purposively\nHe creates because he cannot help it.\nHe is creativity, he is overflowing energy.\nHe is delight, he delights in playing with things. This whole existence is his leela, his play.\nAnd that's how a sannyasin has to look at life And at himself too With the joy af a poet, a painter, a musician\nNot with the eyes of a businessman. Once you can see life\nAn having no purpose at all, Just being for its own sake,\nYou enter into a world of tremendous celebration. Then it is all dance and all song and all joy.\nThat's how my sannyasins have to look at life.\nBela is another flower, one of the most fragrant. It is an eastern flower. It happens only in a hot climate. The hotter the climate, the more fragrant are the flowers. The colder the climate, the less fragrant are the flowers. In fact, many western flowers have no perfume. The cold does not allow their perfume to be released. A certain heat is needed. And the same is true about man. A certain effort that creates heat in you is needed to release your perfume, your fragrance.\nIt is not just accidental that many more Buddhas happen in the East than in the West. It is the same law. It is just as flowers are more fragrant in the East than in the West. The sun is hotter, it releases the energies of the flowers. In a cold country, in a cold climate, people are bound to become materialistic because they have to protect their bodies, otherwise the cold will kill them. They have to remain so concerned about the body that they become body-oriented. In a hotter climate people need not worry about the body too much; they can live naked. Now, one cannot conceive of a Mahavira happening in the West -- he lived naked. It is possible in India. In fact, to wear clothes in India is uncomfortable, to be naked is far more luxurious.\nThe East became more and more concerned about something more inner than the body, because the body was not a problem and life was very secure and safe. The climate was such and the soil was so fertile that just a little effort was needed. India is poor today for the simple reason, that the population has grown beyond its capacities. In Buddha's time there were only two crore people in India; now there are seventy-crore -- almost fifty times more, and the earth is the same. So people were very easily happy with their physical life, there was no problem about it. Even just fifty years ago it was the routine thing that only one man in the whole family would earn and the whole family would live without earning. It was enough. People were satisfied with small comforts, their needs were not many, hence their whole consciousness turned inwards. They started making efforts to reach their innermost core.\nBela is an eastern flower just as religion is an eastern flower. Science is a western flower. Science can happen only in a cold climate where people have to\nstruggle with nature, fight with nature. In the East nature was very very co- operative. There was no problem to fight; the idea has never existed.\nBooks like The Conquest of Nature have never been written in India. The very idea was thought to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- be absurd. It is not a question of conquering . Nature was already giving so much that people were thankful. But in a cold climate you have to fight, struggle. And the struggle is so long, that it makes your whole consciousness focussed on the poverty. But now it is possible that the East and West can meet. That's what is happening here. Now for the first time it is possible that the earth can become one. Now religion can even grow in the West and science can grow in the East. Remember Bela as representative of the eastern fragrance, the fragrance of Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Kabira. The message is to make a total effort to awaken yourself. That very effort creates the heat, the right heat, the right temperature in which the fragrance is released.\nJust one Champak flower is enough\nTo make the whole house full of fragrance. Just one flower in the garden\nAnd the whole garden will be perfumed. And it is a small flower.\nAppearance-wise it is not beautiful at all Appearance-wise it is very ordinary.\nBut don't be deceived by appearances.\nIt is said that Jesus was not a beautiful man In fact he was an ugly man.\nMany people simply laughed at his ugliness. They missed the point, they could not see deeper. If you come across the champak flower\nYou will see a very ordinary flower Not worth looking at twice.\nBut it is the most precious of flowers.\nIt contains the greatest perfume possible. So always remember: the appearance\nIs not the real determining factor in life. The container is of no importance\nBut the content is.\nThe body may be ordinary, homely, and yet\nIt may have a soul which is beyond comprehension. The body may be very beautiful\nAnd bay be utterly empty, with no soul at all. This will happen many times in your life You will come across beautiful people\nWho have no souls at all\nAnd you will come across people who are very homely But have tremendous qualities.\nNever be deceived by appearances.\nAlways look deeper, search deeper.\nLook at the centre, not at the circumferences. And the same is true about yourself too:\nDon't be too concerned\nAbout the circumference and its decorations. Think of the centre\nOf whether there is a centre or not. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- If there is not then create it Because to live without a centre Is not to live at all.\nLife begins only when a centre has arisen.\nAnd not everybody has got a centre, remember. A centre has to be created by tremendous effort. That's what sannyas is all about.\nMan is not mortal, he only appears to be. The appearance is because of the body.\nThe body is born and one day dies. Whatsoever begins ends\nBut there is something within you Which never begins and never ends. That's your reality, that's your being. It is immortal.\nThere is no way for it to die. It can't commit suicide.\nDeath does not exist for it\nJust as darkness does not exist for light. The moment you know yourself\nYou know that there is no death.\nAnd in knowing it one is freed from all fear One is freed from all agony, anguish, anxiety. Knowing this one knows 'I am part of god.' And that is the ultimate realisation.\nWithout it there is no fulfilment, no flowering. Life remains empty.\nBe as wide as god himself.\nBelieve in no limitations, in no boundaries In no adjectives:\nChristian, Hindu, Mohammedan Jewish, Indian, Chinese, Japanese.\nDrop all limitations.\nFeel more and more just a pure consciousness And your horizons will become wider and wider.\nA moment comes when you are as big as god himself Because you are pure consciousness.\nPure consciousness is another name for god. But we cling to narrow limits\nWe cling to our prison cells.\nWe think that these walls that surround us Are very secure.\nOutside the walls there seems to be insecurity So we don't go out, we remain in our black holes.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Small black holes... That's what our life has become. And we go on crawling and fighting\nAnd quarrelling with each other for small things While the infinite waits to receive us.\nGod waits to welcome us.\nHe is ready to take you into his very heart.\nBut you don't listen to the message of the vast Of the oceanic You remain with your small holes\nClinging out of fear\nAfraid of insecurity and safety\nAnd believing that these are not prison cells That these are beautiful palaces.\nAnd you have decorated the walls. You have painted the walls\nYou have made it a little bit comfortable there. But howsoever comfortable it is\nA prison is a prison.\nIt may even be luxurious But a prison is a prison.\nOne has to know the unlimited sky Only then does one know what truth is. Everybody is born only semi-precious. But by becoming a sannyasin\nYou are moving towards becoming really precious! Just a few things which have gathered\nAround the real jewel will have to be dropped. They are clinging to the real jewel\nAnd we think that they are part of it.\nThey are not part of it; they may be just mud.\nThey may have been with the jewel for centuries They have become almost a part of it.\nMy work here is to make you aware\nOf what is real in you and what is unreal in you What is essential in you And what is accidental in you.\nOnce you are aware\nOf the essential and the non-essential\nThen the non-essential can be dropped easily. There is no problem.\nIn fact the moment you know That it is non-essential\nIt drops of its own accord. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The very seeing becomes a transformation. The very understanding brings its own revolution. There is no revolution apart from understanding. Everybody comes here as a semi-precious jewel\nAnd we start hammering and cutting. The work is hard in the beginning.\nIt hurts too, it is painful.\nBut if you are ready to go through the process One day only that which is real That which is eternal will be left\nAnd all else will disappear.\nThat day you have discovered yourself. And the whole life\nIs nothing but a pilgrimage to self-discovery. In discovering oneself one discovers bliss One discovers truth, one discovers beauty.\nOne discovers all the splendours And the glories of existence.\nAnd ultimately one discovers god. Nobody is born noble.\nThe whole idea of aristocracy is sheer nonsense. One hat to achieve it, one is not born with it.\nIt is an art to be learned. One has to be reborn\nOnly then does one become noble.\nOne has to become full of light, awareness, love Then is one noble.\nOrdinarily people are so full of poisons All kinds of poisons\nHow can they be noble?\nWhether they are born in a poor family Or a very famous family\nIt doesn't matter -- they are all unconscious The poor as well as the rich\nThe anonymous as well as the royal ones. But one can become noble.\nSannyas is an effort to bring A new life to you\nA release of new energy\nWhich is potentially there but dormant. It has to be made dynamic.\nIt is almost frozen; it has to be heated up Through love and warmth so that it can melt. People are ordinarily ice-cold in their being. Their smiles are pretensions.\nDeep down they are dead, deadly cold. Unless your being starts warming up You are not noble.\nAnd the moment your being warms up 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You are full of prayer Full of love for the whole.\nYou are full of gratitude to god.\nThat warmth brings thousands of rewards. It is the true beginning\nThe beginning of a real, authentic life. A humble heart\nIs the very essence of religiousness. But beware of one thing:\nThat is false humility.\nThere are thousands of people Who are deceived by it.\nIt is better not to be humble\nThan to be humble in a pseudo way Because the person who is not mumble Sooner or later will have to recognize\nThat all his suffering is coming from his ego\nAnd for how long can you cling to something Which goes on giving you suffering? For how long? The more intelligent you are\nThe sooner you will drop out of it.\nThe pseudo humbleness can recreate trouble For you because it hides the ego\nIt covers up the ego.\nIt is like covering your wound with a rose flower So you don't see the pus And the stink of the wound\nYou see the flower\nThe beauty and the fragrance of the flower. And meanwhile the wound goes on deepening Meanwhile the wound is turning into a cancer. The pseudo-humbleness is created, cultivated. It is ego standing on its head, upside down.\nThat's what is being taught By all the organised religions:\nBe humble, try to be humble\nLearn manners, etiquette that help you to be humble. But this is all from the outside.\nMy effort here is that your heart should open up.\nYou should not cultivate The quality of humbleness.\nIt should be a by-product when your heart opens up. It comes of its own accord.\nA cultivated humbleness is not humbleness at all; It is just its opposite. It is not a friend\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is a foe hiding itself as a friend Hence it is more dangerous than the foe itself. Real humbleness\nComes through silence, meditativeness, awareness. It has nothing to do with humbleness directly\nIt always comes as a consequence. Be more and more meditative Silent, alert, watchful\nAnd many things will come\nIn the wake of your meditativeness. Humbleness will be the first guest. Then it is true\nAnd then it has a beauty of its own. Light is synonymous with god.\nThe whole existence is made of light. That has been the experience\nOf all the mystics down the ages. Now even physicists agree with it In their own way.\nThey also say existence Consists of electricity, electrons.\nElectrons are nothing but light, pure light. This is the first time\nThat mystics and physicists agree an one point. They have come to the conclusion\nThrough different directions\nTotally different, diametrically opposite. But how long can you avoid the truth?\nIf the truth is there\nAnd your search is authentic\nSooner or later you are bound to discover it. Your path may be physics, it may be mysticism It may be poetry, it may be music\nIt may be meditation.\nWhatsoever path you have been following\nIf your search is true, if you are really a seeker Who is ready to risk all Then one day you are bound to discover the truth.\nNow this is the truth: we are made of light\nBut we live in darkness, we all live in darkness We stumble in darkness. This is very strange: we are made of light\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Eighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #4\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3135","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3135 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

With the joy af a poet, a painter, a musician</p><p>Not with the eyes of a businessman. Once you can see life</p><p>An having no purpose at all, Just being for its own sake,</p><p>You enter into a world of tremendous celebration. Then it is all
dance and all song and all joy.</p><p>That's how my sannyasins have to look at life.</p><p>Bela is another flower, one of the most fragrant. It is an eastern
flower. It happens only in a hot climate. The hotter the climate, the
more fragrant are the flowers. The colder the climate, the less fragrant
are the flowers. In fact, many western flowers have no perfume. The cold
does not allow their perfume to be released. A certain heat is needed.
And the same is true about man. A certain effort that creates heat in
you is needed to release your perfume, your fragrance.</p><p>It is not just accidental that many more Buddhas happen in the East
than in the West. It is the same law. It is just as flowers are more
fragrant in the East than in the West. The sun is hotter, it releases
the energies of the flowers. In a cold country, in a cold climate,
people are bound to become materialistic because they have to protect
their bodies, otherwise the cold will kill them. They have to remain so
concerned about the body that they become body-oriented. In a hotter
climate people need not worry about the body too much; they can live
naked. Now, one cannot conceive of a Mahavira happening in the West --
he lived naked. It is possible in India. In fact, to wear clothes in
India is uncomfortable, to be naked is far more luxurious.</p><p>The East became more and more concerned about something more inner
than the body, because the body was not a problem and life was very
secure and safe. The climate was such and the soil was so fertile that
just a little effort was needed. India is poor today for the simple
reason, that the population has grown beyond its capacities. In Buddha's
time there were only two crore people in India; now there are
seventy-crore -- almost fifty times more, and the earth is the same. So
people were very easily happy with their physical life, there was no
problem about it. Even just fifty years ago it was the routine thing
that only one man in the whole family would earn and the whole family
would live without earning. It was enough. People were satisfied with
small comforts, their needs were not many, hence their whole
consciousness turned inwards. They started making efforts to reach their
innermost core.</p><p>Bela is an eastern flower just as religion is an eastern flower.
Science is a western flower. Science can happen only in a cold climate
where people have to</p><p>struggle with nature, fight with nature. In the East nature was very
very co- operative. There was no problem to fight; the idea has never
existed.</p><p>Books like The Conquest of Nature have never been written in India.
The very idea was thought to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query->Osho's books

giving so much that people were thankful. But in a cold climate you have
to fight, struggle. And the struggle is so long, that it makes your
whole consciousness focussed on the poverty. But now it is possible that
the East and West can meet. That's what is happening here. Now for the
first time it is possible that the earth can become one. Now religion
can even grow in the West and science can grow in the East. Remember
Bela as representative of the eastern fragrance, the fragrance of
Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Kabira. The message is to make a total effort
to awaken yourself. That very effort creates the heat, the right heat,
the right temperature in which the fragrance is released.</p><p>Just one Champak flower is enough</p><p>To make the whole house full of fragrance. Just one flower in the
garden</p><p>And the whole garden will be perfumed. And it is a small flower.</p><p>Appearance-wise it is not beautiful at all Appearance-wise it is very
ordinary.</p><p>But don't be deceived by appearances.</p><p>It is said that Jesus was not a beautiful man In fact he was an ugly
man.</p><p>Many people simply laughed at his ugliness. They missed the point,
they could not see deeper. If you come across the champak flower</p><p>You will see a very ordinary flower Not worth looking at twice.</p><p>But it is the most precious of flowers.</p><p>It contains the greatest perfume possible. So always remember: the
appearance</p><p>Is not the real determining factor in life. The container is of no
importance</p><p>But the content is.</p><p>The body may be ordinary, homely, and yet</p><p>It may have a soul which is beyond comprehension. The body may be
very beautiful</p><p>And bay be utterly empty, with no soul at all. This will happen many
times in your life You will come across beautiful people</p><p>Who have no souls at all</p><p>And you will come across people who are very homely But have
tremendous qualities.</p><p>Never be deceived by appearances.</p><p>Always look deeper, search deeper.</p><p>Look at the centre, not at the circumferences. And the same is true
about yourself too:</p><p>Don't be too concerned</p><p>About the circumference and its decorations.

You simply stand aside\nYou don't come in between, you don't hinder.\nYou open all the doors to the sun, to the moon To the wind, to the rain To all the messengers of god.\nYou are simply available to existence With your whole heart\nWithout holding anything back. In that very moment\nWhen you are not holding anything back Prayer has happened.\nIn that very moment the ego is no more The barrier has fallen\nAnd suddenly we are one with the whole. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And to be one with the whole Is bliss, is benediction.\nTo remain separate form the whole is misery Because it is not according to nature\nIt is not according to the fundamental law. It is not true -- that's why it creates misery. When we are one with the whole\nWe have accepted the truth and dropped the lie. To be true\nIs enough to bring tremendous bliss to you. Peace is one of the most important things For a sannyasin to understand\nAnd not only to understand but to be.\nIt has not to become\nOnly an intellectual understanding But an existential feeling --\nYou have to experience it. Mind is never at peace.\nThat is not its nature.\nOne cannot make the mind peaceful.\nAll that one can do is to slip out of the mind And get rooted in the heart. Suddenly there is peace.\nIf you try to make the mind peaceful You will create even more turmoil. Now this will be a new problem.\nAlready there are\nA thousand and one problems in the mind. Now a new problem arises:\nHow to make all these problems disappear How to create peace.\nHence the people\nWho become interested in creating peace of mind Become very unpeaceful\nMore unpeaceful than the ordinary human beings Who are never bothered about it.\nThat's why you will find in ordinary life Something of peace on people's faces\nBut the so-called religious seem to be very tense. Your so-called saints look very tense.\nThere is great anxiety, great turmoil. They are constantly living in a nightmare Of their own creation\nBecause they are trying to do the impossible. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- That is not the way to be peaceful. You have to change the gestalt.\nYou cannot make the mind peaceful But you can slip out of it.\nAnd the moment you slip out of it It loses energy.\nIt is your energy, it is your cooperation That keeps it going; you go on pedaling. The moment you slip out of it\nAnd you move towards the heart\nSuddenly there is peace, with no effort at all.\nSo my suggestions are totally different Than the ordinary ideas about peace.\nOne just has to get out of the mind. Meditation\nIs not a method to make the mind peaceful, It is a method of getting out of the mind And entering into the heart.\nSuddenly mind loses all turmoil Because you are no longer there To help it to go on running.\nWithout any energy it falls flat. Maybe for a few days it goes on Out of the old momentum\nBut it can't go on for long. And then you know the secret:\nWhenever you want peace, exist in the heart. And if you want peace twenty-four hours a day Exist in the heart and use the mind from there. Then the mind is just a tool, an instrument\nA beautiful machine in your hands. And you are the master.\nMind as a machine is beautiful\nBut when the machine becomes the master And the master is completely forgotten The real master completely forgotten Then the whole of life is topsy-turvy.\nEverything is a gift.\nSome unknown source of energy Call it god, Jehova, existence, nature Is very generous.\nIt seems it is overflowing.\nIt can't contain itself, it has to give Not because you deserve it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But because it has too much. It is like a rain cloud, it has to shower. It does not matter where\nOr whether the earth deserves it or not It may shower on a rock.\nThe rock will not be benefitted by it.\nThat's the meaning of the word 'gift'. It is a beautiful word\nIt has a great message in it.\nIf we start looking at it meditatively It can transform your whole life.\nAnd that's what sannyas is all about.\nLooking at life in its reality imply makes one feel grateful\nTo the unknown, to the unknowable. One bows down. That very bowing down, that gratitude\nMakes one a sannyasin. And out of that gratitude\nA thousand and one flowers bloom. Everyone is born bright\nBut sooner or later the whole structure\nOf the society, the whole conditioning, is such That the brightness is destroyed, it is crippled It is covered with stupid superstitions.\nThe intelligent child\nFinds it difficult to remain intelligent Because intelligence doubts, enquires, Argues, rebels.\nIntelligence is individual.\nSometimes it says yes and sometimes it says no. Intelligence lives in its own light\nIt is not imitative\nAnd the parents don't like that. They want the child\nTo be an imitator, a yes-sayer. Whatsoever they say\nHe should accept it with no argument. They know and he does not know\nSo they have to decide\nWhat he has to do, what he has not to do. Hence the intelligent child\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Finds himself in a difficult situation. If he wants to be intelligent He is constantly in trouble There is trouble in the home There is trouble in the school\nThere is trouble in the college In the university.\nWherever he goes there is trouble. Unless one is really courageous Enough to accept all these troubles\nAnd yet to insist on remaining intelligent, Which is certainly very rare,\nOne is bound to compromise sooner or later. The whole pressure is too much.\nThe child is so helpless\nThe child is so small, so tiny\nAnd the people who are pressuring him Are powerful people.\nThey force him to behave in an unintelligent way A way against his own intelligence.\nSlowly slowly he forgets what intelligence is. He becomes dull.\nThe more dull he is, the more he is respected. If he is really stupid he becomes a saint.\nPeople worship him. Jesus\nCould not become a saint for the simple reason That he remained intelligent. He resisted all attempts\nTo destroy his intelligence Hence he was crucified.\nBut the pope in the Vatican Is not an intelligent man.\nPolacks are not known to be intelligent! Now this is a beautiful combination:\nA Polack and a pope.\nIn fact from now onwards Only Polacks should be popes. He is worshipped.\nAnd that happens all over the world. My sannyasins have to be aware of it\nAnd they have to REclaim their intelligence. It is still there\nIt is simply hidden behind much garbage. That garbage has to be removed\nSo you can again become bright 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- So that you can again claim Another childhood, another innocence. That innocence brings purity\nAnd that innocence brings joy\nAnd that innocence brings insight into reality. It is not through knowledge\nThat one comes to know god It is through innocence.\nIt is not through belief\nThat one comes to know god It is through intelligence.\nTremendous intelligence is needed to know god. Excellence is a by-product of meditation Because intelligence itself\nIs a by-product of meditation.\nOrdinarily people behave in a very unintelligent way For the simple reason that They are living mechanically, unconsciously.\nThey are not masters of their being. But slaves of their instincts.\nWhat excellence can they have?\nThey are not even men yet. It is only through meditation\nThat you start becoming a man\nYou start getting out of the animal kingdom. Something greater than the animal\nStarts happening to you through meditation. On the one hand it makes you a human being On the other hand it brings great excellence In whatsoever you do.\nThe secret is\nThat meditation releases awareness in you. To me awareness is the only virtue\nAnd unawareness the only sin. Learn to be aware\nAnd all else will follow of its own accord. God has many aspects.\nYou can look at god through love Then god is love.\nYou can look through beauty Then god is beauty.\nYou can look through bliss\nThen god is bliss.\nIt depends from what angle you look towards god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- God is multi-dimensional But bliss is one of the most fundamental aspects And bliss is the search for us all.\nTo be blissful is to be religious. And when your bliss is absolute You have arrived home.\nParijat is a beautiful flower With great fragrance.\nMan is also a flower\nBut we are absolutely unaware of our potential. We are born as seeds, and unfortunately\nWe remain seeds. we never grow. We never grow to the point Where flowers can bloom in us.\nTo be a Buddha means to bloom as a flower To release one's fragrance.\nRemember, we are born as seeds. But we should die as flowers.\nThen life has been a beautiful experience Then life has been\nA journey of tremendous fulfilment. Otherwise it is sheer wastage.\nMeditation will help you to move From the seed towards the flower.\nWe are not the body and we are not the mind. We are pure consciousness\nAnd pure consciousness is what god is. Sannyas is a journey\nFrom the body-mind to pure consciousness. It is an inward pilgrimage\nFrom the circumference to the centre. When you reach your own centre You are surprised:\nYou don't find yourself there at all You find god himself.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- He is not to be found anywhere else He is just residing in you at your very centre Waiting for you to come home. Innocence\nIs the most precious thing to be achieved Because it is only to the innocent heart That all that is valuable can happen.\nTo the cunning nothing happens. To the cunning love is impossible To the cunning bliss is impossible\nTo the cunning anything of value is impossible. To the cunning money is possible\nPower is possible, prestige is possible. They are all valueless things.\nDeath destroys them all.\nBut to the innocent something happens Which even death cannot take away.\nSo this is the fundamental quality For a sannyasin: To be innocent. Jesus says: Be like small children. That's what he means:\nBe innocent, then god is yours. Drop all cunningness, all cleverness\nAll knowledge, all that gives you the idea That you know.\nMove towards god\nWith a wondering heart, with awe And then success is sure.\nA ten -year old German girl receives her mala\nand the sheet of paper bearing her sannyas name: Nirmala. It means purity, Osho explains.\nHe leans forward to expand on its implications, then pauses, chuckling involuntarily You are still pure!\nDon't allow the world to destroy your purity. Don't allow the world to corrupt you.\nYour sannyas will protect you.\nThe people who have become grown-up Are in a difficulty.\nFirst they have to unlearn many things. You are in a good situation.\nYou need not unlearn anything\nBecause you have not learned anything yet. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You can start moving directly towards god!

own intelligence.</p><p>Slowly slowly he forgets what intelligence is. He becomes dull.</p><p>The more dull he is, the more he is respected. If he is really stupid
he becomes a saint.</p><p>People worship him. Jesus</p><p>Could not become a saint for the simple reason That he remained
intelligent. He resisted all attempts</p><p>To destroy his intelligence Hence he was crucified.</p><p>But the pope in the Vatican Is not an intelligent man.</p><p>Polacks are not known to be intelligent! Now this is a beautiful

knowledge</p><p>That one comes to know god It is through innocence.</p><p>It is not through belief</p><p>That one comes to know god It is through intelligence.</p><p>Tremendous intelligence is needed to know god. Excellence is a
by-product of meditation Because intelligence itself</p><p>Is a by-product of meditation.</p><p>Ordinarily people behave in a very unintelligent way For the simple
reason that They are living mechanically, unconsciously.</p><p>They are not masters of their being. But slaves of their
instincts.</p><p>What excellence can they have?</p><p>They are not even men yet. It is only through meditation</p><p>That you start becoming a man</p><p>You start getting out of the animal kingdom. Something greater than
the animal</p><p>Starts happening to you through meditation. On the one hand it makes
you a human being On the other hand it brings great excellence In
whatsoever you do.</p><p>The secret is</p><p>That meditation releases awareness in you. To me awareness is the
only virtue</p><p>And unawareness the only sin. Learn to be aware</p><p>And all else will follow of its own accord.

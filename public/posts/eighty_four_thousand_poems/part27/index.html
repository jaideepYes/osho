One is not a man of wisdom.\nOne may be a wise guy\nBut to be a wise guy and to be a wise man Are totally different things.\nThe man who knows much Naturally starts dominating others Who don't know so much.\nHe becomes powerful in a way.\nThe knowledgeable people, the scholars The professors -- they are powerful people. They dominate because they have\nA large accumulation of information. But they are not wise.\nTheir lives are as full of stupidities As anybody else's.\nThere is no difference of quality They differ in quantity\nSomebody knows less, somebody knows more. The difference is of quantity\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- But there is no qualitative change. The great professors, the great scholars behave As foolishly and childishly in their life\nAs anybody else.\nYou will not find any difference at all. Sometimes they are even more stupid because They have not learned anything from life.\nThey have remained so enclosed within their books They have remained so surrounded\nBy an abstract world of knowledge That they don't have any acquaintance With reality itself.\nSo when it comes to encountering reality They prove failures, utter failures\nEven about small things.\nThey are not very intelligent either They know only that which they know. If they have to face something new\nThey are completely at a loss as to what to do. If it is something old for which they have Already acquired information\nThey are very wise\nBut if the situation is new The challenge is new They go completely empty\nTheir mind stops working.O And life continuously changes It is never the same.\nIt goes on bringing new challenges to you. It always proposes new questions\nAnd your answers are all old.\nHence the so-called knowledgeable people Are always lagging behind life.\nThe more they know, the more burdened they are. They are carrying such a mountainous weight That they cannot dance with life\nThey cannot move with life easily.\nSlowly slowly they become almost immovable They lose all movement, all dynamism.\nAnd that's what death is.\nThe knowledgeable person dies before his death. He dies in his books\nHis books become his graveyard.\nReal wisdom is not cheap, not so cheap. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is a question Of changing the quality of your consciousness\nNot a question\nOf acquiring more and more knowledge But of becoming more and more aware. This is a totally different gestalts\nTo acquire more knowledge is\nTo be concerned with the content. To become more aware is\nTo be concerned with consciousness Not with the content.\nIt is possible that a man of wisdom May not be knowledgeable at all. Jesus was not very knowledgeable. Mohammed was not educated at all. He could not read, he could not write.\nHe had no relationship with the world of books.\nStill, he became one of the wisest men on earth For the simple reason that He gained more and more awareness\nMore and more meditativeness.\nA sannyasin has to become concerned With the quality of life, not the quantity. How long you live is irrelevant\nHow deeply you live should be the only concern With what intensity, with what totality\nWith what awareness, with what love. And all these energies\nAre released by meditation. Meditation is certainly\nThe greatest magical force on the earth. It is the only bridge between this shore And the farther shore, the beyond.\nSo put all your energies into one efforts How to be more aware.\nAnd if one puts one's total energies into awareness It is bound to happen -- it is our birthright.\nBut one should not be half-hearted. It can't happen half-heartedly\nIt happens only when\nYou are one hundred per cent in it, into it When nothing is being held back,\nWhen you have put all your cards on the table The trump card included.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- When you are not hiding anything When you put yourself in totally It immediately happens.\nAnd that happening is a great revolution.\nIt transforms you from the lowest to the highest From the gross to the subtle From the visible to the invisible,\nIt takes you from the mind to the no-mind. And to live in the no-mind is to be wise.\nTo function out of no-mind Is to function out of wisdom.\nThen your life has a beauty, a grace, a godliness. Then whatsoever you do is right.\nIt can't be wrong\nIt is impossible to do wrong because\nYou are so full of light and so full of insight, Your vision is so clear and unclouded\nThat it is impossible to do anything wrong. The right happens of its own accord.\nThere is no need to cultivate any character. Just consciousness is enough.\nCharacter follows like a shadow. Man without meditation is very tiny Just a very small particle of dust.\nBut the same man with meditation is infinite\nThe same man with meditation becomes oceanic. He becomes the whole.\nWe are small because we cling to the ego Our smallness is caused\nBy our clinging to the ego.\nThe ego is a very small phenomenon, and we Are such fools that we go on clinging to it Thinking it is something immensely valuable. It is the only barrier, it is the only cause Preventing our life from gaining Significance, grandeur, glory.\nIt is a subtle wall surrounding you\nWhich does not allow you to have a communion With the whole.\nOnce the ego is dropped, you start feeling one With the trees and the moon and the sun\nAnd the stars and the people.\nSuddenly all barriers disappear Suddenly you are no more a dewdrop 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Your boundaries are gone. You have become unbounded. And that's the experience of god.\nGod is not a person whom you are going To encounter some day or meet some day. God is an experience --\nThe experience of your dissolution Of your ego disappearing.\nAnd when your ego is no more there What is left?\nJust a pure vastness, an infinite nothingness is But that nothingness is not negative\nThat nothingness is a new kind of fullness. It is nothingness from the side of the ego It is fullness from the side of the whole.\nIt is nothingness from the old vision\nBut it is a new birth, and a new vision is born And it is overflowing\nIt is overflowing with power. And this power is eternal\nThis power has no beginning, no end.\nAnd once you know that you are one with it You have experienced something\nOf tremendous value. Nothing is higher thAn that More valuable than that.\nYou are freed from all small identities\nYou are no more a body and no more a mind. Once you drop the ego, all small boundaries Start disappearing of their own accord.\nTremendous bliss is yours, great ecstasy is yours All that you have to lose is this ugly ego\nWhich has not given you anything. And it cannot give you anything,\nIt can only create trouble, misery, conflict. The ego is the only hell.\nAnd to be free of the ego is to regain Paradise Is to regain innocence. By becoming a sannyasin one is taking a step\nTowards this dissolution of the ego.\nI don't ask you to renounce anything Except the ego.\nJust be a nobody, anonymous With no name, with no identity\nAnd all is yours, the whole is yours! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Then there is no death. Once you have gathered the courage To drop yourself into the whole Naturally, there is no death possible: You have already gone\nSomething new has taken place. Time is no more relevant.\nThe whole process of sannyas is to\nSlowly slowly help you to come out of the ego. The world need not be renounced.\nNothing else has to be renounced, My sannyasin only has to renounce The ego and nothing else\nBecause that is the problem, not the world. You can escape to the mountains\nBut the ego will be with you. You can renounce your family But the ego will be with you,\nEven more than it was in the world. Sitting alone in a mountain cave Your ego will have no competitors\nIt will start flourishing, it will have more space. You will start thinking, 'I am holy\nAnd the whole world is living in sin, Only I am going to heaven\nAnd all others are going to hell.'\nYou will start gaining more strength for the ego. That's why the so-called religious people\nAre not egoless people.\nYour saints, your mahatmas are very egoistic For the simple reason that\nThey have renounced the world\nThey have renounced the comforts of the world -- Which are absolutely irrelevant --\nAnd they have not renounced the real thing The real problem Which goes on, persists within them.\nBe aware of it and consciously drop it. All is attained once the ego is gone.\nWith the ego one is a beggar Without the ego one is an emperor. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Eighty Four Thousand Poems Chapter #28\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1669","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/eighty_four_thousand_poems/>Eighty Four Thousand Poems</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1669 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Eighty_Four_Thousand_Poems/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

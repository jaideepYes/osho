It is for reference purposes only.]\nTruth is available only to the lover Not to the logician.\nTruth opens itself only when you drop the mind And listen from the heart.\nOne can go on thinking about truth and one can Create great systems of thought\nabout truth But to think about truth is not to know truth.\nIt is an experience, not a question of thinking And experience needs a totally different approach.\nAnd for centuries we have been trained In logic, not in love --\nThat's why we go on missing truth.\nEverybody wants to seek truth It is something intrinsic It is something so deep- rooted in man That one cannot avoid seeking it, it is a must.\nBut one can seek in a wrong way Then one will not find.\nMind is the wrong approach The heart, the right approach.\nThe initiation into sannyas means A shift from the head to the heart. Meditation is alchemical\nIt transforms your whole being\nIt destroys all limitations, all narrowness And makes you wide.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It helps you to get rid of all boundaries: The boundaries of religion, nation, race. Awareness helps you not only to get rid of\nAll kinds of logical, ideological confinements, Imprisonments, but also it helps you to transcend The limitation of the body, the mind.\nIt makes you aware that you are Pure consciousness and nothing else.\nThe body is only your house, you are not it. Mind is only a mechanism to be used.\nIt is not the master, it is just a servant. As you become aware\nThat you are neither the body nor the mind\nYou start expanding, you become wider and wider You start becoming oceanic, skylike.\nThat transformation brings glory to you And also it brings victory to you.\nA man who lives without meditation Lives in defeat and failure.\nA man without meditation\nLives an undignified life because he lives In prison, in a small dark hole while\nHis birthright is to be as big as the sky. Even the sky is not the limit!\nPut your total energy into becoming More aware, more watchful, more alert;\nAware of , your body, aware of your thoughts Aware of your feelings.\nIn the beginning it is difficult\nBecause for centuries, for millions of lives We have lived in an unconscious way\nHence it has become almost second nature For us to live the life of a prisoner.\nWe have forgotten completely\nThat it is a prison in which we are living. We have started believing in the chains. Not only do we rationalise our chains We decorate our chains, we colour them We decorate them in beautiful ways.\nWe not only deceive others, we deceive ourselves That they are not chains but ornaments.\nWe can make our chains golden\nWe can make our chains Studded with diamonds and emeralds We can make beautiful chains -- very artistic\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And then we can fall in love with the chains. That's what has happened.\nAnd it has been such a long process That we have completely forgotten\nThe language of freedom -- we have become slaves. Sannyas means a tremendous awakening\nA great commitment to wake up.\nIt is an arduous effort, it is an uphill task But it is worth it.\nBecause it is only through awareness That you will know what life is:\nIts beauty, its poetry, its significance Its glory, its victory,\nAll these can be said in a single word And that word is god.\nGod is only a metaphor -- it represents All that is beautiful and valuable\nAll that is significant.\nIt represents eighty-four thousand poems. Go beyond following.\nIf you want to be a Christ\nThe most significant thing to understand is That following is not going to help you,\nIt is a hindrance, it is a barrier. All followers are imitators\nAll followers are false and pseudo.\nEach individual has to be himself or herself.\nJesus is an authentic individual He is not a follower of anybody. He is not a follower of Moses He is not a follower of Abraham.\nThese were enlightened people, Abraham and Moses. Jesus loved them, but he was not a follower.\nHe appreciated the beauty of these people He appreciated, he imbibed their spirit But he was not a follower.\nHe tried to be himself\nThat's why he was punished.\nThe society does not like individuals.\nIt wants followers, imitators, pseudo people. It is afraid of real human beings\nIt is perfectly at ease with the phony ones. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The authentic individual is bound to be punished. That's why Jesus was crucified:\nHe became Christ. Christ means he attained\nRealisation of his own being.\nYou cannot be a follower of Christ.\nYou can be a Christ, you can be a Buddha -- They are synonymous.\n'Buddha' is the eastern word with the same meaning 'Christ' is the western word\nFor the same experience. But never be a Buddhist\nAnd never be a Mohammedan, never be a Christian -- Just be yourself!\nMy whole effort here is to help you to be free From all kinds of religions and churches\nAnd Bibles and Gitas and Korans So that you can grow\nAccording to your intrinsic nature. Certainly the day you are awakened You are a Christ.\nWhy settle for being a Christian? Christ was not a Christian -- remember.\nAnd if you meet Christ he will immediately say, 'Don't be a Christian.\nIt is not a beautiful phenomenon to be a Christian. Be a Christ!'\nChrist means the crowned one, the annointed one, The blessed one. So you have to transcend all kinds of following.\nBy becoming a sannyasin\nYou are not becoming a follower of mine, No, not at all.\nI am not interested in creating followers. I certainly want to help you to be yourself But I don't want to force you\nAccording to a certain pattern.\nEach sannyasin has to be unique -- remember it, Because god never creates two individuals alike, He always creates unique individuals.\nHence a really religious person 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Cannot be a follower -- drop the very idea. Humanity has suffered very much because Of this whole stupid idea of following others. Learn to be free. Learn from everyone\nFrom Moses, from Mohammed, from Jesus from Zarathustra, from Krishna, from Confucius.\nLearn from the whole world. Remain available.\nBe a disciple: always open to grow Always open to receive any challenge That life gives to you.\nRespond totally, accept every challenge. That's the way of growth -- not following. Every man is born\nWith many kinds of bitternesses, many poisons.\nMan needs to renew himself, to transform himself To drop much that is ugly, much that is bitter.\nLife is a great art.\nOne should not take life for granted. Birth is not synonymous with life Birth is only an opportunity\nThen you have to work upon yourself. There are a thousand and one things\nTo be dropped greed is there, anger is there, Hatred is there, lust is there\nAnd so on, so forth.\nAnd unless these things are dropped Unless they are removed from our being... These are like weeds\nAnd we are so full of these weeds\nThat we cannot grow roses in our being. We have to take out, uproot all the weeds We have to change the whole soil\nWe have to remove all the stones We have to prepare the ground Only then are roses possible.\nAnd when roses grow in your being Your life starts having joy\nYour life starts having beauty Your life starts having grace.\nAnd then you have something to offer to god Otherwise what is there to offer?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- We have so many ugly things Which cannot be offered to god. We have to hide them\nBut by hiding them, nothing is changed.\nThe more we hide them, the more we repress them, The deeper and deeper do those weeds go.\nTheir roots become more and more strengthened They get more nourished.\nBecoming a sannyasin means a commitment That you will try now for the real birth\nAnd you will deliberately drop many kinds of Stupid ideas which dominate the mind.\nMind is full of stupidities And much has to be done.\nMan is almost like a raw diamond.\nA jeweller can understand the hidden beauty Of the raw diamond\nOrdinarily you will not be able To see any beauty in it,\nIt will look like just an ordinary stone\nMaybe a little cclourful, maybe a little shining But nothing very special. Before the Kohinoor.\nThe greatest diamond in the world, Was found in Golconda, in India, The person who found it in his field Had it for three years\nAnd had no idea what it was.\nHe just thought it was a beautiful stone. His children played with it for three years. He might have lost it,\nThe children might have thrown it away, But somehow it remained in the house. travelling sannyasin had stayed for the night And he could not believe his eyes\nBecause he had once been a jeweller. He said, 'What are you doing?\nYou can become the richest man in the world! I have never come across such a diamond.\nThis is the biggest diamond ever.' Then the work started on it.\nNow it is part of the crown of the British queen. The weight is one-third of the original,\nSo much has been cut and polished. but it has\nBecome millions of times more beautiful 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And that's how man is: Every man is born like a raw diamond. I can see -- I have been a jeweller!\nSo when I look at you I can see a diamond, A great diamond -- but you are not aware Because you don't have any idea what a Great opportunity has been given to you And what you can do with your life.\nYou can create such dance, such music\nSuch immense beauty, such incredible ecstasy Which is unimaginable.\nBut people die without ever experiencing Anything worthwhile that\nFor the simple reason they never Prepare themselves for it.\nLife has to be an art, and one has to work hard. Only then does the transformation happen.\nOnce you drop the ego you are godly.\nThe only barrier is the ego. Intrinsically everybody is a god Potentially everyone is a god But the ego is covering us.\nIt has to be removed. It is a thick layer\nOf absolutely unnecessary dust It has no meaning at all.\nBut we are trained for it\nThe society prepares Us for it. It serves the vested interests. Society needs you to be egoists Because unless you are egoists You will not be ambitious.\nAnd if you are not ambitious\nThen the whole economic structure The political structure --\nAll will simply collapse. They all depend on ambition.\nSo every child has to be poisoned\nThrough ambition. And ambition means egos\nYou have to be the first.\nYou have to be the president of the country The prime minister of the country\nYou have to be the richest man You have to win the Nobel prize You have to be Mr. Universe\nAnd you have to be a beauty queen 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- And all kinds of nonsense! Only one thing is not allowed you To be yourself, simply yourself.\nEverything else you can try\nBut never to be just simply, ordinarily yourself. If everybody is simply himself\nThe whole economic structure and politics Will go down the drain.\nWho would like to be the president? For what? It will be impossible to find somebody\nTo become president\nUnless you make it a punishment, Somebody commits some crime and then He has to be president of the country.\nSomebody commits a crime\nOr is found trying to commit suicides then he Can be punished by being prime minister.\nThings like that.., otherwise who would suffer All kinds of neuroses and psychoses\nAnd tensions and anguish and anxiety? Who would be so stupid as to waste his life?\nThe whole of religion is a rebellion Against the structure of ego and ambition. Learn to drop the ego.\nThe day the ego disappears all is achieved. All that's worth achieving\nAll that will give you bliss and freedom All that will make you aware\nThat you are immortal\nThat there is no end and no beginning That you are eternal.\nThen suddenly life becomes a celebration. Everybody is born as a rock\nAnd everybody has to become a flower. Everybody is born absolutely closed And everybody has to become open\nTo life, to love, to god\nTo the wind, to the rain, to the sun.\nTo be a rock helps you to remain protected, It is a kind of security -- one is very safe.\nTo be a flower is dangerous\nBecause the flower is so fragile, so delicate. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- It is dangerous to be a flower That's why very few people try to be flowers. They would like to remain rocks.\nRocks live long.\nBut what kind of life does a rock have? It has no life.\nIt lives long because it is already dead. It cannot die because it is not alive.\nDon't be hard, don't be rocklike.\nBecome sort, vulnerable.\nYes, it is dangerous to be a flower\nBut the only way to live is to live dangerously. That's the way of sannyas: to live in danger\nTo live in insecurity\nTo live in tremendous trust\nThat whatsoever happens is good. Even if the flower lives -only one day Or for only one moment,\nIt is far more valuable\nThan the long lire of a rock.\nA single moment of being a flower and fragrant And dancing in the wind And in the sun and in the rain\nIs far more valuable\nThan to be a rock for eternity\nBecause that single moment contains eternity. The rock is a grave, so come out of the rock. Everybody is born as a rock, remember,\nSo there is nothing wrong in it. Everybody is born as a rock\nBut everybody is born with the capacity\nAnd the potential to be a flower.\nThis is-' the miracle of life, the magic of life That here rocks can become flowers.\nIt all depends on you, on your courage.\nGather courage and then all the mysteries of life Start opening up for you. Remember always\nBliss cannot become a goal of your ambitions It is not an achievement.\nOn the contrary, it showers on you only\nWhen you have dropped all idea of achievement. When the achieving mind is no more there\nWhen you have dropped all kinds of ambitiousness 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Suddenly, as a gift of god The grace of god\nBliss starts showering on you. You cannot achieve it\nBut you can open up to receive it. There is no way to reach it directly One has to be very indirect.\nIt is the sutbtlest experience of life. You cannot be aggressive\nYou have to be very feminine.\nYou have to learn to wait, to be patient. Infinite patience is needed.\nIf one is in a hurry one will miss.\nGod is not possible if you are in a hurry. If you are in a hurry\nThen it is nothing but the ego. The ego is always impatient. It is afraid of death\nThat's why it is impatient. It is constantly scared\nBecause death can happen any moment. Death is always there waiting\nIt can jump upon you, any moment --\nOne never knows... Hence time seems to be very short And much has to be attained.\nSo be in a hurry, be speedy.\nThat is not the way to attain bliss.\nRelax, rest and trust that whenever you are ripe And when the season comes and your turn come.\nThe grace will shower on you.\nIt can't be otherwise, it is inevitable. God is never unfair\nExistence is very just, absolutely just. But one has to learn how to welcome. Just keep your doors open and wait.\nThat's what meditation is all about:\nKeeping your doors open with a welcoming heart Waiting, trusting, praying, but not in a hurry.\nThen one day the miracle happens And it always happens as a gift.\nYou can never claim it as your achievement Because it happens only when you are not, There is nobody to make any claim.\nThe ego is no more there to claim. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- You are simply empty, utterly void. Absolutely no one is there inside you.\nIn that very moment the mystery becomes available.\nThat emptiness becomes the host for the guest. Your being becomes the host\nAnd god becomes the guest.

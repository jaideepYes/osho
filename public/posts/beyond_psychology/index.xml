mins Question 1
BELOVED OSHO,
THE GIFT OF BEING HERE WITH YOU IS OVERSHADOWED BY A SENSE OF
UNWORTHINESS. IT TROUBLES ME BECAUSE I DON&#39;T FEEL AS AVAILABLE
TO YOU AS I COULD BE.
CAN YOU HELP ME TO DISSOLVE THIS?
It is something very essential to understand, that people who are really worthy always feel unworthiness, and the people who are really unworthy never feel it.</description>

BELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS MADNESS?
There are two possibilities:
Madness literally means going out of the mind; hence the two possibilities. You can go out of the mind either below the mind or above the mind.
Ordinarily, people go below the mind because it needs no effort, you don&#39;t have to do anything.</description>

mins Question 1
BELOVED OSHO,
TODAY IS MY EIGHTH SANNYAS BIRTHDAY. ISN&#39;T EIGHT YEARS A VERY
LONG TIME TO MISS THE OBVIOUS?
The obvious has been missed for hundreds of lives, so no time is long enough to miss it.
On the other hand, even a single minute is enough to recognize it.</description>

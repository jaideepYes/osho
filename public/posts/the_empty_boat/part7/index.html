ONE SAID:\n“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING?\nCAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE\nAND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?” THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.\nTHEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,\nTHUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE. THEN ONE FRIEND DIED. CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE\nTO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.\nTHE DISCIPLE FOUND\nTHAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE LUTE. THEY SANG:\n“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO? HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?\nYOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE ARE HERE!” THEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS\nBURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:\n“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES,\nTHIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING\nIN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”\nTHE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:\n“POOR FELLOW,\nHE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”\nThe first thing about life is that it has no explanation. It is there in its absolute glory, but it has no explanation. It is there as a mystery and if you try to explain it you will miss it. It will not be explained, but you will become blind through your explanations.\nPhilosophy is the enemy of life. The most inimical thing that can happen to a man is to get fixed and obsessed with explanations. The moment you think you have the explanation life has left you, you are already dead.\nThis seems to be a paradox. Death may be explained, but life cannot be explained – because death is something finished, complete, and life is always an ongoing affair; life is always on the journey, death has arrived already. When something has reached and is finished, you can explain it, you can define it. When something is still ongoing, it means that the unknown is still to be traveled.\nYou can know the past but you cannot know the future. You can put the past into a theory, but how can you put the future into a theory? The future is always an opening, an infinite opening, and it goes on opening and opening. So when you explain, the explanation always indicates that which is dead.\nPhilosophy has explanations so it cannot be very alive, and you cannot find people who are more dead than philosophers. Life has ebbed out, life has oozed out of them. They are shrunken heads, like dead stones. They make much noise but there is no music of life. They have many explanations, but they have completely forgotten that they have only explanations in their hands,\nExplanation is like a closed fist. Life is like an open hand. They are totally different. And when the fist is completely closed there is no sky in it, no air in it, no space to breathe. You cannot grab the sky in your closed fist. The fist will miss it. The sky is there, the hand is open, it is available. Explanation is grabbing, closing, defining – life oozes out.\nEven a laugh is greater than any philosophy, and when someone laughs about life he understands it. So all those who have really known have laughed. And their laughter can be heard even after centuries. Seeing Buddha holding a flower in his hand, Mahakashyapa laughed. His laughter can be heard even now. Those who have ears to hear, they will hear his laughter, just like a river flowing down through the centuries continuously.\nIn Zen monasteries in Japan, disciples still ask the master, “Tell us, Master, why did Mahakashyapa laugh?” And those who are more alert say, “Tell us, Master, why is Mahakashyapa still laughing?” They use the present, not the past tense. And it is said that the master will reply only when he feels that you can hear the laughter of Mahakashyapa. If you cannot hear it, nothing can be said to you about it.\nBuddhas have always been laughing. You may not have heard them because your doors are closed. You may have looked at a buddha and you may have felt that he is serious, but this seriousness is projected. It is your own seriousness – you have used the buddha as a screen. Hence, Christians say Jesus never laughed. This seems absolutely foolish. Jesus must have laughed and he must have laughed so totally that his whole being must have become laughter – but the disciples couldn’t hear it, that is true. They must have remained closed, their own seriousness projected.\nThey could see Jesus on the cross because you all live in such suffering that you can only see suffering. If they had heard Jesus laughing, they would have omitted it. It is so contradictory to their life, it doesn’t fit in. A Jesus laughing doesn’t fit in with you, he becomes a stranger.\nBut in the East it has been different, and in Zen, in Tao, the laughter reached its peak. It became the polar opposite of philosophy.\nA philosopher is serious because he thinks life is a riddle and a solution can be found. He works on life with his mind, and he gets more and more serious. The more he misses life, the more he gets serious and dead.\nTaoists, Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, say that if you can laugh, if you can feel belly laughter that comes from the very core of your being, that is not just painted on the surface, if you can feel laughter that\ncomes from the deepest center of your being, spreads all over you, overflows to the universe, that laughter will give you the first glimpse of what life is. It is a mystery.\nIn Chuang Tzu such laughter is prayerful, because now you accept life, you don’t hanker for the explanation. How can one find the explanation? We are part of it. How can the part find the explanation for the whole? How can the part look at the whole? How can the part dissect, divide the whole? How can the part go before the whole?\nExplanation means that you must transcend that which you are trying to explain – you must be there before it existed, you must be there when it has ceased to exist. You must move around it so you can define it, and you must dissect so you can reach the heart. A surgeon can find the explanation, not for life, but for a dead body. All medical definitions of life are foolish because the surgeon dissects, and when he makes a conclusion life is there no longer, it is only a corpse. All explanations are postmortems, life is not there.\nNow even scientists have become aware of the phenomenon that when you examine human blood, the blood cannot be the same as it was when it was moving in the veins of the living person. Then it was alive, it had a different quality; now when it is in the test tube, it is dead. It is not the same blood, because the basic quality – life – is no longer in it. All explanations are of that type.\nA flower on the tree is different because life, the shape of life, is flowing in it. When you cut it from the tree, take it to the lab, examine it, it is a different flower. Don’t be deceived by the appearance of it. Now life is no longer flowing in it. You may come to know the chemical composition of the flower, but that is not the explanation.\nA poet has a different approach, not through dissection, but through love, not through uprooting the flower from the tree but rather through merging with the flower, being with it in deep love, in a participation mystique. He participates with it, then he comes to know something, and that is not an explanation. Poetry cannot be an explanation, but it has a glimpse of the truth. It is truer than any science.\nWatch: when you are in love with someone your heart beats differently. Your lover, your beloved, will listen to your heart: it beats differently. Your lover will take your hand...the warmth is different. The blood moves in a different dance, it pulsates differently.\nWhen the doctor takes your hand in his hand, the pulsation is not the same. He can hear the heart beating but this beat is different. When the heart was beating for a lover it had a song of its own, but only a lover can know the beat, only the lover can know the pulsation, the blood, the warmth of life. The doctor cannot know.\nWhat has changed? The doctor has become the observer and you are the observed – you are not one. The doctor treats you like an object. He looks at you as if he is looking at a thing – that makes the difference. A lover doesn’t look at you as an object – he becomes one with you, he merges and melts. He comes to know the deeper core of your being, but he has no explanation. He feels it, but feeling is different. He cannot think about it.\nAnything that can be thought will not be alive. Thought deals with death, it always deals with dead objects; that is why in science there is no place for feeling. Feeling gives a different dimension to existence, the dimension of the alive.\nThis beautiful story has many things to say to you. Move step by step into it, and if you reach a conclusion, then understand that you have missed it. If you reach laughter, then you have understood.\nTHERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.\nChuang Tzu is very telegraphic. As always, those who know will not utter a single word unnecessarily. They live with the essential.\nTHERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.\nThe first thing to be understood is that only friends can discuss life. Whenever a discussion becomes antagonistic, whenever a discussion becomes a debate, the dialogue is broken. Life cannot be discussed that way. Only friends can discuss, because then discussion is not a debate, it is a dialogue.\nAnd what is the difference between a debate and a dialogue? In debate you are not ready to listen to the other; even if you are listening, your listening is false. You are not really listening, you are simply preparing your argument. While the other is speaking you are getting ready to contradict. While the other is talking, you are simply waiting for your opportunity to argue back. You have a prejudice already there in you, you have a theory. You are not in search, you are not ignorant, you are not innocent; you are already filled, your boat is not empty. You carry certain theories with you and you are trying to prove them true.\nA seeker of truth carries no theories with him. He is always open, vulnerable. He can listen. A Hindu cannot listen, a Mohammedan cannot listen. How can a Hindu listen? He already knows the truth, there is no need to listen. You try to make him listen but he cannot; his mind is already so filled that nothing can penetrate. A Christian cannot listen, he already knows the truth. He has closed his doors to new breezes, he has closed his eyes for the new sun to rise, he has reached, he has arrived.\nAll those who feel that they have arrived can debate, but they cannot move in a dialogue. They can only clash. Then conflict arises and they oppose each other. In such a discussion you may prove something, but nothing is proved. You may silence the other, but the other is never converted. You cannot convince, because this is a sort of war, a civilized war – you are not fighting with weapons, you are fighting with words.\nChuang Tzu says: Three friends were discussing life – that is why they could reach laughter; otherwise there would have been a conclusion. One theory might have defeated other theories, one philosophy might have silenced other philosophies, then there would have been a conclusion – and conclusion is dead.\nLife has no conclusion. Life has no foolish thought to it. It goes on and on endlessly; it is always, eternally, an onward affair. How can you conclude anything about it? The moment you conclude you have stepped out of it. Life goes on and you have stepped out of the way. You may cling to your conclusion but life will not wait for you.\nFriends can discuss. Why? You can love a person, you cannot love a philosophy. Philosophers cannot be friends. You can be either their disciple or their enemy but you cannot be their friend. Either you are convinced by them or not convinced, either you follow them or don’t follow them, but you cannot be friends. A friendship is possible only between two empty boats. Then you are open to the other, inviting to the other, then you are constantly an invitation, come to me, enter me, be with me.\nYou can throw away theories and philosophies but you cannot throw away friendship. And when you are in friendship a dialogue becomes possible. In dialogue you listen, and if you have to speak, you speak not to contradict the other, you speak just to seek, to inquire. You speak, not with a conclusion already reached, but with an inquiry, an ongoing inquiry. You are not trying to prove something: you speak from innocence, not from philosophy. Philosophy is never innocent, it is always cunning, it is a device of the mind.\nThree friends were discussing life – because between friends a dialogue is possible. So in the East it has been the tradition that unless you find friendship, love, reverence, trust, no inquiry is possible. If you go to a master and your boat is filled with your ideas, there can be no contact, there can be no dialogue. First you have to be empty so that friendship becomes possible, so that you can look without any ideas floating across your eyes, so that you can look without conclusions. And whenever you can look without conclusions, your perspective is vast, it is not confined.\nA Hindu can read The Bible, but he never understands it. Really, he never reads it, he cannot listen to it. A Christian can read the Gita, but he remains the outsider. He never penetrates its innermost being, he never reaches the inner realm, he moves round and round it. He already knows that only Christ is true, he already knows that only through Christ is salvation; he already knows that only Christ is the son of God. How can he listen to Krishna? Only Christ is truth. Krishna is bound to be untrue, at the most, a beautiful untruth, but never true. Or if he concedes much, then he will say, approximately true.\nBut what do you mean when you say approximately true? It is untrue! Truth is either there or not. Nothing can be approximately true. Truth is, or truth is not. It is always total. You cannot divide it. You cannot say it is true to some degree. No, truth knows no degree. Either it is or it is not.\nSo when the mind contains the conclusion that Christ is the only truth, then it is impossible to listen to Krishna. Even if you come across him on the path you will not be able to listen to him. Even if you meet Buddha you will not meet him.\nAnd the whole world is filled with conclusions. Someone is a Chris-tian, someone is a Hindu, someone is a Jaina, someone is a Buddhist – that is why truth is missing! A religious person cannot be a Christian, a Hindu, or a Buddhist, a religious person can only be a sincere inquirer. He inquires and he remains open without any conclusions. His boat is empty.\nThree friends discussing lifeOnly friends can discuss because then it becomes a dialogue, then\nthe relationship is of I and thou. When you are debating, the relationship is of I and it. The other is a thing to be converted, convinced, the other is not a thou; the other has no significance, the other is just a number.\nIn friendship the other is significant, the other has intrinsic value, the other is an end in himself, you are not trying to convert him. How can you convert a person? What foolishness! The very effort to convert a person is foolish. A person is not a thing. A person is so big and so vast that no theory can be more important than a person. No Bible is more important than a person, no Gita is more important than a person. A person means the very glory of life. You can love a person but you can never convert a person. If you try to convert, you are trying to manipulate. Then the person has become a means and you are exploiting.\nDialogue is possible when your I says thou, when the other is loved, when there is no ideology behind it. The other is simply loved, and whether he is a Christian or Hindu doesn’t matter. This is what friendship means – and friends can discuss life because dialogue is possible.\nONE SAID:\n“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING?\nCAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE\nAND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?”\nHe is not proposing a theory, he is simply raising a question. And remember, you can raise a question in two ways. Sometimes you raise a question only because you have to supply an answer and the answer is already there – you raise the question just to answer it. Then the question is not real, it is false. The answer is already there. The question is just a trick, rhetorical; it is not real, authentic.\nThe question is authentic when there is no answer in you, when you question but you don’t question from an answer, when you question simply to look; the question leaves you empty, just open, inviting, inquiring.\nONE SAID:\n“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT...?”\nWe live together and we never know anything of what togetherness is. You can live together for years without knowing what togetherness is. Look all over the world – people are living together, nobody lives alone: husbands with wives, wives with husbands, children with parents, parents with friends; everybody is living together. Life exists in togetherness, but do you know what togetherness is?\nLiving with a wife for forty years, you may not have lived with her for a single moment. Even while making love to her you may have been thinking of other things. Then you were not there, the lovemaking was just mechanical.\nI have heard that once Mulla Nasruddin went to a film with his wife. They had been married for at least twenty years. The film was one of those torrid foreign films! As they were leaving the cinema his wife said, “Nasruddin, you never love me like those actors were doing in the film. Why?”\nNasruddin said, “Are you crazy? Do you know how much they are paid for doing such things?”\nPeople go on living with each other without any love because you love only when it pays. And how can you love if you love only when it pays? Then love has also become a commodity in the market: then it is not a relationship, it is not a togetherness, it is not a celebration. You are not happy being with the other, at the most you just tolerate the other.\nMulla Nasruddin’s wife was on her deathbed and the doctor said, “Nasruddin, I must be frank with you; in such moments it is better to be truthful. Your wife cannot be saved. The disease has gone beyond us, and you must prepare yourself. Don’t allow yourself to suffer, accept it, it is your fate. Your wife is going to die.”\nNasruddin said, “Don’t worry. If I could suffer with her for so many years, I can suffer for a few hours more!”\nAt the most we tolerate. And whenever you think in terms of toleration, you are suffering, your togetherness is suffering. That is why Jean-Paul Sartre says, “The other is hell”...because with the other you simply suffer, the other becomes the bondage, the other becomes the domination. The other starts creating trouble, and your freedom is lost, your happiness is lost. Then it becomes a routine, a tolerance. If you are tolerating the other how can you know the beauty of togetherness? Really, it has never happened.\nMarriage almost always never happens, because marriage means the celebration of togetherness. It is not a license. No registry office can give you marriage; no priest can give it to you as a gift. It is a tremendous revolution in the being, it is a great transformation in your very style of life, and it can happen only when you celebrate togetherness, when the other is no longer felt as the other, when you no longer feel yourself as I. When the two are not really two, a bridge has happened, they have become one in a certain sense. Physically they remain two, but as far as the innermost being is concerned, they have become one. They may be two poles of one existence but they are not two. A bridge exists. That bridge gives you glimpses of togetherness.\nIt is one of the rarest things to come across a marriage. People live together because they cannot live alone. Remember this: because they cannot live alone, that is why they live together. To live alone is uncomfortable, to live alone is uneconomical, to live alone is difficult, that is why they live together. The reasons are negative.\nA man was going to get married and somebody asked him, “You have always been against marriage, why have you suddenly changed your mind?”\nHe said, “Winter is coming on and people say that it is going to be very cold. Central heating is beyond me and a wife is cheaper!”\nThis is the logic. You live with someone because it is comfortable, convenient, economical, cheaper. To live alone is really difficult: a wife is so many things, the housekeeper, the cook, the servant, the nurse – so many things. She is the cheapest labor in the world, doing so many things without being paid at all. It is an exploitation.\nMarriage exists as an institution of exploitation, it is not togetherness. That is why no happiness comes out of it as a flowering. It cannot. Out of the roots of exploitation how can ecstasy be born?\nThere are your so-called saints who keep saying that you are miserable because you live in a family, because you live in the world. They say, “Leave everything, renounce!” And their logic appears to be right, not because it IS right, but because you have missed togetherness. Otherwise, all those saints would seem absolutely wrong. One who has known togetherness has known the divine; one who is really married has known the divine, because love is the greatest door.\nBut togetherness is not there and you live together without knowing what togetherness is; you live that way for seventy, eighty years without knowing what life is. You drift without any roots in life. You just move from one moment to another without tasting what life gives you. And it is not given to you at birth. It is not hereditary to know life.\nLife comes through birth but the wisdom, the experience, the ecs-tasy, has to be learnt. Hence the meaning of meditation. You have to earn it, you have to grow towards it, you have to attain a certain maturity; only then will you be able to know it.\nLife can open to you only in a certain moment of maturity. But people live and die childishly. They never really grow, they never attain to maturity.\nWhat is maturity? Just becoming sexually mature does not mean you are mature. Ask the psychologists: they say that the average adult mental age remains nearabout thirteen or fourteen. Your physical body goes on growing but your mind stops at about the age of thirteen. It is no wonder you behave so foolishly, why your life becomes a continuous foolishness! A mind which has not grown up is bound to do something wrong every moment.\nAnd the immature mind always throws responsibility onto the other. You feel unhappy and think that it is because everybody else is creating hell for you. “The other is hell.” I say this assertion of Sartre is very immature. If you are mature, the other can also become heaven. The other is whatsoever you are because the other is just a mirror, he reflects you.\nWhen I say maturity, I mean an inner integrity. And this inner integrity comes only when you stop making others responsible, when you stop saying that the other is creating your suffering, when you start realizing that you are the creator of your suffering. This is the first step towards maturity: I am responsible. Whatsoever is happening, it is my doing.\nYou feel sad. Is this your doing? You will feel very much disturbed, but if you can remain with this feeling, sooner or later you will be able to stop doing many things. This is what the theory of karma is all about. You are responsible. Don’t say society is responsible, don’t say that parents are responsible, don’t say the economic conditions are responsible, don’t throw the responsibility onto anybody. YOU are responsible.\nIn the beginning, this will look like a burden because now you cannot throw the responsibility on anyone else. But take it.…\nSomeone asked Mulla Nasruddin, “Why do you look so sad?”\nHe said, “My wife has insisted that I stop gambling, smoking, drinking, playing cards. I have stopped all of them.”\nSo the man said, “Your wife must be very happy now.”\nNasruddin said, “That is the problem. Now she cannot find anything to complain about, so she is very unhappy. She starts talking, but she cannot find anything to complain about. Now she cannot make me responsible for anything and I have never seen her so unhappy. I thought that when I gave up all these things she would cheer up, but she has become more unhappy than ever.”\nIf you go on throwing responsibility onto others and they all do whatsoever you tell them to do, you will end up committing suicide. Eventually there will be nowhere left to throw your responsibilities.\nSo it is good to have a few faults; it helps others to be happy. If there is a really perfect husband, the wife will leave him. How can you dominate a perfect man? So even if you don’t want to, go on doing something wrong so the wife can dominate you and feel happy!\nWhere there is a perfect husband there is bound to be divorce. Find a perfect man and you will all be against him, because you cannot condemn, you cannot say anything wrong about him. Our minds love to throw responsibility onto somebody else. Our minds want to com-plain. It makes us feel good, because then we are not responsible, we are unburdened. But this unburdening is very costly. You are not really unburdened, you are getting more and more burdened. Only you are not alert.\nPeople have lived for seventy years, and for many many lives, without knowing what life is. They were not mature, they were not integrated, they were not centered. They lived on the periphery.\nIf your periphery meets the other’s periphery a clash happens, and if you go on being concerned that the other person is wrong, you remain on the periphery. Once you realize, “I am responsible for my being; whatsoever has happened, I am the cause, I have done it,” suddenly your consciousness shifts from the periphery to the center. Now you become, for the first time, the center of your world.\nNow much can be done...because whatsoever you don’t like, you can drop; whatsoever you like, you can adopt; whatsoever you feel is true, you can follow, and whatsoever you feel is untrue, you need not follow, because you are now centered and rooted in yourself.\nOne friend asked:\n“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING?\nCAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE\nAND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?” THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…\nOnly friends look at each other. When there is someone to whom you feel antagonistic, you never look at him. You avoid his eyes. Even if you have to look at him, your look is vacant, you don’t allow your eyes to absorb him; he is something foreign, rejected.\nThe eyes are the doors. You need only look towards a person and you can absorb him, let him melt in you.\nTHE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…\nOne friend made the inquiry, the other two were not in any hurry to answer. They waited, they were patient. If there had been any conclusion in their mind, they would have spoken immediately. But they looked at each other. They felt the situation, the inquiry, the heart of the inquiry, the meaning of the question, the depth of the question. Remember, if you can feel the depth of a question, the answer is almost found. But nobody has the patience, nobody is ready to go deep into a question. You ask, but you never really go into the inquiry. You ask for the answer immediately.\nTHE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.\nThe fact, the question, the penetration of it, the depth, the reality, the fact of it, showed plainly that no answer was needed. Any answer would have been foolish, any answer would have been superficial.\nIt is said about Buddha that millions of times people used to ask him questions and he would not answer. If the question demanded a superficial answer, he would not answer; if somebody asked, “Is there a God?” he remained silent. And people are foolish. They began to think that he didn’t believe in God, otherwise he would say yes; or they thought he was ignorant, he didn’t know, otherwise he would say either yes or no!\nWhen you ask a question such as, “Does God exist?” you don’t know what you are asking. Do you think this is a question to be answered? Then you are stupid. Can such vital questions be answered? Then you don’t know the depth of it; then this is curiosity, not inquiry.\nIf the man who was asking Buddha was an authentic seeker, then he would have remained with Buddha’s silence – because the silence was the answer. In that silence he would have felt the question, in that silence the question would have asserted itself strongly. Against the background of the silence it would have become clearer. A clarity would have come to him.\nWhenever you ask a deep question, no answer is required. All that is required is to remain with the question. Don’t move here and there, remain with the question and wait. The very question will become the answer. The question, if you go deep into it, will lead to the very source from where the answer also flows. It is in you.\nBuddha has not answered any real question – and remember that about me also. I go on answering your questions, but I also cannot answer your real questions – and you have not asked yet. Whenever you ask the real question, I am not going to answer, because no real question can be answered, it is not an intellectual thing. Only from heart to heart the transmission happens, not from head to head.\nTHE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…\nWhat happened in that look? They were not heads in that look, they became hearts. They looked at each other, they felt, they tasted the question – and it was so real that there was no answer to it.\nYes, we live without knowing what life is. Yes, we live together without knowing what togetherness is. Yes, we live, forgetting completely that we exist. We have been flying round and round in the sky without knowing where we are going or why.\nThe question was so real that if any answer had been given, that answer would be foolish. Only a fool would answer such a question. They looked at each other, they really looked into each other, and burst out laughing. Why burst out laughing? The whole situation is so absurd. Really, we live without knowing what life is; we exist without becoming aware of existence, we journey and journey without knowing from where or to what or why.\nLife is a mystery. Whenever you confront a mystery laughter will arise, for how can you answer a mystery?\nWhat is the most mysterious thing in you? Laughter is the most mysterious thing in you. No animal can laugh, only man. It is the suprememost glory of man. No animal laughs, no trees laugh – only man laughs. Laughter is the most mysterious element in man.\nAristotle defined man as the rational being. It is not a good definition because reason exists in other animals also. The difference is only of degree, and it is not much. Man can only be defined as the laughing and weeping animal, no other definition will do, because no other animal can weep, no other animal can laugh. This polarity exists only in humanity. This is something mysterious, most mysterious, in man.\nAnger exists all over, it is nothing. Sex exists all over, it is nothing, it is not so mysterious. If you want to understand sex, you can understand animal sex, and all that is applicable to animal sex will be applicable to man. In that way man is nothing more.\nAnger, violence, aggression, possessiveness, jealousy, everything exists and exists more purely and simply in animals than in you. Everything is confused in you. That is why psychologists have to study rats just to study man. They are simple, clear, less confused, and whatsoever they conclude about rats is also true of you. All the psychology laboratories are filled with rats. It has become the most important animal for psychologists because it is like the human in so many ways.\nThe rat is the only animal which follows humanity wherever it goes. It is universal. If you find a man in Siberia, there will be a rat somewhere nearby. Wherever he goes, the rat follows – I suspect that rats have already reached the moon. No other animal can exist everywhere like the rat. And its behavior is absolutely human. Understand the behavior of the rat and you have understood humanity.\nBut the rat cannot laugh, the rat cannot weep. Laughter and weeping are two aspects of something which exists only in man. If you want to understand laughter and weeping you have to study humanity; there is no other way it can be studied. That is why I call it the most distinctive quality of the human mind.\nWhenever you feel mystery you have two alternatives: either you weep or you laugh. It depends on your personality, your type. It is possible, if they had been different types of personality, that the three friends would have wept. When such a mystery surrounds you, when you encounter such an unknowable mystery that no explanation is possible, what can you do? How can you respond?\nBut laughter is better than weeping because weeping comes when the mystery of death surrounds you. Then you weep. And the question was about life so it was relevant to laugh. Whenever you encounter the mystery of death you weep, you feel the relevance whenever death is there.\nThe question was about life, not about death. So it seems relevant that they should look into each other, into the life that was in each – the life pulsating, the life dancing all around and with no explanation, with no secret book to reveal the keys; life in its total mystery, in its total unknowability.\nWhat was there to do? They were not philosophers, they were truthful men, mystics. They laughed, they had no explanation.\nTHUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.\nThis is beautiful! Whenever there is an explanation enmity arises, whenever you believe in something you are divided. Belief creates conflict. The whole world is divided because of belief. You are a Hindu and someone is a Mohammedan, and you are enemies. Why are you enemies? – because of your belief. Belief creates the conflict; foolish explanations, ideologies, create conflict, war.\nLook at this: if there is no explanation, who is a Hindu and who is a Mohammedan? And how can you fight? For what? Men have always been fighting over philosophies, shedding blood, murdering each other, just for foolish beliefs. And if you DO look into beliefs, you can see the foolishness – not of your beliefs, but of others’ beliefs! Your belief is something sacred, but everyone else’s belief looks foolish!\nAll beliefs are foolish. You cannot see your own because it is so near. Really, explanations are foolish, stupid.\nI have heard that a flock of birds was flying south for the winter. One bird at the rear asked another, “How come we always follow this idiot leader?”\nThe other said, “In the first place, all leaders are idiots...” otherwise who wants to lead? Only the foolish are always ready to lead. A wise man hesitates. Life is so mysterious – it is not a readymade path. How can you lead? A wise man hesitates and an idiot is always ready to lead.\n“...And in the second place, he has got the map, so every year we have to follow him.”\nLife has no map and there is no possibility of making a map. It is a pathless path. Without explanations how can you be divided? If there is no explanation, the world will be one. But there are millions of explanations, millions of fragments.\nChuang Tzu says a really very penetrating thing:\nTHEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,\nTHUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.\nNow there was nothing to be enemies about, nothing to fight over. They laughed, and the laughter made them one. They laughed, and the laughter led them into a togetherness. Explain and you are divided, become philosophical and you are separated from others, become a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, then all others are enemies.\nLook at the mystery and laugh, and humanity is one. And then there is no need to say that Christians are brothers of Hindus, Hindus are brothers of Mohammedans. First divide them, make them ill with be-liefs, and then supply this medicine: you are all brothers. And have you seen brothers? They fight more than enemies! So what is the use of making them brothers?\nMan fights for his explanations. All fights are foolish. Man fights for his flags, and look at the flags! What type of foolishness, what type of madness exists in the world? For flags, for symbols, for beliefs, for ideologies?\nSays Chuang Tzu: THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION...they laughed. In that mysterious moment they became one, better friends than before.\nIf you really want to be a friend, have no explanations and no conclusions, don’t believe in anything. And then you are not divided, then humanity is one, then there is no barrier.\nAnd love exists not through mind, it exists through feeling.\nThey laughed. Laughter comes from the heart, laughter comes from the belly, laughter comes from the total being. When three people laugh, they become friends. When three people weep, they become friends. When three people debate, they become enemies.\nTHEN ONE FRIEND DIED. CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE\nTO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.\nConfucius is the man of manners par excellence. Nobody can transcend him. So he is always the butt of Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu. They bring Confucius into their stories just to laugh at his foolishness.\nWhat was his foolishness? He lived by a system, he lived by a form-ula, by theories and beliefs. He was the perfectly civilized man, the most perfect gentleman the world has ever known. He moves, and he moves according to the rule. He looks, and he looks according to the rule. He laughs, and he laughs according to the rule. He never moves beyond the boundary, he lives in a constant bondage of his own making. So he is the butt of their laughter, and Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu very much enjoy bringing him into their stories.\nTHEN ONE FRIEND DIED.\nCONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE\nTO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.\nNeither life nor death is a mystery to him. It is something with a place in a system, and some formality had to be followed. So he sent his disciples to see whether the dead man had been disposed of according to the rules, with the right prayer, the right chanting – as written in the books. The dead should be respected.\nThis is the difference. A man who lives through manners is always thinking of respect, never of love. And what is respect in comparison to love? Love is something alive; respect is absolutely dead.\nTHE DISCIPLE FOUND\nTHAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE LUTE.\nThis was unbelievable! This was disrespectful to a person who is dead! The dead body was lying there, and one friend had composed a song. They loved the other man, and when you love a man you want to give him the last farewell through your love, not through books, not through a readymade song which so many have chanted, so many have used, something already rotten and rubbish. They made up a song of their own, fresh, young. Of course, it was homemade, not produced in a factory, not mass-produced. Just homemade, not very polished of course, because they were not poets, they were friends, and they didn’t know how poetry was created. The meter may have been wrong and the grammar incorrect, but love doesn’t care about grammar, love doesn’t care about meter, love doesn’t care about rhythm, because love has such a vital rhythm of its own, it need not care. When there is no love, everything has to be taken care of because you have to substitute care for love.\nOne was playing the lute – and I know that he was not a lute player either. But how do you say goodbye to a friend? It must come from your heart, it must be spontaneous, it cannot be readymade. That is the point.\nTHEY SANG:\n“HEY SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”\nThe mystery! They did not say, “You are going to heaven.” They don’t know. Otherwise, when someone dies you say, “He has gone to heaven.” Then who will go to hell? No one seems to go to hell.\nIn India, the word for a dead person is SWARGIYA. It means, one who has gone to heaven. Then who is going to hell? They didn’t know, so what was the point of uttering a falsehood? Who knows where this man had gone, this Sung Hu – to hell or heaven? Who knows whether hell and heaven exist? Nobody knows; it is a mystery, and one should not defile a mystery, one should not make it profane, one should not assert falsehoods. It is such a sacred thing, one should not say anything which is not known directly.\n“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”\n– it was a question mark.\n“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?\nYOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE ARE HERE!”\nThey say, “You have gone to the place from where you came.” This is a secret law: the ultimate can only be the beginning. The circle goes round and becomes perfect, complete, and it reaches the same point it started from. The end cannot be anything else but the beginning, the death cannot be anything else but the birth. The final should be the source, the original. One is born out of nothingness and then one dies and moves into nothingness. The boat was empty when you were born and when you die the boat will be empty again. Just a flash of lightning. For a few moments you are in the body and then you disappear. Nobody knows from where you came and where you go.\nThey don’t claim any knowledge. They say, “This much we feel: Sung Hu, you have gone to the place from where you came, and damn it, we are still here.” So they are not sorry for Hu, they are sorry for themselves, that they are hanging in the middle and his circle is perfect.\nWhenever somebody dies, have you felt this? Are you sorry for the person who is dead or sorry for yourself? Really, when someone dies, are you sad for him or her, or for yourself? Everybody is sorry for himself because every death brings the news that you are going to die. But a person who can laugh at the mystery of life knows what it is, because only knowledge, real wisdom, can laugh.\nWhere you really were you have gone...\n“AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE ARE HERE!”\nAnd we are still in the middle. Our journey is incomplete, but your circle has become perfect. So they are sorry for themselves, and if they weep, they are weeping for themselves. For the friend who has departed they have nothing but a song, nothing but a celebration of the heart. If they are sorry, they are sorry for themselves.\nThis is something to be understood very deeply. If you understand life, if you can laugh at it, then death is the completion, then it is not the end. Remember, death is not the end of life, it is the completion, it is the climax, the crescendo, the peak from where the wave returns to the original source.\nThey are sorry for themselves, that their wave is hanging in the middle. They have not reached the crescendo, the peak, and their friend has reached where he was before. He has reached home. Those who understand life, only they can understand death, because life and death are not two. Death is the peak, the ultimate, the final flowering, the fragrance of life.\nDeath looks ugly to you because you have never known life, and death creates fear in you because you are afraid of life. Remember, whatsoever your attitude towards life, your attitude towards death will be the same. If you are scared of death you are scared of life; if you love life, you will love death, because death is nothing but the highest peak, the completion. The song reaches its end, the river falls into the ocean. The river came from the ocean in the first place. Now the circle is complete, the river has arrived at the whole.\nTHEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS BURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:\n“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES,\nTHIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING\nIN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”\nThe disciple of Confucius cannot understand them. To him they look frivolous, disrespectful. What type of song is this? Where did you get it? It is not authorized, it is not from the Vedas. MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS...?\nEverything should be done according to the books, according to The Bible, to the Vedas. But life cannot be according to the books – life always transcends books, it always goes beyond; life always throws books aside, moves ahead.\nWhere have you found this, this frivolous caroling in the presence of the departed? You should be respectful. Someone has departed, someone is dead and what are you doing? This is profane!\nTHE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:\n“POOR FELLOW, HE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”\nHe doesn’t know the new scripture, he doesn’t know the new religion. And that is what is happening here every day – the new liturgy.\nA man was here just a few days ago, a professor of history, and he asked me, “To what tradition do you belong?”\nI said, “To no tradition.”\nHe had come here from America to make a film of the meditation techniques, of the camp, of what I say, of what is happening here. The moment he heard that I don’t belong to any tradition, he simply disappeared. Then I don’t belong to history, it is obvious.\nPoor fellow, he does not know the new liturgy! Enough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8221","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_empty_boat/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_empty_boat/>The Empty Boat</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Three Friends</h1><div class=post-meta>39 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8221 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Empty_Boat/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ONE SAID:</p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND
PRODUCE NOTHING?</p><p>CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p><br></p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?” THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT
EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.</p><p>THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE. THEN ONE FRIEND DIED.
CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p>THE DISCIPLE FOUND</p><p><br></p><p>THAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE LUTE.
THEY SANG:</p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO? HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?</p><p>YOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE
ARE HERE!” THEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS</p><p>BURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:</p><p><br></p><p>“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES,</p><p>THIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:</p><p>“POOR FELLOW,</p><p><br></p><p>HE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing about life is that it has no explanation. It is there
in its absolute glory, but it has no explanation. It is there as a
mystery and if you try to explain it you will miss it. It will not be
explained, but you will become blind through your explanations.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is the enemy of life. The most inimical thing that can
happen to a man is to get fixed and obsessed with explanations. The
moment you think you have the explanation life has left you, you are
already dead.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems to be a paradox. Death may be explained, but life cannot
be explained – because death is something finished, complete, and life
is always an ongoing affair; life is always on the journey, death has
arrived already. When something has reached and is finished, you can
explain it, you can define it. When something is still ongoing, it means
that the unknown is still to be traveled.</p><p>You can know the past but you cannot know the future. You can put the
past into a theory, but how can you put the future into a theory? The
future is always an opening, an infinite opening, and it goes on opening
and opening. So when you explain, the explanation always indicates that
which is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy has explanations so it cannot be very alive, and you
cannot find people who are more dead than philosophers. Life has ebbed
out, life has oozed out of them. They are shrunken heads, like dead
stones. They make much noise but there is no music of life. They have
many explanations, but they have completely forgotten that they have
only explanations in their hands,</p><p><br></p><p>Explanation is like a closed fist. Life is like an open hand. They
are totally different. And when the fist is completely closed there is
no sky in it, no air in it, no space to breathe. You cannot grab the sky
in your closed fist. The fist will miss it. The sky is there, the hand
is open, it is available. Explanation is grabbing, closing, defining –
life oozes out.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a laugh is greater than any philosophy, and when someone laughs
about life he understands it. So all those who have really known have
laughed. And their laughter can be heard even after centuries. Seeing
Buddha holding a flower in his hand, Mahakashyapa laughed. His laughter
can be heard even now. Those who have ears to hear, they will hear his
laughter, just like a river flowing down through the centuries
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen monasteries in Japan, disciples still ask the master, “Tell
us, Master, why did Mahakashyapa laugh?” And those who are more alert
say, “Tell us, Master, why is Mahakashyapa still laughing?” They use the
present, not the past tense. And it is said that the master will reply
only when he feels that you can hear the laughter of Mahakashyapa. If
you cannot hear it, nothing can be said to you about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas have always been laughing. You may not have heard them
because your doors are closed. You may have looked at a buddha and you
may have felt that he is serious, but this seriousness is projected. It
is your own seriousness – you have used the buddha as a screen. Hence,
Christians say Jesus never laughed. This seems absolutely foolish. Jesus
must have laughed and he must have laughed so totally that his whole
being must have become laughter – but the disciples couldn’t hear it,
that is true. They must have remained closed, their own seriousness
projected.</p><p><br></p><p>They could see Jesus on the cross because you all live in such
suffering that you can only see suffering. If they had heard Jesus
laughing, they would have omitted it. It is so contradictory to their
life, it doesn’t fit in. A Jesus laughing doesn’t fit in with you, he
becomes a stranger.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the East it has been different, and in Zen, in Tao, the
laughter reached its peak. It became the polar opposite of
philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>A philosopher is serious because he thinks life is a riddle and a
solution can be found. He works on life with his mind, and he gets more
and more serious. The more he misses life, the more he gets serious and
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Taoists, Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, say that if you can laugh, if you
can feel belly laughter that comes from the very core of your being,
that is not just painted on the surface, if you can feel laughter
that</p><p>comes from the deepest center of your being, spreads all over you,
overflows to the universe, that laughter will give you the first glimpse
of what life is. It is a mystery.</p><p>In Chuang Tzu such laughter is prayerful, because now you accept
life, you don’t hanker for the explanation. How can one find the
explanation? We are part of it. How can the part find the explanation
for the whole? How can the part look at the whole? How can the part
dissect, divide the whole? How can the part go before the whole?</p><p>Explanation means that you must transcend that which you are trying
to explain – you must be there before it existed, you must be there when
it has ceased to exist. You must move around it so you can define it,
and you must dissect so you can reach the heart. A surgeon can find the
explanation, not for life, but for a dead body. All medical definitions
of life are foolish because the surgeon dissects, and when he makes a
conclusion life is there no longer, it is only a corpse. All
explanations are postmortems, life is not there.</p><p>Now even scientists have become aware of the phenomenon that when you
examine human blood, the blood cannot be the same as it was when it was
moving in the veins of the living person. Then it was alive, it had a
different quality; now when it is in the test tube, it is dead. It is
not the same blood, because the basic quality – life – is no longer in
it. All explanations are of that type.</p><p>A flower on the tree is different because life, the shape of life, is
flowing in it. When you cut it from the tree, take it to the lab,
examine it, it is a different flower. Don’t be deceived by the
appearance of it. Now life is no longer flowing in it. You may come to
know the chemical composition of the flower, but that is not the
explanation.</p><p>A poet has a different approach, not through dissection, but through
love, not through uprooting the flower from the tree but rather through
merging with the flower, being with it in deep love, in a participation
mystique. He participates with it, then he comes to know something, and
that is not an explanation. Poetry cannot be an explanation, but it has
a glimpse of the truth. It is truer than any science.</p><p>Watch: when you are in love with someone your heart beats
differently. Your lover, your beloved, will listen to your heart: it
beats differently. Your lover will take your hand...the warmth is
different. The blood moves in a different dance, it pulsates
differently.</p><p>When the doctor takes your hand in his hand, the pulsation is not the
same. He can hear the heart beating but this beat is different. When the
heart was beating for a lover it had a song of its own, but only a lover
can know the beat, only the lover can know the pulsation, the blood, the
warmth of life. The doctor cannot know.</p><p>What has changed? The doctor has become the observer and you are the
observed – you are not one. The doctor treats you like an object. He
looks at you as if he is looking at a thing – that makes the difference.
A lover doesn’t look at you as an object – he becomes one with you, he
merges and melts. He comes to know the deeper core of your being, but he
has no explanation. He feels it, but feeling is different. He cannot
think about it.</p><p>Anything that can be thought will not be alive. Thought deals with
death, it always deals with dead objects; that is why in science there
is no place for feeling. Feeling gives a different dimension to
existence, the dimension of the alive.</p><p>This beautiful story has many things to say to you. Move step by step
into it, and if you reach a conclusion, then understand that you have
missed it. If you reach laughter, then you have understood.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is very telegraphic. As always, those who know will not
utter a single word unnecessarily. They live with the essential.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to be understood is that only friends can discuss
life. Whenever a discussion becomes antagonistic, whenever a discussion
becomes a debate, the dialogue is broken. Life cannot be discussed that
way. Only friends can discuss, because then discussion is not a debate,
it is a dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the difference between a debate and a dialogue? In debate
you are not ready to listen to the other; even if you are listening,
your listening is false. You are not really listening, you are simply
preparing your argument. While the other is speaking you are getting
ready to contradict. While the other is talking, you are simply waiting
for your opportunity to argue back. You have a prejudice already there
in you, you have a theory. You are not in search, you are not ignorant,
you are not innocent; you are already filled, your boat is not empty.
You carry certain theories with you and you are trying to prove them
true.</p><p><br></p><p>A seeker of truth carries no theories with him. He is always open,
vulnerable. He can listen. A Hindu cannot listen, a Mohammedan cannot
listen. How can a Hindu listen? He already knows the truth, there is no
need to listen. You try to make him listen but he cannot; his mind is
already so filled that nothing can penetrate. A Christian cannot listen,
he already knows the truth. He has closed his doors to new breezes, he
has closed his eyes for the new sun to rise, he has reached, he has
arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>All those who feel that they have arrived can debate, but they cannot
move in a dialogue. They can only clash. Then conflict arises and they
oppose each other. In such a discussion you may prove something, but
nothing is proved. You may silence the other, but the other is never
converted. You cannot convince, because this is a sort of war, a
civilized war – you are not fighting with weapons, you are fighting with
words.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says: Three friends were discussing life – that is why
they could reach laughter; otherwise there would have been a conclusion.
One theory might have defeated other theories, one philosophy might have
silenced other philosophies, then there would have been a conclusion –
and conclusion is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has no conclusion. Life has no foolish thought to it. It goes on
and on endlessly; it is always, eternally, an onward affair. How can you
conclude anything about it? The moment you conclude you have stepped out
of it. Life goes on and you have stepped out of the way. You may cling
to your conclusion but life will not wait for you.</p><p>Friends can discuss. Why? You can love a person, you cannot love a
philosophy. Philosophers cannot be friends. You can be either their
disciple or their enemy but you cannot be their friend. Either you are
convinced by them or not convinced, either you follow them or don’t
follow them, but you cannot be friends. A friendship is possible only
between two empty boats. Then you are open to the other, inviting to the
other, then you are constantly an invitation, come to me, enter me, be
with me.</p><p><br></p><p>You can throw away theories and philosophies but you cannot throw
away friendship. And when you are in friendship a dialogue becomes
possible. In dialogue you listen, and if you have to speak, you speak
not to contradict the other, you speak just to seek, to inquire. You
speak, not with a conclusion already reached, but with an inquiry, an
ongoing inquiry. You are not trying to prove something: you speak from
innocence, not from philosophy. Philosophy is never innocent, it is
always cunning, it is a device of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Three friends were discussing life – because between friends a
dialogue is possible. So in the East it has been the tradition that
unless you find friendship, love, reverence, trust, no inquiry is
possible. If you go to a master and your boat is filled with your ideas,
there can be no contact, there can be no dialogue. First you have to be
empty so that friendship becomes possible, so that you can look without
any ideas floating across your eyes, so that you can look without
conclusions. And whenever you can look without conclusions, your
perspective is vast, it is not confined.</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu can read The Bible, but he never understands it. Really, he
never reads it, he cannot listen to it. A Christian can read the Gita,
but he remains the outsider. He never penetrates its innermost being, he
never reaches the inner realm, he moves round and round it. He already
knows that only Christ is true, he already knows that only through
Christ is salvation; he already knows that only Christ is the son of
God. How can he listen to Krishna? Only Christ is truth. Krishna is
bound to be untrue, at the most, a beautiful untruth, but never true. Or
if he concedes much, then he will say, approximately true.</p><p><br></p><p>But what do you mean when you say approximately true? It is untrue!
Truth is either there or not. Nothing can be approximately true. Truth
is, or truth is not. It is always total. You cannot divide it. You
cannot say it is true to some degree. No, truth knows no degree. Either
it is or it is not.</p><p><br></p><p>So when the mind contains the conclusion that Christ is the only
truth, then it is impossible to listen to Krishna. Even if you come
across him on the path you will not be able to listen to him. Even if
you meet Buddha you will not meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole world is filled with conclusions. Someone is a
Chris-tian, someone is a Hindu, someone is a Jaina, someone is a
Buddhist – that is why truth is missing! A religious person cannot be a
Christian, a Hindu, or a Buddhist, a religious person can only be a
sincere inquirer. He inquires and he remains open without any
conclusions. His boat is empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Three friends discussing life<span class=s4></span>Only friends can
discuss because then it becomes a dialogue, then</p><p>the relationship is of I and thou. When you are debating, the
relationship is of I and it. The other is a thing to be converted,
convinced, the other is not a thou; the other has no significance, the
other is just a number.</p><p>In friendship the other is significant, the other has intrinsic
value, the other is an end in himself, you are not trying to convert
him. How can you convert a person? What foolishness! The very effort to
convert a person is foolish. A person is not a thing. A person is so big
and so vast that no theory can be more important than a person. No Bible
is more important than a person, no Gita is more important than a
person. A person means the very glory of life. You can love a person but
you can never convert a person. If you try to convert, you are trying to
manipulate. Then the person has become a means and you are
exploiting.</p><p><br></p><p>Dialogue is possible when your I says thou, when the other is loved,
when there is no ideology behind it. The other is simply loved, and
whether he is a Christian or Hindu doesn’t matter. This is what
friendship means – and friends can discuss life because dialogue is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND
PRODUCE NOTHING?</p><p>CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p><br></p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is not proposing a theory, he is simply raising a question. And
remember, you can raise a question in two ways. Sometimes you raise a
question only because you have to supply an answer and the answer is
already there – you raise the question just to answer it. Then the
question is not real, it is false. The answer is already there. The
question is just a trick, rhetorical; it is not real, authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is authentic when there is no answer in you, when you
question but you don’t question from an answer, when you question simply
to look; the question leaves you empty, just open, inviting,
inquiring.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT...?”</p><p><br></p><p>We live together and we never know anything of what togetherness is.
You can live together for years without knowing what togetherness is.
Look all over the world – people are living together, nobody lives
alone: husbands with wives, wives with husbands, children with parents,
parents with friends; everybody is living together. Life exists in
togetherness, but do you know what togetherness is?</p><p><br></p><p>Living with a wife for forty years, you may not have lived with her
for a single moment. Even while making love to her you may have been
thinking of other things. Then you were not there, the lovemaking was
just mechanical.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once Mulla Nasruddin went to a film with his wife.
They had been married for at least twenty years. The film was one of
those torrid foreign films! As they were leaving the cinema his wife
said, “Nasruddin, you never love me like those actors were doing in the
film. Why?”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “Are you crazy? Do you know how much they are paid
for doing such things?”</p><p><br></p><p>People go on living with each other without any love because you love
only when it pays. And how can you love if you love only when it pays?
Then love has also become a commodity in the market: then it is not a
relationship, it is not a togetherness, it is not a celebration. You are
not happy being with the other, at the most you just tolerate the
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin’s wife was on her deathbed and the doctor said,
“Nasruddin, I must be frank with you; in such moments it is better to be
truthful. Your wife cannot be saved. The disease has gone beyond us, and
you must prepare yourself. Don’t allow yourself to suffer, accept it, it
is your fate. Your wife is going to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “Don’t worry. If I could suffer with her for so many
years, I can suffer for a few hours more!”</p><p><br></p><p>At the most we tolerate. And whenever you think in terms of
toleration, you are suffering, your togetherness is suffering. That is
why Jean-Paul Sartre says, “The other is hell”...because with the other
you simply suffer, the other becomes the bondage, the other becomes the
domination. The other starts creating trouble, and your freedom is lost,
your happiness is lost. Then it becomes a routine, a tolerance. If you
are tolerating the other how can you know the beauty of togetherness?
Really, it has never happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage almost always never happens, because marriage means the
celebration of togetherness. It is not a license. No registry office can
give you marriage; no priest can give it to you as a gift. It is a
tremendous revolution in the being, it is a great transformation in your
very style of life, and it can happen only when you celebrate
togetherness, when the other is no longer felt as the other, when you no
longer feel yourself as I. When the two are not really two, a bridge has
happened, they have become one in a certain sense. Physically they
remain two, but as far as the innermost being is concerned, they have
become one. They may be two poles of one existence but they are not two.
A bridge exists. That bridge gives you glimpses of togetherness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the rarest things to come across a marriage. People live
together because they cannot live alone. Remember this: because they
cannot live alone, that is why they live together. To live alone is
uncomfortable, to live alone is uneconomical, to live alone is
difficult, that is why they live together. The reasons are negative.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was going to get married and somebody asked him, “You have
always been against marriage, why have you suddenly changed your
mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Winter is coming on and people say that it is going to be
very cold. Central heating is beyond me and a wife is cheaper!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the logic. You live with someone because it is comfortable,
convenient, economical, cheaper. To live alone is really difficult: a
wife is so many things, the housekeeper, the cook, the servant, the
nurse – so many things. She is the cheapest labor in the world, doing so
many things without being paid at all. It is an exploitation.</p><p>Marriage exists as an institution of exploitation, it is not
togetherness. That is why no happiness comes out of it as a flowering.
It cannot. Out of the roots of exploitation how can ecstasy be born?</p><p><br></p><p>There are your so-called saints who keep saying that you are
miserable because you live in a family, because you live in the world.
They say, “Leave everything, renounce!” And their logic appears to be
right, not because it IS right, but because you have missed
togetherness. Otherwise, all those saints would seem absolutely wrong.
One who has known togetherness has known the divine; one who is really
married has known the divine, because love is the greatest door.</p><p><br></p><p>But togetherness is not there and you live together without knowing
what togetherness is; you live that way for seventy, eighty years
without knowing what life is. You drift without any roots in life. You
just move from one moment to another without tasting what life gives
you. And it is not given to you at birth. It is not hereditary to know
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life comes through birth but the wisdom, the experience, the
ecs-tasy, has to be learnt. Hence the meaning of meditation. You have to
earn it, you have to grow towards it, you have to attain a certain
maturity; only then will you be able to know it.</p><p><br></p><p>Life can open to you only in a certain moment of maturity. But people
live and die childishly. They never really grow, they never attain to
maturity.</p><p><br></p><p>What is maturity? Just becoming sexually mature does not mean you are
mature. Ask the psychologists: they say that the average adult mental
age remains nearabout thirteen or fourteen. Your physical body goes on
growing but your mind stops at about the age of thirteen. It is no
wonder you behave so foolishly, why your life becomes a continuous
foolishness! A mind which has not grown up is bound to do something
wrong every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And the immature mind always throws responsibility onto the other.
You feel unhappy and think that it is because everybody else is creating
hell for you. “The other is hell.” I say this assertion of Sartre is
very immature. If you are mature, the other can also become heaven. The
other is whatsoever you are because the other is just a mirror, he
reflects you.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say maturity, I mean an inner integrity. And this inner
integrity comes only when you stop making others responsible, when you
stop saying that the other is creating your suffering, when you start
realizing that you are the creator of your suffering. This is the first
step towards maturity: I am responsible. Whatsoever is happening, it is
my doing.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel sad. Is this your doing? You will feel very much disturbed,
but if you can remain with this feeling, sooner or later you will be
able to stop doing many things. This is what the theory of karma is all
about. You are responsible. Don’t say society is responsible, don’t say
that parents are responsible, don’t say the economic conditions are
responsible, don’t throw the responsibility onto anybody. YOU are
responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning, this will look like a burden because now you cannot
throw the responsibility on anyone else. But take it.…</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Mulla Nasruddin, “Why do you look so sad?”</p><p>He said, “My wife has insisted that I stop gambling, smoking,
drinking, playing cards. I have stopped all of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the man said, “Your wife must be very happy now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “That is the problem. Now she cannot find anything to
complain about, so she is very unhappy. She starts talking, but she
cannot find anything to complain about. Now she cannot make me
responsible for anything and I have never seen her so unhappy. I thought
that when I gave up all these things she would cheer up, but she has
become more unhappy than ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on throwing responsibility onto others and they all do
whatsoever you tell them to do, you will end up committing suicide.
Eventually there will be nowhere left to throw your
responsibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is good to have a few faults; it helps others to be happy. If
there is a really perfect husband, the wife will leave him. How can you
dominate a perfect man? So even if you don’t want to, go on doing
something wrong so the wife can dominate you and feel happy!</p><p><br></p><p>Where there is a perfect husband there is bound to be divorce. Find a
perfect man and you will all be against him, because you cannot condemn,
you cannot say anything wrong about him. Our minds love to throw
responsibility onto somebody else. Our minds want to com-plain. It makes
us feel good, because then we are not responsible, we are unburdened.
But this unburdening is very costly. You are not really unburdened, you
are getting more and more burdened. Only you are not alert.</p><p><br></p><p>People have lived for seventy years, and for many many lives, without
knowing what life is. They were not mature, they were not integrated,
they were not centered. They lived on the periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>If your periphery meets the other’s periphery a clash happens, and if
you go on being concerned that the other person is wrong, you remain on
the periphery. Once you realize, “I am responsible for my being;
whatsoever has happened, I am the cause, I have done it,” suddenly your
consciousness shifts from the periphery to the center. Now you become,
for the first time, the center of your world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now much can be done...because whatsoever you don’t like, you can
drop; whatsoever you like, you can adopt; whatsoever you feel is true,
you can follow, and whatsoever you feel is untrue, you need not follow,
because you are now centered and rooted in yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>One friend asked:</p><p><br></p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND
PRODUCE NOTHING?</p><p>CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p><br></p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?” THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT
EACH OTHER.…</p><p>Only friends look at each other. When there is someone to whom you
feel antagonistic, you never look at him. You avoid his eyes. Even if
you have to look at him, your look is vacant, you don’t allow your eyes
to absorb him; he is something foreign, rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes are the doors. You need only look towards a person and you
can absorb him, let him melt in you.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…</p><p><br></p><p>One friend made the inquiry, the other two were not in any hurry to
answer. They waited, they were patient. If there had been any conclusion
in their mind, they would have spoken immediately. But they looked at
each other. They felt the situation, the inquiry, the heart of the
inquiry, the meaning of the question, the depth of the question.
Remember, if you can feel the depth of a question, the answer is almost
found. But nobody has the patience, nobody is ready to go deep into a
question. You ask, but you never really go into the inquiry. You ask for
the answer immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.</p><p>The fact, the question, the penetration of it, the depth, the
reality, the fact of it, showed plainly that no answer was needed. Any
answer would have been foolish, any answer would have been
superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about Buddha that millions of times people used to ask him
questions and he would not answer. If the question demanded a
superficial answer, he would not answer; if somebody asked, “Is there a
God?” he remained silent. And people are foolish. They began to think
that he didn’t believe in God, otherwise he would say yes; or they
thought he was ignorant, he didn’t know, otherwise he would say either
yes or no!</p><p><br></p><p>When you ask a question such as, “Does God exist?” you don’t know
what you are asking. Do you think this is a question to be answered?
Then you are stupid. Can such vital questions be answered? Then you
don’t know the depth of it; then this is curiosity, not inquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>If the man who was asking Buddha was an authentic seeker, then he
would have remained with Buddha’s silence – because the silence was the
answer. In that silence he would have felt the question, in that silence
the question would have asserted itself strongly. Against the background
of the silence it would have become clearer. A clarity would have come
to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you ask a deep question, no answer is required. All that is
required is to remain with the question. Don’t move here and there,
remain with the question and wait. The very question will become the
answer. The question, if you go deep into it, will lead to the very
source from where the answer also flows. It is in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has not answered any real question – and remember that about
me also. I go on answering your questions, but I also cannot answer your
real questions – and you have not asked yet. Whenever you ask the real
question, I am not going to answer, because no real question can be
answered, it is not an intellectual thing. Only from heart to heart the
transmission happens, not from head to head.</p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…</p><p><br></p><p>What happened in that look? They were not heads in that look, they
became hearts. They looked at each other, they felt, they tasted the
question – and it was so real that there was no answer to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, we live without knowing what life is. Yes, we live together
without knowing what togetherness is. Yes, we live, forgetting
completely that we exist. We have been flying round and round in the sky
without knowing where we are going or why.</p><p><br></p><p>The question was so real that if any answer had been given, that
answer would be foolish. Only a fool would answer such a question. They
looked at each other, they really looked into each other, and burst out
laughing. Why burst out laughing? The whole situation is so absurd.
Really, we live without knowing what life is; we exist without becoming
aware of existence, we journey and journey without knowing from where or
to what or why.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a mystery. Whenever you confront a mystery laughter will
arise, for how can you answer a mystery?</p><p><br></p><p>What is the most mysterious thing in you? Laughter is the most
mysterious thing in you. No animal can laugh, only man. It is the
suprememost glory of man. No animal laughs, no trees laugh – only man
laughs. Laughter is the most mysterious element in man.</p><p><br></p><p>Aristotle defined man as the rational being. It is not a good
definition because reason exists in other animals also. The difference
is only of degree, and it is not much. Man can only be defined as the
laughing and weeping animal, no other definition will do, because no
other animal can weep, no other animal can laugh. This polarity exists
only in humanity. This is something mysterious, most mysterious, in
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger exists all over, it is nothing. Sex exists all over, it is
nothing, it is not so mysterious. If you want to understand sex, you can
understand animal sex, and all that is applicable to animal sex will be
applicable to man. In that way man is nothing more.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger, violence, aggression, possessiveness, jealousy, everything
exists and exists more purely and simply in animals than in you.
Everything is confused in you. That is why psychologists have to study
rats just to study man. They are simple, clear, less confused, and
whatsoever they conclude about rats is also true of you. All the
psychology laboratories are filled with rats. It has become the most
important animal for psychologists because it is like the human in so
many ways.</p><p><br></p><p>The rat is the only animal which follows humanity wherever it goes.
It is universal. If you find a man in Siberia, there will be a rat
somewhere nearby. Wherever he goes, the rat follows – I suspect that
rats have already reached the moon. No other animal can exist everywhere
like the rat. And its behavior is absolutely human. Understand the
behavior of the rat and you have understood humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>But the rat cannot laugh, the rat cannot weep. Laughter and weeping
are two aspects of something which exists only in man. If you want to
understand laughter and weeping you have to study humanity; there is no
other way it can be studied. That is why I call it the most distinctive
quality of the human mind.</p><p>Whenever you feel mystery you have two alternatives: either you weep
or you laugh. It depends on your personality, your type. It is possible,
if they had been different types of personality, that the three friends
would have wept. When such a mystery surrounds you, when you encounter
such an unknowable mystery that no explanation is possible, what can you
do? How can you respond?</p><p><br></p><p>But laughter is better than weeping because weeping comes when the
mystery of death surrounds you. Then you weep. And the question was
about life so it was relevant to laugh. Whenever you encounter the
mystery of death you weep, you feel the relevance whenever death is
there.</p><p><br></p><p>The question was about life, not about death. So it seems relevant
that they should look into each other, into the life that was in each –
the life pulsating, the life dancing all around and with no explanation,
with no secret book to reveal the keys; life in its total mystery, in
its total unknowability.</p><p><br></p><p>What was there to do? They were not philosophers, they were truthful
men, mystics. They laughed, they had no explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>This is beautiful! Whenever there is an explanation enmity arises,
whenever you believe in something you are divided. Belief creates
conflict. The whole world is divided because of belief. You are a Hindu
and someone is a Mohammedan, and you are enemies. Why are you enemies? –
because of your belief. Belief creates the conflict; foolish
explanations, ideologies, create conflict, war.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at this: if there is no explanation, who is a Hindu and who is a
Mohammedan? And how can you fight? For what? Men have always been
fighting over philosophies, shedding blood, murdering each other, just
for foolish beliefs. And if you DO look into beliefs, you can see the
foolishness – not of your beliefs, but of others’ beliefs! Your belief
is something sacred, but everyone else’s belief looks foolish!</p><p><br></p><p>All beliefs are foolish. You cannot see your own because it is so
near. Really, explanations are foolish, stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a flock of birds was flying south for the winter.
One bird at the rear asked another, “How come we always follow this
idiot leader?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other said, “In the first place, all leaders are idiots...”
otherwise who wants to lead? Only the foolish are always ready to lead.
A wise man hesitates. Life is so mysterious – it is not a readymade
path. How can you lead? A wise man hesitates and an idiot is always
ready to lead.</p><p><br></p><p>“...And in the second place, he has got the map, so every year we
have to follow him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Life has no map and there is no possibility of making a map. It is a
pathless path. Without explanations how can you be divided? If there is
no explanation, the world will be one. But there are millions of
explanations, millions of fragments.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says a really very penetrating thing:</p><p>THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there was nothing to be enemies about, nothing to fight over.
They laughed, and the laughter made them one. They laughed, and the
laughter led them into a togetherness. Explain and you are divided,
become philosophical and you are separated from others, become a Hindu,
a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, then all others are enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the mystery and laugh, and humanity is one. And then there is
no need to say that Christians are brothers of Hindus, Hindus are
brothers of Mohammedans. First divide them, make them ill with be-liefs,
and then supply this medicine: you are all brothers. And have you seen
brothers? They fight more than enemies! So what is the use of making
them brothers?</p><p><br></p><p>Man fights for his explanations. All fights are foolish. Man fights
for his flags, and look at the flags! What type of foolishness, what
type of madness exists in the world? For flags, for symbols, for
beliefs, for ideologies?</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu: THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION...they laughed. In that
mysterious moment they became one, better friends than before.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to be a friend, have no explanations and no
conclusions, don’t believe in anything. And then you are not divided,
then humanity is one, then there is no barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>And love exists not through mind, it exists through feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>They laughed. Laughter comes from the heart, laughter comes from the
belly, laughter comes from the total being. When three people laugh,
they become friends. When three people weep, they become friends. When
three people debate, they become enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN ONE FRIEND DIED. CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius is the man of manners par excellence. Nobody can transcend
him. So he is always the butt of Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu. They bring
Confucius into their stories just to laugh at his foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>What was his foolishness? He lived by a system, he lived by a
form-ula, by theories and beliefs. He was the perfectly civilized man,
the most perfect gentleman the world has ever known. He moves, and he
moves according to the rule. He looks, and he looks according to the
rule. He laughs, and he laughs according to the rule. He never moves
beyond the boundary, he lives in a constant bondage of his own making.
So he is the butt of their laughter, and Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu very
much enjoy bringing him into their stories.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN ONE FRIEND DIED.</p><p>CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p><br></p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither life nor death is a mystery to him. It is something with a
place in a system, and some formality had to be followed. So he sent his
disciples to see whether the dead man had been disposed of according to
the rules, with the right prayer, the right chanting – as written in the
books. The dead should be respected.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference. A man who lives through manners is always
thinking of respect, never of love. And what is respect in comparison to
love? Love is something alive; respect is absolutely dead.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DISCIPLE FOUND</p><p><br></p><p>THAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE
LUTE.</p><p>This was unbelievable! This was disrespectful to a person who is
dead! The dead body was lying there, and one friend had composed a song.
They loved the other man, and when you love a man you want to give him
the last farewell through your love, not through books, not through a
readymade song which so many have chanted, so many have used, something
already rotten and rubbish. They made up a song of their own, fresh,
young. Of course, it was homemade, not produced in a factory, not
mass-produced. Just homemade, not very polished of course, because they
were not poets, they were friends, and they didn’t know how poetry was
created. The meter may have been wrong and the grammar incorrect, but
love doesn’t care about grammar, love doesn’t care about meter, love
doesn’t care about rhythm, because love has such a vital rhythm of its
own, it need not care. When there is no love, everything has to be taken
care of because you have to substitute care for love.</p><p><br></p><p>One was playing the lute – and I know that he was not a lute player
either. But how do you say goodbye to a friend? It must come from your
heart, it must be spontaneous, it cannot be readymade. That is the
point.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY SANG:</p><p><br></p><p>“HEY SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystery! They did not say, “You are going to heaven.” They don’t
know. Otherwise, when someone dies you say, “He has gone to heaven.”
Then who will go to hell? No one seems to go to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the word for a dead person is SWARGIYA. It means, one who
has gone to heaven. Then who is going to hell? They didn’t know, so what
was the point of uttering a falsehood? Who knows where this man had
gone, this Sung Hu – to hell or heaven? Who knows whether hell and
heaven exist? Nobody knows; it is a mystery, and one should not defile a
mystery, one should not make it profane, one should not assert
falsehoods. It is such a sacred thing, one should not say anything which
is not known directly.</p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”</p><p><br></p><p>– it was a question mark.</p><p><br></p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE
ARE HERE!”</p><p>They say, “You have gone to the place from where you came.” This is a
secret law: the ultimate can only be the beginning. The circle goes
round and becomes perfect, complete, and it reaches the same point it
started from. The end cannot be anything else but the beginning, the
death cannot be anything else but the birth. The final should be the
source, the original. One is born out of nothingness and then one dies
and moves into nothingness. The boat was empty when you were born and
when you die the boat will be empty again. Just a flash of lightning.
For a few moments you are in the body and then you disappear. Nobody
knows from where you came and where you go.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t claim any knowledge. They say, “This much we feel: Sung
Hu, you have gone to the place from where you came, and damn it, we are
still here.” So they are not sorry for Hu, they are sorry for
themselves, that they are hanging in the middle and his circle is
perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever somebody dies, have you felt this? Are you sorry for the
person who is dead or sorry for yourself? Really, when someone dies, are
you sad for him or her, or for yourself? Everybody is sorry for himself
because every death brings the news that you are going to die. But a
person who can laugh at the mystery of life knows what it is, because
only knowledge, real wisdom, can laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Where you really were you have gone...</p><p><br></p><p>“AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE ARE HERE!”</p><p><br></p><p>And we are still in the middle. Our journey is incomplete, but your
circle has become perfect. So they are sorry for themselves, and if they
weep, they are weeping for themselves. For the friend who has departed
they have nothing but a song, nothing but a celebration of the heart. If
they are sorry, they are sorry for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something to be understood very deeply. If you understand
life, if you can laugh at it, then death is the completion, then it is
not the end. Remember, death is not the end of life, it is the
completion, it is the climax, the crescendo, the peak from where the
wave returns to the original source.</p><p><br></p><p>They are sorry for themselves, that their wave is hanging in the
middle. They have not reached the crescendo, the peak, and their friend
has reached where he was before. He has reached home. Those who
understand life, only they can understand death, because life and death
are not two. Death is the peak, the ultimate, the final flowering, the
fragrance of life.</p><p>Death looks ugly to you because you have never known life, and death
creates fear in you because you are afraid of life. Remember, whatsoever
your attitude towards life, your attitude towards death will be the
same. If you are scared of death you are scared of life; if you love
life, you will love death, because death is nothing but the highest
peak, the completion. The song reaches its end, the river falls into the
ocean. The river came from the ocean in the first place. Now the circle
is complete, the river has arrived at the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS BURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:</p><p>“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES,</p><p>THIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple of Confucius cannot understand them. To him they look
frivolous, disrespectful. What type of song is this? Where did you get
it? It is not authorized, it is not from the Vedas. MAY I INQUIRE WHERE
YOU FOUND THIS...?</p><p><br></p><p>Everything should be done according to the books, according to The
Bible, to the Vedas. But life cannot be according to the books – life
always transcends books, it always goes beyond; life always throws books
aside, moves ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Where have you found this, this frivolous caroling in the presence of
the departed? You should be respectful. Someone has departed, someone is
dead and what are you doing? This is profane!</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:</p><p>“POOR FELLOW, HE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”</p><p><br></p><p>He doesn’t know the new scripture, he doesn’t know the new religion.
And that is what is happening here every day – the new liturgy.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was here just a few days ago, a professor of history, and he
asked me, “To what tradition do you belong?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “To no tradition.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had come here from America to make a film of the meditation
techniques, of the camp, of what I say, of what is happening here. The
moment he heard that I don’t belong to any tradition, he simply
disappeared. Then I don’t belong to history, it is obvious.</p><p>Poor fellow, he does not know the new liturgy! Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

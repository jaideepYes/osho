‌CHAPTER 1
The Toast Is Burned
10 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
HE WHO RULES MEN, LIVES IN CONFUSION; HE WHO IS RULED BY MEN LIVES IN SORROW. TAO THEREFORE DESIRED
NEITHER TO INFLUENCE OTHERS NOR BE INFLUENCED BY THEM.
THE WAY TO GET CLEAR OF CONFUSION AND FREE OF SORROW IS TO LIVE WITH TAO IN THE LAND OF THE VOID.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Wholeness
19 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
HOW DOES THE TRUE MAN OF TAO
WALK THROUGH WALLS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION AND STAND IN FIRE WITHOUT BEING BURNT?
NOT BECAUSE OF CUNNING OR DARING, NOT BECAUSE HE HAS LEARNED –
BUT BECAUSE HE HAS UNLEARNED.
HIS NATURE SINKS TO ITS ROOT IN THE ONE. HIS VITALITY, HIS POWER,
HIDE IN SECRET TAO. WHEN HE IS ALL ONE, THERE IS NO FLAW IN HIM</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Man of Tao
11 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT, HARMS NO OTHER BEING BY HIS ACTIONS,
YET HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF TO BE KIND AND GENTLE. HE DOES NOT STRUGGLE TO MAKE MONEY,
AND HE DOES NOT MAKE A VIRTUE OF POVERTY. HE GOES HIS WAY WITHOUT RELYING ON OTHERS,
AND DOES NOT PRIDE HIMSELF ON WALKING ALONE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
The Owl and the Phoenix
12 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
HUI TZU WAS PRIME MINISTER OF LIANG.
HE HAD WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE INSIDE INFORMATION THAT CHUANG TZU COVETED HIS POST,
AND WAS PLOTTING TO SUPPLANT HIM. WHEN CHUANG TZU CAME TO VISIT LIANG
THE PRIME MINISTER SENT OUT POLICE TO ARREST HIM,
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY SEARCHED FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS THEY COULD NOT FIND HIM.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Apologies
13 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
IF A MAN STEPS ON A STRANGER’S FOOT IN THE MARKETPLACE,
HE MAKES A POLITE APOLOGY AND OFFERS AN EXPLANATION: “THIS PLACE IS SO CROWDED.” IF AN ELDER BROTHER
STEPS ON HIS YOUNGER BROTHER’S FOOT HE SAYS, “SORRY,”
AND THAT IS THAT. IF A PARENT
TREADS ON HIS CHILD’S FOOT NOTHING IS SAID AT ALL.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Three in the Morning
14 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
WHAT IS THIS THREE IN THE MORNING? IT IS ABOUT A MONKEY TRAINER
WHO WENT TO HIS MONKEYS AND TOLD THEM: “AS REGARDS YOUR CHESTNUTS,
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THREE MEASURES IN THE MORNING, AND FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.”
ON HEARING THIS ALL THE MONKEYS BECAME ANGRY. SO THE KEEPER SAID:</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Need to Win
15 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
WHEN AN ARCHER IS SHOOTING FOR FUN HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL.
IF HE SHOOTS FOR A BRASS BUCKLE HE IS ALREADY NERVOUS.
IF HE SHOOTS FOR A PRIZE OF GOLD HE GOES BLIND
OR SEES TWO TARGETS – HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND.
HIS SKILL HAS NOT CHANGED, BUT THE PRIZE DIVIDES HIM.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Three Friends
16 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE. ONE SAID:
“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT, WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING?
CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE
AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?” THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.
THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,
THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
The Useless
17 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
HUI TZU SAID TO CHUANG TZU:
“ALL YOUR TEACHING IS CENTERED ON WHAT HAS NO USE.” CHUANG TZU REPLIED:
“IF YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HAS NO USE YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE USED. THE EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, IS BROAD AND VAST,
BUT OF ALL THIS EXPANSE A MAN USES ONLY A FEW INCHES UPON WHICH HE HAPPENS TO BE STANDING AT THE TIME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Means and Ends
18 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall
THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP IS TO CATCH FISH,
AND WHEN THE FISH ARE CAUGHT THE TRAP IS FORGOTTEN.
THE PURPOSE OF WORDS IS TO CONVEY IDEAS.
WHEN THE IDEAS ARE GRASPED THE WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN. WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN
WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS? HE IS THE ONE</description>

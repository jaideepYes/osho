These are not the words of a philosopher, these are the experiences of a mystic.\nAlmustafa is just a name. It is Kahlil Gibran who is speaking through him – and for a special reason. He could have spoken directly in his own name; there was no need for Almustafa to be a medium. But Kahlil Gibran does not want to create a religion, although whatever he has said is the fundamental religiousness. To avoid it... because in the name of religion so much inhumanity to human beings has been done, so much bloodshed.…\nMillions of people have been killed. Thousands have been burned alive. The moment any religion becomes organized and crystallized it becomes a danger to all that is valuable in life. Then it is no longer the path to God, it becomes an excuse for war.\nKahlil Gibran keeps himself hiding behind Almustafa so people don’t start worshipping him, so people don’t continue the ugly past. Rather than saying directly what he wants to say, he has created a device: Almustafa. Because of Almustafa, his book is not counted as a holy book – although it is one of the most holy books in the world. Compared to it, all other holy books will appear unholy.\nHe created Almustafa so that his book would be taken as fiction, as poetry. This is his compassion, and this is his greatness. You can look in all the holy scriptures; you will not find words so alive that they go directly like arrows into your heart. And you will find much that is inhuman, unworthy of remaining in those holy scriptures. But man is so blind – just the small fiction of Almustafa, and people have forgotten a simple fact: that these truths cannot be asserted unless you have experienced them, unless they are your own.\nKahlil Gibran has prepared the ground for me. He has sown the seeds in unknown fields, in “unremembered seasons.”\nI am here in the right time for the harvest.\nYou are my harvest. You are the fruits and the flowers. Talking on Kahlil Gibran is just to remind you about your seeds. And also, something more important.…\nThere is an ancient story in the land of Kahlil Gibran – one of the most beautiful lands on the earth, Lebanon. It is famous only for two things – Kahlil Gibran and thousands-of-years-old cedar trees which are still trying to reach towards the stars.\nKahlil Gibran was also doing that. The cedars of Lebanon have not succeeded yet, but Kahlil Gibran has succeeded. Perhaps one day those cedars will also reach to the stars.\nOne of the most important Dutch painters, Vincent van Gogh – perhaps the most important as far as insight, understanding is concerned – in all his paintings, his trees always go beyond the stars; the stars are left behind. He was thought mad by his contemporaries. He was asked again and again: “Where have you seen trees growing above the faraway stars?”\nVincent van Gogh said, “I have not seen them, but sitting by the side of the trees, I have heard their longings. And I paint the flower even before the seed has been sown.”\nAll his stars are strange: he has painted them as spirals. Even the painters laughed at him – “You must be insane. Stars are not spirals.” He said, “What can I do? Not only in my dreams but even in my wakefulness, my heart always feels that they are spirals.” He could not sell a single painting in his whole life – who will purchase such paintings? And he painted them with his blood, with his very life.\nHe used to get from his younger brother just enough money every week so that he could eat two meals a day for seven days. He used to fast three days in the week so he could purchase paints, canvasses. No other painter has painted with such longing, with such deep love.\nHe lived just to paint; he died when he was thirty-three. And just a few months ago, physicists have come to the conclusion that stars are spirals – one hundred years afterwards.\nThe poet has certainly some unknown shortcut to knowing things. He cannot prove it. He is not a scientist, he is not a logician. But the contemporaries are thousands of years behind. It is very rare to find an individual who is authentically contemporary. Rajiv Gandhi, the prime minister of India, won the election on a single slogan: “I want India to enter the twenty-first century.” And not a single man in this vast country of nine hundred million people asked him whether the country has yet reached the twentieth century! People are living in thousands-of-years-old superstitions, in ideologies which have no relevance to truth. And they are not willing to come out of their darkness.\nI would like my people to be not only of this century or of the twenty-first century; I would like my people to be the people of the whole future. When you can be masters of the whole future, why unnecessarily remain beggars?\nListen to these words, because these are not words, these are living flames. It is pure fire. If it cannot consume you, you have not heard it:\nLOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF...\nSuch a tremendous statement, which will always remain fresh. I cannot conceive of any time in the future when this statement will become out of date. If you can understand it, if you can live it, the whole future also becomes yours. It can open the doors of the unknown reality that awaits you.\nLove gives naught but itself... You also give when you are in love – flowers, ice cream, bhelpuri. But this is not love, this is bargaining, business.\nIn a small school, the teacher had been insisting on the greatness of Jesus for almost one hour to the students. The school belonged to a church; it was an international school.\nAfter one hour, she asked, “Can anyone say who is the greatest man in history?” A little boy, an American, said, “Abraham Lincoln.”\nThe teacher could not believe it. For one hour she had been hammering into their heads that Jesus Christ is the highest peak human consciousness has ever achieved, and this idiot says “Abraham Lincoln”!\nShe said, “You are not wrong, but not right either. Sit down.”\nAnother girl stood up to answer the same question and she said, “Winston Churchill.”\nThe teacher said, “My god!” But because the school was in England and Winston Churchill was the prime minister, she could not say, “You are not right.” She said, “You are very close to the truth.”\nAnd then a very small boy started waving his hand – and this was strange, because this boy had never done such a thing. He was a very silent individual.\nThe teacher said, “What is your answer?”\nHe said, “There is no question; everybody knows Jesus Christ is the greatest man in the world.”\nThe teacher was shocked even more, because the boy was a Jew. But there was a seal waiting – whoever gives the right answer is going to win the seal. The little boy, carrying the big seal, was followed by the teacher and caught outside the school. The teacher said, “Listen, are you not a Jew?”\nHe said, “Of course I am. What is the problem? Why are you following me?”\nShe said, “Being a Jew... and you declare Jesus Christ to be the greatest man in the world?”\nHe laughed. He said, “Ah, yes. In the deepest core of my heart, I know that Moses is the greatest man in the world. But business is business.”\nLove is not business, but man has reduced love into business.\nLove gives only itself because there is nothing higher to give. Can you think of anything greater? anything more valuable?\nLove gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself – that is even more significant to understand. Love knows only giving; even the idea of getting something in return does not arise. But this is the miracle of existence: if you give love, love returns a thousandfold back to you, your own love.\nThere is no need to be a beggar. Love makes you an emperor. It gives itself, and strangely enough finds that the same love has become a thousandfold and has returned from all directions. The more you give it the more you have it.\nHumanity looks so poor because we have forgotten the cosmic law. Instead of giving, love has become a beggar, it is continuously asking. The wife is asking, “Give me love, I am your wife.” The husband is saying, “Give me love.” Everyone is asking “Give me love.” Who is going to give? – all are beggars.\nYou should come near an emperor like me, who gives and goes on giving, because it is an inexhaustible source.\nAnd the more I have loved people, the more I was surprised: my love has increased and I can give more.\nI have heard a story:\nA man’s dog died. He had been very loving towards the dog, and the dog was rare – a beautiful piece of art. It was not just an ordinary dog; generations of crossbreeding had created it. The man was very sad. He went to the same pet shop where he had purchased the first dog, and said that he wanted something better; otherwise he would not be able to forget his old dog.\nThe owner said, “Don’t be worried. I have a very rare dog – and very cheap.” He showed him the dog and certainly, the man had never seen such a beautiful dog with such a philosophical face, with such loving eyes, with such a beautiful body.\nHe said, “I am ready to pay anything.”\nBut the owner said, “He’s not very costly, he’s the cheapest dog I have. There are more costly dogs if you want.”\nThe man went around and he was surprised: those costly dogs were nothing compared to that cheap dog. He asked the owner: “I’m puzzled and confused. Why are you selling that dog so cheap?”\nThe owner said, “You don’t understand. First purchase it, and then you will understand.”\nSo he purchased the dog – at such a cheap price! You could not even get a vagabond dog from the street at that price.\nPuzzled, he went home. In the morning he looked and the dog had disappeared. He said, “My god, where has the dog gone? The house was locked and I am alone.”\nHe rushed back to the shop and the dog was there, sitting in his place. The owner said, “Have you understood why he is the cheapest dog? He always comes back. He has been sold a thousand times but he is so obedient.You can have him,” he said, “but what is the point?”\nWhen I read the story I could remember only one thing in my experience... because I don’t have a dog, although dogs come once in awhile. But I know about love. It is not only cheap, it has no price at all. To be loving costs nothing, and yet it always comes back a thousandfold. You go on becoming richer and richer. It is a strange economics of existence.\nLOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF. LOVE POSSESSES NOT NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED.\nThe moment you possess anything, you have killed it. And millions are the people in the world who have killed their love with their own hands. They should look at their hands – they are covered with the blood of their own love. And now they are miserable; they never wanted to kill, there was no intention to kill, but in their unconsciousness they started possessing. If they loved someone, they wanted to possess that person totally. Husbands are possessing their wives, wives are posessing their husands, parents are possessing their children. Teachers are trying in every possible way to possess their students. Politicians are trying to possess countries. Religions are trying to possess millions of people and their lives.\nThey are all murderers, because the moment you try to possess, you have killed. Life thrives only in freedom.\nIf you love, you will give more and more freedom to your beloved.\nAnd love never allows anyone to possess it – because love is your very soul. If you allow somebody to possess it, you have committed suicide.\nSo either love is murdered or commits suicide. People are simply walking corpses with begging bowls, searching for love, for warmth, for tenderness. And they are not going to find it because they have created a stupid society, they have created a mad world.\nThe basis of everybody going neurotic or psychotic is simple: their souls are not nourished. Love is the very nourishment. You can have all the wealth of the world; if you don’t have love, you are the poorest man – unnecessarily burdened with wealth, palaces, empires.\nBut one who loves, one who has known the secret of love – not to possess and not to be possessed – is really born again. He has become, in the true sense, alive. He will have all the beautiful experiences of life, all the great ecstasies of existence.\nIf love grows in your heart, you are pregnant with God. It is God growing within you. Slowly, slowly you will disappear and there will only be pure godliness. It is felt.…\nThose who have been close to Gautam Buddha or Mahavira have felt it. It is a strange story that neither Mahavira believes in God nor Buddha believes in God. People think that they are atheists, but no, absolutely no. They don’t believe in God because they themselves are God.\nYou believe in God because your God is somewhere high beyond the sky; you are just a creature, creeping on the earth. Why should a Buddha believe in God? He’s within him, he himself has\nbecome the temple of God. So although they denied the existence of God, the reason for the denial was not the same as the reason of an atheist.\nThe atheist denies God because God cannot be proved logically. The atheist should deny love too, because love also cannot be proved logically.\nI have known many atheists and I have asked them only one question: “Have you ever fallen in love?”\nAnd they were surprised. They said, “Why are you changing the subject? We were talking about God.”\nI said, “I am not changing the subject, I am coming to the subject. Have you ever fallen in love?” They said, “Yes, we have loved.”\n“Then,” I said, “think once again. Can you prove scientifically, rationally, logically, that love exists?” They said, “We cannot.”\n“Then,” I said, “stop denying God, because for the same reasons, you have been denying God.”\nOnly a man like Gautam Buddha has the right to deny God, because he has found him. And he has found him not somewhere else, but in himself. Now, God is not an object but his own subjectivity.\nAnd it is strange that these two persons, Gautam Buddha and Mahavira, are the only people in the whole world who have preached nonviolence. Non-violence is their word for love. They avoided the word ‘love’ because love has got into wrong company. You go to a prostitute and you say, “I love you.” Love has fallen into the gutter. That’s why they had to find something virgin, pure. But it means love: “nonviolence.”\nAnd at the same time I must remind you that the people who have believed in God in the sky have not been nonviolent. Mohammed is not nonviolent; neither is Moses, nor is Jesus.\nIn twenty centuries, Christians have killed so many people that it is impossible to count them. Mohammedans have been killing continuously for fourteen centuries, and the people who are Mohammedans are not those who are converted because of the truth; they are converted because they are cowards. Mohammedanism came to people with a sword in one hand and the HOLY KORAN in another: “You can choose. There is no need of any argument, the sword is the argument.” Those who had some guts died rather than choosing out of fear.\nLove cannot arise out of fear. The Christians have changed the tactics because the times have changed, but the story is the same: THE HOLY BIBLE in one hand and a loaf of bread in another: “You can choose.” Have you seen anybody being converted to Christianity because of its higher values, greater truth, deeper insights? Have you seen anybody who is rich, cultured, educated being converted to Christianity? No, it needs beggars, it needs orphans, because they need food. They are hungry. They are not hungry for truth; they are hungry for bread, they are hungry for a shelter, they are hungry for clothes. Is this conversion?\nThe Christian church of America got annoyed with me for the simple reason that the well-educated, talented, young generation was coming to me. And my hands are empty; there is neither a sword nor bread nor a HOLY KORAN nor a HOLY BIBLE.\nI can only give you my love, because I know it is going to come back.\nChristians became annoyed. They were not annoyed with Vivekananda because Vivekananda was being political. He was telling them, “It is all the same: Christianity, Hinduism, their teachings are all the same.” There was no problem with him. They were not afraid of Ramateertha.…\nWhy should they have been so annoyed with me? For almost one year, my sannyasins in Italy – which is the citadel of Catholic Christianity – have been trying to get just a three-week tourist visa for me, and the pope goes on interfering with the government. Just today I received the message that now it has become a burning question in Italy that the government does not say no. If they say no, then my sannyasins are going to the court. And they cannot say yes, because the pope, and the votes.…\nFinally, one political party of radical revolutionaries saw the whole game: For one year continuously! – you should answer, either yes or no. But you always go on saying “tomorrow” and tomorrow never comes. Now the radical revolutionary party has insisted to the prime minister of Italy that, “Either you give the visa or you deny it.”\nIf the pope can enter India, then who are you to prevent me? And when the pope came to India I welcomed him, and I condemned the people who were throwing stones at him and were protesting that he should go back. I condemned those people, the Hindu chauvinists. These are the signs of weakness. If the pope is coming, invite him, welcome him for a discussion. You have your shankaracharyas – have open-forum discussions all over the country. And if he is right, let this country be Christian, because the question is not whether Hindu or Christian, the question is to be always with the truth.\nI have been challenging the pope continually – I am ready to come to the Vatican, his own city, amongst his own people. I am ready to discuss not anything else but Catholic Christianity. And my condition is simple: if you can defeat me, I will become a Catholic Christian, but if you are defeated, then you have to become a sannyasin! And the Vatican has to become my headquarters.\nBut such impotent people... they will not say anything, and they will go on pressuring the prime minister: “Votes... if this man is allowed, then Catholic votes will not be given to you.” Now, the whole country is Catholic, and you will not find politicians who have any spine. These are spineless creatures.\nOne young man, Suraj Kalmadhi, from Poona, is now the opposition leader in the parliament. He has been sending messages to me saying, “You come back to India; I will fight for you in the parliament.” And I have come to Poona – now he should at least fight with the police commissioner. But spineless.…\nYes, there are a few people who are not to be categorized with these spineless ones: Balasaheb\nR. Borade from the City Youth Congress has written to me, saying that “We will fight for you.” And\ntoday, the Mayor of Poona, Ulhas Dhole Patil came, saying that “Whatever has happened is so ugly that I have come just to apologize. Forgive us; it should not have happened.” He has written a letter to me, saying, “You are welcome in the city of Poona and I want you to stay here forever.” And just now he came again and told my secretary, Neelam: “I am going to pass a resolution in the Poona Corporation that the Corporation should ask forgiveness, and ask that you please don’t leave Poona, but remain here.”\nThere are a few people still alive, it seems, in this city of the dead. Perhaps a few more dead people will start standing up, coming out of their graves, because I am not going to tolerate this police commissioner here. Either I am going to be here or he is going to be here! I don’t believe in compromising.\nI am a nonviolent person; I have never killed even an ant. But the day I found, in the early morning in the darkness of my room, shouting, forcing the door... I opened my eyes. Half asleep, I saw two ghostlike people. I wondered – since when have ghosts started wearing uniforms? I asked them, “Who are you? And on what authority have you entered my bedroom?”\nAnd those stupid guys had no answers. They just threw a paper over my face. I had no idea what it was; I tore it up and threw it away. That was the only moment in my life I have thought of having a revolver; those two ghosts must have gone out of my bedroom dead, not living.\nI would like to tell Ulhas Dhole Patil: If you really mean it – and I think you really mean what you say – then this police commissioner and those two idiots should be immediately transferred from here. They are becoming the cause of condemnation for the whole city, for the coming generations, forever.\nYou just look at what ideas he has suggested, and enforced. And these people Rajiv Gandhi is thinking to take into the twenty-first century! – in bullock carts, I hope. Instead of bullocks, these people will be good.\nHis conditions... and he has not even the guts to say, “These are my conditions.” He persuaded the office, the ashram in-charge, Svabhav, to sign saying that “These are our ideas,” that “we will abide by the following norms.” And you just look at the norms.\nAbout two norms, I talked this morning. But then I found it is a long list. You have to understand it, and you have to make the whole city understand it.\nFirst: only for two hours a discourse is allowed. Is this the freedom for which thousands of people died? Is this the freedom for which Bharat Singh was crucified? Is this the freedom for which, for one hundred years continuously, the country was struggling? And it goes against the constitution of India. A third-rate government servant violating the constitution of India – who is he to tell me that my discourse should be only for two hours? It will never be.\nBut his stupidity knows no limits.\nSecond: only five meditations, one hour each. In the country where meditation was born, in the country where there are one hundred twelve meditations, in the country where all the geniuses for\nalmost ten thousand years have done nothing but meditate... a police commissioner ordering us that we will abide, and we will do only five meditations, each meditation only for one hour. How much does he know about meditation? If he has any guts, he should come here and first let us decide how much he knows about meditation. I don’t think he can even give the names of one hundred twelve meditations; to know about meditation is a totally different thing.\nAnd the constitution gives us religious freedom. Why only for us? – if you are making it a law, then it should be for the whole country; for all the temples, for all the mosques, for all GURUDWARAS.\nThis is a temple of God. Nobody can say to us that we cannot meditate for more than one hour.\nToday he is saying.… I warn the people of Poona: this insane person should be removed immediately, because today he is imposing himself on a small, nonviolent group of people who have done no harm to anybody – “You should meditate only one hour.” My discourse should be only for two hours. Soon he will be imposing on you – “Your intercourse should be only for two hours.” What about intercourse? What about himself? What is the limit he has imposed upon himself? How long, three minutes?\nAnd Third: discourses will be open to police officers. Why? Discourses are for the disciples. This is not a police academy. And do you think your police officers will be able to understand the discourses? Only idiots enter into the service of police. And why should discourses be open to police officers? If they are interested, they should come here as disciples; they are open to all.\nBut we cannot allow specifically police officers – they can come here as human beings. Have they lost their humanity completely?\nAnd not only police officers – their men accompanying them... Who are these “men”? Shiv Sena people? Hindu chauvinists? Who are these “men” who are going to accompany police officers? Why can’t they come by themselves? Last time also – when the same person, Vilas Tupe, had thrown a dagger at me – they had asked for twenty police officers for my protection. It is strange... now things are more clear, looking retrospectively. It was the police who informed us, “Somebody is going to throw a dagger at Osho, so twenty police officers should be allowed in the discourse – for protection.”\nThe dagger was thrown and the twenty police officers were just standing there – they did nothing! It is absolutely clear: they were there to protect Vilas Tupe. Otherwise ten thousand sannyasins might have destroyed Vilas Tupe and not even fragments of his being would have been found anywhere. It was certainly a conspiracy of the police and Vilas Tupe.\nAnd then the police insisted that we need not worry: “It will be a police case.” And twenty police officers, eyewitnesses; ten thousand eyewitnesses, sannyasins... and the magistrate simply cancelled the case. It seems the conspiracy was deeper; even the magistrate was involved in it. It was such a clear case, so solid that even if we wanted to lose it, it would be impossible to lose it.\nBut the strategy was clear. They said, “You need not be worried, we are taking it into our hands. The police will take Vilas Tupe to court.” And the police did nothing there. The dagger was there, in the hands of the police, and they remained silent. Within five minutes Vilas Tupe was free.\nThe same man and the same group – and again the same number of policemen are asking to enter here. This is a simple, logical inference: the men accompanying him are nobody else but Vilas Tupe and his group. He should have also asked that at least one of them should be allowed to carry a dagger!\nFifth: the discourses will not be provocative. Then what is the purpose of the discourse? It has to provoke your sleeping souls, it has to provoke your potential. It has to be provocative; otherwise there is no purpose.\nThis is not a kindergarten school. This is a school of mysticism and the effort is to provoke in you a longing, a tremendous desire to see the truth.\nBut who is this man who is trying to destroy my freedom and your freedom?\nSixth: they should not be against any other religion. Hindus can be against Mohammedans; otherwise why don’t they go to the mosques for their prayers? Mohammedans can be against Hindus, Christians can be against others.\nI am against all religions, because I am a religious person and a religious person is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian nor Buddhist. I will speak against all religions because they are pseudo – they are not true religions. And if he has any intelligence to prove otherwise, he’s welcome. If he can prove that the organized religions are true religions... but destroying the freedom of people to be religious is against all human values.\nI will speak against all religions. I have to, because I stand for religiousness, not for religions.\nSeventh: the number of foreigners residing in the ashram will not be more than one hundred. We don’t believe in countries and we don’t believe in nations. For us, nobody is a foreigner.\nWe are children of the same universe, of the same earth – who is a foreigner? And what right has he got? Where in the constitution is the right given to police commissioners to restrict the number of foreigners listening to a master? From where did he get this number one hundred? – why not ten thousand? How has he decided for one hundred? It is arbitrary.\nAnd as far as I am concerned and my people are concerned, here nobody is a foreigner. The moment you enter this house of God, you are simply human beings.\nAnd I am not going to change because of these stupid, ordinary public servants who know nothing of religion, who know nothing of humanity, and still.He has some nerve. But I am going to put him\nright. He has got into trouble unnecessarily. Whoever gets into trouble with me will repent for his whole life.\nAnd their names will be informed to the police. Here, everybody’s name is a sannyas name. They are all rooted in the Sanskrit language. How are you going to find that this name is a foreigner’s? I have my own ways.…\nNine: the number of foreigners daily visiting the ashram for discourses will not exceed one thousand. This man seems to besomething is either loose in his head or something is too tight. But he need\nnot be worried; we have in our ashram all kinds of mind-mechanics. He can come – either we will loosen his mind or tighten his mind.\nJust one problem about which I am afraid, apprehensive: if there is no mind inside? – then it is going to be trouble. But we will find some solution.\nHe does not understand. This is a democracy; this is a free, sovereign country. And if the government allows people from all over the world to enter the country... he seems to be superior to the government.\nWe are not going to abide by any nonsense, and if this man is not removed, he will have to face me in court. And in court, I am not going to have an advocate; I myself am going to face it.\nTenth: no number of the ashram or visitors is allowed to carry firearms. What about the twenty police officers? They will have to leave their firearms outside, according to his own dictates. He seems to be having nightmares – nobody has any firearms here. He wants twenty police officers to bring firearms.\nMy attorney, Tathagat, had told him: “Usually there were seven thousand to ten thousand people from all over the world. You cannot cut the number to one thousand.”\nAnd he said, “We don’t have enough people to control ten thousand people.” This is said by a commissioner! He can control the whole district and he has enough people for the whole commissionery but just for a six-acre area of land, he does not have enough people to control. And who is asking him to control?\nWe have been here from 1974 and there was never a need to control our people. There has been no fight in the ashram. He does not even understand that the people who have come here have not come here to fight. They have come here to be more loving, to be more honest, to be more sincere, to be more truthful – they are seekers. There is no need of any control. Nobody controls here.\nSo he should remember: whoever comes to the doors of this temple – as a seeker, not as a police officer – whether his skin is white or black, whether his nose is long or short, he’s welcome. And if he has any problem with that, either he can come here... or if he raises such nonsense questions again, I am dragging him into court. And he should not think that in the Poona court the magistrates can be manipulated in the same way they have been before. Because it was a police case, we did not interfere. Now it will be a direct fight with me – and the case is not going to end in Poona, it will go up to the Supreme Court in Delhi. If justice is not done, then I am going to the people all over the country. This government is nothing but servants of the people.\nThen I am going to ask the people of the country to throw out all these idiots. It is better that he pack his suitcases. And he has those two donkeys – put the suitcases on those two donkeys and escape! The sooner you do it, the better it will be.\nEleventh: members of the ashram are prohibited from indulging in any obscene behavior in the ashram or outside the ashram. Does he know what the word “obscene” means? The temples of Khajuraho should be demolished by the order of the commissioner of Poona because they are\nobscene. The temples of Puri should be demolished, the temples of Konark should be demolished. The beautiful caves of Ajanta and Ellora should be demolished.\nThese are the things which attract the whole world – and if they are not obscene, then he will have to show, in front of my people, what obscenity is.\nYou have naked Jaina monks and that is not obscene. You have naked Hindu monks and that is not obscene. And all over the country, you have shivalingas. Shivalinga represents the penis of Shiva and the vagina of Parvati, and they are all over the country – everywhere, in every city, under any tree. They are not obscene.\nI would love to know: Is this police commissioner born not of a woman? Wasn’t his father obscene? Wasn’t his mother obscene? And while his father was doing all kinds of obscenities to his mother, if my sannyasins had entered the room to give him an invitation... “You are invited for a discourse”\nHe is saying “inside the ashram or outside the ashram.” The whole of India is obscene. Their scriptures are obscene. He should go to some library and just look into shivapuran and he will find out what obscenity is. And Shiva is one of the gods of the Hindus.\nThese people are going to teach me? There is nothing obscene in the world. Everything is natural – it is your interpretation. Yes, I can understand if he had said, “They should not be indulging in any behavior which is obscene outside the ashram.” I have no concern outside the ashram. It is their individual responsibility what they are doing or not doing.\nAnd it is for the police commissioner and his police to go to the court and get a clear-cut definition of obscenity. Up to now, all over the world, no court has been able to decide what is obscene and what is not. But I think you have got a police commissioner who knows what is obscene. We would love to see him just give us a little show of his obscenity, so that we can also understand that this is obscene behavior and we are not to do it outside the ashram.\nTwelve: the police officers will have the right to visit the ashram during any time of day or night. their lawful directions will be complied with, without any hesitation.\nAre my sannyasins also allowed to enter your houses during any time of day or night? No sane person could ask that police officers be allowed in the night. For what? We don’t need them even in the day! Their faces, their uniforms, their retarded minds – for what do we need them? No. This is a temple of God, and you will have to act according to our directions. You cannot order us unless we indulge in any crime. If we are murdering people, of course it is lawful for you to ask for permission to enter the premises.\nYou have seen what has happened in the gurudwara of Amritsar. For three hundred years, the British people were more intelligent; they never entered the temple of the Sikhs. A temple should be respected.\nIt is our temple. Do you want to create another Amritsar? Then certainly we will need ten thousand licenses for machine guns. Of course they will be lawful. But if the police behave in such a way, then I am not a Gandhian. I do not believe in violence; but I also do not believe in anybody else doing violence to my people.\nWe are nonviolent people. We don’t need any police. And there is no need for them to enter the premises of the ashram without permission, behaving in the same way they would behave in their own temples. They can come to the gate. That is the limit. Beyond that, it belongs to God – not to the commissionery of the police commissioner.\nLOVE POSSESSES NOT...\nAnd we believe in love, we don’t believe in machine guns. But if you force us, you will find yourself destroying your constitution, your democracy, your prestige in the whole world.\nNOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;\nFOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT UNTO LOVE.\nWHEN YOU LOVE YOU SHOULD NOT SAY, “GOD IS IN MY HEART...” because that can become your ego. Hence, Almustafa says: BUT RATHER, “I AM IN THE HEART OF GOD.”\nHe has improved upon the first statement but the second statement, although better, can still be improved. My suggestion is that you should say, “Love is and I am not.”\nAND THINK NOT YOU CAN DIRECT THE COURSE OF LOVE, FOR LOVE, IF IT FINDS YOU WORTHY, DIRECTS YOUR COURSE.\nRelax and trust into love. And allow love to take you. Just as every river goes to the ocean, every small stream of love arising from your heart goes to the universal, to the ultimate, to God.\nLOVE HAS NO OTHER DESIRE BUT TO FULFILL ITSELF.\nBUT IF YOU LOVE AND MUST NEEDS HAVE DESIRES, LET THESE BE YOUR DESIRES...\nBut if you are not strong enough to surrender totally to love, and you have other desires too, then Almustafa says, at least have these desires:\nTO MELT AND BE LIKE A RUNNING BROOK THAT SINGS ITS MELODY TO THE NIGHT. TO KNOW THE PAIN OF TOO MUCH TENDERNESS.\nTO BE WOUNDED BY YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF LOVE:\nAND TO BLEED WILLINGLY AND JOYFULLY.\nTO WAKE AT DAWN WITH A WINGED HEART AND GIVE THANKS FOR ANOTHER DAY OF LOVING;\nTO REST AT THE NOON HOUR AND MEDITATE LOVE’S ECSTASY; TO RETURN HOME AT EVENTIDE WITH GRATITUDE;\nIf you cannot let go totally, then slowly slowly, step by step, move towards gratitude.\nAND THEN TO SLEEP WITH A PRAYER FOR THE BELOVED IN YOUR HEART AND A SONG OF PRAISE UPON YOUR LIPS.\nAnd don’t be bothered by any police commissioners! Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6920","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/>The Messiah, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Love possesses not</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6920 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Messiah_Vol_1/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

shown. These are not the words of a philosopher, these are the
experiences of a mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is just a name. It is Kahlil Gibran who is speaking through
him – and for a special reason. He could have spoken directly in his own
name; there was no need for Almustafa to be a medium. But Kahlil Gibran
does not want to create a religion, although whatever he has said is the
fundamental religiousness. To avoid it... because in the name of
religion so much inhumanity to human beings has been done, so much
bloodshed.…</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people have been killed. Thousands have been burned
alive. The moment any religion becomes organized and crystallized it
becomes a danger to all that is valuable in life. Then it is no longer
the path to God, it becomes an excuse for war.</p><p><br></p><p>Kahlil Gibran keeps himself hiding behind Almustafa so people don’t
start worshipping him, so people don’t continue the ugly past. Rather
than saying directly what he wants to say, he has created a device:
Almustafa. Because of Almustafa, his book is not counted as a holy book
– although it is one of the most holy books in the world. Compared to
it, all other holy books will appear unholy.</p><p><br></p><p>He created Almustafa so that his book would be taken as fiction, as
poetry. This is his compassion, and this is his greatness. You can look
in all the holy scriptures; you will not find words so alive that they
go directly like arrows into your heart. And you will find much that is
inhuman, unworthy of remaining in those holy scriptures. But man is so
blind – just the small fiction of Almustafa, and people have forgotten a
simple fact: that these truths cannot be asserted unless you have
experienced them, unless they are your own.</p><p><br></p><p>Kahlil Gibran has prepared the ground for me. He has sown the seeds
in unknown fields, in “unremembered seasons.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am here in the right time for the harvest.</p><p><br></p><p>You are my harvest. You are the fruits and the flowers. Talking on
Kahlil Gibran is just to remind you about your seeds. And also,
something more important.…</p><p><br></p><p>There is an ancient story in the land of Kahlil Gibran – one of the
most beautiful lands on the earth, Lebanon. It is famous only for two
things – Kahlil Gibran and thousands-of-years-old cedar trees which are
still trying to reach towards the stars.</p><p>Kahlil Gibran was also doing that. The cedars of Lebanon have not
succeeded yet, but Kahlil Gibran has succeeded. Perhaps one day those
cedars will also reach to the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most important Dutch painters, Vincent van Gogh – perhaps
the most important as far as insight, understanding is concerned – in
all his paintings, his trees always go beyond the stars; the stars are
left behind. He was thought mad by his contemporaries. He was asked
again and again: “Where have you seen trees growing above the faraway
stars?”</p><p><br></p><p>Vincent van Gogh said, “I have not seen them, but sitting by the side
of the trees, I have heard their longings. And I paint the flower even
before the seed has been sown.”</p><p><br></p><p>All his stars are strange: he has painted them as spirals. Even the
painters laughed at him – “You must be insane. Stars are not spirals.”
He said, “What can I do? Not only in my dreams but even in my
wakefulness, my heart always feels that they are spirals.” He could not
sell a single painting in his whole life – who will purchase such
paintings? And he painted them with his blood, with his very life.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to get from his younger brother just enough money every week
so that he could eat two meals a day for seven days. He used to fast
three days in the week so he could purchase paints, canvasses. No other
painter has painted with such longing, with such deep love.</p><p><br></p><p>He lived just to paint; he died when he was thirty-three. And just a
few months ago, physicists have come to the conclusion that stars are
spirals – one hundred years afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>The poet has certainly some unknown shortcut to knowing things. He
cannot prove it. He is not a scientist, he is not a logician. But the
contemporaries are thousands of years behind. It is very rare to find an
individual who is authentically contemporary. Rajiv Gandhi, the prime
minister of India, won the election on a single slogan: “I want India to
enter the twenty-first century.” And not a single man in this vast
country of nine hundred million people asked him whether the country has
yet reached the twentieth century! People are living in
thousands-of-years-old superstitions, in ideologies which have no
relevance to truth. And they are not willing to come out of their
darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like my people to be not only of this century or of the
twenty-first century; I would like my people to be the people of the
whole future. When you can be masters of the whole future, why
unnecessarily remain beggars?</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to these words, because these are not words, these are living
flames. It is pure fire. If it cannot consume you, you have not heard
it:</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF...</p><p><br></p><p>Such a tremendous statement, which will always remain fresh. I cannot
conceive of any time in the future when this statement will become out
of date. If you can understand it, if you can live it, the whole future
also becomes yours. It can open the doors of the unknown reality that
awaits you.</p><p><br></p><p>Love gives naught but itself... You also give when you are in love –
flowers, ice cream, bhelpuri. But this is not love, this is bargaining,
business.</p><p>In a small school, the teacher had been insisting on the greatness of
Jesus for almost one hour to the students. The school belonged to a
church; it was an international school.</p><p><br></p><p>After one hour, she asked, “Can anyone say who is the greatest man in
history?” A little boy, an American, said, “Abraham Lincoln.”</p><p>The teacher could not believe it. For one hour she had been hammering
into their heads that Jesus Christ is the highest peak human
consciousness has ever achieved, and this idiot says “Abraham
Lincoln”!</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “You are not wrong, but not right either. Sit down.”</p><p><br></p><p>Another girl stood up to answer the same question and she said,
“Winston Churchill.”</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher said, “My god!” But because the school was in England and
Winston Churchill was the prime minister, she could not say, “You are
not right.” She said, “You are very close to the truth.”</p><p><br></p><p>And then a very small boy started waving his hand – and this was
strange, because this boy had never done such a thing. He was a very
silent individual.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher said, “What is your answer?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “There is no question; everybody knows Jesus Christ is the
greatest man in the world.”</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher was shocked even more, because the boy was a Jew. But
there was a seal waiting – whoever gives the right answer is going to
win the seal. The little boy, carrying the big seal, was followed by the
teacher and caught outside the school. The teacher said, “Listen, are
you not a Jew?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Of course I am. What is the problem? Why are you following
me?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Being a Jew... and you declare Jesus Christ to be the
greatest man in the world?”</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed. He said, “Ah, yes. In the deepest core of my heart, I
know that Moses is the greatest man in the world. But business is
business.”</p><p><br></p><p>Love is not business, but man has reduced love into business.</p><p><br></p><p>Love gives only itself because there is nothing higher to give. Can
you think of anything greater? anything more valuable?</p><p><br></p><p>Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself – that
is even more significant to understand. Love knows only giving; even the
idea of getting something in return does not arise. But this is the
miracle of existence: if you give love, love returns a thousandfold back
to you, your own love.</p><p>There is no need to be a beggar. Love makes you an emperor. It gives
itself, and strangely enough finds that the same love has become a
thousandfold and has returned from all directions. The more you give it
the more you have it.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity looks so poor because we have forgotten the cosmic law.
Instead of giving, love has become a beggar, it is continuously asking.
The wife is asking, “Give me love, I am your wife.” The husband is
saying, “Give me love.” Everyone is asking “Give me love.” Who is going
to give? – all are beggars.</p><p><br></p><p>You should come near an emperor like me, who gives and goes on
giving, because it is an inexhaustible source.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more I have loved people, the more I was surprised: my love
has increased and I can give more.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story:</p><p><br></p><p>A man’s dog died. He had been very loving towards the dog, and the
dog was rare – a beautiful piece of art. It was not just an ordinary
dog; generations of crossbreeding had created it. The man was very sad.
He went to the same pet shop where he had purchased the first dog, and
said that he wanted something better; otherwise he would not be able to
forget his old dog.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner said, “Don’t be worried. I have a very rare dog – and very
cheap.” He showed him the dog and certainly, the man had never seen such
a beautiful dog with such a philosophical face, with such loving eyes,
with such a beautiful body.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am ready to pay anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the owner said, “He’s not very costly, he’s the cheapest dog I
have. There are more costly dogs if you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man went around and he was surprised: those costly dogs were
nothing compared to that cheap dog. He asked the owner: “I’m puzzled and
confused. Why are you selling that dog so cheap?”</p><p><br></p><p>The owner said, “You don’t understand. First purchase it, and then
you will understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he purchased the dog – at such a cheap price! You could not even
get a vagabond dog from the street at that price.</p><p><br></p><p>Puzzled, he went home. In the morning he looked and the dog had
disappeared. He said, “My god, where has the dog gone? The house was
locked and I am alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>He rushed back to the shop and the dog was there, sitting in his
place. The owner said, “Have you understood why he is the cheapest dog?
He always comes back. He has been sold a thousand times but he is so
obedient.<span class=s4></span>You can have him,” he said, “but what
is the point?”</p><p>When I read the story I could remember only one thing in my
experience... because I don’t have a dog, although dogs come once in
awhile. But I know about love. It is not only cheap, it has no price at
all. To be loving costs nothing, and yet it always comes back a
thousandfold. You go on becoming richer and richer. It is a strange
economics of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF. LOVE
POSSESSES NOT NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED.</p><p>The moment you possess anything, you have killed it. And millions are
the people in the world who have killed their love with their own hands.
They should look at their hands – they are covered with the blood of
their own love. And now they are miserable; they never wanted to kill,
there was no intention to kill, but in their unconsciousness they
started possessing. If they loved someone, they wanted to possess that
person totally. Husbands are possessing their wives, wives are posessing
their husands, parents are possessing their children. Teachers are
trying in every possible way to possess their students. Politicians are
trying to possess countries. Religions are trying to possess millions of
people and their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>They are all murderers, because the moment you try to possess, you
have killed. Life thrives only in freedom.</p><p>If you love, you will give more and more freedom to your beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>And love never allows anyone to possess it – because love is your
very soul. If you allow somebody to possess it, you have committed
suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>So either love is murdered or commits suicide. People are simply
walking corpses with begging bowls, searching for love, for warmth, for
tenderness. And they are not going to find it because they have created
a stupid society, they have created a mad world.</p><p><br></p><p>The basis of everybody going neurotic or psychotic is simple: their
souls are not nourished. Love is the very nourishment. You can have all
the wealth of the world; if you don’t have love, you are the poorest man
– unnecessarily burdened with wealth, palaces, empires.</p><p><br></p><p>But one who loves, one who has known the secret of love – not to
possess and not to be possessed – is really born again. He has become,
in the true sense, alive. He will have all the beautiful experiences of
life, all the great ecstasies of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>If love grows in your heart, you are pregnant with God. It is God
growing within you. Slowly, slowly you will disappear and there will
only be pure godliness. It is felt.…</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have been close to Gautam Buddha or Mahavira have felt it.
It is a strange story that neither Mahavira believes in God nor Buddha
believes in God. People think that they are atheists, but no, absolutely
no. They don’t believe in God because they themselves are God.</p><p><br></p><p>You believe in God because your God is somewhere high beyond the sky;
you are just a creature, creeping on the earth. Why should a Buddha
believe in God? He’s within him, he himself has</p><p>become the temple of God. So although they denied the existence of
God, the reason for the denial was not the same as the reason of an
atheist.</p><p><br></p><p>The atheist denies God because God cannot be proved logically. The
atheist should deny love too, because love also cannot be proved
logically.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known many atheists and I have asked them only one question:
“Have you ever fallen in love?”</p><p><br></p><p>And they were surprised. They said, “Why are you changing the
subject? We were talking about God.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not changing the subject, I am coming to the subject.
Have you ever fallen in love?” They said, “Yes, we have loved.”</p><p>“Then,” I said, “think once again. Can you prove scientifically,
rationally, logically, that love exists?” They said, “We cannot.”</p><p>“Then,” I said, “stop denying God, because for the same reasons, you
have been denying God.”</p><p><br></p><p>Only a man like Gautam Buddha has the right to deny God, because he
has found him. And he has found him not somewhere else, but in himself.
Now, God is not an object but his own subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is strange that these two persons, Gautam Buddha and Mahavira,
are the only people in the whole world who have preached nonviolence.
Non-violence is their word for love. They avoided the word ‘love’
because love has got into wrong company. You go to a prostitute and you
say, “I love you.” Love has fallen into the gutter. That’s why they had
to find something virgin, pure. But it means love: “nonviolence.”</p><p><br></p><p>And at the same time I must remind you that the people who have
believed in God in the sky have not been nonviolent. Mohammed is not
nonviolent; neither is Moses, nor is Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>In twenty centuries, Christians have killed so many people that it is
impossible to count them. Mohammedans have been killing continuously for
fourteen centuries, and the people who are Mohammedans are not those who
are converted because of the truth; they are converted because they are
cowards. Mohammedanism came to people with a sword in one hand and the
HOLY KORAN in another: “You can choose. There is no need of any
argument, the sword is the argument.” Those who had some guts died
rather than choosing out of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Love cannot arise out of fear. The Christians have changed the
tactics because the times have changed, but the story is the same: THE
HOLY BIBLE in one hand and a loaf of bread in another: “You can choose.”
Have you seen anybody being converted to Christianity because of its
higher values, greater truth, deeper insights? Have you seen anybody who
is rich, cultured, educated being converted to Christianity? No, it
needs beggars, it needs orphans, because they need food. They are
hungry. They are not hungry for truth; they are hungry for bread, they
are hungry for a shelter, they are hungry for clothes. Is this
conversion?</p><p>The Christian church of America got annoyed with me for the simple
reason that the well-educated, talented, young generation was coming to
me. And my hands are empty; there is neither a sword nor bread nor a
HOLY KORAN nor a HOLY BIBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>I can only give you my love, because I know it is going to come
back.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians became annoyed. They were not annoyed with Vivekananda
because Vivekananda was being political. He was telling them, “It is all
the same: Christianity, Hinduism, their teachings are all the same.”
There was no problem with him. They were not afraid of Ramateertha.…</p><p><br></p><p>Why should they have been so annoyed with me? For almost one year, my
sannyasins in Italy – which is the citadel of Catholic Christianity –
have been trying to get just a three-week tourist visa for me, and the
pope goes on interfering with the government. Just today I received the
message that now it has become a burning question in Italy that the
government does not say no. If they say no, then my sannyasins are going
to the court. And they cannot say yes, because the pope, and the
votes.…</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, one political party of radical revolutionaries saw the whole
game: For one year continuously! – you should answer, either yes or no.
But you always go on saying “tomorrow” and tomorrow never comes. Now the
radical revolutionary party has insisted to the prime minister of Italy
that, “Either you give the visa or you deny it.”</p><p><br></p><p>If the pope can enter India, then who are you to prevent me? And when
the pope came to India I welcomed him, and I condemned the people who
were throwing stones at him and were protesting that he should go back.
I condemned those people, the Hindu chauvinists. These are the signs of
weakness. If the pope is coming, invite him, welcome him for a
discussion. You have your shankaracharyas – have open-forum discussions
all over the country. And if he is right, let this country be Christian,
because the question is not whether Hindu or Christian, the question is
to be always with the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been challenging the pope continually – I am ready to come to
the Vatican, his own city, amongst his own people. I am ready to discuss
not anything else but Catholic Christianity. And my condition is simple:
if you can defeat me, I will become a Catholic Christian, but if you are
defeated, then you have to become a sannyasin! And the Vatican has to
become my headquarters.</p><p><br></p><p>But such impotent people... they will not say anything, and they will
go on pressuring the prime minister: “Votes... if this man is allowed,
then Catholic votes will not be given to you.” Now, the whole country is
Catholic, and you will not find politicians who have any spine. These
are spineless creatures.</p><p><br></p><p>One young man, Suraj Kalmadhi, from Poona, is now the opposition
leader in the parliament. He has been sending messages to me saying,
“You come back to India; I will fight for you in the parliament.” And I
have come to Poona – now he should at least fight with the police
commissioner. But spineless.…</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there are a few people who are not to be categorized with these
spineless ones: Balasaheb</p><p>R. Borade from the City Youth Congress has written to me, saying that
“We will fight for you.” And</p><p>today, the Mayor of Poona, Ulhas Dhole Patil came, saying that
“Whatever has happened is so ugly that I have come just to apologize.
Forgive us; it should not have happened.” He has written a letter to me,
saying, “You are welcome in the city of Poona and I want you to stay
here forever.” And just now he came again and told my secretary, Neelam:
“I am going to pass a resolution in the Poona Corporation that the
Corporation should ask forgiveness, and ask that you please don’t leave
Poona, but remain here.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few people still alive, it seems, in this city of the
dead. Perhaps a few more dead people will start standing up, coming out
of their graves, because I am not going to tolerate this police
commissioner here. Either I am going to be here or he is going to be
here! I don’t believe in compromising.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a nonviolent person; I have never killed even an ant. But the
day I found, in the early morning in the darkness of my room, shouting,
forcing the door... I opened my eyes. Half asleep, I saw two ghostlike
people. I wondered – since when have ghosts started wearing uniforms? I
asked them, “Who are you? And on what authority have you entered my
bedroom?”</p><p><br></p><p>And those stupid guys had no answers. They just threw a paper over my
face. I had no idea what it was; I tore it up and threw it away. That
was the only moment in my life I have thought of having a revolver;
those two ghosts must have gone out of my bedroom dead, not living.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell Ulhas Dhole Patil: If you really mean it – and I
think you really mean what you say – then this police commissioner and
those two idiots should be immediately transferred from here. They are
becoming the cause of condemnation for the whole city, for the coming
generations, forever.</p><p><br></p><p>You just look at what ideas he has suggested, and enforced. And these
people Rajiv Gandhi is thinking to take into the twenty-first century! –
in bullock carts, I hope. Instead of bullocks, these people will be
good.</p><p><br></p><p>His conditions... and he has not even the guts to say, “These are my
conditions.” He persuaded the office, the ashram in-charge, Svabhav, to
sign saying that “These are our ideas,” that “we will abide by the
following norms.” And you just look at the norms.</p><p><br></p><p>About two norms, I talked this morning. But then I found it is a long
list. You have to understand it, and you have to make the whole city
understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>First: only for two hours a discourse is allowed. Is this the freedom
for which thousands of people died? Is this the freedom for which Bharat
Singh was crucified? Is this the freedom for which, for one hundred
years continuously, the country was struggling? And it goes against the
constitution of India. A third-rate government servant violating the
constitution of India – who is he to tell me that my discourse should be
only for two hours? It will never be.</p><p><br></p><p>But his stupidity knows no limits.</p><p><br></p><p>Second: only five meditations, one hour each. In the country where
meditation was born, in the country where there are one hundred twelve
meditations, in the country where all the geniuses for</p><p>almost ten thousand years have done nothing but meditate... a police
commissioner ordering us that we will abide, and we will do only five
meditations, each meditation only for one hour. How much does he know
about meditation? If he has any guts, he should come here and first let
us decide how much he knows about meditation. I don’t think he can even
give the names of one hundred twelve meditations; to know about
meditation is a totally different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And the constitution gives us religious freedom. Why only for us? –
if you are making it a law, then it should be for the whole country; for
all the temples, for all the mosques, for all GURUDWARAS.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a temple of God. Nobody can say to us that we cannot meditate
for more than one hour.</p><p><br></p><p>Today he is saying.… I warn the people of Poona: this insane person
should be removed immediately, because today he is imposing himself on a
small, nonviolent group of people who have done no harm to anybody –
“You should meditate only one hour.” My discourse should be only for two
hours. Soon he will be imposing on you – “Your intercourse should be
only for two hours.” What about intercourse? What about himself? What is
the limit he has imposed upon himself? How long, three minutes?</p><p><br></p><p>And Third: discourses will be open to police officers. Why?
Discourses are for the disciples. This is not a police academy. And do
you think your police officers will be able to understand the
discourses? Only idiots enter into the service of police. And why should
discourses be open to police officers? If they are interested, they
should come here as disciples; they are open to all.</p><p><br></p><p>But we cannot allow specifically police officers – they can come here
as human beings. Have they lost their humanity completely?</p><p><br></p><p>And not only police officers – their men accompanying them... Who are
these “men”? Shiv Sena people? Hindu chauvinists? Who are these “men”
who are going to accompany police officers? Why can’t they come by
themselves? Last time also – when the same person, Vilas Tupe, had
thrown a dagger at me – they had asked for twenty police officers for my
protection. It is strange... now things are more clear, looking
retrospectively. It was the police who informed us, “Somebody is going
to throw a dagger at Osho, so twenty police officers should be allowed
in the discourse – for protection.”</p><p><br></p><p>The dagger was thrown and the twenty police officers were just
standing there – they did nothing! It is absolutely clear: they were
there to protect Vilas Tupe. Otherwise ten thousand sannyasins might
have destroyed Vilas Tupe and not even fragments of his being would have
been found anywhere. It was certainly a conspiracy of the police and
Vilas Tupe.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the police insisted that we need not worry: “It will be a
police case.” And twenty police officers, eyewitnesses; ten thousand
eyewitnesses, sannyasins... and the magistrate simply cancelled the
case. It seems the conspiracy was deeper; even the magistrate was
involved in it. It was such a clear case, so solid that even if we
wanted to lose it, it would be impossible to lose it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the strategy was clear. They said, “You need not be worried, we
are taking it into our hands. The police will take Vilas Tupe to court.”
And the police did nothing there. The dagger was there, in the hands of
the police, and they remained silent. Within five minutes Vilas Tupe was
free.</p><p>The same man and the same group – and again the same number of
policemen are asking to enter here. This is a simple, logical inference:
the men accompanying him are nobody else but Vilas Tupe and his group.
He should have also asked that at least one of them should be allowed to
carry a dagger!</p><p><br></p><p>Fifth: the discourses will not be provocative. Then what is the
purpose of the discourse? It has to provoke your sleeping souls, it has
to provoke your potential. It has to be provocative; otherwise there is
no purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not a kindergarten school. This is a school of mysticism and
the effort is to provoke in you a longing, a tremendous desire to see
the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But who is this man who is trying to destroy my freedom and your
freedom?</p><p><br></p><p>Sixth: they should not be against any other religion. Hindus can be
against Mohammedans; otherwise why don’t they go to the mosques for
their prayers? Mohammedans can be against Hindus, Christians can be
against others.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against all religions, because I am a religious person and a
religious person is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian nor
Buddhist. I will speak against all religions because they are pseudo –
they are not true religions. And if he has any intelligence to prove
otherwise, he’s welcome. If he can prove that the organized religions
are true religions... but destroying the freedom of people to be
religious is against all human values.</p><p><br></p><p>I will speak against all religions. I have to, because I stand for
religiousness, not for religions.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventh: the number of foreigners residing in the ashram will not be
more than one hundred. We don’t believe in countries and we don’t
believe in nations. For us, nobody is a foreigner.</p><p><br></p><p>We are children of the same universe, of the same earth – who is a
foreigner? And what right has he got? Where in the constitution is the
right given to police commissioners to restrict the number of foreigners
listening to a master? From where did he get this number one hundred? –
why not ten thousand? How has he decided for one hundred? It is
arbitrary.</p><p><br></p><p>And as far as I am concerned and my people are concerned, here nobody
is a foreigner. The moment you enter this house of God, you are simply
human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not going to change because of these stupid, ordinary public
servants who know nothing of religion, who know nothing of humanity, and
still.<span class=s4></span>He has some nerve. But I am going to put
him</p><p>right. He has got into trouble unnecessarily. Whoever gets into
trouble with me will repent for his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>And their names will be informed to the police. Here, everybody’s
name is a sannyas name. They are all rooted in the Sanskrit language.
How are you going to find that this name is a foreigner’s? I have my own
ways.…</p><p><br></p><p>Nine: the number of foreigners daily visiting the ashram for
discourses will not exceed one thousand. This man seems to be<span class=s4></span>something is either loose in his head or something is
too tight. But he need</p><p>not be worried; we have in our ashram all kinds of mind-mechanics. He
can come – either we will loosen his mind or tighten his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one problem about which I am afraid, apprehensive: if there is
no mind inside? – then it is going to be trouble. But we will find some
solution.</p><p><br></p><p>He does not understand. This is a democracy; this is a free,
sovereign country. And if the government allows people from all over the
world to enter the country... he seems to be superior to the
government.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not going to abide by any nonsense, and if this man is not
removed, he will have to face me in court. And in court, I am not going
to have an advocate; I myself am going to face it.</p><p><br></p><p>Tenth: no number of the ashram or visitors is allowed to carry
firearms. What about the twenty police officers? They will have to leave
their firearms outside, according to his own dictates. He seems to be
having nightmares – nobody has any firearms here. He wants twenty police
officers to bring firearms.</p><p><br></p><p>My attorney, Tathagat, had told him: “Usually there were seven
thousand to ten thousand people from all over the world. You cannot cut
the number to one thousand.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “We don’t have enough people to control ten thousand
people.” This is said by a commissioner! He can control the whole
district and he has enough people for the whole commissionery but just
for a six-acre area of land, he does not have enough people to control.
And who is asking him to control?</p><p><br></p><p>We have been here from 1974 and there was never a need to control our
people. There has been no fight in the ashram. He does not even
understand that the people who have come here have not come here to
fight. They have come here to be more loving, to be more honest, to be
more sincere, to be more truthful – they are seekers. There is no need
of any control. Nobody controls here.</p><p><br></p><p>So he should remember: whoever comes to the doors of this temple – as
a seeker, not as a police officer – whether his skin is white or black,
whether his nose is long or short, he’s welcome. And if he has any
problem with that, either he can come here... or if he raises such
nonsense questions again, I am dragging him into court. And he should
not think that in the Poona court the magistrates can be manipulated in
the same way they have been before. Because it was a police case, we did
not interfere. Now it will be a direct fight with me – and the case is
not going to end in Poona, it will go up to the Supreme Court in Delhi.
If justice is not done, then I am going to the people all over the
country. This government is nothing but servants of the people.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I am going to ask the people of the country to throw out all
these idiots. It is better that he pack his suitcases. And he has those
two donkeys – put the suitcases on those two donkeys and escape! The
sooner you do it, the better it will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Eleventh: members of the ashram are prohibited from indulging in any
obscene behavior in the ashram or outside the ashram. Does he know what
the word “obscene” means? The temples of Khajuraho should be demolished
by the order of the commissioner of Poona because they are</p><p>obscene. The temples of Puri should be demolished, the temples of
Konark should be demolished. The beautiful caves of Ajanta and Ellora
should be demolished.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the things which attract the whole world – and if they are
not obscene, then he will have to show, in front of my people, what
obscenity is.</p><p><br></p><p>You have naked Jaina monks and that is not obscene. You have naked
Hindu monks and that is not obscene. And all over the country, you have
shivalingas. Shivalinga represents the penis of Shiva and the vagina of
Parvati, and they are all over the country – everywhere, in every city,
under any tree. They are not obscene.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to know: Is this police commissioner born not of a
woman? Wasn’t his father obscene? Wasn’t his mother obscene? And while
his father was doing all kinds of obscenities to his mother, if my
sannyasins had entered the room to give him an invitation... “You are
invited for a discourse<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying “inside the ashram or outside the ashram.” The whole of
India is obscene. Their scriptures are obscene. He should go to some
library and just look into shivapuran and he will find out what
obscenity is. And Shiva is one of the gods of the Hindus.</p><p><br></p><p>These people are going to teach me? There is nothing obscene in the
world. Everything is natural – it is your interpretation. Yes, I can
understand if he had said, “They should not be indulging in any behavior
which is obscene outside the ashram.” I have no concern outside the
ashram. It is their individual responsibility what they are doing or not
doing.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is for the police commissioner and his police to go to the
court and get a clear-cut definition of obscenity. Up to now, all over
the world, no court has been able to decide what is obscene and what is
not. But I think you have got a police commissioner who knows what is
obscene. We would love to see him just give us a little show of his
obscenity, so that we can also understand that this is obscene behavior
and we are not to do it outside the ashram.</p><p><br></p><p>Twelve: the police officers will have the right to visit the ashram
during any time of day or night. their lawful directions will be
complied with, without any hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Are my sannyasins also allowed to enter your houses during any time
of day or night? No sane person could ask that police officers be
allowed in the night. For what? We don’t need them even in the day!
Their faces, their uniforms, their retarded minds – for what do we need
them? No. This is a temple of God, and you will have to act according to
our directions. You cannot order us unless we indulge in any crime. If
we are murdering people, of course it is lawful for you to ask for
permission to enter the premises.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen what has happened in the gurudwara of Amritsar. For
three hundred years, the British people were more intelligent; they
never entered the temple of the Sikhs. A temple should be respected.</p><p><br></p><p>It is our temple. Do you want to create another Amritsar? Then
certainly we will need ten thousand licenses for machine guns. Of course
they will be lawful. But if the police behave in such a way, then I am
not a Gandhian. I do not believe in violence; but I also do not believe
in anybody else doing violence to my people.</p><p>We are nonviolent people. We don’t need any police. And there is no
need for them to enter the premises of the ashram without permission,
behaving in the same way they would behave in their own temples. They
can come to the gate. That is the limit. Beyond that, it belongs to God
– not to the commissionery of the police commissioner.</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE POSSESSES NOT...</p><p><br></p><p>And we believe in love, we don’t believe in machine guns. But if you
force us, you will find yourself destroying your constitution, your
democracy, your prestige in the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;</p><p><br></p><p>FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT UNTO LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU LOVE YOU SHOULD NOT SAY, “GOD IS IN MY HEART...” because
that can become your ego. Hence, Almustafa says: BUT RATHER, “I AM IN
THE HEART OF GOD.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has improved upon the first statement but the second statement,
although better, can still be improved. My suggestion is that you should
say, “Love is and I am not.”</p><p><br></p><p>AND THINK NOT YOU CAN DIRECT THE COURSE OF LOVE, FOR LOVE, IF IT
FINDS YOU WORTHY, DIRECTS YOUR COURSE.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax and trust into love. And allow love to take you. Just as every
river goes to the ocean, every small stream of love arising from your
heart goes to the universal, to the ultimate, to God.</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE HAS NO OTHER DESIRE BUT TO FULFILL ITSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT IF YOU LOVE AND MUST NEEDS HAVE DESIRES, LET THESE BE YOUR
DESIRES...</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are not strong enough to surrender totally to love, and
you have other desires too, then Almustafa says, at least have these
desires:</p><p><br></p><p>TO MELT AND BE LIKE A RUNNING BROOK THAT SINGS ITS MELODY TO THE
NIGHT. TO KNOW THE PAIN OF TOO MUCH TENDERNESS.</p><p>TO BE WOUNDED BY YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF LOVE:</p><p><br></p><p>AND TO BLEED WILLINGLY AND JOYFULLY.</p><p><br></p><p>TO WAKE AT DAWN WITH A WINGED HEART AND GIVE THANKS FOR ANOTHER DAY
OF LOVING;</p><p><br></p><p>TO REST AT THE NOON HOUR AND MEDITATE LOVE’S ECSTASY; TO RETURN HOME
AT EVENTIDE WITH GRATITUDE;</p><p>If you cannot let go totally, then slowly slowly, step by step, move
towards gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEN TO SLEEP WITH A PRAYER FOR THE BELOVED IN YOUR HEART AND A
SONG OF PRAISE UPON YOUR LIPS.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be bothered by any police commissioners! Okay, Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

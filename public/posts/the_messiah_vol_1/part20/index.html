EVEN LIKE THE SUN IS YOUR GOD-SELF;\nIT KNOWS NOT THE WAYS OF THE MOLE NOR SEEKS IT THE HOLES OF THE SERPENT.\nBUT YOUR GOD-SELF DWELLS NOT ALONE IN YOUR BEING. MUCH IN YOU IS STILL MAN, AND MUCH IN YOU IS NOT YET MAN,\nBUT A SHAPELESS PYGMY THAT WALKS ASLEEP IN THE MIST SEARCHING FOR ITS OWN AWAKENING.\nAND OF THE MAN IN YOU WOULD I NOW SPEAK.\nFOR IT IS HE AND NOT YOUR GOD-SELF NOR THE PYGMY IN THE MIST THAT KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME.\nI continuously feel sad and sorry for Kahlil Gibran. He does not really belong to the crowd. He belongs to the highest peaks of human consciousness, but he knows not the way.\nIt seems basically he is a poet but once in a while, in his dreams, he has seen the sunlit peaks of his consciousness, too. He has tried his best to convey whatever his dreams have revealed to him – but dreams don’t reveal the truth.\nAt the most, the best dream is nothing but a full moon night, shadowed, reflected in a lake. If the lake is silent – no ripples, no wind blowing and disturbing it – it becomes a mirror and one can see the moon in that mirror. But it is not the real moon, it is only the reflection. A small pebble thrown in the lake, and all the silver of the moon will be spread in ripples all over, and the moon disappears.\nSo is the case, unfortunately, with Kahlil Gibran.\nWhen he describes the moon he is really describing the reflection of the moon. The reflection is almost exactly like the moon – and sometimes even more beautiful. The lake also enhances the beauty; the silence surrounding the lake also makes the dream richer. But howsoever rich a dream may be, it is still a dream.\nAgain I can make the distinction between the poet and the mystic: the poet at the most sees the reflection; the mystic sees the moon. So they are very close, and sometimes the poet comes to describe the moon so realistically that almost anyone can be deceived. Moreover, the poet has an articulateness which is not necessary for a mystic. So you can be deceived. The mystic may look ordinary in his expressions, and the poet is able to decorate his dreams according to his own articulateness.\nI feel sad and sorry for Kahlil Gibran that he remained satisfied with the reflection in the lake. He never thought about what the reflection was of. He was a great dreamer, and his dreams brought magic to his words. Again and again you will see him coming very close to the truth; but he goes on missing the point.\nTHEN ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE CITY STOOD FORTH AND SAID, SPEAK TO US OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.\nAND HE ANSWERED, SAYING:\nIT IS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT YOU, ALONE AND UNGUARDED, COMMIT A WRONG UNTO OTHERS AND THEREFORE UNTO YOURSELF.\nThis can never be said by a man who is awakened, who has seen the real moon. In fact, he will say just the contrary.\nLet me repeat Kahlil Gibran and show you how he goes on being a Gautam Buddha – missing again and again. I don’t feel sad and sorry for everybody, but Kahlil Gibran has the potential, and is unaware of it. He says:\nIT IS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT YOU, ALONE AND UNGUARDED, COMMIT A WRONG UNTO OTHERS AND THEREFORE UNTO YOURSELF. The truth is, it is WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT YOU, ALONE –\nabsolutely alone – for the first time know what virtue is.\nMan has never committed crimes unto others and unto himself in his absolute aloneness. He commits crimes in the crowd, with the crowd – because in the crowd and with the crowd he does not feel responsible for what he is doing. He is simply a cog in the machine. He can easily say, “I was doing something which was being done by everybody else.”\nIn India, almost every day somewhere or other there are riots amongst Hindus and Mohammedans, Jainas and Mohammedans.… I used to live in a city which is famous only for its riots. A small excuse, and the whole city is on fire... because that city was almost balanced in population between Mohammedans and Hindus. And small and stupid things, which are thought to be religious, spiritual.…\nFor example, if you – with your music, your drums, your songs, your flutes – pass a Mohammedan mosque and don’t stop your music, it is enough to kill hundreds of people, to burn dozens of houses.\nAnd the first victim of all these riots is the woman. She is raped, taken away. And Hindus cannot accept a woman who has been raped by a Mohammedan. Even if he has not raped her, but the woman has stayed in the house of a Mohammedan just for one night, that’s enough for the primitive Hindu mind to condemn her. She has lost her soul, her spirituality. She cannot be accepted.\nI was watching these riots for almost twenty years continuously, and I was wondering – nice, beautiful, very loving people – how do they suddenly change? Just a rumor is enough, and killing and murder and violence start.\nIn the university, one of the professors – a very nice, loving human being – when I saw him putting fire to a Hindu temple I could not resist the temptation to ask him. After the riots were over and the curfew was withdrawn, I said, “I could have believed anybody to be so ugly and violent, but not you. I want to ask a few questions: one is, could you alone burn the Hindu temple, which has not harmed you or anybody?”\nHe said, “Why are you asking this?”\nI said, “I want to understand the psychology of crime.”\nTears came to his eyes, and he said, “Alone it is inconceivable, but in the crowd one becomes just a part of the crowd. And when there are so many people putting fire to the temple, some unconscious urge for violence, destruction, animality, surfaces.”\nOne forgets completely his own individuality; he becomes just a cog in the machine. Whatever he does is not his doing, it is the doing of the unconscious crowd. And he is pulled in by the crowd.\nKahlil Gibran seems to be absolutely unaware that wandering upon the wind in your total aloneness, one becomes enlightened, not a criminal. Crime as such is part of the mob psychology. It seems consciousness is something like water. Water always keeps the same level – and when you are part of a crowd, your consciousness also comes to have the same level, same blindness, as the mob.\nPeople in their aloneness have become Everests, the highest peaks of consciousness. But the crowd has never risen to consciousness; you have never heard about a crowd which is enlightened. It is always the individual who has the capacity to rise on the winds, just like an eagle flying alone across the sun, to greater and greater freedom.\nThe mob is always of the slaves, of the people who are afraid, people whose beings are full of fear. Lions don’t move in a crowd. In their dignity and pride, in their glory and magnificence, they stand alone. It is only the sheep, cowards – full of fear, always concerned about their death – they remain in a crowd.\nYou will not see a sheep alone. Alone, she starts feeling lost. She does not know what to do, where to go. It was always the crowd psychology which has dominated her.\nCrime is not born out of the aloneness of man. It is born out of the cowards, who are not capable of being alone.\nWith the crowd there is a certain security, a certain coziness – just watch a crowd of sheep, how they move. They don’t even leave spaces. Touching each others’ bodies, they move as if they have one consciousness. And they are happy in their non-individuality.\nCrime comes not out of individuals, it comes out of those who cannot experience aloneness and the heights of the winds, who cannot open their wings, out of fear that they may be lost. Kahlil Gibran’s idea is absolutely misleading – categorically wrong.\nBut the last part of his statement, taken separately from the whole, has a reflection of the moon – when he says that when you commit a crime against others, you are also committing a crime against yourself. I say it is a reflection because in a reflection, a change happens. When you are standing before a mirror, your right eye in the reflection becomes your left eye; your left eye in the reflection becomes your right eye. The same has happened even with this statement which has some reflection – it is a reflection, and cannot be truly representative of truth.\nHe says, when you commit a crime against other people you are also committing a crime against yourself. The reality is, before committing a crime against others you have already committed a crime against yourself. Unless you have committed a crime against yourself it is impossible to commit a crime against others.\nThis proves my hypothesis that he is looking at the reflection. How can you be full of hate towards others if you are not full of hate towards yourself? And how can you be loving to others if you are not loving to yourself? You come first – and you do to other people the same that you are doing to yourself. So the reality is almost vice-versa.\nIn aloneness is born your freedom, your independence. In aloneness your consciousness has nothing else to be busy with – left alone, it starts turning upon itself; there is nowhere else to go. And when consciousness becomes a circle, coming back to the source from where it started, your life is no more the old, unconscious life. Because the returning consciousness goes on dispelling all darkness from every nook and corner of your being.\nAnd when you are full of light you have tasted godliness for the first time. In aloneness, nobody commits a crime – cannot commit a crime.\nAND FOR THAT WRONG COMMITTED MUST YOU KNOCK AND WAIT A WHILE UNHEEDED AT THE GATE OF THE BLESSED.\nThere is no need to wait at the gate of the blessed, because in your aloneness you have become the blessed. That is the meaning of the Sanskrit word Bhagwan – the blessed one.\nBut even people like Jesus are unaware of what they are saying and what they are doing. His whole life he was telling people, “You are sheep and I am your shepherd.” This is humiliation! To call a human being a sheep means you have taken all his dignity, you have destroyed his freedom, you have made him part of a mob.\nAnd all the religions have done it, whether they say it or not, for a simple reason: because unless people are sheep, how are they going to be shepherds? The priests, the theologians, the politicians, all need you to remain sheep – just a crowd. Every effort is being made to destroy your individuality and to destroy your aloneness, because if you are alone you will be a lion. And lions don’t need any shepherds.\nYes, once in a while, for a breakfast.…\nMy effort with you is to bring you out of this constant conditioning that you are part of a crowd – no, you are just yourself. And you are not sheep, you are lions.\nAnd that’s where you can see the difference between Jesus and Gautam Buddha. Gautam Buddha used to say that whenever a person becomes initiated into meditation, enters his own soul – where nobody else can enter, where he is going to be absolutely alone – there arises in him the lion’s roar. Buddha is giving dignity to you, he is transforming you from the world of sheep into the glory of being a lion.\nI want my people to be lions.\nYou can be together – not as a crowd, but as a gathering of lions; each one separate and individual, allowing space for everybody else.\nIt is because of people like Jesus – who are beautiful, in many ways – that the world is suffering all kinds of oppression, exploitation. Because what can a sheep do? No one has ever heard of any revolution happening in a crowd of sheep. They are very obedient to the crowd. They are very obedient to the shepherd.\nThe shepherd is not going to save them; he has already destroyed them. And to call himself a shepherd and all other human beings just sheep, shows a deep-rooted ego – not enlightenment, where ego disappears, when one is but there is no “I”, no ego, no longing to be superior and holier than others.\nThe misunderstandings in Kahlil Gibran are deeply connected with the misunderstandings of Jesus Christ. He loved Jesus, his language reflects Jesus, his statements reflect Jesus, although he is far more poetic. Far more beautiful is his way of expression – but never be deceived by the expressions, howsoever beautiful they are. Dissect all those beautiful expressions and you will not find anything within them. Or, what you will find will be only darkness, misunderstanding, ignorance.\nThe people who have been in search of truth have always gone in aloneness. And the people who want to find the meaning of life have always gone into themselves, where nobody else can enter.\nAloneness outside... aloneness inside... and you have come to a point where you can roar like a lion. Of course, millions of sheep are going to be annoyed with you, because they cannot roar like a lion and they cannot soar like an eagle. They have been told just to believe in the crowd in which they have accidentally been born.\nA person who remains part of a crowd never attains his true individuality. He remains fake.\nYou have heard the expression, which exists in almost all languages: A sheep hiding itself in a lion’s skin. These kinds of sayings are not out of the wisdom of centuries, they are out of the ignorance of centuries. I would like to put the proverb right: The truth is that you are a lion forced to live in the skin of a sheep.\nAnd there is no need, and there is no place where you have to knock to find the blessed one. Yes, there is a space where the blessed one is already waiting for you – and it is within you. Neither Jesus nor anybody else can lead you there – only you. If you revolt from being a sheep and gather courage to roar like a lion and to move like a lion, you will be the blessed one.\nLIKE THE OCEAN IS YOUR GOD-SELF; IT REMAINS FOREVER UNDEFILED.\nThis is the beauty of Kahlil Gibran, that although he falls again and again, he gets up.…\nHe lived almost his whole life in America, where the motto of every American is: Try and try and try again! And the poor fellow is doing the best he can, but he falls – and you have to remember this, and you have to be very mindful, very alert, when you are reading Kahlil Gibran or anybody else.\nA great calamity has happened to humanity. A idea has become settled in the minds of people that if someone is right, he is always right, and if someone is wrong he is always wrong. If somebody is a saint he is always a saint – day out, day in; and if somebody is a sinner he is always a sinner – day out, day in.\nThis is not the reality. Even sinners have moments when they are saints, and even saints go for a holiday.\nThis calamity goes back to Aristotle, the father of Western logic, because he accepts only two categories: either you are right or you are wrong. He forgets that there is a possibility of many positions between right and wrong. He has also forgotten the simple fact that you may be right in one thing and wrong in another thing.\nBut it needs tremendous awareness – and particularly with people like Kahlil Gibran, whose words are hypnotizing. They are almost like a lullaby; they are very soothing, even if they are wrong. You become so impressed by them, you lose all your interest in being alert, aware, watchful.\nLike the ocean is your god-self... This is true. Your being is not confined to your bones. Your being is not confined to the bag of skin in which you are living – you call it your body. Your being is as vast as the ocean.\nAll the rivers of the world go on bringing every kind of rubbish, crap, dirt, dust, because they have been passing through thousands of miles. And for millions of years they have been falling into the ocean, but the ocean remains undefiled. This is a truth to be remembered. It should be written in letters of gold.\nYou have done all kinds of actions, good and bad. You have been right and wrong, you have seen all the days and all the nights of your life, you have been to the temples and you have been to the prostitutes – but your being remains undefiled, just as the ocean. You are so vast... these small things don’t matter at all in the last reckoning.\nHence I say to you, never judge anybody by any small action that he has done. Somebody has stolen, somebody has murdered, somebody has lied – these are small actions. Don’t judge the man and his whole life on the basis of a small action.\nAnd remember the ultimate truth – that whatever you do, your innermost core remains undefiled. There is no way to pollute your being, to corrupt your soul. Within a second... if you become aware of your inner being, you will be surprised: “I was condemned by everybody, I was condemning myself, but my real being has remained untouched. It is always virgin, always pure.”\nI would like to tell you a beautiful story.\nThere was a man, thousands of years before. His name was Valmik; his profession was robbery. And if needed, he had no hesitation in killing people. If they resisted giving him their money, their valuable things, he had no hesitation for a single moment to kill them. He was a strong man.\nAt that time he was not known as Valmik, he was known as Valya Bhil – the bhils are aboriginal, primitive tribes. And who would call Valya Bhil “Valmik”? – because Valmik means the same, but becomes respectable. He was a robber and a murderer, and everybody knew it.\nIt was very rare that people would pass through the forest where he lived. The road had almost become unusable, because whoever passed that way was going to be robbed or killed.\nA musician, a poet, and a very beautiful man, Narada, who always, even while moving, continued to play on a very simple musical instrument – and remember, the more simple the instrument the more difficult it is to create great music out of it. He used to carry a simple instrument, an ektara – a one-stringed sitar. It is easy when there are many strings to create music, because you can create different notes on different strings. The ektara has only one string – that is the meaning of ektara. Ek means one; tara means string. It has become almost the symbol of Narada. You will not find a statue or a painting of him without his ektara.\nHe was a master musician, and a great poet – and perhaps the only man in India who knew the hilariousness of existence, who used to laugh.…\nWhen he was leaving, people told him: “Don’t go – otherwise you will lose your ektara. That Valya does not care who you are, and if you try to save your ektara you will lose your head. Better is to follow another route, although that route is a little longer.”\nNarada said, “If I had not known I might have gone by the other route, but now it is a challenge, between Valya and Narada. I would love to see this man, who has made you all cowards, so afraid. Just a single man, and the whole traffic on the road has disappeared. Must be a lion, living in the forest... and thousands of people used to pass on this road. Now nobody goes there; the road is closed – not for repair!”\nNarada went, because he trusted in music more than in the murderousness of a man. What kind of music it is that cannot transform the murderous animal instinct in a man?\nValya heard the music – it was enchanting, it had a magic. And when he saw Narada alone – with no weapons, with no possessions, just one ektara ... the man was even more beautiful than his music. It has to be so, because the creator of anything is always greater than his creation; the creation cannot be greater than the creator. For the first time Valya felt hesitant, indecisive whether to let this beautiful man pass. But to make an exception would not be right – this was his fame, that nobody could pass on that road without being robbed or killed.\nSo he warned the great musician and seer: “I pray to you, go back. If you don’t go back I will have to take your possessions, whatever they are. If you resist you may lose your life. And I don’t want to do anything with you – neither do I want to take your instrument nor do I want to deprive you of life. And don’t say later on that I did not warn you.”\nBut Narada went on playing on his ektara. And rather than going on the road he came and sat by the side of Valya, who was sharpening his sword. Narada said, “You are a beautiful man; but why do you do such a thing?”\nHe said, “What else can I do? I don’t have any education; I am an untouchable, the lowest and most condemned class of the Hindus. I cannot go to a temple, I cannot go in the city – but I have to look after my wife, my old mother, my father, my children.”\nNarada said, “If that is the case, I would like to go to your home and ask everybody – you are committing things which are inhuman. Who is going to be punished for them? You are committing all those things for your old mother and father – ask them, ‘Will you share my punishment too?’ Ask\nyour wife, ask your children: ‘Whatever I am doing I am doing for you – are you going to share my punishment?“’\nValya laughed, and he said, “You seem to be very clever and cunning! I will go home and you will disappear. Nobody can cheat Valya.”\nNarada said, “There is no question of cheating. You can tie me with a rope to a tree – and you know nobody comes here; I will wait. And whatever you want to do after, you can do. But first bring me the answer.”\nHe had never thought about it. He went home. He asked his father, mother, his wife, his children – nobody was ready to share the punishment. They said, “That is not our business. It is your responsibility to take care of your family; we are not concerned with how you are taking care. What you are doing is totally your responsibility.”\nIt was a great shock. He could not believe that the parents he loved so much, the wife he loved so much... his own children, for whom he was committing all kinds of crimes... flatly refused: “It is your duty to take care of us. The question of sharing in your punishment does not arise.”\nHe came back with tears in his eyes, untied Narada, touched his feet, and said, “Just by a single question you have transformed me. I don’t have a family. If they cannot share my punishment they don’t love me – I was living in an illusion. They loved all the money that I was bringing to them, but when the question of punishment was raised not a single one answered that ‘I will share with you.’ Now I don’t have any family.”\nAnd he threw his sword away in the forest and asked Narada, “Initiate me so that one day I can also feel the same music and the same poetry and the same joy that I see on your face.”\nNarada said, “Much is not needed – just the name of God. You have to start chanting the name of God, RAM.”\nRemember – this is very confusing in a way – this is not the same name as I discussed before, the king, Rama, who behaved with his wife in a very primitive, crude, ugly way. Ram is older than the Rama I discussed with you – in fact he was named Rama because the name ram existed before him. It is the Hindu equivalent of God.\nNarada said, “This will do: sit silently and repeat, ram, ram, ram, so that all that goes on in your mind slowly slowly is replaced by Ram. And this is the beauty of it – that once it has replaced everything, it also disappears. In the same way you light a candle... the flame is not possible without the candle but slowly slowly, first the flame will burn the candle, and once the candle is finished the flame will disappear automatically.”\nThis is something very significant. So he said, “You do simple things. Don’t get involved in any complex thing because you are a simple man, a courageous man. And after a few months I will be coming back to see what is happening. If some other help is needed I will always be available to you.”\nBut he was uneducated, aboriginal, a primitive man – uncivilized, uncultured. He started with trust – because this kind of simple person is always trusting. He started repeating, RAM... RAM... RAM... RAM... And Narada had told him, “Go on repeating faster and faster – don’t leave any gap between two RAM’S.”\nThe poor fellow got into trouble. If you repeat, “ram, ram, ram...” and he was uneducated, he had never heard the name. So he got mixed up; he started repeating “Mara, Mara, Mara...” ram means God, but if you repeat it, two Ram’s join – and the change is possible for an uneducated man. Mara means “dying, dying, dying...”\nBut in a way it is significant, the story. If you really want to achieve the state of godliness, the death of your ego is absolutely necessary. So although it was just a mistake, when after three months Narada came back, Valya was a transformed being. He was radiating light, pulsating the whole atmosphere with a new energy.\nEven Narada felt defeated. His whole life he had been repeating, chanting, singing the name of God, playing on his musical instrument, but his gain had not been as much as Valya’s. He was almost a light unto himself. Around him an aura of light... Narada could not call him valya again, because that would be disrespectful. He changed valya into Valmik, and told him, “You have done a miracle, because the same name I have been repeating for my whole life and just in three months you have left me far behind. It will take lives for me to catch hold of you.”\nHe said, “I have not done anything except whatever you have told me. I have been repeating, ‘mara, mara, mara...”’\nNarada said, “My god! I never told you that – I told you ram.\nHe said, “I am an uneducated man, absolutely unaware of any religion or anything. My whole life has been just of robbery and murder. I forgot – instead of ram the order changed; the M of ram came ahead of R. Forgive me.”\nNarada said, “There is no need to forgive you. You are so innocent: without any greed, without any desire to be rewarded in heaven, even repeating mara, mara, you are a new man. Don’t be worried. You continue – whatever you have been doing is right.”\n“But,” he said, “how can it be? What about my acts of murder? Because I cannot count so I cannot say how many people I have murdered. What about my robberies?”\nNarada said to him, “Forget it all. You have reached the ocean of your being. It is radiating all over; even a blind man may be able to see it or, at least feel it – the joy, the fragrance. And don’t think at all about what you have been doing. Those are small acts. Small rivers, muddy, dirty, have fallen into the ocean, and the ocean is never made dirty by these rivers. It remains undefiled.”\nAND LIKE THE ETHER IT LIFTS BUT THE WINGED. EVEN LIKE THE SUN IS YOUR GOD-SELF.\nAND LIKE THE ETHER IT LIFTS BUT THE WINGED...\nAll that you need is wings, courage to be alone in the vast sky, with no guide, with no map, with no roads, with no signposts, with no milestones. It needs only courage and wings, and the whole sky is yours.\nEVEN LIKE THE SUN IS YOUR GOD-SELF. Your innermost being, from a different angle is like the sun. IT KNOWS NOT THE WAYS OF THE MOLE NOR SEEKS IT THE HOLES OF THE SERPENT.\nIt rises for everyone to share, for everyone to receive fresh life every day. But it does not know the ways of the mole, nor seeks it the holes of the serpent. It is available – the serpent can come out of his hole, the mole can come out of his hole.\nYour self is also like the sun – it is available, but you are living in a hole, different kinds of holes.\nThe sun will not knock on your doors. It is really inside you. You have to open all the doors and all the windows so life’s fragrance starts showering on you, so the light that you have always contained starts radiating.\nAll these lines that have preceded, I support with my total being. But again he says: BUT YOUR GOD-SELF DWELLS NOT ALONE IN YOUR BEING.\nThat too is true – whatever dwells in your being dwells in every being. And the totality of all the beings is the ocean of consciousness. You can call it God – I prefer the word godliness, because it is more a quality than a thing. It is more a presence than a person.\nMUCH IN YOU IS STILL MAN, AND MUCH IN YOU IS NOT YET MAN... Much in you is asleep –\nyour manhood, your humanity. AND MUCH IN YOU IS NOT YET EVEN MAN... your origins from the animals are also there.\nIn India, the Hindus have a very beautiful conception of one of their incarnations of God, which is half man and half animal. The whole world has laughed about it – “what kind of stupidity is this?” But it is simply a symbol of your inner psychology.\nHalf in you is man and half is still animal. And the trouble is, the animal is fully awake and the man is fully asleep.\n... BUT A SHAPELESS PYGMY THAT WALKS ASLEEP IN THE MIST, SEARCHING FOR ITS OWN AWAKENING.\nThe man in you tries to wake up. You know sometimes in a nightmare, you want to wake up but you cannot. You cannot open your eyes, you cannot move your hands – as if everything has become paralyzed. The impact of the nightmare is so much that for a few moments you are almost dead. You will laugh about it when you wake up, but while you are asleep you are trembling with fear – and even when you wake up you will find the after-effects, the hangover. Your perspiration will be there – the night may be cool but the nightmare was so dangerous that your body accepted it as a reality. The body is blind. It started perspiring out of fear. You will find your heart is beating louder; although you are awake, still the nightmare’s effects can be seen. Although the elephant has passed through the door, his tail is still inside the room.\nAND OF THE MAN IN YOU WOULD I NOW SPEAK:\nFOR IT IS HE AND NOT YOUR GOD-SELF NOR THE PYGMY IN THE MIST THAT KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME.\nHere he becomes hypothetical. He does not know; he himself is groping. What he says... something is right in it and something is wrong in it.\nFOR IT IS HE AND NOT YOUR GOD-SELF NOR THE PYGMY IN THE MIST THAT KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME...\nHe’s dividing you in three parts: first the pygmy, the animal; second, the man who is asleep and groping, and trying to wake up; and third, the god-self. This division is wrong.\nThere is no god-self, only the awakened man. God-self is another name for the awakened man. That’s why a man like Gautam Buddha said there is no God. And you can ignore the atheists, who have never explored their inner being, but you cannot ignore Gautam Buddha or Mahavira. Both say there is no God.\nTo say it in other words: When God is asleep, we call him man, and when man is awake, we call him God. The awakening of man is his godliness; there is no other god. So division is not threefold.\nYou are divided into the animal and man – the animal has to go to sleep and the man has to come to awakening. And both things happen simultaneously. The awakened man you can call the god.\nH.G. Wells was writing about the world’s history. When he came to write about Buddha – he studied much about Buddha and was very much puzzled: What to say about this man? What he said is so significant that perhaps it is difficult to find another statement made in this century which is more significant. He said about Buddha: “Gautam the Buddha is the most godless man and yet the most godly.”\nThere is no need of any God if you are awake.\nYour awakening, your enlightenment makes you laugh, that “I was looking for God in the sky and he was hiding within me.”\nA small storyIt is just a story, but full of meaning and juice.\nWhen God created the world, he used to live in the world. But he became tired, because from the morning on, everybody would start coming with complaints: somebody has no child, somebody’s child is sick, somebody’s child has died; somebody has fallen in love but the parents are not allowing him to marry the woman... and millions are the problems. And just one poor God! And those who could not get him in the day would torture him in the night – he was unable even to sleep.\nFinally, he asked his advisor, “What should I do? These people will kill me! They don’t allow me rest, and they bring a thousand and one problems. They should solve those problems. I have given them every capacity, intelligence, to solve all their problems but they want to throw all responsibility\non me, thinking that ‘Why should we bother? Why did you create us in the first place? If you created us then take care of our problems.”’\nThe advisor whispered in his ear, “There is a place where these people will never go.” He said, “Just show it to me.”\nAnd he said, “You just hide inside these people themselves. They will go searching for you all over the world but they will never go inside. You can rest, relax.” And he is resting and relaxing there.\nIf you want to know whether the story is true or not, go in! Okay, Vimal?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6222","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/>The Messiah, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20 Crime: a crowd psychology</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6222 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Messiah_Vol_1/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE ANSWERED, SAYING:</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND,</p><p><br></p><p>THAT YOU, ALONE AND UNGUARDED, COMMIT A WRONG UNTO OTHERS AND

KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME.</p><p><br></p><p>I continuously feel sad and sorry for Kahlil Gibran. He does not
really belong to the crowd. He belongs to the highest peaks of human
consciousness, but he knows not the way.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems basically he is a poet but once in a while, in his dreams,
he has seen the sunlit peaks of his consciousness, too. He has tried his
best to convey whatever his dreams have revealed to him – but dreams
don’t reveal the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>At the most, the best dream is nothing but a full moon night,
shadowed, reflected in a lake. If the lake is silent – no ripples, no
wind blowing and disturbing it – it becomes a mirror and one can see the
moon in that mirror. But it is not the real moon, it is only the
reflection. A small pebble thrown in the lake, and all the silver of the
moon will be spread in ripples all over, and the moon disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>So is the case, unfortunately, with Kahlil Gibran.</p><p><br></p><p>When he describes the moon he is really describing the reflection of
the moon. The reflection is almost exactly like the moon – and sometimes
even more beautiful. The lake also enhances the beauty; the silence
surrounding the lake also makes the dream richer. But howsoever rich a
dream may be, it is still a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Again I can make the distinction between the poet and the mystic: the
poet at the most sees the reflection; the mystic sees the moon. So they
are very close, and sometimes the poet comes to describe the moon so
realistically that almost anyone can be deceived. Moreover, the poet has
an articulateness which is not necessary for a mystic. So you can be
deceived. The mystic may look ordinary in his expressions, and the poet
is able to decorate his dreams according to his own articulateness.</p><p><br></p><p>I feel sad and sorry for Kahlil Gibran that he remained satisfied
with the reflection in the lake. He never thought about what the
reflection was of. He was a great dreamer, and his dreams brought magic
to his words. Again and again you will see him coming very close to the
truth; but he goes on missing the point.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE CITY STOOD FORTH AND SAID, SPEAK TO US
OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE ANSWERED, SAYING:</p><p>IT IS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT YOU, ALONE
AND UNGUARDED, COMMIT A WRONG UNTO OTHERS AND THEREFORE UNTO
YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>This can never be said by a man who is awakened, who has seen the
real moon. In fact, he will say just the contrary.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat Kahlil Gibran and show you how he goes on being a
Gautam Buddha – missing again and again. I don’t feel sad and sorry for
everybody, but Kahlil Gibran has the potential, and is unaware of it. He
says:</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT YOU, ALONE
AND UNGUARDED, COMMIT A WRONG UNTO OTHERS AND THEREFORE UNTO YOURSELF.
The truth is, it is WHEN YOUR SPIRIT GOES WANDERING UPON THE WIND THAT
YOU, ALONE –</p><p>absolutely alone – for the first time know what virtue is.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has never committed crimes unto others and unto himself in his
absolute aloneness. He commits crimes in the crowd, with the crowd –
because in the crowd and with the crowd he does not feel responsible for
what he is doing. He is simply a cog in the machine. He can easily say,
“I was doing something which was being done by everybody else.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, almost every day somewhere or other there are riots amongst
Hindus and Mohammedans, Jainas and Mohammedans.… I used to live in a
city which is famous only for its riots. A small excuse, and the whole
city is on fire... because that city was almost balanced in population
between Mohammedans and Hindus. And small and stupid things, which are
thought to be religious, spiritual.…</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if you – with your music, your drums, your songs, your
flutes – pass a Mohammedan mosque and don’t stop your music, it is
enough to kill hundreds of people, to burn dozens of houses.</p><p><br></p><p>And the first victim of all these riots is the woman. She is raped,
taken away. And Hindus cannot accept a woman who has been raped by a
Mohammedan. Even if he has not raped her, but the woman has stayed in
the house of a Mohammedan just for one night, that’s enough for the
primitive Hindu mind to condemn her. She has lost her soul, her
spirituality. She cannot be accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>I was watching these riots for almost twenty years continuously, and
I was wondering – nice, beautiful, very loving people – how do they
suddenly change? Just a rumor is enough, and killing and murder and
violence start.</p><p><br></p><p>In the university, one of the professors – a very nice, loving human
being – when I saw him putting fire to a Hindu temple I could not resist
the temptation to ask him. After the riots were over and the curfew was
withdrawn, I said, “I could have believed anybody to be so ugly and
violent, but not you. I want to ask a few questions: one is, could you
alone burn the Hindu temple, which has not harmed you or anybody?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Why are you asking this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I want to understand the psychology of crime.”</p><p>Tears came to his eyes, and he said, “Alone it is inconceivable, but
in the crowd one becomes just a part of the crowd. And when there are so
many people putting fire to the temple, some unconscious urge for
violence, destruction, animality, surfaces.”</p><p><br></p><p>One forgets completely his own individuality; he becomes just a cog
in the machine. Whatever he does is not his doing, it is the doing of
the unconscious crowd. And he is pulled in by the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Kahlil Gibran seems to be absolutely unaware that wandering upon the
wind in your total aloneness, one becomes enlightened, not a criminal.
Crime as such is part of the mob psychology. It seems consciousness is
something like water. Water always keeps the same level – and when you
are part of a crowd, your consciousness also comes to have the same
level, same blindness, as the mob.</p><p><br></p><p>People in their aloneness have become Everests, the highest peaks of
consciousness. But the crowd has never risen to consciousness; you have
never heard about a crowd which is enlightened. It is always the
individual who has the capacity to rise on the winds, just like an eagle
flying alone across the sun, to greater and greater freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>The mob is always of the slaves, of the people who are afraid, people
whose beings are full of fear. Lions don’t move in a crowd. In their
dignity and pride, in their glory and magnificence, they stand alone. It
is only the sheep, cowards – full of fear, always concerned about their
death – they remain in a crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not see a sheep alone. Alone, she starts feeling lost. She
does not know what to do, where to go. It was always the crowd
psychology which has dominated her.</p><p><br></p><p>Crime is not born out of the aloneness of man. It is born out of the
cowards, who are not capable of being alone.</p><p><br></p><p>With the crowd there is a certain security, a certain coziness – just
watch a crowd of sheep, how they move. They don’t even leave spaces.
Touching each others’ bodies, they move as if they have one
consciousness. And they are happy in their non-individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>Crime comes not out of individuals, it comes out of those who cannot
experience aloneness and the heights of the winds, who cannot open their
wings, out of fear that they may be lost. Kahlil Gibran’s idea is
absolutely misleading – categorically wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>But the last part of his statement, taken separately from the whole,
has a reflection of the moon – when he says that when you commit a crime
against others, you are also committing a crime against yourself. I say
it is a reflection because in a reflection, a change happens. When you
are standing before a mirror, your right eye in the reflection becomes
your left eye; your left eye in the reflection becomes your right eye.
The same has happened even with this statement which has some reflection
– it is a reflection, and cannot be truly representative of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>He says, when you commit a crime against other people you are also
committing a crime against yourself. The reality is, before committing a
crime against others you have already committed a crime against
yourself. Unless you have committed a crime against yourself it is
impossible to commit a crime against others.</p><p>This proves my hypothesis that he is looking at the reflection. How
can you be full of hate towards others if you are not full of hate
towards yourself? And how can you be loving to others if you are not
loving to yourself? You come first – and you do to other people the same
that you are doing to yourself. So the reality is almost vice-versa.</p><p><br></p><p>In aloneness is born your freedom, your independence. In aloneness
your consciousness has nothing else to be busy with – left alone, it
starts turning upon itself; there is nowhere else to go. And when
consciousness becomes a circle, coming back to the source from where it
started, your life is no more the old, unconscious life. Because the
returning consciousness goes on dispelling all darkness from every nook
and corner of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are full of light you have tasted godliness for the
first time. In aloneness, nobody commits a crime – cannot commit a
crime.</p><p>AND FOR THAT WRONG COMMITTED MUST YOU KNOCK AND WAIT A WHILE UNHEEDED
AT THE GATE OF THE BLESSED.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to wait at the gate of the blessed, because in your
aloneness you have become the blessed. That is the meaning of the
Sanskrit word Bhagwan – the blessed one.</p><p><br></p><p>But even people like Jesus are unaware of what they are saying and
what they are doing. His whole life he was telling people, “You are
sheep and I am your shepherd.” This is humiliation! To call a human
being a sheep means you have taken all his dignity, you have destroyed
his freedom, you have made him part of a mob.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the religions have done it, whether they say it or not, for a
simple reason: because unless people are sheep, how are they going to be
shepherds? The priests, the theologians, the politicians, all need you
to remain sheep – just a crowd. Every effort is being made to destroy
your individuality and to destroy your aloneness, because if you are
alone you will be a lion. And lions don’t need any shepherds.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, once in a while, for a breakfast.…</p><p><br></p><p>My effort with you is to bring you out of this constant conditioning
that you are part of a crowd – no, you are just yourself. And you are
not sheep, you are lions.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where you can see the difference between Jesus and Gautam
Buddha. Gautam Buddha used to say that whenever a person becomes
initiated into meditation, enters his own soul – where nobody else can
enter, where he is going to be absolutely alone – there arises in him
the lion’s roar. Buddha is giving dignity to you, he is transforming you
from the world of sheep into the glory of being a lion.</p><p><br></p><p>I want my people to be lions.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be together – not as a crowd, but as a gathering of lions;
each one separate and individual, allowing space for everybody else.</p><p>It is because of people like Jesus – who are beautiful, in many ways
– that the world is suffering all kinds of oppression, exploitation.
Because what can a sheep do? No one has ever heard of any revolution
happening in a crowd of sheep. They are very obedient to the crowd. They
are very obedient to the shepherd.</p><p><br></p><p>The shepherd is not going to save them; he has already destroyed
them. And to call himself a shepherd and all other human beings just
sheep, shows a deep-rooted ego – not enlightenment, where ego
disappears, when one is but there is no “I”, no ego, no longing to be
superior and holier than others.</p><p><br></p><p>The misunderstandings in Kahlil Gibran are deeply connected with the
misunderstandings of Jesus Christ. He loved Jesus, his language reflects
Jesus, his statements reflect Jesus, although he is far more poetic. Far
more beautiful is his way of expression – but never be deceived by the
expressions, howsoever beautiful they are. Dissect all those beautiful
expressions and you will not find anything within them. Or, what you
will find will be only darkness, misunderstanding, ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who have been in search of truth have always gone in
aloneness. And the people who want to find the meaning of life have
always gone into themselves, where nobody else can enter.</p><p><br></p><p>Aloneness outside... aloneness inside... and you have come to a point
where you can roar like a lion. Of course, millions of sheep are going
to be annoyed with you, because they cannot roar like a lion and they
cannot soar like an eagle. They have been told just to believe in the
crowd in which they have accidentally been born.</p><p><br></p><p>A person who remains part of a crowd never attains his true
individuality. He remains fake.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard the expression, which exists in almost all languages:
A sheep hiding itself in a lion’s skin. These kinds of sayings are not
out of the wisdom of centuries, they are out of the ignorance of
centuries. I would like to put the proverb right: The truth is that you
are a lion forced to live in the skin of a sheep.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no need, and there is no place where you have to knock
to find the blessed one. Yes, there is a space where the blessed one is
already waiting for you – and it is within you. Neither Jesus nor
anybody else can lead you there – only you. If you revolt from being a
sheep and gather courage to roar like a lion and to move like a lion,
you will be the blessed one.</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE THE OCEAN IS YOUR GOD-SELF; IT REMAINS FOREVER UNDEFILED.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the beauty of Kahlil Gibran, that although he falls again and
again, he gets up.…</p><p><br></p><p>He lived almost his whole life in America, where the motto of every
American is: Try and try and try again! And the poor fellow is doing the
best he can, but he falls – and you have to remember this, and you have
to be very mindful, very alert, when you are reading Kahlil Gibran or
anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>A great calamity has happened to humanity. A idea has become settled
in the minds of people that if someone is right, he is always right, and
if someone is wrong he is always wrong. If somebody is a saint he is
always a saint – day out, day in; and if somebody is a sinner he is
always a sinner – day out, day in.</p><p>This is not the reality. Even sinners have moments when they are
saints, and even saints go for a holiday.</p><p><br></p><p>This calamity goes back to Aristotle, the father of Western logic,
because he accepts only two categories: either you are right or you are
wrong. He forgets that there is a possibility of many positions between
right and wrong. He has also forgotten the simple fact that you may be
right in one thing and wrong in another thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But it needs tremendous awareness – and particularly with people like
Kahlil Gibran, whose words are hypnotizing. They are almost like a
lullaby; they are very soothing, even if they are wrong. You become so
impressed by them, you lose all your interest in being alert, aware,
watchful.</p><p><br></p><p>Like the ocean is your god-self... This is true. Your being is not
confined to your bones. Your being is not confined to the bag of skin in
which you are living – you call it your body. Your being is as vast as
the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>All the rivers of the world go on bringing every kind of rubbish,
crap, dirt, dust, because they have been passing through thousands of
miles. And for millions of years they have been falling into the ocean,
but the ocean remains undefiled. This is a truth to be remembered. It
should be written in letters of gold.</p><p><br></p><p>You have done all kinds of actions, good and bad. You have been right
and wrong, you have seen all the days and all the nights of your life,
you have been to the temples and you have been to the prostitutes – but
your being remains undefiled, just as the ocean. You are so vast...
these small things don’t matter at all in the last reckoning.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say to you, never judge anybody by any small action that he
has done. Somebody has stolen, somebody has murdered, somebody has lied
– these are small actions. Don’t judge the man and his whole life on the
basis of a small action.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember the ultimate truth – that whatever you do, your
innermost core remains undefiled. There is no way to pollute your being,
to corrupt your soul. Within a second... if you become aware of your
inner being, you will be surprised: “I was condemned by everybody, I was
condemning myself, but my real being has remained untouched. It is
always virgin, always pure.”</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you a beautiful story.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a man, thousands of years before. His name was Valmik; his
profession was robbery. And if needed, he had no hesitation in killing
people. If they resisted giving him their money, their valuable things,
he had no hesitation for a single moment to kill them. He was a strong
man.</p><p><br></p><p>At that time he was not known as Valmik, he was known as Valya Bhil –
the bhils are aboriginal, primitive tribes. And who would call Valya
Bhil “Valmik”? – because Valmik means the same, but becomes respectable.
He was a robber and a murderer, and everybody knew it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very rare that people would pass through the forest where he
lived. The road had almost become unusable, because whoever passed that
way was going to be robbed or killed.</p><p>A musician, a poet, and a very beautiful man, Narada, who always,
even while moving, continued to play on a very simple musical instrument
– and remember, the more simple the instrument the more difficult it is
to create great music out of it. He used to carry a simple instrument,
an ektara – a one-stringed sitar. It is easy when there are many strings
to create music, because you can create different notes on different
strings. The ektara has only one string – that is the meaning of ektara.
Ek means one; tara means string. It has become almost the symbol of
Narada. You will not find a statue or a painting of him without his
ektara.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a master musician, and a great poet – and perhaps the only man
in India who knew the hilariousness of existence, who used to
laugh.…</p><p><br></p><p>When he was leaving, people told him: “Don’t go – otherwise you will
lose your ektara. That Valya does not care who you are, and if you try
to save your ektara you will lose your head. Better is to follow another
route, although that route is a little longer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “If I had not known I might have gone by the other
route, but now it is a challenge, between Valya and Narada. I would love
to see this man, who has made you all cowards, so afraid. Just a single
man, and the whole traffic on the road has disappeared. Must be a lion,
living in the forest... and thousands of people used to pass on this
road. Now nobody goes there; the road is closed – not for repair!”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada went, because he trusted in music more than in the
murderousness of a man. What kind of music it is that cannot transform
the murderous animal instinct in a man?</p><p><br></p><p>Valya heard the music – it was enchanting, it had a magic. And when
he saw Narada alone – with no weapons, with no possessions, just one
ektara ... the man was even more beautiful than his music. It has to be
so, because the creator of anything is always greater than his creation;
the creation cannot be greater than the creator. For the first time
Valya felt hesitant, indecisive whether to let this beautiful man pass.
But to make an exception would not be right – this was his fame, that
nobody could pass on that road without being robbed or killed.</p><p><br></p><p>So he warned the great musician and seer: “I pray to you, go back. If
you don’t go back I will have to take your possessions, whatever they
are. If you resist you may lose your life. And I don’t want to do
anything with you – neither do I want to take your instrument nor do I
want to deprive you of life. And don’t say later on that I did not warn
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Narada went on playing on his ektara. And rather than going on
the road he came and sat by the side of Valya, who was sharpening his
sword. Narada said, “You are a beautiful man; but why do you do such a
thing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What else can I do? I don’t have any education; I am an
untouchable, the lowest and most condemned class of the Hindus. I cannot
go to a temple, I cannot go in the city – but I have to look after my
wife, my old mother, my father, my children.”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “If that is the case, I would like to go to your home
and ask everybody – you are committing things which are inhuman. Who is
going to be punished for them? You are committing all those things for
your old mother and father – ask them, ‘Will you share my punishment
too?’ Ask</p><p>your wife, ask your children: ‘Whatever I am doing I am doing for you
– are you going to share my punishment?“’</p><p><br></p><p>Valya laughed, and he said, “You seem to be very clever and cunning!
I will go home and you will disappear. Nobody can cheat Valya.”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “There is no question of cheating. You can tie me with a
rope to a tree – and you know nobody comes here; I will wait. And
whatever you want to do after, you can do. But first bring me the
answer.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had never thought about it. He went home. He asked his father,
mother, his wife, his children – nobody was ready to share the
punishment. They said, “That is not our business. It is your
responsibility to take care of your family; we are not concerned with
how you are taking care. What you are doing is totally your
responsibility.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a great shock. He could not believe that the parents he loved
so much, the wife he loved so much... his own children, for whom he was
committing all kinds of crimes... flatly refused: “It is your duty to
take care of us. The question of sharing in your punishment does not
arise.”</p><p><br></p><p>He came back with tears in his eyes, untied Narada, touched his feet,
and said, “Just by a single question you have transformed me. I don’t
have a family. If they cannot share my punishment they don’t love me – I
was living in an illusion. They loved all the money that I was bringing
to them, but when the question of punishment was raised not a single one
answered that ‘I will share with you.’ Now I don’t have any family.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he threw his sword away in the forest and asked Narada, “Initiate
me so that one day I can also feel the same music and the same poetry
and the same joy that I see on your face.”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “Much is not needed – just the name of God. You have to
start chanting the name of God, RAM.”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember – this is very confusing in a way – this is not the same
name as I discussed before, the king, Rama, who behaved with his wife in
a very primitive, crude, ugly way. Ram is older than the Rama I
discussed with you – in fact he was named Rama because the name ram
existed before him. It is the Hindu equivalent of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “This will do: sit silently and repeat, ram, ram, ram,
so that all that goes on in your mind slowly slowly is replaced by Ram.
And this is the beauty of it – that once it has replaced everything, it
also disappears. In the same way you light a candle... the flame is not
possible without the candle but slowly slowly, first the flame will burn
the candle, and once the candle is finished the flame will disappear
automatically.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is something very significant. So he said, “You do simple
things. Don’t get involved in any complex thing because you are a simple
man, a courageous man. And after a few months I will be coming back to
see what is happening. If some other help is needed I will always be
available to you.”</p><p>But he was uneducated, aboriginal, a primitive man – uncivilized,
uncultured. He started with trust – because this kind of simple person
is always trusting. He started repeating, RAM... RAM... RAM... RAM...
And Narada had told him, “Go on repeating faster and faster – don’t
leave any gap between two RAM’S.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor fellow got into trouble. If you repeat, “ram, ram, ram...”
and he was uneducated, he had never heard the name. So he got mixed up;
he started repeating “Mara, Mara, Mara...” ram means God, but if you
repeat it, two Ram’s join – and the change is possible for an uneducated
man. Mara means “dying, dying, dying...”</p><p><br></p><p>But in a way it is significant, the story. If you really want to
achieve the state of godliness, the death of your ego is absolutely
necessary. So although it was just a mistake, when after three months
Narada came back, Valya was a transformed being. He was radiating light,
pulsating the whole atmosphere with a new energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Narada felt defeated. His whole life he had been repeating,
chanting, singing the name of God, playing on his musical instrument,
but his gain had not been as much as Valya’s. He was almost a light unto
himself. Around him an aura of light... Narada could not call him valya
again, because that would be disrespectful. He changed valya into
Valmik, and told him, “You have done a miracle, because the same name I
have been repeating for my whole life and just in three months you have
left me far behind. It will take lives for me to catch hold of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have not done anything except whatever you have told me.
I have been repeating, ‘mara, mara, mara...”’</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “My god! I never told you that – I told you ram.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am an uneducated man, absolutely unaware of any religion
or anything. My whole life has been just of robbery and murder. I forgot
– instead of ram the order changed; the M of ram came ahead of R.
Forgive me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said, “There is no need to forgive you. You are so innocent:
without any greed, without any desire to be rewarded in heaven, even
repeating mara, mara, you are a new man. Don’t be worried. You continue
– whatever you have been doing is right.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he said, “how can it be? What about my acts of murder? Because
I cannot count so I cannot say how many people I have murdered. What
about my robberies?”</p><p><br></p><p>Narada said to him, “Forget it all. You have reached the ocean of
your being. It is radiating all over; even a blind man may be able to
see it or, at least feel it – the joy, the fragrance. And don’t think at
all about what you have been doing. Those are small acts. Small rivers,
muddy, dirty, have fallen into the ocean, and the ocean is never made
dirty by these rivers. It remains undefiled.”</p><p><br></p><p>AND LIKE THE ETHER IT LIFTS BUT THE WINGED. EVEN LIKE THE SUN IS YOUR
GOD-SELF.</p><p>AND LIKE THE ETHER IT LIFTS BUT THE WINGED...</p><p>All that you need is wings, courage to be alone in the vast sky, with
no guide, with no map, with no roads, with no signposts, with no
milestones. It needs only courage and wings, and the whole sky is
yours.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN LIKE THE SUN IS YOUR GOD-SELF. Your innermost being, from a
different angle is like the sun. IT KNOWS NOT THE WAYS OF THE MOLE NOR
SEEKS IT THE HOLES OF THE SERPENT.</p><p><br></p><p>It rises for everyone to share, for everyone to receive fresh life
every day. But it does not know the ways of the mole, nor seeks it the
holes of the serpent. It is available – the serpent can come out of his
hole, the mole can come out of his hole.</p><p><br></p><p>Your self is also like the sun – it is available, but you are living
in a hole, different kinds of holes.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun will not knock on your doors. It is really inside you. You
have to open all the doors and all the windows so life’s fragrance
starts showering on you, so the light that you have always contained
starts radiating.</p><p><br></p><p>All these lines that have preceded, I support with my total being.
But again he says: BUT YOUR GOD-SELF DWELLS NOT ALONE IN YOUR BEING.</p><p>That too is true – whatever dwells in your being dwells in every
being. And the totality of all the beings is the ocean of consciousness.
You can call it God – I prefer the word godliness, because it is more a
quality than a thing. It is more a presence than a person.</p><p><br></p><p>MUCH IN YOU IS STILL MAN, AND MUCH IN YOU IS NOT YET MAN... Much in
you is asleep –</p><p>your manhood, your humanity. AND MUCH IN YOU IS NOT YET EVEN MAN...
your origins from the animals are also there.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the Hindus have a very beautiful conception of one of their
incarnations of God, which is half man and half animal. The whole world
has laughed about it – “what kind of stupidity is this?” But it is
simply a symbol of your inner psychology.</p><p><br></p><p>Half in you is man and half is still animal. And the trouble is, the
animal is fully awake and the man is fully asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT A SHAPELESS PYGMY THAT WALKS ASLEEP IN THE MIST, SEARCHING
FOR ITS OWN AWAKENING.</p><p><br></p><p>The man in you tries to wake up. You know sometimes in a nightmare,
you want to wake up but you cannot. You cannot open your eyes, you
cannot move your hands – as if everything has become paralyzed. The
impact of the nightmare is so much that for a few moments you are almost
dead. You will laugh about it when you wake up, but while you are asleep
you are trembling with fear – and even when you wake up you will find
the after-effects, the hangover. Your perspiration will be there – the
night may be cool but the nightmare was so dangerous that your body
accepted it as a reality. The body is blind. It started perspiring out
of fear. You will find your heart is beating louder; although you are
awake, still the nightmare’s effects can be seen. Although the elephant
has passed through the door, his tail is still inside the room.</p><p>AND OF THE MAN IN YOU WOULD I NOW SPEAK:</p><p><br></p><p>FOR IT IS HE AND NOT YOUR GOD-SELF NOR THE PYGMY IN THE MIST THAT
KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME.</p><p><br></p><p>Here he becomes hypothetical. He does not know; he himself is
groping. What he says... something is right in it and something is wrong
in it.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR IT IS HE AND NOT YOUR GOD-SELF NOR THE PYGMY IN THE MIST THAT
KNOWS CRIME AND THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME...</p><p><br></p><p>He’s dividing you in three parts: first the pygmy, the animal;
second, the man who is asleep and groping, and trying to wake up; and
third, the god-self. This division is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no god-self, only the awakened man. God-self is another name
for the awakened man. That’s why a man like Gautam Buddha said there is
no God. And you can ignore the atheists, who have never explored their
inner being, but you cannot ignore Gautam Buddha or Mahavira. Both say
there is no God.</p><p><br></p><p>To say it in other words: When God is asleep, we call him man, and
when man is awake, we call him God. The awakening of man is his
godliness; there is no other god. So division is not threefold.</p><p><br></p><p>You are divided into the animal and man – the animal has to go to
sleep and the man has to come to awakening. And both things happen
simultaneously. The awakened man you can call the god.</p><p><br></p><p>H.G. Wells was writing about the world’s history. When he came to
write about Buddha – he studied much about Buddha and was very much
puzzled: What to say about this man? What he said is so significant that
perhaps it is difficult to find another statement made in this century
which is more significant. He said about Buddha: “Gautam the Buddha is
the most godless man and yet the most godly.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need of any God if you are awake.</p><p><br></p><p>Your awakening, your enlightenment makes you laugh, that “I was
looking for God in the sky and he was hiding within me.”</p><p><br></p><p>A small story<span class=s4></span>It is just a story, but full of
meaning and juice.</p><p><br></p><p>When God created the world, he used to live in the world. But he
became tired, because from the morning on, everybody would start coming
with complaints: somebody has no child, somebody’s child is sick,
somebody’s child has died; somebody has fallen in love but the parents
are not allowing him to marry the woman... and millions are the
problems. And just one poor God! And those who could not get him in the
day would torture him in the night – he was unable even to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, he asked his advisor, “What should I do? These people will
kill me! They don’t allow me rest, and they bring a thousand and one
problems. They should solve those problems. I have given them every
capacity, intelligence, to solve all their problems but they want to
throw all responsibility</p><p>on me, thinking that ‘Why should we bother? Why did you create us in
the first place? If you created us then take care of our problems.”’</p><p><br></p><p>The advisor whispered in his ear, “There is a place where these
people will never go.” He said, “Just show it to me.”</p><p>And he said, “You just hide inside these people themselves. They will
go searching for you all over the world but they will never go inside.
You can rest, relax.” And he is resting and relaxing there.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to know whether the story is true or not, go in! Okay,
Vimal?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

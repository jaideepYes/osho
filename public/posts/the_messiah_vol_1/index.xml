Life gives unto life
13 January 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BELOVED OSHO,
YOU OFTEN SAY, “I WOULD GIVE, BUT ONLY TO THE DESERVING.”

BELOVED OSHO,
LOVE GIVES NAUGHT BUT ITSELF AND TAKES NAUGHT BUT FROM ITSELF. LOVE POSSESSES NOT NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED;
FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT UNTO LOVE.
WHEN YOU LOVE YOU SHOULD NOT SAY, “GOD IS IN MY HEART,” BUT RATHER, “I AM IN THE HEART OF GOD.”
AND THINK NOT YOU CAN DIRECT THE COURSE OF LOVE, FOR LOVE, IF IT FINDS YOU WORTHY, DIRECTS YOUR COURSE.</description>

AND SHE WAS A SEERESS.\nAND HE LOOKED UPON HER WITH EXCEEDING TENDERNESS, FOR IT WAS SHE WHO HAD FIRST SOUGHT AND BELIEVED IN HIM WHEN HE HAD BEEN BUT A DAY IN THEIR CITY.\nAND SHE HAILED HIM, SAYING:\nPROPHET OF GOD, IN QUEST OF THE UTTERMOST, LONG HAVE YOU SEARCHED THE DISTANCES FOR YOUR SHIP.\nAND NOW YOUR SHIP HAS COME, AND YOU MUST NEEDS GO.\nDEEP IS YOUR LONGING FOR THE LAND OF YOUR MEMORIES AND THE DWELLING-PLACE OF YOUR GREATER DESIRES; AND OUR LOVE WOULD NOT BIND YOU NOR OUR NEEDS HOLD YOU.\nYET THIS WE ASK ERE YOU LEAVE US, THAT YOU SPEAK TO US AND GIVE US OF YOUR TRUTH.\nAND WE WILL GIVE IT UNTO OUR CHILDREN, AND THEY UNTO THEIR CHILDREN, AND IT SHALL NOT PERISH.\nIN YOUR ALONENESS YOU HAVE WATCHED WITH OUR DAYS, AND IN YOUR WAKEFULNESS YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE WEEPING AND THE LAUGHTER OF OUR SLEEP.\nNOW THEREFORE DISCLOSE US TO OURSELVES, AND TELL US ALL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN YOU OF THAT WHICH IS BETWEEN BIRTH AND DEATH.\nAND HE ANSWERED:\nPEOPLE OF ORPHALESE, OF WHAT CAN I SPEAK SAVE OF THAT WHICH IS EVEN NOW MOVING WITHIN YOUR SOULS?\nKahlil Gibran has covered in these few words the whole spectrum of spiritual growth. First we saw the innocent people come to him – farmers, gardeners, leaving their work in their fields, rushed towards him.\nWhenever truth has arrived, the innocent are the blessed ones who recognize it. Have you ever thought about it? – not a single rabbi ever came to listen to Jesus. Strange as it may seem – because the days when Jesus lived were the highest peak of Jewish wisdom and Jerusalem had the most learned, scholarly rabbis of any city in the world.\nThe people who came to listen to Jesus were uneducated, uncultured – farmers, fishermen, gardeners, carpenters. Amongst his apostles, none was from the higher strata of the society. None was a brahmin, none was a pundit, none was a professor.\nJerusalem was the seat of the Jewish university; people traveled from faraway lands to Judea to be educated in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was at the very peak of its youth. But none of these learned people came to listen to Jesus. The reason? – because they believed they knew it all. They have read all the scriptures, they are acquainted with all the wise sayings of the past. Their memories were full, but memory is not intelligence.\nIn fact, the more knowledgeable you become, the less is the possibility of your ever becoming intelligent enough to discover yourself. Your knowledge does not give you your real being, it only creates a pseudo ego – and the egoist cannot go to a carpenter’s son, Jesus – who knows nothing because he has no certificates.\nOnly one man... and because he was the only one, his name is still remembered. He was a professor in the university; Nicodemus was his name. But even he could not gather courage enough to come to Jesus in full daylight. He was afraid – “What will people say?” He is a professor of religion and he goes and asks questions to an uneducated young man who has never seen the scriptures? Hence he went in the middle of the night, when everyone was asleep; even Jesus’ intimate apostles were asleep. He woke up Jesus, introduced himself – “I am a professor of religion in the university; Nicodemus is my name. Please forgive me for disturbing your sleep.”\nJesus said to him, “Don’t be worried about it, because I will disturb your far deeper sleep. But you are a coward and on this path, cowards cannot move. It needs guts – and the first symbol of a courageous man is to recognize that he knows not, that all his knowledge is borrowed, that he is repeating words of others, that he has never entered into silences of his own soul, that he is blind.”\nThe very recognition is a great beginning. The moment you recognize that you do not know, you are already moving towards the path that leads to knowing. In the scriptures are only dead words; a true seeker cannot be satisfied with them. He would like to come in contact while the word is still alive, blood and flesh.\nScriptures are needed by those who cannot encounter a man like Jesus, because he is going to hit them hard to make them aware: “All that you have learned has been learned in sleep, and all that you have been repeating is mechanical. It is not your own experience.”\nTruth can only be experienced. Only lies can be learned. Millions of libraries are full of lies – beautiful lies. Not that they were always lies... once they were also alive, once they were also uttered by someone who had found them. In that moment, the word has wings. In that moment, the word is full of silence, love, beauty, truth.\nBut all that fragrance of the living word will disappear soon – the flower will die, the petals will disappear into the earth. Not even a trace will be left behind. But faraway echoes will go on and on, in scriptures collected by scholars, commented on by researchers. But whatever they are doing is dissecting a corpse, and by dissecting a corpse you cannot find the soul.\nWhat medical science goes on doing, idiots have been doing since the very beginning. In every medical college, they are dissecting corpses to find what it is that we call life. Can you think of people more blind? And they are very learned. And because they cannot find the living principle of life in a corpse, they deny it.\nIt is very easy to deny, it is very easy to say no. You can do it sitting in your chair, no pilgrimage is needed. But to find, to seek and search, you will have to move into the unknown without any prejudice. And all knowledge that is borrowed, creates only prejudice and nothing else.\nAn intelligent man puts all his knowledge aside and becomes an innocent child – who knows nothing but who is open, available, receptive; whose eyes are full of wonder, who is mystified by small things. A seashell on the beach, a wildflower which attracts nobody, mystifies him. He is living in a wonderland. It is not only Alice who entered wonderland; every child lives in wonderland.\nAnd that’s what Jesus said to Nicodemus. Unless you are born again in this very life, unless you become a child again, there is no hope for you.\nWhen Almustafa saw the people coming... they were all innocent people – not rabbis, not popes, not professors; no shankaracharyas, no ayatollahs, but simple people, who knew that they knew not. But that is the beginning of an eternal journey in which one goes on disappearing. One day one finds the truth, but one does not find oneself. The seeker is lost and the sought is found. The knower is no more, but knowledge, knowing has blossomed.\nAnd others came also... who are these “others”?\nAND OTHERS CAME ALSO AND ENTREATED HIM, BUT HE ANSWERED THEM NOT.\nThese “others” are the presidents, the prime ministers, the governors, the police commissioners – all types of blind and deaf people. Seeing that the whole city of Orphalese is rushing towards that mad guy, Almustafa.These so-called leaders of men are really followers of the crowd, because it is the\ncrowd that gives them power. Wherever the crowd is going, the leader pretends that he’s leading them. He goes on watching to see whether the crowd is behind him or not. All the leaders are just followers of their own followers. It is because of these people that the world remains miserable, insane, stupid.\nAND OTHERS CAME.Almustafa had answered the innocent people who were telling him, “Forgive\nus; we had been seeing you, yet we have seen your face for the first time. And what a calamity that this is the day of your departure – and you have been amongst us for twelve years and we simply thought you were a dreamer of dreams. Forgive us. Don’t go away, be with us a little more. Share your truth with us; now we are ready.”\nBut then the blind, the deaf, the knowledgeable arrived. And because all the simple people and their crowd were so much impressed by the very presence of Almustafa, they also entreated him, but this was hypocrisy. Those questions were not authentic; they were not coming from their own hearts. They were just showing the people that “not only have you recognized him, we have also recognized him.” They always want to convince people that “We are ahead of you.”\nBut Almustafa is not deceived, cannot be deceived.\n... BUT HE ANSWERED THEM NOT. On the contrary, HE ONLY BENT HIS HEAD; AND THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR SAW HIS TEARS FALLING UPON HIS BREAST.\nThose tears are his answer to these people who are still pretending. At the moment of departure – when the uncultured, uncivilized, uneducated and the poor have recognized – still they cannot recognize, they cannot see. Power blinds. Knowledge blinds.\nHe is crying, tears are falling on his chest, out of compassion – “What kind of people are leading the world?”\nThe governor of California wanted to meet me. He sent a messenger. I said, “I am available. Rather than sending you, he should have come himself. What prevents him? If I wanted to see him, I would have gone and knocked on his door; it is just the right thing to do. He should come and knock on my door. Everybody is welcome.”\nThe woman who had come with the message said, “But he is a governor.”\nI said, “He may be God – then too, if he wants to meet me, he has to come.”\nBut power, prestige, respectabilityOne president of India, Jakirhussain, sent a message with one\nof the oldest members of parliament, Seth Govinddas – I was the guest of Seth Govinddas. He tried to persuade me.\nI said, “Forget it. If he wants to see me and meet me, I’m available, but I don’t have any business to go to the president’s house.”\nHe said, “You don’t understand, he can be of immense help.”\nI said, “In my whole life, I have only trusted in existence, not in anybody’s help.”\nIn fact it was a problem for him, because if he had succeeded in taking me to the president, he would have obliged the president. But my simple refusal... he said, “How am I going to convey it to him?”\nI said, “Repeat my words exactly, that it is the thirsty who comes to the well, it is not the well who runs after thirsty people. The thirsty person may be the president, it doesn’t matter. Beggar or emperor, whoever is thirsty has to come to the well.”\nI have also wept, because I have also come across so many blind people. Even my own sannyasins have sometimes tried to persuade me – “If the governor or the prime minister or the president is favorable to you, then these small guys, police commissioners, etc., will not harass you. On the contrary, they will welcome you.”\nI said, “I am not a businessman.”\nMy father used to tell me many times: “You know perfectly well that it is not good to sleep and cover your head and face under the blanket. It is not hygienic.”\nI said, “I know. But I don’t have any other time for my tears.”\nIn the darkness of the night, covered under the blanket, I can cry and weep to my heart’s content, seeing all kinds of stupidities happening all around, all over the world.\nAnd if you tell these people, “You are the cause of making the earth a hell,” they are annoyed, they are irritated. They become revengeful. Now, at least I can claim one thing, that nobody in the whole history of man has had so many enemies as I have. This is some great distinction. And I have not harmed anybody.\nAll my efforts have been to wake you, to deliver a message that I am carrying in my heart, to share my silence and my bliss. And people are annoyed, irritated. Almost all the countries of the world have decided that I cannot enter in their lands. I was thinking that perhaps my own country would behave in a different way, but I was wrong. Idiots are idiots. Whether they are American or Indian makes no difference.\nI was in Bombay. One leader, a president of some powerful political group, wrote a letter to the chief minister and sent a copy to me. The letter was to tell the chief minister that my presence in Bombay would pollute the atmosphere.\nI said, “My God, can anyone pollute Bombay? The worst city in the whole world.” For four months\nI was there; I never went out even one time. I never even looked out of my window. I remained in a completely closed room – still, you can smell.as if you are sitting in a toilet! This is Bombay.\nI started thinking of how to pollute it more but I am sorry to confess, I could not find any way. It is too far gone.\nAnd then pressure was brought on one of my sannyasins in whose home I was a guest for four months: if I’m not removed from his house, he, his family and his house, with me, will be burned.\nOne sometimes wonders whether to cry or to laugh.\nSomebody was continuously phoning every day – “When are you coming to Poona? I am a police officer and I am inquiring about it to give you protection.” We inquired of the Bombay police, we inquired of the Poona police. They said, “We have not been phoning you. Somebody is pretending to be a police officer.”\nI was going to come last Sunday, but my host became so much concerned that he asked for protection from the police. On Saturday night, the police informed him, “We can give you protection up to Thana. Beyond that you will have to ask another district, up to Chinchwad; from Chinchwad you will have to ask the Chinchwad police for protection up to Poona.”\nI told him, “You don’t be worried. Rather than asking for protection from these people... I know their protection.”\nHe said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “When I was arrested in America, I was handcuffed, a heavy chain around my waist, chains on my feet. I could not even walk. And they were afraid that people would be there all over the street, and I may raise my hands, so they put another chain that connected my handcuffs to the chain around my waist so I could not move my hands. And they rushed so madly in their car... and the reason was that people were all around and they were waving and giving me the sign of victory. Then I understood why they were in such a hurry. Photographers were all around, press people were all around, and if they see that people are greeting me and they have arrested me without any arrest warrant, it will look like the whole talk about democracy is simply nonsense. The continuous propaganda about individuality, freedom of expression, is just to deceive the whole world.”\nThe U.S. Marshal who was sitting in front in the car taking me inside the jail, told me, “Here, you are absolutely protected.”\nI said, “What about you? If being handcuffed, chained, is protection – then first give it to your president, to your governors, because their lives are in constant danger. In America, twenty percent of the presidents have been assassinated. It is not a small number. Keep all your presidents in jail! But don’t talk nonsense to me.”\nTo avoid the police protection – because I have seen the police protection – rather than moving from Bombay on Sunday, I moved on Saturday night. My host was not convinced, but the next morning, he was convinced because his house was surrounded by fifteen policemen with guns.\nHe had come with me. His family informed him that “Police are surrounding the house. We are almost under arrest, and we are telling them that Osho left last night.” And they told the police, “Your\nprotection was asked – but then he was leaving at twelve o’clock today. Why have you arrived in the morning, with guns? And we had asked only for six police officers, without uniforms – why a whole regiment?”\nThey remained there the whole day thinking that I would leave at twelve. Finally, they thought that perhaps I was not in the house. Then the chief said to the son of my sannyasin, “Osho bluffed us.”\nStrange – we had asked for protection. If we don’t want it, you cannot impose it upon us – “We will protect you whether you want it or not.” Where does the question of bluffing arise?\nI reached here at four o’clock in the night, and within three hours the police were here. I was asleep. As I opened my eyes, I saw two policemen in my bedroom.\nI said, “I never see dreams, particularly nightmares. How have these dodos managed to come inside?” I asked, “Do you have any search warrant?” – they didn’t have – “Then how have you entered my private bedroom?”\nThey said, “We have to serve a notice on you.” Sometimes one wonders whether we use words in our sleep. Is this the way to serve a notice? Is this the way to be a servant of the people? All these are servants of the people; we pay them. They should behave like servants... but they behave like masters.\nI said, “I have not committed any crime. I have just slept for three hours, is it a crime?”\nOne of them said, “You are a controversial person and the police commissioner feels your presence may provoke violence in the city.”\nNow these people are not even aware that I was here for seven years, and no violence was provoked by me in the city – what more evidence do you want? On the contrary, a man from this city has tried to kill me, to assassinate me – in front of ten thousand sannyasins and twenty police officers, he threw a dagger at me in a morning discourse. It was almost impossible to lose the case even if we wanted to lose. Ten thousand eye-witnesses you cannot find for any such case – and twenty police officers!\nStill the case was dismissed, that it never happened. These are our magistrates, this is our police. These are our police commissioners. If they wanted to keep the silence of the city, they should have thrown out that man who tried to assassinate me.\nBut the next day when my attorney went to see the commissioner, he was surprised. On his calendar of appointments was the name of the same man; it seemed he was behind the whole thing. And I have been here for two days, and still violence has not happened in the city.\nIn seven years while I was here, I entered your city only four times. I never left the ashram. And those four times were absolutely necessary. I had not gone to see a film. My father was dying in the hospital, that’s why I had to go. One of my sannyasins was in a hospital in a coma, and I had to go. All four times I had gone only to the hospital to see someone who was dying – and died. Sitting in my room, how could I have created violence in the city?\nAnd on the notice... I said “Read it. What is my crime?” My crime is that I am controversial. But can you tell me – has there ever been a man of any intelligence who was not controversial? To be controversial is not a crime. In fact, the whole evolution of human consciousness depends on controversial people: Socrates, Jesus, Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, Bodhidharma, Zarathustra. They were fortunate that none of them entered Poona.\nThis city is condemned, because this city murdered Mahatma Gandhi, this city tried to murder me... and they are trying to tell me that I am controversial and dangerous. They are not even ashamed. Mahatma Gandhi was murdered by the same group of people who have tried to assassinate me. For centuries to come, Poona will be remembered as a city of murderers.\nBecause he had no reasonable cause... otherwise, you would have seen me again handcuffed and in jail, because I have done something which is unprecedented. That police officer misbehaved. I was lying down on my bed and he throws the notice over my face! I cannot tolerate such subhuman behavior. I immediately tore up the notice and threw it away, and I told those police officers, “Go and tell your commissioner.”\nI know that a notice from the government should not be thrown away, but there are limits! First, the law has to show humanity and respect for human beings. Only then can it expect respect from others. And these are our servants; we pay the tax. And they have become masters.\nIt was right of Almustafa not to answer them; they don’t deserve. But I am a different kind of man than Almustafa.\nHe only bent his head... I will never do that. You can cut my head but I will not bend my head. And those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.\nYes, I also weep and cry for humanity, but I am crying in the darkness, covering myself. I don’t want you to see my tears, because my tears will be painful to you. My tears will be like wounds to you. You have seen only my songs... but my eyes also have tear glands.\nBut those tears are for the blind and the deaf, the heartless. Those tears are for all categories of idiots.\nPoona can brag about one thing: you have the highest category of idiots in the world. And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple.\nEach statement by Kahlil Gibran is significant. Why towards the temple? All over the world there are thousands and thousands of temples and churches and mosques and gurudwaras and synagogues – and people go there to pray. Their prayers are like parrots repeating words; they do not even know the meaning of those words.\nNo, the function of the temple is totally different. The function of the temple is, when somebody arrives home like Almustafa, then the temple is the place to declare it. Almustafa entering into a temple, the temple becomes sacred. But without Almustafa, a temple is just a house – empty, meaningless.\nAnd he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple. You should enter the temple only when you deserve, when you have earned, when you feel you have something to share; something sacred and something of the beyond.\nAnd there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra. And she was a seeress.\nBy the way, I want you to remember that Kahlil Gibran is perhaps one of those very few people for whom the woman is closer to the sacred than the man, for the simple reason that she is more heart than head. She knows how to love. And if you don’t know how to love, how can you know how to pray?\nPrayer is nothing but the most refined form of love. A love unaddressed to anybody, a love for the whole.\nAlmitra was a seeress. Kahlil Gibran should be remembered forever as one who gives respect and dignity to women. All your so-called bogus religious leaders of the world have only condemned the woman. Even the greatest of them, for whom I have great respect, but with reservations – even Gautam Buddha who is certainly the highest peak ever attained up to now, the Everest. Even he was not respectful towards women. For years he continuously refused to initiate any women. And finally, after twenty years of continual refusal, continual insult, humiliation, he reconsidered. Because of a strange situation, he had to concede and accept women initiates. He must have been very reluctant even in that moment. He had to agree because the woman was almost his real mother... because his mother died when he was born, immediately. His own mother never saw him; neither had he any remembrance of his mother.\nHis mother’s younger sister remained unmarried just because she wanted to take care of this rare child, who had a charisma from the very beginning. And astrologers and prophets declared that either he would become an emperor of the whole world or he would renounce the world and become the greatest awakened man humanity has known.\nThis woman brought up the child, cared about him – and sacrificed her own life, for the simple reason that if she got married, she would have her own children and would have to divide her caring and become involved in her own life, her children, her husband. No, she remained unmarried so that she could shower all her love on Gautam Buddha.\nWhen that old woman, who could be said to be really his mother, came and asked to be initiated, there was a great silence, a great moment of hesitation. Twenty years of continual refusal... but how can he refuse this woman – -who has sacrificed her whole life for him, and he cannot do even this much for her, to initiate her into sannyas? Reluctantly, I say, he initiated her. And why do I say “reluctantly”? – because immediately afterwards he declared, “My religion was going to last for five thousand years. Now it will last for only five hundred years because a woman has entered into the fold.” As if a woman is a disease, as if Buddha’s religion is no longer healthy enough to remain alive for five thousand years. The entry of a woman seems to mean that his religion has grown a cancer.\nUgly is the statement – and the same is the case with Mahavira, the same is the case with Jesus, the same is the case with Mohammed. The same is the case with Moses. And these are our highest flights towards the stars.\nKahlil Gibran seems to have a far more human and far deeper insight. There have been seers in all the religions, but Almitra is a seeress. And the reason he gives has to be understood very deeply and preserved in the deepest part of your being:\nAND HE LOOKED UPON HER WITH EXCEEDING TENDERNESS, FOR IT WAS SHE WHO HAD FIRST SOUGHT AND BELIEVED IN HIM WHEN HE HAD BEEN BUT A DAY IN THEIR CITY.\nFor twelve years he had been in the city and she was the only one who recognized him – even on the first day when he entered the city.\nPeople go on asking me, “Why do you have so many sannyasins in the bodies of women?” – as if sannyas has anything to do with the body. In what way is sannyas concerned with the body?\nSannyas is a concern with the soul. And the woman is more open and more available because she knows not logic, but love. And the law of love is the highest law in life; the laws based on logic are the lowest.\nA man needs first to be intellectually convinced. I have millions of sannyasins – certainly, seventy- five percent are women, twenty-five percent are men. This is a rare phenomenon, because Buddha, or Mahavira, or Mohammed, Jesus – nobody allowed them.\nA man first needs to be logically convinced; he begins from the lowest. And then it is long ladder to reach to the ardor of love. Love is absolutely beyond logic, transcendental to logic. Even my own sannyasins – first they are convinced: this man seems to be right; whatever he is saying seems to be substantial. They raise all kinds of doubts in their minds, they try in every way to be skeptical. When finally their skepticism and their doubts are destroyed, then a thick layer of intellectuality is removed and their heart is available.\nBut the woman first falls in love with me and then she thinks, “Whatever he’s saying is bound to be right. How can love be wrong?”\nTheir approaches are different. Man has chosen a long route – unnecessarily, but it looks like more manly, arduous, hard – -and he will go on a long journey to come back home.\nThe woman has chosen the shortcut – the path of love – it is only one step. It does not need even the second step. One step and you have arrived. That too I am saying because it will be difficult to understand if I say exactly what happens: it is not even one step.\nMan takes many many steps, miles and miles, just to come back home – tired, exhausted, sad.\nThat’s why saints look so sad. What do you call them in England? – hangdog faces. Nice people, but unnecessarily running in all directions to find the place where they have always been.\nSo to say the absolute truth, the woman does not take even a single step. It is truth that takes a step towards the woman; the woman simply falls in love and the home has arrived. She has been there, the love has just opened her eyes.\nAlmitra was the first to recognize that Almustafa belongs to the other shore, he’s a stranger here. He’s not dreaming about a ship – he is so lovely, so beautiful, that she cannot doubt even if he is dreaming. In her deep love, his dream becomes a reality. The ship that would arrive twelve years afterwards had arrived for Almitra the very first day. Those twelve years’ distance do not exist for her.\nPeople ask me why so many women become sannyasins. It is simple: because they are women, because they are hearts, because they know only one language and that language is of love.\nAnd she hailed him, saying... and you can see the difference. The people who have recognized on the last day when they saw the separation was going to happen, suddenly became aware that they have missed – amongst them was a man, a messiah, a message from the other shore. But they were simply deaf and blind, and now it is too late.\nSo they are saying, “Linger on a little more... just a little more. We have not been able to taste your truth and we have not been able to drink from your eyes. Shower your grace a little more.”\nBut Almitra says something totally different:\nPROPHET OF GOD, IN THE QUEST OF THE UTTERMOST, LONG HAVE YOU SEARCHED THE DISTANCES FOR YOUR SHIP.\nAND NOW YOUR SHIP HAS COME, AND YOU MUST NEEDS GO.\nOnly love can see it.\nThe mind is greedy. Mind is greed.\nAll those people who are saying, “Linger on a little”... I say unto you, if Almustafa agrees with them, they will forget all about him again. Again they will take him for granted – “What is the hurry? And if the ship comes again, we can persuade him to remain with us.”\nMan lives in tomorrows which never come. Mind has no contact with the present; either it lives in the past or it lives in the future.\nThey are shocked: they could not recognize and twelve years have passed – what a loss! And they can also see that if he remains, perhaps tomorrow or the day after tomorrow they may be able to understand his truth, his experience.\nBut I repeat again: If Almustafa remains with them, they will forget him again.\nBut Almitra says to him, “It is hard, it hurts, but there is no other way. You have waited long, you have given opportunity enough to these people. Now You must needs go.\nDEEP IS YOUR LONGING FOR THE LAND OF YOUR MEMORIES AND THE DWELLING-PLACE OF YOUR GREATER DESIRES; AND OUR LOVE WOULD NOT BIND YOU NOR OUR NEEDS HOLD YOU.\nThat’s the beauty of love, that it gives you freedom. That is the criterion of whether there is love or not. If love prevents you from your growth, it is not love. Love may suffer but will not be jealous, love may suffer but will not be a bondage.\nAlmitra says, and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you. We need you, certainly we need you, but you have been here twelve years – it is enough. We have ignored you, perhaps people are not thirsty. So you don’t pay any attention to people’s prayer that you remain with us. I know – Deep is your longing for the land, your love for the people but whatever you could do, you have done. We would like you to be here, but love would not bind you – we need you, but it is our unconsciousness that we missed you – nor our needs hold you.\nYet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.\nWe don’t want you to be here, we don’t want to become a prison to you because of our needs and because of our love and because of your compassion. But at least do this much before you leave: speak to us and give us of your truth.\nRemember, truth is always individual. There is no truth of the collective mind, of the crowd. The crowd has only lies – Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism.\nThe crowd has only lies.\nThe truth is always individual.\nIt is experienced in the very innermost core of your being – where you cannot take anybody with you. You cannot take the person you love, you cannot take your friend with you. You have to go alone, and only in your aloneness is the realization. And because the realization happens in the individual, there is no need of any religion, organized.\nYes, religiousness is needed – unorganized, available to each individual according to his own potential, possibilities.\nA real human society, a real civilization will allow every individual to seek and search and find his truth. Gautam Buddha’s truth is of no use to you. My truth is of no use to you. At the most, the man who has realized the truth can give you a certainty that truth is not just a hypothesis; that it is a reality, that it transforms people.\nI cannot give you my truth, but my presence can trigger a journey in you towards the ultimate shrine.\nBut a woman thinks in a different way than a man, because her thinking is not based on thoughts. Her thinking is based on feelings. Why is she saying it? Because she says:\nAnd we will give it unto our children It is not greed.\nAnd they unto their children,\nAnd it shall not perish.\nWe want your flame to remain alive. We will go on passing it from heart to heart.\nIn your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.\nShe’s saying, “Whatever you have watched, we were laughing in our sleep, we were talking in our sleep, we were acting, doing things in our sleep. We were not aware what was going on.”\nNow therefore disclose us to ourselves... We don’t ask anything more. Just disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.\nA tremendously potent question: What is between birth and death? That is your life principle – between birth and death is God – but because you are asleep, you never become aware of it. You are born and you will die, and without knowing what was between the two. And between the two was your truth.\nAnd he answered:\nPEOPLE OF ORPHALESE, OF WHAT CAN I SPEAK SAVE OF THAT WHICH IS EVEN NOW MOVING WITHIN YOUR SOULS?\nEvery master simply wakes you up to your own reality, to your own truth. He does not give you anything.\nYou already have it. You have just not looked inwards.\nA little silence, a little meditativeness and you will start uncovering yourself. Truth is a discovery within.\nAlmustafa is right when he says...of what can i speak save of that which is even now moving within your own souls? I can see the flame but you don’t look inwards. Just close your eyes, look inwards. Go on digging deeper and deeper until you have come to the waters of eternal life.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6288","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_messiah_vol_1/>The Messiah, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 Disclose us to ourselves</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6288 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Messiah_Vol_1/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

NOW MOVING WITHIN YOUR SOULS?</p><p><br></p><p>Kahlil Gibran has covered in these few words the whole spectrum of
spiritual growth. First we saw the innocent people come to him –
farmers, gardeners, leaving their work in their fields, rushed towards
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever truth has arrived, the innocent are the blessed ones who
recognize it. Have you ever thought about it? – not a single rabbi ever
came to listen to Jesus. Strange as it may seem – because the days when
Jesus lived were the highest peak of Jewish wisdom and Jerusalem had the
most learned, scholarly rabbis of any city in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who came to listen to Jesus were uneducated, uncultured –
farmers, fishermen, gardeners, carpenters. Amongst his apostles, none
was from the higher strata of the society. None was a brahmin, none was
a pundit, none was a professor.</p><p><br></p><p>Jerusalem was the seat of the Jewish university; people traveled from
faraway lands to Judea to be educated in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was at the
very peak of its youth. But none of these learned people came to listen
to Jesus. The reason? – because they believed they knew it all. They
have read all the scriptures, they are acquainted with all the wise
sayings of the past. Their memories were full, but memory is not
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the more knowledgeable you become, the less is the
possibility of your ever becoming intelligent enough to discover
yourself. Your knowledge does not give you your real being, it only
creates a pseudo ego – and the egoist cannot go to a carpenter’s son,
Jesus – who knows nothing because he has no certificates.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one man... and because he was the only one, his name is still
remembered. He was a professor in the university; Nicodemus was his
name. But even he could not gather courage enough to come to Jesus in
full daylight. He was afraid – “What will people say?” He is a professor
of religion and he goes and asks questions to an uneducated young man
who has never seen the scriptures? Hence he went in the middle of the
night, when everyone was asleep; even Jesus’ intimate apostles were
asleep. He woke up Jesus, introduced himself – “I am a professor of
religion in the university; Nicodemus is my name. Please forgive me for
disturbing your sleep.”</p><p>Jesus said to him, “Don’t be worried about it, because I will disturb
your far deeper sleep. But you are a coward and on this path, cowards
cannot move. It needs guts – and the first symbol of a courageous man is
to recognize that he knows not, that all his knowledge is borrowed, that
he is repeating words of others, that he has never entered into silences
of his own soul, that he is blind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The very recognition is a great beginning. The moment you recognize
that you do not know, you are already moving towards the path that leads
to knowing. In the scriptures are only dead words; a true seeker cannot
be satisfied with them. He would like to come in contact while the word
is still alive, blood and flesh.</p><p><br></p><p>Scriptures are needed by those who cannot encounter a man like Jesus,
because he is going to hit them hard to make them aware: “All that you
have learned has been learned in sleep, and all that you have been
repeating is mechanical. It is not your own experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>Truth can only be experienced. Only lies can be learned. Millions of
libraries are full of lies – beautiful lies. Not that they were always
lies... once they were also alive, once they were also uttered by
someone who had found them. In that moment, the word has wings. In that
moment, the word is full of silence, love, beauty, truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But all that fragrance of the living word will disappear soon – the
flower will die, the petals will disappear into the earth. Not even a
trace will be left behind. But faraway echoes will go on and on, in
scriptures collected by scholars, commented on by researchers. But
whatever they are doing is dissecting a corpse, and by dissecting a
corpse you cannot find the soul.</p><p><br></p><p>What medical science goes on doing, idiots have been doing since the
very beginning. In every medical college, they are dissecting corpses to
find what it is that we call life. Can you think of people more blind?
And they are very learned. And because they cannot find the living
principle of life in a corpse, they deny it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to deny, it is very easy to say no. You can do it
sitting in your chair, no pilgrimage is needed. But to find, to seek and
search, you will have to move into the unknown without any prejudice.
And all knowledge that is borrowed, creates only prejudice and nothing
else.</p><p><br></p><p>An intelligent man puts all his knowledge aside and becomes an
innocent child – who knows nothing but who is open, available,
receptive; whose eyes are full of wonder, who is mystified by small
things. A seashell on the beach, a wildflower which attracts nobody,
mystifies him. He is living in a wonderland. It is not only Alice who
entered wonderland; every child lives in wonderland.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what Jesus said to Nicodemus. Unless you are born again in
this very life, unless you become a child again, there is no hope for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>When Almustafa saw the people coming... they were all innocent people
– not rabbis, not popes, not professors; no shankaracharyas, no
ayatollahs, but simple people, who knew that they knew not. But that is
the beginning of an eternal journey in which one goes on disappearing.
One day one finds the truth, but one does not find oneself. The seeker
is lost and the sought is found. The knower is no more, but knowledge,
knowing has blossomed.</p><p><br></p><p>And others came also... who are these “others”?</p><p>AND OTHERS CAME ALSO AND ENTREATED HIM, BUT HE ANSWERED THEM NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>These “others” are the presidents, the prime ministers, the
governors, the police commissioners – all types of blind and deaf
people. Seeing that the whole city of Orphalese is rushing towards that
mad guy, Almustafa.<span class=s4></span>These so-called leaders of
men are really followers of the crowd, because it is the</p><p>crowd that gives them power. Wherever the crowd is going, the leader
pretends that he’s leading them. He goes on watching to see whether the
crowd is behind him or not. All the leaders are just followers of their
own followers. It is because of these people that the world remains
miserable, insane, stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>AND OTHERS CAME.<span class=s4></span>Almustafa had answered the
innocent people who were telling him, “Forgive</p><p>us; we had been seeing you, yet we have seen your face for the first
time. And what a calamity that this is the day of your departure – and
you have been amongst us for twelve years and we simply thought you were
a dreamer of dreams. Forgive us. Don’t go away, be with us a little
more. Share your truth with us; now we are ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>But then the blind, the deaf, the knowledgeable arrived. And because
all the simple people and their crowd were so much impressed by the very
presence of Almustafa, they also entreated him, but this was hypocrisy.
Those questions were not authentic; they were not coming from their own
hearts. They were just showing the people that “not only have you
recognized him, we have also recognized him.” They always want to
convince people that “We are ahead of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Almustafa is not deceived, cannot be deceived.</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT HE ANSWERED THEM NOT. On the contrary, HE ONLY BENT HIS HEAD;
AND THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR SAW HIS TEARS FALLING UPON HIS BREAST.</p><p><br></p><p>Those tears are his answer to these people who are still pretending.
At the moment of departure – when the uncultured, uncivilized,
uneducated and the poor have recognized – still they cannot recognize,
they cannot see. Power blinds. Knowledge blinds.</p><p><br></p><p>He is crying, tears are falling on his chest, out of compassion –
“What kind of people are leading the world?”</p><p><br></p><p>The governor of California wanted to meet me. He sent a messenger. I
said, “I am available. Rather than sending you, he should have come
himself. What prevents him? If I wanted to see him, I would have gone
and knocked on his door; it is just the right thing to do. He should
come and knock on my door. Everybody is welcome.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman who had come with the message said, “But he is a
governor.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “He may be God – then too, if he wants to meet me, he has to
come.”</p><p><br></p><p>But power, prestige, respectability<span class=s4></span>One
president of India, Jakirhussain, sent a message with one</p><p>of the oldest members of parliament, Seth Govinddas – I was the guest
of Seth Govinddas. He tried to persuade me.</p><p>I said, “Forget it. If he wants to see me and meet me, I’m available,
but I don’t have any business to go to the president’s house.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t understand, he can be of immense help.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “In my whole life, I have only trusted in existence, not in
anybody’s help.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it was a problem for him, because if he had succeeded in
taking me to the president, he would have obliged the president. But my
simple refusal... he said, “How am I going to convey it to him?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Repeat my words exactly, that it is the thirsty who comes to
the well, it is not the well who runs after thirsty people. The thirsty
person may be the president, it doesn’t matter. Beggar or emperor,
whoever is thirsty has to come to the well.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have also wept, because I have also come across so many blind
people. Even my own sannyasins have sometimes tried to persuade me – “If
the governor or the prime minister or the president is favorable to you,
then these small guys, police commissioners, etc., will not harass you.
On the contrary, they will welcome you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not a businessman.”</p><p><br></p><p>My father used to tell me many times: “You know perfectly well that
it is not good to sleep and cover your head and face under the blanket.
It is not hygienic.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I know. But I don’t have any other time for my tears.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the darkness of the night, covered under the blanket, I can cry
and weep to my heart’s content, seeing all kinds of stupidities
happening all around, all over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you tell these people, “You are the cause of making the earth
a hell,” they are annoyed, they are irritated. They become revengeful.
Now, at least I can claim one thing, that nobody in the whole history of
man has had so many enemies as I have. This is some great distinction.
And I have not harmed anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>All my efforts have been to wake you, to deliver a message that I am
carrying in my heart, to share my silence and my bliss. And people are
annoyed, irritated. Almost all the countries of the world have decided
that I cannot enter in their lands. I was thinking that perhaps my own
country would behave in a different way, but I was wrong. Idiots are
idiots. Whether they are American or Indian makes no difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in Bombay. One leader, a president of some powerful political
group, wrote a letter to the chief minister and sent a copy to me. The
letter was to tell the chief minister that my presence in Bombay would
pollute the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “My God, can anyone pollute Bombay? The worst city in the
whole world.<span class=s4></span>” For four months</p><p>I was there; I never went out even one time. I never even looked out
of my window. I remained in a completely closed room – still, you can
smell.<span class=s4></span>as if you are sitting in a toilet! This is
Bombay.</p><p>I started thinking of how to pollute it more but I am sorry to
confess, I could not find any way. It is too far gone.</p><p><br></p><p>And then pressure was brought on one of my sannyasins in whose home I
was a guest for four months: if I’m not removed from his house, he, his
family and his house, with me, will be burned.</p><p><br></p><p>One sometimes wonders whether to cry or to laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody was continuously phoning every day – “When are you coming to
Poona? I am a police officer and I am inquiring about it to give you
protection.” We inquired of the Bombay police, we inquired of the Poona
police. They said, “We have not been phoning you. Somebody is pretending
to be a police officer.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was going to come last Sunday, but my host became so much concerned
that he asked for protection from the police. On Saturday night, the
police informed him, “We can give you protection up to Thana. Beyond
that you will have to ask another district, up to Chinchwad; from
Chinchwad you will have to ask the Chinchwad police for protection up to
Poona.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “You don’t be worried. Rather than asking for protection
from these people... I know their protection.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “When I was arrested in America, I was handcuffed, a heavy
chain around my waist, chains on my feet. I could not even walk. And
they were afraid that people would be there all over the street, and I
may raise my hands, so they put another chain that connected my
handcuffs to the chain around my waist so I could not move my hands. And
they rushed so madly in their car... and the reason was that people were
all around and they were waving and giving me the sign of victory. Then
I understood why they were in such a hurry. Photographers were all
around, press people were all around, and if they see that people are
greeting me and they have arrested me without any arrest warrant, it
will look like the whole talk about democracy is simply nonsense. The
continuous propaganda about individuality, freedom of expression, is
just to deceive the whole world.”</p><p><br></p><p>The U.S. Marshal who was sitting in front in the car taking me inside
the jail, told me, “Here, you are absolutely protected.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What about you? If being handcuffed, chained, is protection
– then first give it to your president, to your governors, because their
lives are in constant danger. In America, twenty percent of the
presidents have been assassinated. It is not a small number. Keep all
your presidents in jail! But don’t talk nonsense to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>To avoid the police protection – because I have seen the police
protection – rather than moving from Bombay on Sunday, I moved on
Saturday night. My host was not convinced, but the next morning, he was
convinced because his house was surrounded by fifteen policemen with
guns.</p><p><br></p><p>He had come with me. His family informed him that “Police are
surrounding the house. We are almost under arrest, and we are telling
them that Osho left last night.” And they told the police, “Your</p><p>protection was asked – but then he was leaving at twelve o’clock
today. Why have you arrived in the morning, with guns? And we had asked
only for six police officers, without uniforms – why a whole
regiment?”</p><p><br></p><p>They remained there the whole day thinking that I would leave at
twelve. Finally, they thought that perhaps I was not in the house. Then
the chief said to the son of my sannyasin, “Osho bluffed us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Strange – we had asked for protection. If we don’t want it, you
cannot impose it upon us – “We will protect you whether you want it or
not.” Where does the question of bluffing arise?</p><p><br></p><p>I reached here at four o’clock in the night, and within three hours
the police were here. I was asleep. As I opened my eyes, I saw two
policemen in my bedroom.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I never see dreams, particularly nightmares. How have these
dodos managed to come inside?” I asked, “Do you have any search
warrant?” – they didn’t have – “Then how have you entered my private
bedroom?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We have to serve a notice on you.” Sometimes one wonders
whether we use words in our sleep. Is this the way to serve a notice? Is
this the way to be a servant of the people? All these are servants of
the people; we pay them. They should behave like servants... but they
behave like masters.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have not committed any crime. I have just slept for three
hours, is it a crime?”</p><p><br></p><p>One of them said, “You are a controversial person and the police
commissioner feels your presence may provoke violence in the city.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now these people are not even aware that I was here for seven years,
and no violence was provoked by me in the city – what more evidence do
you want? On the contrary, a man from this city has tried to kill me, to
assassinate me – in front of ten thousand sannyasins and twenty police
officers, he threw a dagger at me in a morning discourse. It was almost
impossible to lose the case even if we wanted to lose. Ten thousand
eye-witnesses you cannot find for any such case – and twenty police
officers!</p><p><br></p><p>Still the case was dismissed, that it never happened. These are our
magistrates, this is our police. These are our police commissioners. If
they wanted to keep the silence of the city, they should have thrown out
that man who tried to assassinate me.</p><p><br></p><p>But the next day when my attorney went to see the commissioner, he
was surprised. On his calendar of appointments was the name of the same
man; it seemed he was behind the whole thing. And I have been here for
two days, and still violence has not happened in the city.</p><p><br></p><p>In seven years while I was here, I entered your city only four times.
I never left the ashram. And those four times were absolutely necessary.
I had not gone to see a film. My father was dying in the hospital,
that’s why I had to go. One of my sannyasins was in a hospital in a
coma, and I had to go. All four times I had gone only to the hospital to
see someone who was dying – and died. Sitting in my room, how could I
have created violence in the city?</p><p>And on the notice... I said “Read it. What is my crime?” My crime is
that I am controversial. But can you tell me – has there ever been a man
of any intelligence who was not controversial? To be controversial is
not a crime. In fact, the whole evolution of human consciousness depends
on controversial people: Socrates, Jesus, Gautam Buddha, Mahavira,
Bodhidharma, Zarathustra. They were fortunate that none of them entered
Poona.</p><p><br></p><p>This city is condemned, because this city murdered Mahatma Gandhi,
this city tried to murder me... and they are trying to tell me that I am
controversial and dangerous. They are not even ashamed. Mahatma Gandhi
was murdered by the same group of people who have tried to assassinate
me. For centuries to come, Poona will be remembered as a city of
murderers.</p><p><br></p><p>Because he had no reasonable cause... otherwise, you would have seen
me again handcuffed and in jail, because I have done something which is
unprecedented. That police officer misbehaved. I was lying down on my
bed and he throws the notice over my face! I cannot tolerate such
subhuman behavior. I immediately tore up the notice and threw it away,
and I told those police officers, “Go and tell your commissioner.”</p><p><br></p><p>I know that a notice from the government should not be thrown away,
but there are limits! First, the law has to show humanity and respect
for human beings. Only then can it expect respect from others. And these
are our servants; we pay the tax. And they have become masters.</p><p><br></p><p>It was right of Almustafa not to answer them; they don’t deserve. But
I am a different kind of man than Almustafa.</p><p><br></p><p>He only bent his head... I will never do that. You can cut my head
but I will not bend my head. And those who stood near saw his tears
falling upon his breast.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I also weep and cry for humanity, but I am crying in the
darkness, covering myself. I don’t want you to see my tears, because my
tears will be painful to you. My tears will be like wounds to you. You
have seen only my songs... but my eyes also have tear glands.</p><p><br></p><p>But those tears are for the blind and the deaf, the heartless. Those
tears are for all categories of idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>Poona can brag about one thing: you have the highest category of
idiots in the world. And he and the people proceeded towards the great
square before the temple.</p><p>Each statement by Kahlil Gibran is significant. Why towards the
temple? All over the world there are thousands and thousands of temples
and churches and mosques and gurudwaras and synagogues – and people go
there to pray. Their prayers are like parrots repeating words; they do
not even know the meaning of those words.</p><p><br></p><p>No, the function of the temple is totally different. The function of
the temple is, when somebody arrives home like Almustafa, then the
temple is the place to declare it. Almustafa entering into a temple, the
temple becomes sacred. But without Almustafa, a temple is just a house –
empty, meaningless.</p><p>And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the
temple. You should enter the temple only when you deserve, when you have
earned, when you feel you have something to share; something sacred and
something of the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>And there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra.
And she was a seeress.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, I want you to remember that Kahlil Gibran is perhaps one
of those very few people for whom the woman is closer to the sacred than
the man, for the simple reason that she is more heart than head. She
knows how to love. And if you don’t know how to love, how can you know
how to pray?</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is nothing but the most refined form of love. A love
unaddressed to anybody, a love for the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Almitra was a seeress. Kahlil Gibran should be remembered forever as
one who gives respect and dignity to women. All your so-called bogus
religious leaders of the world have only condemned the woman. Even the
greatest of them, for whom I have great respect, but with reservations –
even Gautam Buddha who is certainly the highest peak ever attained up to
now, the Everest. Even he was not respectful towards women. For years he
continuously refused to initiate any women. And finally, after twenty
years of continual refusal, continual insult, humiliation, he
reconsidered. Because of a strange situation, he had to concede and
accept women initiates. He must have been very reluctant even in that
moment. He had to agree because the woman was almost his real mother...
because his mother died when he was born, immediately. His own mother
never saw him; neither had he any remembrance of his mother.</p><p><br></p><p>His mother’s younger sister remained unmarried just because she
wanted to take care of this rare child, who had a charisma from the very
beginning. And astrologers and prophets declared that either he would
become an emperor of the whole world or he would renounce the world and
become the greatest awakened man humanity has known.</p><p><br></p><p>This woman brought up the child, cared about him – and sacrificed her
own life, for the simple reason that if she got married, she would have
her own children and would have to divide her caring and become involved
in her own life, her children, her husband. No, she remained unmarried
so that she could shower all her love on Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>When that old woman, who could be said to be really his mother, came
and asked to be initiated, there was a great silence, a great moment of
hesitation. Twenty years of continual refusal... but how can he refuse
this woman – -who has sacrificed her whole life for him, and he cannot
do even this much for her, to initiate her into sannyas? Reluctantly, I
say, he initiated her. And why do I say “reluctantly”? – because
immediately afterwards he declared, “My religion was going to last for
five thousand years. Now it will last for only five hundred years
because a woman has entered into the fold.” As if a woman is a disease,
as if Buddha’s religion is no longer healthy enough to remain alive for
five thousand years. The entry of a woman seems to mean that his
religion has grown a cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>Ugly is the statement – and the same is the case with Mahavira, the
same is the case with Jesus, the same is the case with Mohammed. The
same is the case with Moses. And these are our highest flights towards
the stars.</p><p>Kahlil Gibran seems to have a far more human and far deeper insight.
There have been seers in all the religions, but Almitra is a seeress.
And the reason he gives has to be understood very deeply and preserved
in the deepest part of your being:</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE LOOKED UPON HER WITH EXCEEDING TENDERNESS, FOR IT WAS SHE WHO
HAD FIRST SOUGHT AND BELIEVED IN HIM WHEN HE HAD BEEN BUT A DAY IN THEIR
CITY.</p><p><br></p><p>For twelve years he had been in the city and she was the only one who
recognized him – even on the first day when he entered the city.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on asking me, “Why do you have so many sannyasins in the
bodies of women?” – as if sannyas has anything to do with the body. In
what way is sannyas concerned with the body?</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is a concern with the soul. And the woman is more open and
more available because she knows not logic, but love. And the law of
love is the highest law in life; the laws based on logic are the
lowest.</p><p><br></p><p>A man needs first to be intellectually convinced. I have millions of
sannyasins – certainly, seventy- five percent are women, twenty-five
percent are men. This is a rare phenomenon, because Buddha, or Mahavira,
or Mohammed, Jesus – nobody allowed them.</p><p><br></p><p>A man first needs to be logically convinced; he begins from the
lowest. And then it is long ladder to reach to the ardor of love. Love
is absolutely beyond logic, transcendental to logic. Even my own
sannyasins – first they are convinced: this man seems to be right;
whatever he is saying seems to be substantial. They raise all kinds of
doubts in their minds, they try in every way to be skeptical. When
finally their skepticism and their doubts are destroyed, then a thick
layer of intellectuality is removed and their heart is available.</p><p><br></p><p>But the woman first falls in love with me and then she thinks,
“Whatever he’s saying is bound to be right. How can love be wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>Their approaches are different. Man has chosen a long route –
unnecessarily, but it looks like more manly, arduous, hard – -and he
will go on a long journey to come back home.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman has chosen the shortcut – the path of love – it is only one
step. It does not need even the second step. One step and you have
arrived. That too I am saying because it will be difficult to understand
if I say exactly what happens: it is not even one step.</p><p><br></p><p>Man takes many many steps, miles and miles, just to come back home –
tired, exhausted, sad.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why saints look so sad. What do you call them in England? –
hangdog faces. Nice people, but unnecessarily running in all directions
to find the place where they have always been.</p><p><br></p><p>So to say the absolute truth, the woman does not take even a single
step. It is truth that takes a step towards the woman; the woman simply
falls in love and the home has arrived. She has been there, the love has
just opened her eyes.</p><p>Almitra was the first to recognize that Almustafa belongs to the
other shore, he’s a stranger here. He’s not dreaming about a ship – he
is so lovely, so beautiful, that she cannot doubt even if he is
dreaming. In her deep love, his dream becomes a reality. The ship that
would arrive twelve years afterwards had arrived for Almitra the very
first day. Those twelve years’ distance do not exist for her.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask me why so many women become sannyasins. It is simple:
because they are women, because they are hearts, because they know only
one language and that language is of love.</p><p><br></p><p>And she hailed him, saying... and you can see the difference. The
people who have recognized on the last day when they saw the separation
was going to happen, suddenly became aware that they have missed –
amongst them was a man, a messiah, a message from the other shore. But
they were simply deaf and blind, and now it is too late.</p><p><br></p><p>So they are saying, “Linger on a little more... just a little more.
We have not been able to taste your truth and we have not been able to
drink from your eyes. Shower your grace a little more.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Almitra says something totally different:</p><p><br></p><p>PROPHET OF GOD, IN THE QUEST OF THE UTTERMOST, LONG HAVE YOU SEARCHED
THE DISTANCES FOR YOUR SHIP.</p><p><br></p><p>AND NOW YOUR SHIP HAS COME, AND YOU MUST NEEDS GO.</p><p><br></p><p>Only love can see it.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is greedy. Mind is greed.</p><p><br></p><p>All those people who are saying, “Linger on a little”... I say unto
you, if Almustafa agrees with them, they will forget all about him
again. Again they will take him for granted – “What is the hurry? And if
the ship comes again, we can persuade him to remain with us.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man lives in tomorrows which never come. Mind has no contact with the
present; either it lives in the past or it lives in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>They are shocked: they could not recognize and twelve years have
passed – what a loss! And they can also see that if he remains, perhaps
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow they may be able to understand his
truth, his experience.</p><p><br></p><p>But I repeat again: If Almustafa remains with them, they will forget
him again.</p><p><br></p><p>But Almitra says to him, “It is hard, it hurts, but there is no other
way. You have waited long, you have given opportunity enough to these
people. Now You must needs go.</p><p><br></p><p>DEEP IS YOUR LONGING FOR THE LAND OF YOUR MEMORIES AND THE
DWELLING-PLACE OF YOUR GREATER DESIRES; AND OUR LOVE WOULD NOT BIND YOU
NOR OUR NEEDS HOLD YOU.</p><p>That’s the beauty of love, that it gives you freedom. That is the
criterion of whether there is love or not. If love prevents you from
your growth, it is not love. Love may suffer but will not be jealous,
love may suffer but will not be a bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>Almitra says, and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.
We need you, certainly we need you, but you have been here twelve years
– it is enough. We have ignored you, perhaps people are not thirsty. So
you don’t pay any attention to people’s prayer that you remain with us.
I know – Deep is your longing for the land, your love for the people but
whatever you could do, you have done. We would like you to be here, but
love would not bind you – we need you, but it is our unconsciousness
that we missed you – nor our needs hold you.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of
your truth.</p><p><br></p><p>We don’t want you to be here, we don’t want to become a prison to you
because of our needs and because of our love and because of your
compassion. But at least do this much before you leave: speak to us and
give us of your truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, truth is always individual. There is no truth of the
collective mind, of the crowd. The crowd has only lies – Hinduism,
Jainism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd has only lies.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is always individual.</p><p><br></p><p>It is experienced in the very innermost core of your being – where
you cannot take anybody with you. You cannot take the person you love,
you cannot take your friend with you. You have to go alone, and only in
your aloneness is the realization. And because the realization happens
in the individual, there is no need of any religion, organized.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, religiousness is needed – unorganized, available to each
individual according to his own potential, possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>A real human society, a real civilization will allow every individual
to seek and search and find his truth. Gautam Buddha’s truth is of no
use to you. My truth is of no use to you. At the most, the man who has
realized the truth can give you a certainty that truth is not just a
hypothesis; that it is a reality, that it transforms people.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot give you my truth, but my presence can trigger a journey in
you towards the ultimate shrine.</p><p><br></p><p>But a woman thinks in a different way than a man, because her
thinking is not based on thoughts. Her thinking is based on feelings.
Why is she saying it? Because she says:</p><p><br></p><p>And we will give it unto our children It is not greed.</p><p>And they unto their children,</p><p>And it shall not perish.</p><p><br></p><p>We want your flame to remain alive. We will go on passing it from
heart to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your
wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>She’s saying, “Whatever you have watched, we were laughing in our
sleep, we were talking in our sleep, we were acting, doing things in our
sleep. We were not aware what was going on.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now therefore disclose us to ourselves... We don’t ask anything more.
Just disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you
of that which is between birth and death.</p><p><br></p><p>A tremendously potent question: What is between birth and death? That
is your life principle – between birth and death is God – but because
you are asleep, you never become aware of it. You are born and you will
die, and without knowing what was between the two. And between the two
was your truth.</p><p><br></p><p>And he answered:</p><p><br></p><p>PEOPLE OF ORPHALESE, OF WHAT CAN I SPEAK SAVE OF THAT WHICH IS EVEN
NOW MOVING WITHIN YOUR SOULS?</p><p><br></p><p>Every master simply wakes you up to your own reality, to your own
truth. He does not give you anything.</p><p><br></p><p>You already have it. You have just not looked inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>A little silence, a little meditativeness and you will start
uncovering yourself. Truth is a discovery within.</p><p><br></p><p>Almustafa is right when he says...of what can i speak save of that
which is even now moving within your own souls? I can see the flame but
you don’t look inwards. Just close your eyes, look inwards. Go on
digging deeper and deeper until you have come to the waters of eternal
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

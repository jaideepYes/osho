out. It is a Zen koan. First you have to understand the meaning of Zen
and the meaning of a koan.</p><p>Zen is not a religion, not a dogma, not a creed, Zen is not even a
quest, an inquiry; it is non-philosophical. The fundamental of the Zen
approach is that all is as it should be, nothing is missing. This very
moment everything is perfect. The goal is not somewhere else, it is
here, it is now. Tomorrows don't exist. This very moment is the only
reality. Hence in Zen there is no distinction between methods and goals,
means and goals.</p><p>All the philosophies of the world and all the religions of the world
create duality; howsoever they may go on talking about non-duality, they
create a split personality in man.</p><p>That has been the greatest calamity that has befallen humanity: all
the do- gooders have created a schizophrenic man. When you divide
reality into means and goals you divide man himself, because for man,
man is the closest reality to man. His consciousness becomes split. He
lives here but not really; he is always there, somewhere else. He is
always searching, always inquiring; never living, never being, always
doing; getting richer, getting powerful, getting spiritual, getting
holier, saintly -- always more and more. And this constant hankering for
more creates his tense, anguished state, and meanwhile he is missing all
that is made available by existence. He is interested in the far away
and God is close by. His eyes are focused on the stars and God is within
him. Hence the most fundamental thing to understand about Zen is: The
goose has NEVER been in. Let me tell you the story how this koan
started: A great philosophical official, Riko, once asked the strange
Zen Master, Nansen, to explain to him the old koan of the goose in the
bottle.</p><p>"If a man puts a gosling into a bottle," said Riko, "and feeds him
until he is full- grown, how can the man get the goose out without
killing it or breaking the bottle?"</p><p>Nansen gave a great clap with his hands and shouted, "Riko!" "Yes,
Master," said the official with a start.</p><p>"See," said Nansen, "the goose is out!" Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>2</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>It is only a question of seeing, it is only a question of becoming
alert, awake, it is only a question of waking up. The goose is in the
bottle if you are in a dream; the goose has never been in the bottle if
you are awake. And in the dream there is no way to take the goose out of
the bottle. Either the goose will die or the bottle will have to be
broken, and both alternatives are not allowed: neither has the bottle to
be broken nor has the goose to be killed. Now, a fully-grown goose in a
small bottle... how can you take it out? This is called a koan.</p><p>A koan is not an ordinary puzzle; it is not a puzzle because it
cannot be solved. A puzzle is that which has a possibility of being
solved; you just have to look for the right answer. You will find it --
it only needs intelligence to find the answer to the puzzle; but a
puzzle is not really insoluble.</p><p>A koan is insoluble; you cannot solve it, you can only DISSOLVE it.
And the way to dissolve it is to change the very plane of your being
from dreaming to wakefulness. In the dream the goose is in the bottle
and there is no way to bring it out of the bottle without breaking the
bottle or killing the goose -- in the dream. Hence, as far as the dream
is concerned, the puzzle is impossible; nothing can be done about
it.</p><p>But there is a way out -- which has nothing to do with the puzzle,
remember. You have to wake up. That has nothing to do with the bottle
and nothing to do with the goose either. You have to wake up. It has
something to do with YOU. That's why Nansen did not answer the
question.</p><p>Riko asked, "If a man puts a gosling into a bottle and feeds him
until he is full- grown, how can the man get the goose out without
killing it or breaking the bottle?"</p><p>Nansen didn't answer. On the other hand, he gave a great clap with
his hands and shouted,</p><p>"Riko!"</p><p>Now, this is not an answer to the question -- this has nothing to do
with the question at all</p><p>-- it is irrelevant, inconsistent. But it solves it; in fact, it
dissolves it. The moment he shouted,</p><p>"Riko!" the official with a start said, "Yes, Master" The whole plane
of his being is transformed by a simple strategy.</p><p>A Master is not a teacher; he does not teach you, he simply devises
methods to wake you up. That clap is a method, that clap simply brought
Riko into the present. And it was so unexpected... When you are asking
such a spiritual koan you don't expect the Master to answer you with a
loud clap and then shout, "Riko!"</p><p>Suddenly he is brought from the past, from the future. Suddenly for a
moment he forgets the whole problem. Where is the bottle and where is
the goose? There is only the Master, in a strange posture, clapping and
shouting for Riko. Suddenly the whole problem is dropped. He has slipped
out of the problem without even knowing that he slipped out of it. He
has slipped out of the problem as a snake slips out of its old skin. For
a moment time has stopped. For a moment the clock has stopped. For a
moment the mind has stopped. For a moment there is nothing. The Master,
the sound of the clap, and a sudden awakening. In that very moment the
Master says, "See! See, the goose is out!" It is dissolved.</p><p>A koan can only be dissolved but can never be solved. A puzzle can
never be dissolved but can be solved. So remember, a koan is not a
puzzle.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 3</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>But when people who are accustomed to continuous thinking, logical
reasoning, start studying Zen, they take a false step from the very
beginning. Zen cannot be studied; it has to be lived, it has to be
imbibed -- imbibed from a living Master. It is a transmission beyond
words, a transmission of the lamp. The lamp is</p><p>invisible.</p><p>Now, anybody watching this whole situation -- Riko asking a question,
the Master clapping and shouting -- would not have found anything very
spiritual in it, would not have found any great philosophy, may have
come back very frustrated. But something transpired --</p><p>something which is not visible and can never be visible.</p><p>It happens only when the silence of the Master penetrates the silence
of the disciple, when two silences meet and merge; then immediately
there is seeing. The Master has eyes, the disciple has eyes, but the
disciple's eyes are closed. A device is needed, some method, so that the
disciple can open his eyes without any effort of his own. If he makes an
effort he will miss the point, because who will make the effort?</p><p>Christmas Humphreys, one of the great lovers of Zen in the West, the
founder of the Buddhist Society of England and the man who made Zen
Buddhism very famous in the Western world, writes about this koan, and
you will see the difference. He says:</p><p>"There is a method of taking the problem in flank, as it were. It
will be nonsense to the rational-minded, but such will read no further.
Those who read on will expect increasing nonsense, for sense, the
suburban villas of rational thought, will soon be left behind, and the
mind will be free on the illimitable hills of its own inherent joy.
Here, then, is the real solution to the problem of the opposites.</p><p>"Shall I tell it you? Consider a live goose in a bottle. How to get
it out without hurting the goose or breaking the bottle? The answer is
simple -- 'There, it's out!"'</p><p>Now, the whole point is lost: it becomes philosophical. First,
Christmas Humphreys thinks Zen is part of Buddhism; that is to begin
with a wrong door, with a wrong step. Zen has nothing to do with
Buddhism. It certainly has something to do with the Buddha, but nothing
to do with Buddhism as such, just as Sufism has nothing to do with
Islam, Hassidism has nothing to do with Judaism, Tantra has nothing to
do with Hinduism. Yes, Tantra certainly has something to do with Shiva
and Sufism has something to do with Mohammed and Hassidism has something
to do with Moses, but not with the traditions, not with the conventions,
not with the theologies.</p><p>A Moses alive, a Mohammed alive, can transmit something which cannot
be said, can show something which cannot be said, can create a certain
vibe around him which can trigger enlightenment in many people, but
without any explanation, without any logical proof.</p><p>Enlightenment is almost like a love affair. Just as you fall in love
-- you cannot rationalize it; it is below reason -- in the same way you
fall into enlightenment. It is above reason: you fall above words.</p><p>There is a beautiful story of a Master who was staying at a
disciple's house. The disciple was a little worried about the Master
because his ways were strange, unexpected. He could do anything! He was
almost thought to be mad. So not to create any trouble for the
neighborhood Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>4</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>-- because in the night he might start dancing, singing, shouting,
sermonizing to nobody and create a disturbance in the neighborhood --
they put him in the basement and locked him up in the basement, so that
even if he went and did something nobody would hear him. They closed all
the windows, all the doors, and locked them.</p><p>In the middle of the night they were suddenly awakened. Somebody was
rolling about on the roof with such a loud laughter that a great crowd
had gathered all around and they were asking, "What is the matter?"</p><p>They rushed up, they found the Master rolling on the roof. They
asked, "What is the matter? How did you manage? We locked you in the
basement just to avoid such a scene!"</p><p>The Master said, "That's why I am laughing. Suddenly I started
falling upwards. I cannot believe it myself! It has never happened
before, falling upwards!"</p><p>It is a beautiful story. Enlightenment is falling upwards just as
love is falling downwards.</p><p>But something is similar in both; the falling -- unreasonable,
unexplainable, inexpressible.</p><p>Only those to whom it has happened know, and even when it has
happened you cannot explain it to anybody to whom it has not happened
yet.</p><p>Christmas Humphreys calls Zen "Zen Buddhism" That is starting in the
wrong direction from the very beginning. Zen is not Buddhism -- the
essential core of the heart of Buddha, certainly, but it is the
essential core of Moses too, the essential core of Zarathustra too, Lao
Tzu too. It is the essential core of all those who have become
enlightened, of all those who have awakened from their dream, of all
those who have seen that the goose is out, that the goose has never been
in, that the problem was not a problem at all in the first place, hence
no solution is needed.</p><p>Christmas Humphreys says: "There is a method of taking the problem in
flank, as it were.</p><p>It will be nonsense to the rational-minded..."</p><p>He himself is rational-minded; otherwise, it is not nonsense.
Nonsense is something below sense. Zen is supra-sense, not nonsense; it
is above sense. It is something far beyond the reaches of reason. Logic
is a very ordinary game; anybody who has a little intelligence can play
the game. The moment you go beyond logic then you enter into the world
of Zen. It is not nonsense, it is supra- sense. His very use of the word
"nonsense" shows a deep-down bias towards rationality.</p><p>He says: "... but such will read no further. Those who read on will
expect increasing nonsense, for sense, the suburban villas of rational
thought, will soon be left behind... "</p><p>They are not left behind, because if you leave something behind you
are on the same track.</p><p>You have left a milestone behind, but the road is the same, the path
is not different. Maybe you have gone a mile ahead, but your dimension
has not changed. The difference is only of quantity, not of quality.</p><p>Reason is not only left behind, reason is transcended, surpassed.
There is a difference, a great difference, a difference that makes the
difference.</p><p>I have heard a story -- it happened in the Second World War: Osho -
The Goose</p><p>is Out 5</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>In a thick part of the Burmese jungle, a small plane was left by the
army. They were in a hurry, they were retreating, and for some
mechanical reason they could not manage to take it with them. The
primitives found the plane; they could not understand what it was. They
figured out that it must be some kind of bullock cart -- that was the
only possible thing for them to think; the bullock cart was the ultimate
vehicle in their vision. So they started using the plane as a bullock
cart, and they enjoyed it. It was the best bullock cart they had ever
found!</p><p>Then somebody passed by -- a man who lived a little further away from
the primitive tribe but was part of the tribe. He knew, he had come to
experience cars, trucks, buses. He said,</p><p>"This is not a bullock cart, this is a car, and I know something
about cars" So he fixed it, and they were immensely amazed that without
horses, without bulls, the machine was working. It was such a toy! Every
morning, every evening, they enjoyed just looking at it again and again
from all sides, entering it, sitting in it; and because there were not
many roads, even to go a few feet was a great excitement.</p><p>Then one day a pilot passed by the primitive forest and he said,
"What are you doing? This is an airplane, it can fly!"</p><p>He took two primitives with him, and when they left the ground they
could not believe it.</p><p>This was absolutely beyond their imagination, beyond all their
dreams. They used to think that only Gods could fly; they had heard
stories about Gods flying in the sky. Yes, they had seen airplanes in
the sky, but they had always believed they belonged to the Gods.</p><p>Now, the same mechanism can be used as a bullock cart or as a car,
but between the bullock cart and the car the distinction is only of
quantity, not of quality. The moment the airplane takes off from the
ground it changes its plane: it surpasses the bullock cart, the car. It
moves in a totally new dimension.</p><p>So reason is not left behind, reason is simply transcended. Hence,
Christmas Humphreys calling it nonsense, irrational, or thinking that
reason has been left behind is still thinking in terms of
rationality.</p><p>He says: "... and the mind will be free..."</p><p>Now, that is absolutely stupid; the mind will not be free. When you
enter into the world of Zen there is no-mind. Zen is equivalent to
no-mind. It is not freedom of the mind, it is freedom from the mind, and
there is a lot of difference, an unbridgeable difference. The mind is
not free, you are free of the mind. The mind is no longer there, free or
unfree, the mind has simply ceased. You have gone through a new door
which was always available to you but you had never knocked on it -- the
door of being, the door of eternity.</p><p>Zen, the very word "Zen" comes from the Sanskrit word DHYANA. DHYANA
means meditation, but the word "meditation" does not carry its total
significance. "Meditation" again gives you the feeling that mind is
doing something: mind meditating, concentrating, contemplating, but mind
is there. DHYANA simply means a state of no-mind, no concentration, no
contemplation, no meditation, in fact -- but just a silence, a deep,
profound silence where all thoughts have disappeared; where there is no
ripple in the lake of consciousness; when the consciousness is
functioning just like a mirror reflecting all that is --</p><p>the stars, the trees, the birds, the people, all that is -- simply
reflecting it without any Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>6</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>distortion, without any interpretation, without bringing in your
prejudices. That's what your mind is: your prejudices, your ideologies,
your dogmas, your habits.</p><p>Christmas Humphreys says: "... and the mind will be free on the
illimitable hills of its own inherent joy."</p><p>This is real nonsense! First, "mind will be free". Mind can never be
free. Freedom and mind never meet. Mind means bondage, mind is a prison.
In the mind you live an encapsulated life, surrounded by all kinds of
thoughts, theories, systems, philosophies, surrounded by the whole past
of humanity, all kinds of</p><p>superstitions -- Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, Buddhist, Jaina;
political, social, economic, religious. Either your mind is made up of
the bricks of the Bible, the Koran, the Gita, or maybe DAS KAPITAL, or
the Communist Manifesto. You may have made your prison differently from
others, you may have chosen a different architect, but the prison is the
same. The architect can be Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein --
you can choose, prisons come in all shapes and all sizes -- and then the
interior decoration is up to you. You can put beautiful paintings
inside, you can carpet it wall to wall, you can paint it according to
your likes and dislikes, you can make a few changes here and there, a
window on the left or on the right, a curtain of this material or that,
but a prison is a prison.</p><p>Mind as such is a prison, and everybody is living in the prison.
Unless you get out of the prison you will never know what freedom is.
Your prison can be very cozy, comfortable, convenient, it can be very
well decorated, golden, studded with diamonds... It will be difficult to
leave it -- you have worked so hard to create it -- it is not going to
be easy. But a prison is a prison; made of gold or made of mud, it makes
no difference. You will never know the infinity of freedom, you will
never know the beauty and the splendor of freedom; your splendor will
is. You will never know that the goose is always out. You will live in
all kinds of dreams. Howsoever beautiful they are, dreams are dreams,
and sooner or later all dreams are shattered.</p><p>But mind is self-perpetuating. If one dream shatters it immediately
creates another dream</p><p>-- in fact, it always keeps one ready. Before the old one is
shattered it supplies you with a new one -- a better dream, more
refined, more sophisticated, more scientific, more technological --</p><p>and again you are infatuated, again the desire arises: "Why not try
it? Maybe other dreams have failed, but that does not necessarily mean
that all dreams will fail. One may succeed."</p><p>That hope goes on lingering; that hope keeps you running after
dreams. And when death comes, one finds that one's whole life has been
nothing but the same stuff as dreams are made of: "... A tale/Told by an
idiot/Full of sound and fury/Signifying nothing." But this is how
millions of people are living.</p><p>Christmas Humphreys says: "... and the mind will be free on the
illimitable hills of its own inherent joy."</p><p>This shows that he never understood even a single dewdrop of the Zen
experience. He became the propagator of Zen philosophy in the West, but
not knowing what he was doing, not experiencing anything of what he was
talking about.</p><p>The mind cannot reach "the illimitable hills of its own inherent
joy"; the mind has no inherent capacity for joy. The mind is the cause
of all misery; it knows nothing of joy. It only thinks about joy, and
its thinking about joy is also nothing but an imagination against the
suffering in which it lives.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 7</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>If you ask the mind to define joy, its definition will be negative;
it will simply say. "There will be no suffering, there will be no pain,
there will be no death." But this is all negative definition; it says
nothing about bliss, it simply speaks about painlessness. But the goal
of painlessness is not of any worth. Even if you are without pain will
you find it worth living and for how long? Even if you don't have any
illness that does not mean that you have the well-being of health; that
is a totally different quality. A person may be medically fit, there may
be nothing wrong as far as the diagnosis of the physician goes, but if
he is not feeling an overflowing joy it is not health -- an absence of
disease perhaps, but not the presence of health. The absence of disease
is not equivalent to the presence of health; that's a totally different
phenomenon.</p><p>You may not be miserable; that does not mean that you are blissful.
You may be simply in a limbo, neither blissful nor miserable, which is a
far worse situation than being miserable, because the miserable person
at least tries to get out of it. The person who lives in a limbo, just
on the boundary line, neither miserable nor blissful, cannot get out of
misery because he is not in misery. He cannot enter into bliss because
there is no push from behind; the misery is not hitting him hard enough
so that he can take a jump. He will remain stuck, stagnant.</p><p>Misery is a negative state, bliss is a positive state, but the mind
knows only</p><p>misery. The mind cannot know "the illimitable hills of its own
inherent joy" because there is nothing in it.</p><p>The mind is only a creation of the society to help you perform your
social duties efficiently.</p><p>The mind is a strategy of the establishment to manipulate you, to
enslave you, to keep you as unintelligent as possible, because the
intelligent person is dangerous.</p><p>In the whole of the Bible there is not a single statement praising
intelligence. It is full of all kinds of rubbish, but there is not a
single statement in praise of intelligence. Superstition is praised,
belief is praised, all kinds of stupid things are praised.</p><p>All the religions, organized religions, have been trying to make man
a robot, a machine, and they have almost succeeded. That's why there are
so few Buddhas, so few Jesuses. The reason is simple: societies,
factories, the state, the church, the nation -- they are in a deep
conspiracy to destroy the small child, who is very vulnerable, delicate
and helpless.</p><p>You can destroy him. And the basic strategy for destruction is to
create a mind, impose a mind on him, so that he forgets his innermost
qualities of joy, he forgets the innocence that he brought from the
sources of existence, so that he forgets all that is beautiful and
becomes only a cog in the wheel of society. He has to be a good servant,
he has to be a good mechanic, he has to be a good station-master, a good
professor, this and that, but he has not to be a divine being, he has
not to function blissfully.</p><p>The society is very afraid of blissful people for the simple reason
that bliss is such a tremendous experience that one can sacrifice one's
life for it but one cannot sacrifice one's bliss for anything else. One
lives for bliss, one dies for bliss, once one has known what bliss is.
Hence the blissful person is absolutely beyond the imprisoning forces of
the society. The society can only rule the miserable, the church can
only exploit the miserable.</p><p>And Christmas Humphreys says: "Here, then, is the real solution to
the problem of the opposites."</p><p>There is no "problem of the opposites." Opposites are not opposites,
they are</p><p>complementaries, hence there is no problem as such. Darkness and
light are one phenomenon, two aspects of the same coin. Life and death
are inseparable, you cannot separate them -- how Osho - The Goose is
Out</p><p>8</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>can you make them opposites? They are complementaries, they help each
other. Hence there is no problem and there is no need for any
solution.</p><p>And Zen is not a solution to opposites, it is a transcendence, it is
a higher vision</p><p>-- a bird's-eye view from where all dualities look stupid.</p><p>The most important thing that happened to the first man who walked on
the moon was that he suddenly forgot that he was an American. Suddenly
the whole earth was one, there were no boundaries, because there is no
map on the earth. The American continent, the African continent, the
Asian continent, this country and that country all disappeared. Not that
he made any effort to put all the opposing camps together; there was not
even a Soviet Russia or an America, the whole earth was just simply
one.</p><p>And the first words that were uttered by the American were "My
beloved earth!" This is transcendence. For a moment he had forgotten all
conditionings: "My beloved earth!" Now the whole earth belonged to
him.</p><p>This is what actually happens in a state of silence: the whole
existence is yours and all opposites disappear into each other,
supporting, dancing with each other. It becomes an orchestra.</p><p>Christmas Humphreys says, "Shall I tell it you? Consider..."</p><p>Now, look how just small changes make great differences: "Shall I
tell it you? Consider..."</p><p>This is the way philosophy moves, not Zen: "Consider..." It is not a
question of consideration; either you know or you don't know.</p><p>The Master Nansen did not say, "Consider, now I will give a great
clap. Consider, now I will shout, 'Riko!' and you have to say, 'Yes,
Master!' Then I will</p><p>say, 'See, the goose is out!"'</p><p>Then the whole point would have been lost.</p><p>Just a few days ago in a darshan meeting in the evening I called
Nirupa. She had broken one of her hands. She is one of my mediums, but
now she cannot participate in the dancing.</p><p>She was just sitting in the front line and I called her. For a moment
she hesitated and everybody laughed, because what was she going to do
with one hand? But Zen is done with one hand -- the sound of one hand
clapping! -- and she did well. Of course, only I could hear the sound,
but the sound of one hand clapping... Even when you are making a sound
with two hands clapping the energy is one. Your left hand and your right
hand are not two, they are joined in you. They are not opposites, they
are complementary, they belong to one being.</p><p>All opposites belong to one being, and it is not a question of
consideration. If you consider, you take all the juice out of the
beautiful koan.</p><p>"Consider,' he says, "a live goose in a bottle. How to get it out
without hurting the goose or breaking the bottle?"</p><p>He cannot even say "without killing the goose." A proper Englishman!
"Without hurting the goose or breaking the bottle." In fact, even to say
"breaking the bottle" his heart must be breaking! "The answer is
simple..."</p><p>It is not simple. In the first place it is not an answer either.
"There, it is out!" He has destroyed the whole beauty of the koan. But
habits die very hard. It is just the way of thinking, the way of the
mind.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 9</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>The Pope was given a pair of red silk slippers with the initials
T.I.F inscribed on them.</p><p>When His Holiness asked what the letters stood for, he was told,
"Toes In First:'</p><p>Anand Bhavo, you ask me:</p><p>OSHO, IS THE GOOSE REALLY OUT?</p><p>It has always been out, it has never been in. It is only a question
of dreaming. Wake up!</p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, IN THE WEST I AM A STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY. IS THERE ANY LOVE</p><p>OR WISDOM IN PHILOSOPHY? I HAVE NOT FOUND THEM YET.</p><p>Anand Wolfgang, it is good that you have not found it yet. I hope
that you will never find it, ever, because Germans tend to find it!</p><p>It is said philosophy is like a blind man searching on a dark night
in a dark room for a black cat which is not there. But Germans find it!
They have given the greatest philosophers to the world: Immanuel Kant
and Hegel and Fichte and Marx and Feuerbach and so on and so forth.</p><p>It is good, Wolfgang, that you say:</p><p>IN THE WEST I AM A STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY. IS THERE ANY LOVE OR</p><p>WISDOM IN PHILOSOPHY?</p><p>Love is not possible at all, because philosophy means logic and logic
cannot be loving.</p><p>Logic is the foundation of science but not the foundation of life.
Logic is applicable to dead things, to objects, because the basic method
of logic is dissection. The moment you dissect something you kill it, so
if you want to find life through logic you will never find it; the very
method prohibits it.</p><p>You can cut a rose flower, you can dissect it, you can put all the
ingredients</p><p>separately into different bottles methodically labelled, but one
thing will be missing: there will be no beauty to be found and no life
to be found, no joy to be found, no dance of the rose flower in the
wind, in the rain, in the sun; they will all be gone. There will be a
few chemicals, but those chemicals are not the rose flower, those
chemicals were simply the situation in which the rose has appeared. They
don't constitute the rose, they only constituted the situation for the
appearance of the rose. If you take them away, the rose disappears into
its invisible world.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 10</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>It is like dissecting a dancer -- do you think you will find
something like dance inside?</p><p>You will find bones, you will find all kinds of nasty things, but you
will not find a dance. You can cut the throat of a singer, but you will
not find the song -- and you had always believed that the song came from
the throat. The throat is only a vehicle; the song comes from the
beyond. The throat can be a good vehicle or a bad vehicle, that is a
different matter, but it is only a vehicle. By dissecting the vehicle
you cannot find that which was descending on it from the world of the
beyond.</p><p>Love and logic never meet, cannot meet. Logic means the outward
journey, love means the inward journey. Logic means dissection, love
means finding the organic unity. Logic thinks in terms of the many, the
multiple.</p><p>In fact, scientists should stop calling the universe "universe," they
should call it</p><p>"multiverse." "Universe" is a poetic name given by lovers; universe
means one, "uni."</p><p>According to science it is not a universe, it is many, it is a
multiverse. Only lovers know the unity, thinkers cannot know unity.</p><p>And in the unity of the whole one finds love and one finds wisdom.
Wisdom is the shadow of love; wherever there is love there is wisdom.
When love is alive</p><p>there is dance, there is song, there is beauty; those are all the
qualities of wisdom. If you think logic can give you wisdom then you
will have to decide one thing very clearly, and that is that knowledge
has to be taken as wisdom. Then logic can give you wisdom, but then
knowledge becomes equivalent to, synonymous with, wisdom -- and
knowledge is not synonymous with wisdom.</p><p>Knowledge is all borrowed, rubbish; you have gathered it from
others.</p><p>Wisdom is the explosion of your own consciousness. Wisdom is
intrinsic; it does not come from the outside, it explodes within you and
spreads towards the outer world. It is like light radiating: you share
it, you don't accumulate it. Knowledge has to be begged for, wisdom has
to be shared. They are totally different dimensions.</p><p>Philosophy, Wolfgang, cannot give you love or wisdom, but it can go
on giving you hope.</p><p>And if philosophy is the answer, it must have been a silly
question.</p><p>Remember it, if you can find any answer through philosophy, that
simply proves one thing: that your question was silly. If the question
is really significant, philosophy has no answer. You will have to look
in a different direction. That direction I call Zen, that direction I
call awakening -- not theorizing, philosophizing, but becoming silent;
not becoming more knowledgeable but dropping all knowledge, discarding
it, so that you can be empty, utterly empty. In emptiness there is
clarity, there is cleanliness, there is purity, there is innocence, a
childlike wonder and awe. And those are the moments of love and wisdom
growing in you; they grow together. Knowledge and logic grow together.
Wisdom and love grow together.</p><p>A famous zoology professor at the Sorbonne had the habit of giving
his students an oral exam at the end of his course, and he always asked
the same question: "Tell me all you know about worms."</p><p>Of course his students would goof around all semester and then just
before the exam study assiduously all about worms. And they all got very
high marks.</p><p>Finally the professor became concerned that all his students were
doing so well. The time came to give the exam and meanwhile all the
students were studying all about worms. When Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>11</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>the first student came for the exam, the professor asked, "Tell me
all you know about elephants:'</p><p>The student was profoundly flustered for a moment, then he answered,
"Elephants have worm-like tails. Worms are classified... " And then he
started.</p><p>Knowledge is always unintelligent. If a question is asked for which
you have a ready-made answer it is good, if a question is asked for
which you don't have a ready-made answer you are in trouble. You are
just behaving mechanically. Knowledge is mechanical, and how can
anything mechanical help you to be wise? Knowledge is nothing but
categorization.</p><p>Once upon a time there was a handsome young lion. He was captured in
the African jungle and brought to America, where he was put on display
in a zoo. This made the lion very unhappy because he preferred the
freedom of his wild native land and the companionship of other jungle
beasts. But after a time he became resigned to his fate and made up his
mind that if he had to live behind bars he would be the best zoo lion
around.</p><p>In an adjoining cage there was another lion, an old and lazy one with
a negative responsibility and no signs of ambition or capability of any
kind. He lay all day in the sun, aroused no interest from visitors. In
sharp contrast, the young lion paced for hours back and forth in his
cage. He acted the true King of Beasts, rolling his maned head,
snarling, and baring his teeth. The crowds loved him; they paid no
attention to the indolent old lion asleep in the next cage.</p><p>The young lion appreciated the attention he was getting, but he was
annoyed by his failure to win adequate reward. Each afternoon the zoo
keeper came through the cages to feed the animals. The lazy old lion who
made no effort to please the spectators was given a big bowl of
horsemeat. The young lion, now a star attraction, was given a bowl of
chopped-up oranges, bananas and nuts. This made him very unhappy.</p><p>"Perhaps," he mused, "I am not trying hard enough. I will improve the
act." So he strutted longer and more spectacularly. To the snarls and
gnashing of teeth he added frequent roars that shook the bars of his
cage. The crowds got bigger.</p><p>Thousands of citizens came to see his performance, and he was
pictured on page one in the local newspaper.</p><p>But the diet did not change. Still the lazy lion got the red meat and
the young lion stayed on a vegetarian diet. Finally he could endure it
no longer. He stopped the keeper with a challenge. "I am getting sick
and tired of this," he complained. "Each day you give that no-good lazy
type next door a big bowl of red meat and you feed me oranges, bananas
and nuts. It is grossly unfair. Why do you think all these people come
to the zoo? They come to see me! I am the star attraction, the lion that
is doing all the work and the one that gets the results. Why am I not
entitled to meat for dinner?"</p><p>The keeper replied, "Young man, you don't know how lucky you are. The
Table of Organization in this zoo calls for one lion. You are being
carried as a monkey!"</p><p>The philosophers are good at categorizing things, the scientists are
good at categorizing things. Their whole effort is how to categorize,
how to put everything in a particular category</p><p>-- this is this, that is that -- and they go on and on. They are not
in search of the organic unity Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>12</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>of life, they are not in search of the ultimate principle of life
that runs in the trees and the mountains and the stars and the animals
and the birds and men and women. They are not in search of that unifying
factor. That unifying factor is what religions have called the truth,
what Buddha has called NIRVANA, what Jesus has called the kingdom of
God.</p><p>You will not find, Wolfgang, any wisdom, any love in philosophy. Yes,
you will find all kinds of beautiful answers, you will find all kinds of
parrot-like information, facts, you will become very efficient in
repeating them, in quoting them, but you will only be becoming a
computer. That can be done better by a computer than by you.</p><p>Find out something within you which a computer cannot do and you will
have</p><p>found the right direction for your innermost being, for your freedom.
That is the whole effort of Zen, that's what we are trying to do here.
The computer cannot love; it can say "I love you," but you know that it
is a computer. It can make all the gestures of love, but if suddenly the
electricity goes... "Grrr, grrr, grrr," or if the battery runs out,
first you have to replace the battery, then it will say "I love
you."</p><p>But people are foolish and people are trying all kinds of things to
make man more like a robot.</p><p>Just the other day I was reading this item in a newspaper: "Mundane
Mating," Toronto, 25</p><p>February:</p><p>Men and women in future will have robot sexual partners, and erotic
technology will offer them their hearts' desires: stimulants,
aphrodisiacs, and chemical orgasms.</p><p>Sexologists concluded during a seminar here that men and women will
still mate, but during well-defined periods. Some said that women will
want the "profound and basic experience" of pregnancy without giving
birth.</p><p>One sexologist said that sexual relations with robots will help to
"supplement or enrich fantasy life and contribute to the establishment
of a milieu which fosters rather than arrests sexual growth and
development."</p><p>It is going to happen! In a way it has already happened. For
thousands of years man has been making love mechanically, and the
so-called mahatmas -- Mahatma Gandhi and the Polack Pope and Mother
Teresa -- they all say that if you make love only for one reason, that
is reproduction, then it is not sin. If you make love just for the sheer
joy of it, for the sheer fun of it, it is sin.</p><p>Now, reproduction is chemical, biological; fun is a higher value. No
animal knows anything about fun. Have you seen animals making love? Do
you see any fun? They don't even say, "Hello!" to each other, and when
they are finished they don't even say, "Thank you, see you soon!" They
don't even look at each other; they seem to be utterly bored. Look at
animals making love -- they seem to be utterly bored, as if some
biological force is forcing them to do something and they have to do it.
Once they are finished they go on their ways; they will never</p><p>recognize each other again, they will not write love letters.</p><p>Fun is not animal, fun is human. And all these mahatmas go on
condemning man for everything animal except reproduction -- and
reproduction is absolutely animal! All animals reproduce; there is
nothing special in it. The only thing is -- they don't enjoy it, they
don't have Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>13</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>any fun in it, they don't have any loving relationship growing out of
it, they don't transform the sexual energy. But reproduction is thought
to be a virtue and fun is thought to be something absolutely
condemnable. These people have always changed human joy into a
robot-like phenomenon.</p><p>People have been making love to each other in the darkness, under
blanket covers. If a Martian comes to the earth, particularly to India,
he will not see any sign of anybody making love. He will be very puzzled
how these people reproduce. His basic inquiry here will be to find out
how you reproduce, because he will not see anybody making love. Love is
far away, he will not see any people holding hands.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p>Once a couple reached Mars, and of course their basic inquiry was...
because they could not find out how people made love there. They tried
hard, they did all kinds of things that they had done on Earth to know
about other people's love affairs -- they became peeping toms --</p><p>but they could not find out anything.</p><p>Finally they asked a Martian couple, very politely, "We have come
from Earth, we are on a research tour. We want to know how you make
love."</p><p>They said, "It is very simple!" They opened their fridge, brought out
two jars, started mixing the chemicals contained in the jars into a
third small jar, mixed them well and put the jar back into the
fridge.</p><p>The couple inquiring about love-making could not see any love-making
in it.</p><p>They said,</p><p>"What are you doing? Are you preparing coffee or something?" They
said, "No, because in nine months this new jar will have a child in it.
We have mixed all the ingredients needed.</p><p>This is how we reproduce."</p><p>The couple from Earth started laughing. They said, "Then tell us one
thing more</p><p>-- how do you prepare coffee?"</p><p>Then they both undressed and started making love! And the couple from
Earth went into hysterical laughter; they could not believe what was
happening. They were making coffee!</p><p>The Martians asked, "What are you laughing at? Why are you
laughing?"</p><p>They said, "Because this is the way we reproduce -- and you are
making coffee! So this is the coffee which you served us this
morning!"</p><p>Man has been trying to find some scientific way to reproduce so that
everything can become mechanical. Then even love will no longer be
private. Wisdom has already been taken over by the churches, the
universities; love is still a little bit private. Of course, the society
has dominated almost ninety-nine percent of it through marriage, through
all kinds of laws, through all kinds of legal bindings, but still
one-percent remains private. That too the society is not very happy
about; that has also to be encroached upon -- your love has also to be
taken away from you. Wisdom was taken away long ago, now love has to be
taken away. Then you are reduced to a machine, a servile machine, a
slave; then you will only repeat clichés.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 14</p><p>Chapter 1 - The goose is out!</p><p>A man rings at the chaplain's door. When the housekeeper opens the
door, the man says, "I am bringing you the twenty-four thousand liters
of oil you ordered"</p><p>The housekeeper is very surprised and asks the chaplain if he ordered
all those liters of oil.</p><p>The chaplain is even more surprised, but suddenly he remembers his
parrot. So he storms into the room and shouts, "Did you order
twenty-four thousand liters of oil?"</p><p>"No," says the parrot.</p><p>"Are you sure? Quite sure?" asks the chaplain. "Yes!" shrills the
parrot.</p><p>"Well, just wait!" replies the chaplain. "If I find out that you have
been lying, I'll nail you by your two wings to the wall!"</p><p>Sure enough, he soon discovers that it is the parrot that placed the
order, so he nails it to the wall.</p><p>After the parrot has been hanging there for a while, he sadly looks
out of the window and sees the crucifix in front of the church. He lifts
his head and says, "Well, Jesus, did you order twenty-four thousand
liters of oil too?"</p><p>Man has been reduced to a parrot. My sannyasins have to come out of
all these cages -- the cages that philosophy, theology, science and all
other kinds of things have created around you.</p><p>You have to come out of it all, IN toto -- not partially, not
gradually, not slowly, not tomorrow but now, at this very moment.</p><p>"Riko!"</p><p>"Yes, Master," said the official with a start. "See," said Nansen,
"the goose is out!"

I am not a good archer because I don't believe in targets and goals, so my arrows go everywhere except the target.\nThe last attempt:\nIt is the annual hunting season in heaven. Only the Holy Ghost is reluctant to participate --\nevery year up to now he has ended up with a shot in his bum.\nGod the Father finally convinces him to participate and promises to watch over him carefully. But just towards the end it happens again: there is a shot and the Holy Ghost jumps around in agony, hands on his lower back.\nIn rage, God the Father runs into the bushes and pulls Joseph out. \"Joseph!\" he screams,\n\"Will you never be able to forgive what he did with Mary?\" Osho - The Goose is Out\n31\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys 3\nNo peaks, no valleys\n3 March 1981 am in Buddha Hall The first question\nQuestion 1\nOSHO, YOU ARE CALLING FROM THE PEAK. I AM LOST IN THE ECHOING\nVALLEYS. HOW MAY I COME TO YOU?\nSwami Deva Rahaman, there are no peaks, no valleys; the whole idea is a fabrication.\nThere is no higher, no lower; there is no hierarchy in existence at all. It is just one cosmic whole, it is an organic unity.\nBut the egoist has always been trying to divide people into different categories: the ignorant, the enlightened; the sinners, the saints; the criminals, the virtuous; the notorious, the famous; the moral, the immoral. The game is the same: divide people and then try to belong to the higher category so you can pretend to be \"holier than thou.\"\nHence I want it to be continuously remembered by you that there are no peaks and there are no valleys; we all belong to one oceanic whole. The smallest blade of grass is as significant as the greatest star. They all participate in the same cosmic play, they all contribute to its beauty, to its joy, to its song, to its celebration. The existence will be less even if a small blade of grass is missing; there will be something lacking, there will be an emptiness.\nMy approach to life is non-divisive. My sannyasins are not my followers; they are not to imitate me, they are not to become me.\nHence, Deva Rahaman, don't use such language, don't use such concepts. Don't say:\nOSHO, YOU ARE CALLING FROM THE PEAK. I AM LOST IN THE ECHOING\nVALLEYS.\nThe peaks and the valleys are part of one whole: the peaks cannot exist without the valleys, the valleys cannot exist without the peaks. So who is important? Both are interdependent. Life is neither dependent nor independent, life is a continuum of interdependence. It is beautiful wherever you are, it is lovely to be whatsoever you are.\nThe desire to be on the peaks is a wrong desire -- all desires as such are wrong,\nand religious desires are far more wrong than any other desires for the simple reason that other desires can be fulfilled. Of course, by their fulfillment you will not go beyond frustration; fulfilled or not fulfilled, frustration is inevitable. If your desire is fulfilled you will be Osho - The Goose is Out\n32\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nfrustrated -- in fact, more so, because now you will see you were chasing a shadow; you have got it and there is nothing in it. If your desire is not fulfilled you will be frustrated, because your whole life is wasted and you have not been able to fulfill a single desire. All your hopes are shattered.\nHopes are bound to be shattered. To hope is to hanker for hopelessness, to desire is to breed frustration. But in the worldly things at least there is a possibility of succeeding, failing, attaining, not attaining. But in spiritual matters there is no question of attainment at all because the goose is out! Nothing can be done about it, it is already out. The moment you start enjoying your valley you are on the peak -- there is no other peak!\nOne day I suddenly decided enough is enough. I dropped the idea of the peaks and started enjoying the valley, and a miracle I saw: the valley disappeared. In fact, from the very beginning there had been no valley, I was always on the peak, but because I was searching for a peak I could not see where I was.\nYour eyes are focused far away, hence you miss the obvious. It is here, and your mind is there, arrowed into the blue sky. And the reality surrounds you: it is closer than your very heartbeat, it is closer than your breathing, it is closer than the circulation of your blood, it is closer than your very marrow, it is closer than your very consciousness. It is your very core, your very being!\nRahaman, don't ask for the peak, otherwise you will go on missing it. And the more you miss the more you will be in a vicious circle, because the more you miss the more you try to reach, the more you miss the greater the endeavor, the more you miss the more you become an American: \"Try it again and again, try hard.\" A simple conclusion: if you are missing that shows you are not trying hard enough, so put your total energy into it. And you will still be missing; there is no way to make it. You are trying for the impossible and the impossible does not happen; it cannot happen, it has never happened -- it is not in the nature of\nthings.\nBuddha says again and again: AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this IS the nature of things. Listen to the nature of things and you will never be in misery; try to improve upon it and you will live in hell. Hell is our creation, and we create hell by trying to do the impossible. Heaven is our nature, it is our spontaneity, it is where we always are.\nYou have heard the biblical story that God threw Adam and Eve out of his kingdom, the Garden of Eden. It is basically wrong; for two reasons it is wrong. First: the reason why he threw them out is very despotic -- they had not obeyed him. He seems to be a very ordinary daddy, too ordinary, fanatic! A small, childish rebellion, which is part of nature, part of growth... We should be immensely grateful to Adam and Eve because they disobeyed. That is the beginning of humanity, that is the beginning of revolution, that is the beginning of growth, of maturity, of freedom, of a sense of dignity. They revolted against being animals. All other animals were very good Catholics, all going to Church every Sunday, reading the Bible, following the commandments, following every order without ever questioning it. They are still doing the same, hence dogs have remained dogs, eagles have remained eagles, buffaloes have remained buffaloes, donkeys, howsoever saintly and holy they look, have remained donkeys. Only man has grown; his growth started with the rebellion.\nThe rebellion was simple -- every child has to go through it. A moment comes when the child has to say no, he has to insist on the no. In fact, unless a child learns to say no he will never be able to say yes; his yes will be impotent without a background of no. A fundamental Osho - The Goose is Out\n33\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nno is needed as a blackboard; only on that fundamental blackboard of no can he write a beautiful yes.\nGod denied man his fundamental right to say no, and in that very denial he denied man's ultimate growth to say yes. The whole story is fanatical, ugly.\nSecondly: where can you drive man out to? This whole existence is the Garden of Eden!\nThere is no other place, there is no other space, there is no other time. The whole universe is divine, so wherever you are you are in the Garden of Eden. The only thing that CAN be is: the idea has been implanted in man that you have to reach the Garden of Eden. You are in the Garden, and the idea that you have been thrown out of the Garden and you have to get back to the Garden is creating your trouble, your whole misery, your whole anguish. Not recognizing where you are, you are hankering for something which is not possible, because this is the place.\nTHIS VERY BODY THE BUDDHA.\nAND THIS VERY PLACE THE LOTUS PARADISE.\nThere is no other Buddhahood and there is no other Lotus Paradise. The word \"paradise\"\ncomes from the Persian FIRDAUS; FIRDAUS means a garden -- the same story, the Garden of Eden. Everybody is searching for a paradise. You can give it different names -- NIRVANA, enlightenment, SAMADHI, kingdom of God, ultimate truth -- you can go on giving it different names, but you will still be missing -- missing not because you have been thrown out of the Garden, but missing because you are in the Garden and you have fallen in a deep dreamlike state. The dream consists of your desires to reach somewhere else, to the peaks.\nMy insistence is that you are already there. Just sit silently and look around, sit silently and look within. You have never been anywhere else! AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this IS\nthe nature of things -- you cannot be anywhere else.\nA rose is a rose is a rose -- there is no other possibility -- but you can drive a rose crazy.\nYou can put the idea into the mind of the rose that \"You have to be a rose. What are you doing here? Wasting time, wasting a great opportunity. God has given you an opportunity to be a rose. What are you doing here? Swaying in the wind, dancing in the sun, taking life as fun? Be serious, be somber, become holy! Read the Koran, the Gita, the Bible,\" and you will have driven the rose crazy.\nIt is good that roses don't understand your language. It is good that they don't care a bit about what you are saying. It is good that they go on doing their thing\nwithout bothering at all about your politicians, your priests, your professors. That's why they are so beautiful, so innocent. Your priests cannot be so beautiful, they cannot be so innocent; they are bound to be cunning.\nAfter checking into the large motel complex, the evangelist read in his room for several hours, then sauntered over to the bar where he struck up a conversation with the pretty hat check girl. After she had finished working they shared a few drinks and then retired to his room. But when the evangelist began removing her blouse she seemed to have second thoughts. \"Are you sure this is all right?\" she asked. \"I mean, you are a holy man.\"\nOsho - The Goose is Out 34\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\n\"My dear, he replied, \"it is written in the Bible.\"\nShe took him at his word, and the two spent a very pleasant night together. The next morning, however, as the girl was preparing to leave, she said, \"You know, I don't remember the part of the Bible you mentioned last night. Could you show it to me?\"\nIn response, the evangelist took the Gideon Bible from the nightstand, opened the cover and pointed to the flyleaf on which someone had inscribed, \"The hat check girl screws.\"\nThese are your priests, your evangelists, your great spiritual leaders! They are neurotic and they are driving the whole of humanity neurotic. Avoid all spiritual nonsense -- and spiritual nonsense is REAL nonsense; all other nonsense is very ordinary, very mundane. In fact, with mundane matters you cannot be too nonsensical -- reality will prevent you -- but with religious nonsense there are no checks. There is no reality, no criterion, you cannot judge, so you can fly off into all kinds of esoteric bullshit.\nAnd your priests are such bullshitters, and for centuries they have been bullshitting on you!\nYou are crawling in holy cowdung! It is time to get out of it.\nDeva Rahaman, the way you are is the only way you can be. Accept it -- not only accept it but rejoice in it, love it, and the peak will start opening up within your very heart, and suddenly you will find you are awake in the Garden of Eden, immediately. It is not a question of going anywhere, just of being here.\nYou ask me:\nHOW MAY I COME TO YOU?\nThere is no need. You have to come to YOU, not to me. I am not here to create a new kind of neurosis. There are enough alternatives available! Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Jainism, Buddhism... three hundred religions in the world. You can choose your own kind of neurosis; they come in all shapes, in all sizes. You can easily pick any kind of fanaticism, neurosis, and that will keep you engaged your whole life -- but simply engaged.\nIt will not give you time or space to dance, to sing, to celebrate.\nAll kinds of goals basically create deep down in you a split, a hypocrisy. You are that which you are and you start trying to be that which you are not. In the beginning it is only an effort to be that which you are not; slowly slowly you start pretending too that you are becoming that which you are not, because to encounter failure continuously is very humiliating. At least you can pretend to others, you can wear masks, you can create a certain persona, a personality, a garb, a facade, and you can start living behind that facade. And people will look only at your mask and they will believe it, and once they start believing it --\nyou will start believing it -- because they are believing that you are holy, that you are saintly, that you are this and you are that.\nIt is a very strange game: you start it, and soon you will be caught in it yourself -\n- in your own lie! And once you are caught in your own lie you will try to hide the truth, to evade the truth, to repress the truth; you will begin investing more and more in your lie. You may be a marigold and you may invest your whole life in being a rose. You may be a rose and you may Osho - The Goose is Out\n35\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\ninvest your whole life in being a diamond -- which you cannot be. This is the sheer stupidity of the experience humanity has been living with for centuries.\nHence what I say hurts. It is not a question of small dimensions, it is a question of immense dimensions. For thousands of years man has lived a hypocritical life, utterly false, pseudo, and now to shatter his whole investment, to shatter his whole mind, certainly hurts.\nHence everybody is going to be against me except just a few people who are intelligent enough to wake up.\n\"My so-called liberal mother is really such a prude,\" the high-school cheerleader sadly told her locker partner. \"She said that I could only pet with my dates if they didn't touch me below the waist.\"\n\"Oh, that's too bad,\" her schoolmate commiserated. \"What do you intend to do about it?\"\n\"Well,\" the cheerleader giggled, \"the first thing I'm going to do is learn to stand on my head.\"\nThat's what your religious people have been doing: SIRSHASANA -- the art, the yoga of standing on your head. It certainly fulfills something: the ego. Whenever you can do something unnatural or at least pretend that you are doing it, it fulfills the ego. Nature cannot fulfill the ego. If you eat and enjoy eating, what is there to brag about? If you make love and you enjoy it, what is there to brag about? But if you become a celibate then there is something to brag about, if you fast then you have something which nobody else has. Then you can feel superior, higher, greater, bigger, chosen. The unnatural has an attraction, although it destroys your whole life, but the attraction is in the ego. And unless we drop this whole game of the ego, hypocrisy cannot disappear from the world.\nRabbi Goldstein had just moved into his apartment and decided he should get acquainted with his across-the-hall neighbor. When the door was opened, he was pleasantly surprised to be confronted by a young damsel considerably more than passing fair and considerably less than fully clad.\nThough justifiably flustered by this smiling apparition, the rabbi nevertheless managed a remark singularly appropriate to the occasion: \"Hi, I'm your new sugar across the hall -- can I borrow a cup of neighbor?\"\nYou can try to be unnatural, but your nature will assert itself in a thousand and one ways; it will come up again and again. You will have to hush it, you will have to repress it.\nIt was eight a.m. at a Las Vegas gambling palace and two lone bettors were still standing by a dice table awaiting further competition, when a lusciously endowed brunette attired in a suit happened by.\n\"Although it's quite early in the day,\" she announced, \"I feel lucky this morning. I'd like to roll the dice once for twenty thousand dollars. Would the two of you care to take me up on the wager?\"\nOsho - The Goose is Out 36\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\n\"Sure, lady,\" answered one of the men, \"we'll take your action.\"\n\"I hope you gentlemen won't mind,\" she then said, \"but the only way I can get lucky is to roll the dice without my panties on.\"\nSo saying, the lissome lovely proceeded to remove her slacks and panties. With a shout of\n\"Mamma needs a new pair of pants!\" she rolled the dice, gave a squeal of delight and yelled,\n\"I win!\" She then picked up her money, her slacks and her underwear and made a hasty exit from the room.\nThe two men exchanged double takes, and one of them blurted out, \"Hey, what did she roll anyway?\"\n\"How the hell should I know?\" snapped the other, \"I thought YOU were watching the dice!\"\nWe have created such a strange humanity, and the whole rationale of this whole mad earth, this mad humanity, is religious, spiritual. Search for the truth, search\nfor God, search for the peaks, and you have lost yourself in the search.\nThere is only one search -- to find yourself -- and for that you need not go anywhere else.\nFor that you have to withdraw from all your desires, ambitions, goals. You have to come back home.\nRahaman, you are not to become me. I am not your enemy -- I cannot tell you to become me. If you try to become me you will only be a carbon copy, a hypocrite, you will only be an imitation.\nThose who have gathered around me are not my followers, not my imitators -- just fellow companions, fellow celebrants, dance partners! Existence to me is a carnival, it is just a festival. It is for those who know how to dance. And the dance need not wait for tomorrow --\ntomorrow never comes -- the dance has to be now, here, this very moment. This very silence has to become the dance!\nSo don't hanker for any peaks, just be where you are totally, utterly, and the goose is out!\nHanker for the peaks, and the goose is in the bottle. Those peaks are the bottle, those goals are the bottle. They keep you encapsulated, they keep you imprisoned. The future is your bondage and the present is your freedom.\nHere I differ totally from Jesus, from Buddha, from Krishna, from Mahavira, from everybody else. Knowingly, unknowingly, they have created a pattern of imitation for humanity. I want to destroy this whole pattern, this whole status quo. I want you to be just yourself. Whatsoever you are, you are beautiful as you are; you need not be somebody else to be beautiful.\nThat's the only way to enjoy, but it is up to you. If you want to suffer... and there are people who love suffering, they cannot live without suffering; their only joy is in suffering and more suffering. The more they suffer the more they feel that they are doing something great.\nThen it is up to you; then don't make any fuss about it, then go to the peaks. But the peaks won't satisfy you because from those peaks you will again be looking\nfar ahead for further peaks. Osho - The Goose is Out 37\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nThe headmistress of a girls' boarding school was abruptly awakened one night by one of her students, a rather mature-looking sixteen-year-old. \"Miss Forbes,\" she cried, \"I've just been raped!\"\n\"Now, be calm, Melissa,\" the headmistress told her firmly. \"The first thing you must do is to go to the refrigerator and eat half a lemon.\"\n\"Half a lemon?\" asked the surprised student. \"Will that keep me from getting pregnant?\"\n\"No,\" admitted the headmistress, \"but it WILL get rid of that silly grin.\"\nThat's what religious people have been doing: removing all your smiles, making you look as sad as possible, as long-faced as possible.\nChristians say Jesus never laughed. If it is true, then whatsoever he has said is wrong. If what he has said is right then this cannot be true, because the man continuously says,\n\"Rejoice! I say to you again and again rejoice!\" And Christians say he never laughed!\nLaughter seems to be mundane for them, laughter seems to be worldly; it is not good for holy people. Holy people have to be continuously sad, hence they have created a long tradition of sad, ill, sick, pathological people whom they worship.\nThe more pathological you look the more you will be worshipped. The more you are a sadist and a masochist the more you will be worshipped. Torture yourself and teach others to torture themselves -- they call it asceticism -- become a monk, renounce the world...\nThe word \"monk\" means one who lives alone, escapes from people. And in fact\nit is relationship that is the opportunity to grow, it is love that is a challenge to growth, it is friendship that brings you to your real flavor. It is life in all its adventures, challenges, that helps you to become mature, integrated.\nMonks remain retarded, they remain stupid. They are bound to remain stupid -- they have been taken out of the soil of life. At the most they are greenhouse plants: bring them into the world and they will immediately shrink and die. They are very afraid people, continuously trembling, afraid of hell, which does not exist, greedy for heaven, which does not exist -- and between hell and heaven missing everything that does exist.\nThe inexperienced young man had heard that a good way to arouse sexual desire in a girl who proved impervious to the more usual forms of wooing was to forthrightly place her hand on his organ. Having parked with a date for more than an hour in the local lovers' lane with nothing to show for it but some sisterly kisses, he decided to try this new technique. The response was instantaneous: the girl berated him with the longest stream of invectives he had ever heard. Stunned, he tried to reply, but she refused to listen, insisting instead that he take her home at once.\nAs he pulled up in front of her house, she again started shouting imprecations. Finally out of breath, she demanded, \"Well, do you have anything to say for yourself?\"\n\"Yes, I have,\" was his pained reply. \"Please let go.\" The second question\nOsho - The Goose is Out 38\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys Question 2\nOSHO, I AM A HOMOSEXUAL CATHOLIC AND BADLY SUFFER FROM STUTTERING. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT OF MY MESS?\nGyaneshwar, the first thing you should get out of is your Catholicism; that is the real mess.\nHomosexuality is not such a big problem, it is not a problem at all, in fact. It is part of human freedom. There is nothing wrong if two persons choose a certain style of sexual relationship; it should be nobody's business. But the priests and the politicians are poking their noses into everything! They create guilt in you -- absolutely unnecessary.\nIf two men are in love, what is wrong in it? What harm are they doing to anybody? In fact, they look happier than the heterosexuals; that's why they are called \"gay.\" This is strange: I never see lesbians looking gay -- they look sad, they look very serious -- but homosexuals always look very gay, very sweet, really honey.\nI have been wondering what is the matter, why are lesbians not so happy? Maybe they cannot enjoy nagging, which has been an eternal joy for the woman. In fact, without their nagging I don't think anybody would ever have become religious. All your saints are the by-product of nagging. All your saints should be immensely grateful to women: they have driven them to be spiritual! They did not leave any possibility for them IN the world; they had to escape to the monasteries. They say they are going in search of God; in fact, they are simply going away from the wife. They were cowards.\nLesbians don't look very happy. Something is missing, and that something seems to be they cannot torture each other. They understand each other perfectly well, and because they understand each other very well there is no mystery left.\nMan lives in the head, the woman lives in the heart. The heart can rejoice only when there is something very mysterious, something like a koan: the goose in the bottle. Neither the bottle has to be broken nor the goose has to be killed, and it has to be taken out too. The heart enjoys the mysterious; the head is not interested in the mysterious, it is interested in the puzzling, in the riddling. Any riddle, any puzzle, and the head is interested. The approach of the head is logical.\nTo a man the woman is mysterious; to connect with the woman he has to come to his heart, and he lives in the head. Hence the woman always remains a trouble. He cannot understand her, he cannot explain what is happening, he\ncannot explain it away either. He has to live with a mystery, and that is a constant pain in his neck; it is beyond his grasp.\nBut with a man things are simple: both are logical. They understand the language, they understand logic, they understand mathematics, calculation. At the most the man is just a new question to be solved -- not a mystery to be lived but a question to be solved; a problem which can be solved, which is not impossible to solve. That keeps them interested, that keeps them intrigued. Hence I see homosexuals looking gay. Lesbians look very sad.\nAnd one more thing happens: homosexuals become more feminine and they start having a certain beauty, a certain \"niceness\" about them, a certain roundness, a grace. The lesbian becomes manly, she starts losing her feminine grace; she becomes masculine, aggressive, hard. Hence, Gyaneshwar, if you were a woman it would have been a problem and I would Osho - The Goose is Out\n39\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nhave helped you to come out of it. But you are a man. Why bother? Why make much out of a simple thing? If you are enjoying a relationship with a man, enjoy it!\nThe Christian God himself seems to be homosexual -- the whole trinity consists of three men. How they are managing it nobody knows -- not a single woman! Only the Holy Ghost is a little suspect -- maybe the Holy Ghost is bisexual? Ghosts can do any kind of thing!\nOtherwise the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost -- what kind of trinity is this? It is very homosexual! They have not allowed a single woman to be in it, just to keep out of trouble.\nOne woman would have destroyed the whole trinity; it would have become a real triangle!\nSo homosexuality is not a problem. We should start looking at real problems and should not be concerned about unreal problems. There are real problems to be solved. And this is a trick of the human mind: to create unreal problems so that you become occupied with them while real problems go on growing. And this is\nan old strategy: politicians, priests, so-called religious leaders go on giving you pseudo problems to solve so that you become occupied with the pseudo.\nThe problem in itself is meaningless, the problem is not a problem at all, but how much fuss has gone on down the ages about homosexuality! There are countries where people are still killed for homosexual acts, murdered, sentenced to jail for their whole lives. Strange world! This is a twentieth-century world? Homosexuality is not a problem at all; there are thousands of real problems to be solved. But man has to be kept engaged with toys.\nMy effort is to withdraw all your attention from toys so that you can focus on the real problems of life; and if you focus on the real problems of life they can be solved. Now, I don't see how homosexuality becomes a problem. How does it become a problem? Why should it be of concern to anybody? A love affair is two individuals' private concern; it is THEIR\nintimacy, it is not a social phenomenon.\nAnd, in fact, it will help the world population if more people turned homosexual. It will be good, very good for the world: less people will be born, the earth will be less burdened, there will be less poverty. Of course, less orphans and less Mother Teresas! There will be less need for contraceptives, birth control methods, sterilization, and of course the whole business of the Polack Pope will go out of his hands. That is his whole business! For one year continuously he has been talking against contraceptives, against birth control, sterilization, abortion.\nHomosexuality can solve all these problems simply!\nSo I don't see there is much of a problem in it. The only problem is your Catholicism.\nRodney, the eldest son of a respectable Boston family, announced to his shocked father that he intended to live with his swishy boyfriend on Beacon Hill.\n\"Damn it, Rodney,\" the parent responded, \"our family came over with John Winthrop, and we've never had a scandal such as this.\"\n\"I can't help it, father, I love him.\"\n\"But for God's sake, son, he's Catholic!\"\nThat is the true problem! Come out of your Catholicism. And when I say come out of your Catholicism, I mean come out of all kinds of stupid ideologies and start living life as if you Osho - The Goose is Out\n40\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nare Adam and Eve -- the first man on the earth, the first woman on the earth. Start afresh, from scratch.\nAnd as far as your stuttering is concerned, what is wrong in it? It may just be because you have made such a problem out of homosexuality that you are stuttering. Stuttering -- I have watched it in many people -- comes in a state of stress, tension.\nWhen I was a student in the university, my neighbor... a young man, beautiful man, healthy, in every way intelligent, and I had never seen him stuttering. Once his father visited him and he immediately started stuttering -- before the father. I could not believe what was happening. The moment the father left he was perfectly okay. I asked him.\nHe said, \"This is a problem. When I go back home, I cannot avoid stuttering before my father and mother. It happens... the more I try to avoid it the more it happens. Even when my father's letter comes and I start reading it, I suddenly feel a trembling. I cannot read my father's letter without stuttering. Otherwise I am perfectly okay.\"\nSo I said to him, \"So it is not a question of stuttering; there is some stress, some tension.\nThe father is heavy on you and he regresses you back towards your childhood, back to your old fears, and those fears start overcoming your intelligence.\"\nI said to him, \"Do one thing: next time your father comes, try to stutter with every word!\"\nHe said, \"How is that going to help?\"\nI said, \"You try. Don't try not to stutter, on the contrary try to stutter. Make every\neffort that not a single word should come out without stuttering!\"\nHe said, \"What are you suggesting? I have been doing just the opposite and have failed utterly, and your method seems to be such that it is bound to create more troubles for me!\"\nI said, \"Give it a try.\"\nAnd the father came, and I was there, and he tried it -- and he could not stutter!\nThere are a few things which happen only if you try; there are a few things which happen only if you DON'T try, because the very effort comes out of fear and if fear is the cause then the effort cannot help.\nHypnotherapists call it \"the law of the reverse effect.\"\nIf you are learning to ride a bicycle you may be on a sixty-foot-wide road, absolutely empty, nobody on the road, and then you see a milestone by the side of the road, and suddenly your cycle starts moving towards that milestone for no reason at all. You start feeling afraid, you try to avoid the milestone. Now, on a sixty-foot-wide road even a blind man has only a rare chance of hitting the milestone, but you will try hard, and the more you try the more you will become focused. Now the whole road disappears, there is only that milestone just standing there like Hanumanji, the monkey god, giggling at you, making faces at you, attracting you like a magnetic force. And you are doing every act that you can do to avoid it, but you are going... you know you are going. It is unavoidable! The more unavoidable you feel it is, the more energy you put into it. You become tense. The whole world has shrunken to Hanumanji... and the crash!\nThis is one of the fundamental laws of life. Homosexuality may be the cause, but it is not homosexuality really but your attitude to it, your approach to it. You are making a problem out of it; then there will be trouble.\nOsho - The Goose is Out 41\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nMy suggestion, Gyaneshwar, is: stutter beautifully -- make stuttering songs! You will enjoy, others will enjoy, and that's what we are here for.\n\"Have faith and ye shall be healed!\" intoned the evangelist at the revival meeting. A woman on crutches and a man came forward. The evangelist asked, \"What is your name, my good woman?\"\n\"I'm Mrs. Smith,\" she answered, \"and I haven't been able to walk without crutches for twenty years.\"\n\"Well, Mrs. Smith,\" he said, \"go behind that screen and pray.\" Turning to the man, he asked, \"What is your name?\"\n\"My name ith Thamuelth,\" he answered, \"and I have alwayth thpoken with a lithp.\"\n\"All right, Mr. Samuels,\" the evangelist said, \"go behind that screen with Mrs. Smith and pray.\"\nAfter several minutes had passed, the revivalist announced, \"I think the time has come.\nWitness these miracles. Mrs. Smith, throw your left crutch over the screen.\" The audience gasped as it sailed over. \"Mrs. Smith, throw your right crutch over the screen.\" The crowd cheered as the second crutch appeared.\nEncouraged, the evangelist commanded, \"Mr. Samuels, say something in a loud, clear voice, so we can all hear you.\"\nSamuels answered, \"Mithuth Sthmith jutht fell on her ath!\"\nSo what is wrong in it? It is a far greater miracle! So don't be worried about unnecessary things. Stutter joyously, enjoy it, and there is a possibility that you may stop stuttering --\nbeware of it! If you don't want to stop it then don't listen to me, you just go on trying not to stutter.\nMy suggestion is stutter, and don't be a miser. Fill the whole place with\nstuttering!\nWhomsoever you meet, stutter -- don't miss an opportunity. Even the words that you can speak well don't speak well, stutter! And you may be surprised that once you relax, once you start enjoying, once the tension is dropped, stuttering may disappear. If it disappears, good; if it does not disappear there is no harm in it. It is innocent!\nTake life as easily as possible. But people don't understand me. I say to them, \"Life is a mystery. It is not to be solved but to be lived.\" And somebody has asked me, \"Osho, when you said that, I heard, \"Life is a MISERY, not to be solved but to be lived.\" That is up to you. To me it is a mystery, not to be solved but to be lived, but you can hear it as \"misery.\"\nDon't make unnecessary problems for yourself, so that your whole energy can become focused on the essential problem. And the essential problem is only one: Know thyself.\nThe last question Question 3\nOsho - The Goose is Out 42\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nOSHO, I AM IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN GOING TO THE MOON. THIS\nLONGING HAS ALWAYS HAUNTED ME AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. CAN\nYOU TELL ME ONE OR TWO JOKES ABOUT THE MOON?\nGandharva, perhaps that's why you have come to me -- my name means the moon. You are moonstruck; that means you are a lunatic! \"Lunatic\" simply means struck by the moon... and this is a gathering of mad people. You have come to the moon! Your long-cherished desire is fulfilled... the goose is out!\nBut I have two jokes for you:\nShortly after his spaceship landed on the moon, the astronaut debarked and began exploring the strange new terrain. He had walked for only fifteen minutes when he came upon a lovely young moon girl who was busily stirring an empty pot with a stick.\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself, \"I'm an astronaut here to discover things about the moon.\"\nThe moon girl stopped stirring long enough to throw him quite a pleasant smile. \"How nice it is that you are formed just like our moon men,\" she observed. Throwing off her clothes, she asked, \"And am I structured as are Earth women?\"\n\"Yes, you are,\" answered the now excited astronaut. \"But tell me, why do you stir that pot?\"\n\"I'm making a baby,\" she said. And, sure enough, a few minutes later a baby appeared in the pot.\n\"Now would you like to see how we make babies on Earth?\" asked the astronaut. The girl agreed, and the astronaut proceeded with his passionate demonstration.\n\"That was enjoyable,\" she said afterward, \"but where is the baby?\" \"Oh, that takes nine months,\" explained the astronaut.\n\"Nine months?\" she asked. \"Then why did you stop stirring?\"\nA small group of scientists had spent an enlightening week on the moon comparing life there with our own.\n\"Tell me,\" one Earth scientist asked his moon counter-part, \"just how do you reproduce the species here on this planet?\"\n\"I shall be pleased to demonstrate,\" replied the leader of the moon group, and he called forth a voluptuous moon beauty with three heads. They then engaged their tentacles for a few moments, and almost at once a small pouch began to form on the female's back; it grew, and within little more than a minute it opened up very much like a blooming flower, and a small moon child dropped out, as fully\ndeveloped as the adults but much smaller, and began scampering about the room.\nOnce the Earth scientists had recovered from this unexpected experience they attempted to explain how procreation differs in our world. The Moonians insisted upon being shown, and after unsuccessful attempts to dissuade them, the chief scientist of the expedition finally Osho - The Goose is Out\n43\nChapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys\nagreed. Choosing a comely scientific aide from the group, he took her to a cot in the corner of the room and there proceeded to make love to her in a manner to which we here on Earth are more accustomed.\nThe Moonians examined the couple from every angle, and when they were finished, their leader said, \"That was certainly unusual and, I must say, interesting, but where is the baby --\nor was the demonstration a failure?\"\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied the Earth scientist. \"We cannot tell at once. But if the contact was successful, then the baby will arrive in approximately nine months.\"\n\"Nine months!\" exclaimed the Moonian. \"Amazing! But tell us then, doctor, if the Earth child will not be born for nine months, why were you in such a hurry there at the end?\"\nOsho - The Goose is Out 44\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6987","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_goose_is_out/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_goose_is_out/>The Goose is Out</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 2 - Just see it</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6987 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Goose_is_Out/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

targets and goals, so my arrows go everywhere except the target.</p><p>The last attempt:</p><p>It is the annual hunting season in heaven. Only the Holy Ghost is
reluctant to participate --</p><p>every year up to now he has ended up with a shot in his bum.</p><p>God the Father finally convinces him to participate and promises to
watch over him carefully. But just towards the end it happens again:
there is a shot and the Holy Ghost jumps around in agony, hands on his
lower back.</p><p>In rage, God the Father runs into the bushes and pulls Joseph out.
"Joseph!" he screams,</p><p>"Will you never be able to forgive what he did with Mary?" Osho - The
Goose is Out</p><p>31</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys 3</p><p>No peaks, no valleys</p><p>3 March 1981 am in Buddha Hall The first question</p><p>Question 1</p><p>OSHO, YOU ARE CALLING FROM THE PEAK. I AM LOST IN THE ECHOING</p><p>VALLEYS. HOW MAY I COME TO YOU?</p><p>Swami Deva Rahaman, there are no peaks, no valleys; the whole idea is
a fabrication.</p><p>There is no higher, no lower; there is no hierarchy in existence at
all. It is just one cosmic whole, it is an organic unity.</p><p>But the egoist has always been trying to divide people into different
categories: the ignorant, the enlightened; the sinners, the saints; the
criminals, the virtuous; the notorious, the famous; the moral, the
immoral. The game is the same: divide people and then try to belong to
the higher category so you can pretend to be "holier than thou."</p><p>Hence I want it to be continuously remembered by you that there are
no peaks and there are no valleys; we all belong to one oceanic whole.
The smallest blade of grass is as significant as the greatest star. They
all participate in the same cosmic play, they all contribute to its
beauty, to its joy, to its song, to its celebration. The existence will
be less even if a small blade of grass is missing; there will be
something lacking, there will be an emptiness.</p><p>My approach to life is non-divisive. My sannyasins are not my
followers; they are not to imitate me, they are not to become me.</p><p>Hence, Deva Rahaman, don't use such language, don't use such
concepts. Don't say:</p><p>OSHO, YOU ARE CALLING FROM THE PEAK. I AM LOST IN THE ECHOING</p><p>VALLEYS.</p><p>The peaks and the valleys are part of one whole: the peaks cannot
exist without the valleys, the valleys cannot exist without the peaks.
So who is important? Both are interdependent. Life is neither dependent
nor independent, life is a continuum of interdependence. It is beautiful
wherever you are, it is lovely to be whatsoever you are.</p><p>The desire to be on the peaks is a wrong desire -- all desires as
such are wrong,</p><p>and religious desires are far more wrong than any other desires for
the simple reason that other desires can be fulfilled. Of course, by
their fulfillment you will not go beyond frustration; fulfilled or not
fulfilled, frustration is inevitable. If your desire is fulfilled you
will be Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>32</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>frustrated -- in fact, more so, because now you will see you were
chasing a shadow; you have got it and there is nothing in it. If your
desire is not fulfilled you will be frustrated, because your whole life
is wasted and you have not been able to fulfill a single desire. All
your hopes are shattered.</p><p>Hopes are bound to be shattered. To hope is to hanker for
hopelessness, to desire is to breed frustration. But in the worldly
things at least there is a possibility of succeeding, failing,
attaining, not attaining. But in spiritual matters there is no question
of attainment at all because the goose is out! Nothing can be done about
it, it is already out. The moment you start enjoying your valley you are
on the peak -- there is no other peak!</p><p>One day I suddenly decided enough is enough. I dropped the idea of
the peaks and started enjoying the valley, and a miracle I saw: the
valley disappeared. In fact, from the very beginning there had been no
valley, I was always on the peak, but because I was searching for a peak
I could not see where I was.</p><p>Your eyes are focused far away, hence you miss the obvious. It is
here, and your mind is there, arrowed into the blue sky. And the reality
surrounds you: it is closer than your very heartbeat, it is closer than
your breathing, it is closer than the circulation of your blood, it is
closer than your very marrow, it is closer than your very consciousness.
It is your very core, your very being!</p><p>Rahaman, don't ask for the peak, otherwise you will go on missing it.
And the more you miss the more you will be in a vicious circle, because
the more you miss the more you try to reach, the more you miss the
greater the endeavor, the more you miss the more you become an American:
"Try it again and again, try hard." A simple conclusion: if you are
missing that shows you are not trying hard enough, so put your total
energy into it. And you will still be missing; there is no way to make
it. You are trying for the impossible and the impossible does not
happen; it cannot happen, it has never happened -- it is not in the
nature of</p><p>things.</p><p>Buddha says again and again: AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this IS the
nature of things. Listen to the nature of things and you will never be
in misery; try to improve upon it and you will live in hell. Hell is our
creation, and we create hell by trying to do the impossible. Heaven is
our nature, it is our spontaneity, it is where we always are.</p><p>You have heard the biblical story that God threw Adam and Eve out of
his kingdom, the Garden of Eden. It is basically wrong; for two reasons
it is wrong. First: the reason why he threw them out is very despotic --
they had not obeyed him. He seems to be a very ordinary daddy, too
ordinary, fanatic! A small, childish rebellion, which is part of nature,
part of growth... We should be immensely grateful to Adam and Eve
because they disobeyed. That is the beginning of humanity, that is the
beginning of revolution, that is the beginning of growth, of maturity,
of freedom, of a sense of dignity. They revolted against being animals.
All other animals were very good Catholics, all going to Church every
Sunday, reading the Bible, following the commandments, following every
order without ever questioning it. They are still doing the same, hence
dogs have remained dogs, eagles have remained eagles, buffaloes have
remained buffaloes, donkeys, howsoever saintly and holy they look, have
remained donkeys. Only man has grown; his growth started with the
rebellion.</p><p>The rebellion was simple -- every child has to go through it. A
moment comes when the child has to say no, he has to insist on the no.
In fact, unless a child learns to say no he will never be able to say
yes; his yes will be impotent without a background of no. A fundamental
Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>33</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>no is needed as a blackboard; only on that fundamental blackboard of
no can he write a beautiful yes.</p><p>God denied man his fundamental right to say no, and in that very
denial he denied man's ultimate growth to say yes. The whole story is
fanatical, ugly.</p><p>Secondly: where can you drive man out to? This whole existence is the
Garden of Eden!</p><p>There is no other place, there is no other space, there is no other
time. The whole universe is divine, so wherever you are you are in the
Garden of Eden. The only thing that CAN be is: the idea has been
implanted in man that you have to reach the Garden of Eden. You are in
the Garden, and the idea that you have been thrown out of the Garden and
you have to get back to the Garden is creating your trouble, your whole
misery, your whole anguish. Not recognizing where you are, you are
hankering for something which is not possible, because this is the
place.</p><p>THIS VERY BODY THE BUDDHA.</p><p>AND THIS VERY PLACE THE LOTUS PARADISE.</p><p>There is no other Buddhahood and there is no other Lotus Paradise.
The word "paradise"</p><p>comes from the Persian FIRDAUS; FIRDAUS means a garden -- the same
story, the Garden of Eden. Everybody is searching for a paradise. You
can give it different names -- NIRVANA, enlightenment, SAMADHI, kingdom
of God, ultimate truth -- you can go on giving it different names, but
you will still be missing -- missing not because you have been thrown
out of the Garden, but missing because you are in the Garden and you
have fallen in a deep dreamlike state. The dream consists of your
desires to reach somewhere else, to the peaks.</p><p>My insistence is that you are already there. Just sit silently and
look around, sit silently and look within. You have never been anywhere
else! AIS DHAMMO SANANTANO -- this IS</p><p>the nature of things -- you cannot be anywhere else.</p><p>A rose is a rose is a rose -- there is no other possibility -- but
you can drive a rose crazy.</p><p>You can put the idea into the mind of the rose that "You have to be a
rose. What are you doing here? Wasting time, wasting a great
opportunity. God has given you an opportunity to be a rose. What are you
doing here? Swaying in the wind, dancing in the sun, taking life as fun?
Be serious, be somber, become holy! Read the Koran, the Gita, the
Bible," and you will have driven the rose crazy.</p><p>It is good that roses don't understand your language. It is good that
they don't care a bit about what you are saying. It is good that they go
on doing their thing</p><p>without bothering at all about your politicians, your priests, your
professors. That's why they are so beautiful, so innocent. Your priests
cannot be so beautiful, they cannot be so innocent; they are bound to be
cunning.</p><p>After checking into the large motel complex, the evangelist read in
his room for several hours, then sauntered over to the bar where he
struck up a conversation with the pretty hat check girl. After she had
finished working they shared a few drinks and then retired to his room.
But when the evangelist began removing her blouse she seemed to have
second thoughts. "Are you sure this is all right?" she asked. "I mean,
you are a holy man."</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 34</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>"My dear, he replied, "it is written in the Bible."</p><p>She took him at his word, and the two spent a very pleasant night
together. The next morning, however, as the girl was preparing to leave,
she said, "You know, I don't remember the part of the Bible you
mentioned last night. Could you show it to me?"</p><p>In response, the evangelist took the Gideon Bible from the
nightstand, opened the cover and pointed to the flyleaf on which someone
had inscribed, "The hat check girl screws."</p><p>These are your priests, your evangelists, your great spiritual
leaders! They are neurotic and they are driving the whole of humanity
neurotic. Avoid all spiritual nonsense -- and spiritual nonsense is REAL
nonsense; all other nonsense is very ordinary, very mundane. In fact,
with mundane matters you cannot be too nonsensical -- reality will
prevent you -- but with religious nonsense there are no checks. There is
no reality, no criterion, you cannot judge, so you can fly off into all
kinds of esoteric bullshit.</p><p>And your priests are such bullshitters, and for centuries they have
been bullshitting on you!</p><p>You are crawling in holy cowdung! It is time to get out of it.</p><p>Deva Rahaman, the way you are is the only way you can be. Accept it
-- not only accept it but rejoice in it, love it, and the peak will
start opening up within your very heart, and suddenly you will find you
are awake in the Garden of Eden, immediately. It is not a question of
going anywhere, just of being here.</p><p>You ask me:</p><p>HOW MAY I COME TO YOU?</p><p>There is no need. You have to come to YOU, not to me. I am not here
to create a new kind of neurosis. There are enough alternatives
available! Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Jainism, Buddhism...
three hundred religions in the world. You can choose your own kind of
neurosis; they come in all shapes, in all sizes. You can easily pick any
kind of fanaticism, neurosis, and that will keep you engaged your whole
life -- but simply engaged.</p><p>It will not give you time or space to dance, to sing, to
celebrate.</p><p>All kinds of goals basically create deep down in you a split, a
hypocrisy. You are that which you are and you start trying to be that
which you are not. In the beginning it is only an effort to be that
which you are not; slowly slowly you start pretending too that you are
becoming that which you are not, because to encounter failure
continuously is very humiliating. At least you can pretend to others,
you can wear masks, you can create a certain persona, a personality, a
garb, a facade, and you can start living behind that facade. And people
will look only at your mask and they will believe it, and once they
start believing it --</p><p>you will start believing it -- because they are believing that you
are holy, that you are saintly, that you are this and you are that.</p><p>It is a very strange game: you start it, and soon you will be caught
in it yourself -</p><p>- in your own lie! And once you are caught in your own lie you will
try to hide the truth, to evade the truth, to repress the truth; you
will begin investing more and more in your lie. You may be a marigold
and you may invest your whole life in being a rose. You may be a rose
and you may Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>35</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>invest your whole life in being a diamond -- which you cannot be.
This is the sheer stupidity of the experience humanity has been living
with for centuries.</p><p>Hence what I say hurts. It is not a question of small dimensions, it
is a question of immense dimensions. For thousands of years man has
lived a hypocritical life, utterly false, pseudo, and now to shatter his
whole investment, to shatter his whole mind, certainly hurts.</p><p>Hence everybody is going to be against me except just a few people
who are intelligent enough to wake up.</p><p>"My so-called liberal mother is really such a prude," the high-school
cheerleader sadly told her locker partner. "She said that I could only
pet with my dates if they didn't touch me below the waist."</p><p>"Oh, that's too bad," her schoolmate commiserated. "What do you
intend to do about it?"</p><p>"Well," the cheerleader giggled, "the first thing I'm going to do is
learn to stand on my head."</p><p>That's what your religious people have been doing: SIRSHASANA -- the
art, the yoga of standing on your head. It certainly fulfills something:
the ego. Whenever you can do something unnatural or at least pretend
that you are doing it, it fulfills the ego. Nature cannot fulfill the
ego. If you eat and enjoy eating, what is there to brag about? If you
make love and you enjoy it, what is there to brag about? But if you
become a celibate then there is something to brag about, if you fast
then you have something which nobody else has. Then you can feel
superior, higher, greater, bigger, chosen. The unnatural has an
attraction, although it destroys your whole life, but the attraction is
in the ego. And unless we drop this whole game of the ego, hypocrisy
cannot disappear from the world.</p><p>Rabbi Goldstein had just moved into his apartment and decided he
should get acquainted with his across-the-hall neighbor. When the door
was opened, he was pleasantly surprised to be confronted by a young
damsel considerably more than passing fair and considerably less than
fully clad.</p><p>Though justifiably flustered by this smiling apparition, the rabbi
nevertheless managed a remark singularly appropriate to the occasion:
"Hi, I'm your new sugar across the hall -- can I borrow a cup of
neighbor?"</p><p>You can try to be unnatural, but your nature will assert itself in a
thousand and one ways; it will come up again and again. You will have to
hush it, you will have to repress it.</p><p>It was eight a.m. at a Las Vegas gambling palace and two lone bettors
were still standing by a dice table awaiting further competition, when a
lusciously endowed brunette attired in a suit happened by.</p><p>"Although it's quite early in the day," she announced, "I feel lucky
this morning. I'd like to roll the dice once for twenty thousand
dollars. Would the two of you care to take me up on the wager?"</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 36</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>"Sure, lady," answered one of the men, "we'll take your action."</p><p>"I hope you gentlemen won't mind," she then said, "but the only way I
can get lucky is to roll the dice without my panties on."</p><p>So saying, the lissome lovely proceeded to remove her slacks and
panties. With a shout of</p><p>"Mamma needs a new pair of pants!" she rolled the dice, gave a squeal
of delight and yelled,</p><p>"I win!" She then picked up her money, her slacks and her underwear
and made a hasty exit from the room.</p><p>The two men exchanged double takes, and one of them blurted out,
"Hey, what did she roll anyway?"</p><p>"How the hell should I know?" snapped the other, "I thought YOU were
watching the dice!"</p><p>We have created such a strange humanity, and the whole rationale of
this whole mad earth, this mad humanity, is religious, spiritual. Search
for the truth, search</p><p>for God, search for the peaks, and you have lost yourself in the
search.</p><p>There is only one search -- to find yourself -- and for that you need
not go anywhere else.</p><p>For that you have to withdraw from all your desires, ambitions,
goals. You have to come back home.</p><p>Rahaman, you are not to become me. I am not your enemy -- I cannot
tell you to become me. If you try to become me you will only be a carbon
copy, a hypocrite, you will only be an imitation.</p><p>Those who have gathered around me are not my followers, not my
imitators -- just fellow companions, fellow celebrants, dance partners!
Existence to me is a carnival, it is just a festival. It is for those
who know how to dance. And the dance need not wait for tomorrow --</p><p>tomorrow never comes -- the dance has to be now, here, this very
moment. This very silence has to become the dance!</p><p>So don't hanker for any peaks, just be where you are totally,
utterly, and the goose is out!</p><p>Hanker for the peaks, and the goose is in the bottle. Those peaks are
the bottle, those goals are the bottle. They keep you encapsulated, they
keep you imprisoned. The future is your bondage and the present is your
freedom.</p><p>Here I differ totally from Jesus, from Buddha, from Krishna, from
Mahavira, from everybody else. Knowingly, unknowingly, they have created
a pattern of imitation for humanity. I want to destroy this whole
pattern, this whole status quo. I want you to be just yourself.
Whatsoever you are, you are beautiful as you are; you need not be
somebody else to be beautiful.</p><p>That's the only way to enjoy, but it is up to you. If you want to
suffer... and there are people who love suffering, they cannot live
without suffering; their only joy is in suffering and more suffering.
The more they suffer the more they feel that they are doing something
great.</p><p>Then it is up to you; then don't make any fuss about it, then go to
the peaks. But the peaks won't satisfy you because from those peaks you
will again be looking</p><p>far ahead for further peaks. Osho - The Goose is Out 37</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>The headmistress of a girls' boarding school was abruptly awakened
one night by one of her students, a rather mature-looking
sixteen-year-old. "Miss Forbes," she cried, "I've just been raped!"</p><p>"Now, be calm, Melissa," the headmistress told her firmly. "The first
thing you must do is to go to the refrigerator and eat half a
lemon."</p><p>"Half a lemon?" asked the surprised student. "Will that keep me from
getting pregnant?"</p><p>"No," admitted the headmistress, "but it WILL get rid of that silly
grin."</p><p>That's what religious people have been doing: removing all your
smiles, making you look as sad as possible, as long-faced as
possible.</p><p>Christians say Jesus never laughed. If it is true, then whatsoever he
has said is wrong. If what he has said is right then this cannot be
true, because the man continuously says,</p><p>"Rejoice! I say to you again and again rejoice!" And Christians say
he never laughed!</p><p>Laughter seems to be mundane for them, laughter seems to be worldly;
it is not good for holy people. Holy people have to be continuously sad,
hence they have created a long tradition of sad, ill, sick, pathological
people whom they worship.</p><p>The more pathological you look the more you will be worshipped. The
more you are a sadist and a masochist the more you will be worshipped.
Torture yourself and teach others to torture themselves -- they call it
asceticism -- become a monk, renounce the world...</p><p>The word "monk" means one who lives alone, escapes from people. And
in fact</p><p>it is relationship that is the opportunity to grow, it is love that
is a challenge to growth, it is friendship that brings you to your real
flavor. It is life in all its adventures, challenges, that helps you to
become mature, integrated.</p><p>Monks remain retarded, they remain stupid. They are bound to remain
stupid -- they have been taken out of the soil of life. At the most they
are greenhouse plants: bring them into the world and they will
immediately shrink and die. They are very afraid people, continuously
trembling, afraid of hell, which does not exist, greedy for heaven,
which does not exist -- and between hell and heaven missing everything
that does exist.</p><p>The inexperienced young man had heard that a good way to arouse
sexual desire in a girl who proved impervious to the more usual forms of
wooing was to forthrightly place her hand on his organ. Having parked
with a date for more than an hour in the local lovers' lane with nothing
to show for it but some sisterly kisses, he decided to try this new
technique. The response was instantaneous: the girl berated him with the
longest stream of invectives he had ever heard. Stunned, he tried to
reply, but she refused to listen, insisting instead that he take her
home at once.</p><p>As he pulled up in front of her house, she again started shouting
imprecations. Finally out of breath, she demanded, "Well, do you have
anything to say for yourself?"</p><p>"Yes, I have," was his pained reply. "Please let go." The second
question</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 38</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys Question 2</p><p>OSHO, I AM A HOMOSEXUAL CATHOLIC AND BADLY SUFFER FROM STUTTERING.
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT OF MY MESS?</p><p>Gyaneshwar, the first thing you should get out of is your
Catholicism; that is the real mess.</p><p>Homosexuality is not such a big problem, it is not a problem at all,
in fact. It is part of human freedom. There is nothing wrong if two
persons choose a certain style of sexual relationship; it should be
nobody's business. But the priests and the politicians are poking their
noses into everything! They create guilt in you -- absolutely
unnecessary.</p><p>If two men are in love, what is wrong in it? What harm are they doing
to anybody? In fact, they look happier than the heterosexuals; that's
why they are called "gay." This is strange: I never see lesbians looking
gay -- they look sad, they look very serious -- but homosexuals always
look very gay, very sweet, really honey.</p><p>I have been wondering what is the matter, why are lesbians not so
happy? Maybe they cannot enjoy nagging, which has been an eternal joy
for the woman. In fact, without their nagging I don't think anybody
would ever have become religious. All your saints are the by-product of
nagging. All your saints should be immensely grateful to women: they
have driven them to be spiritual! They did not leave any possibility for
them IN the world; they had to escape to the monasteries. They say they
are going in search of God; in fact, they are simply going away from the
wife. They were cowards.</p><p>Lesbians don't look very happy. Something is missing, and that
something seems to be they cannot torture each other. They understand
each other perfectly well, and because they understand each other very
well there is no mystery left.</p><p>Man lives in the head, the woman lives in the heart. The heart can
rejoice only when there is something very mysterious, something like a
koan: the goose in the bottle. Neither the bottle has to be broken nor
the goose has to be killed, and it has to be taken out too. The heart
enjoys the mysterious; the head is not interested in the mysterious, it
is interested in the puzzling, in the riddling. Any riddle, any puzzle,
and the head is interested. The approach of the head is logical.</p><p>To a man the woman is mysterious; to connect with the woman he has to
come to his heart, and he lives in the head. Hence the woman always
remains a trouble. He cannot understand her, he cannot explain what is
happening, he</p><p>cannot explain it away either. He has to live with a mystery, and
that is a constant pain in his neck; it is beyond his grasp.</p><p>But with a man things are simple: both are logical. They understand
the language, they understand logic, they understand mathematics,
calculation. At the most the man is just a new question to be solved --
not a mystery to be lived but a question to be solved; a problem which
can be solved, which is not impossible to solve. That keeps them
interested, that keeps them intrigued. Hence I see homosexuals looking
gay. Lesbians look very sad.</p><p>And one more thing happens: homosexuals become more feminine and they
start having a certain beauty, a certain "niceness" about them, a
certain roundness, a grace. The lesbian becomes manly, she starts losing
her feminine grace; she becomes masculine, aggressive, hard. Hence,
Gyaneshwar, if you were a woman it would have been a problem and I would
Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>39</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>have helped you to come out of it. But you are a man. Why bother? Why
make much out of a simple thing? If you are enjoying a relationship with
a man, enjoy it!</p><p>The Christian God himself seems to be homosexual -- the whole trinity
consists of three men. How they are managing it nobody knows -- not a
single woman! Only the Holy Ghost is a little suspect -- maybe the Holy
Ghost is bisexual? Ghosts can do any kind of thing!</p><p>Otherwise the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost -- what kind of
trinity is this? It is very homosexual! They have not allowed a single
woman to be in it, just to keep out of trouble.</p><p>One woman would have destroyed the whole trinity; it would have
become a real triangle!</p><p>So homosexuality is not a problem. We should start looking at real
problems and should not be concerned about unreal problems. There are
real problems to be solved. And this is a trick of the human mind: to
create unreal problems so that you become occupied with them while real
problems go on growing. And this is</p><p>an old strategy: politicians, priests, so-called religious leaders go
on giving you pseudo problems to solve so that you become occupied with
the pseudo.</p><p>The problem in itself is meaningless, the problem is not a problem at
all, but how much fuss has gone on down the ages about homosexuality!
There are countries where people are still killed for homosexual acts,
murdered, sentenced to jail for their whole lives. Strange world! This
is a twentieth-century world? Homosexuality is not a problem at all;
there are thousands of real problems to be solved. But man has to be
kept engaged with toys.</p><p>My effort is to withdraw all your attention from toys so that you can
focus on the real problems of life; and if you focus on the real
problems of life they can be solved. Now, I don't see how homosexuality
becomes a problem. How does it become a problem? Why should it be of
concern to anybody? A love affair is two individuals' private concern;
it is THEIR</p><p>intimacy, it is not a social phenomenon.</p><p>And, in fact, it will help the world population if more people turned
homosexual. It will be good, very good for the world: less people will
be born, the earth will be less burdened, there will be less poverty. Of
course, less orphans and less Mother Teresas! There will be less need
for contraceptives, birth control methods, sterilization, and of course
the whole business of the Polack Pope will go out of his hands. That is
his whole business! For one year continuously he has been talking
against contraceptives, against birth control, sterilization,
abortion.</p><p>Homosexuality can solve all these problems simply!</p><p>So I don't see there is much of a problem in it. The only problem is
your Catholicism.</p><p>Rodney, the eldest son of a respectable Boston family, announced to
his shocked father that he intended to live with his swishy boyfriend on
Beacon Hill.</p><p>"Damn it, Rodney," the parent responded, "our family came over with
John Winthrop, and we've never had a scandal such as this."</p><p>"I can't help it, father, I love him."</p><p>"But for God's sake, son, he's Catholic!"</p><p>That is the true problem! Come out of your Catholicism. And when I
say come out of your Catholicism, I mean come out of all kinds of stupid
ideologies and start living life as if you Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>40</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>are Adam and Eve -- the first man on the earth, the first woman on
the earth. Start afresh, from scratch.</p><p>And as far as your stuttering is concerned, what is wrong in it? It
may just be because you have made such a problem out of homosexuality
that you are stuttering. Stuttering -- I have watched it in many people
-- comes in a state of stress, tension.</p><p>When I was a student in the university, my neighbor... a young man,
beautiful man, healthy, in every way intelligent, and I had never seen
him stuttering. Once his father visited him and he immediately started
stuttering -- before the father. I could not believe what was happening.
The moment the father left he was perfectly okay. I asked him.</p><p>He said, "This is a problem. When I go back home, I cannot avoid
stuttering before my father and mother. It happens... the more I try to
avoid it the more it happens. Even when my father's letter comes and I
start reading it, I suddenly feel a trembling. I cannot read my father's
letter without stuttering. Otherwise I am perfectly okay."</p><p>So I said to him, "So it is not a question of stuttering; there is
some stress, some tension.</p><p>The father is heavy on you and he regresses you back towards your
childhood, back to your old fears, and those fears start overcoming your
intelligence."</p><p>I said to him, "Do one thing: next time your father comes, try to
stutter with every word!"</p><p>He said, "How is that going to help?"</p><p>I said, "You try. Don't try not to stutter, on the contrary try to
stutter. Make every</p><p>effort that not a single word should come out without
stuttering!"</p><p>He said, "What are you suggesting? I have been doing just the
opposite and have failed utterly, and your method seems to be such that
it is bound to create more troubles for me!"</p><p>I said, "Give it a try."</p><p>And the father came, and I was there, and he tried it -- and he could
not stutter!</p><p>There are a few things which happen only if you try; there are a few
things which happen only if you DON'T try, because the very effort comes
out of fear and if fear is the cause then the effort cannot help.</p><p>Hypnotherapists call it "the law of the reverse effect."</p><p>If you are learning to ride a bicycle you may be on a sixty-foot-wide
road, absolutely empty, nobody on the road, and then you see a milestone
by the side of the road, and suddenly your cycle starts moving towards
that milestone for no reason at all. You start feeling afraid, you try
to avoid the milestone. Now, on a sixty-foot-wide road even a blind man
has only a rare chance of hitting the milestone, but you will try hard,
and the more you try the more you will become focused. Now the whole
road disappears, there is only that milestone just standing there like
Hanumanji, the monkey god, giggling at you, making faces at you,
attracting you like a magnetic force. And you are doing every act that
you can do to avoid it, but you are going... you know you are going. It
is unavoidable! The more unavoidable you feel it is, the more energy you
put into it. You become tense. The whole world has shrunken to
Hanumanji... and the crash!</p><p>This is one of the fundamental laws of life. Homosexuality may be the
cause, but it is not homosexuality really but your attitude to it, your
approach to it. You are making a problem out of it; then there will be
trouble.</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 41</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>My suggestion, Gyaneshwar, is: stutter beautifully -- make stuttering
songs! You will enjoy, others will enjoy, and that's what we are here
for.</p><p>"Have faith and ye shall be healed!" intoned the evangelist at the
revival meeting. A woman on crutches and a man came forward. The
evangelist asked, "What is your name, my good woman?"</p><p>"I'm Mrs. Smith," she answered, "and I haven't been able to walk
without crutches for twenty years."</p><p>"Well, Mrs. Smith," he said, "go behind that screen and pray."
Turning to the man, he asked, "What is your name?"</p><p>"My name ith Thamuelth," he answered, "and I have alwayth thpoken
with a lithp."</p><p>"All right, Mr. Samuels," the evangelist said, "go behind that screen
with Mrs. Smith and pray."</p><p>After several minutes had passed, the revivalist announced, "I think
the time has come.</p><p>Witness these miracles. Mrs. Smith, throw your left crutch over the
screen." The audience gasped as it sailed over. "Mrs. Smith, throw your
right crutch over the screen." The crowd cheered as the second crutch
appeared.</p><p>Encouraged, the evangelist commanded, "Mr. Samuels, say something in
a loud, clear voice, so we can all hear you."</p><p>Samuels answered, "Mithuth Sthmith jutht fell on her ath!"</p><p>So what is wrong in it? It is a far greater miracle! So don't be
worried about unnecessary things. Stutter joyously, enjoy it, and there
is a possibility that you may stop stuttering --</p><p>beware of it! If you don't want to stop it then don't listen to me,
you just go on trying not to stutter.</p><p>My suggestion is stutter, and don't be a miser. Fill the whole place
with</p><p>stuttering!</p><p>Whomsoever you meet, stutter -- don't miss an opportunity. Even the
words that you can speak well don't speak well, stutter! And you may be
surprised that once you relax, once you start enjoying, once the tension
is dropped, stuttering may disappear. If it disappears, good; if it does
not disappear there is no harm in it. It is innocent!</p><p>Take life as easily as possible. But people don't understand me. I
say to them, "Life is a mystery. It is not to be solved but to be
lived." And somebody has asked me, "Osho, when you said that, I heard,
"Life is a MISERY, not to be solved but to be lived." That is up to you.
To me it is a mystery, not to be solved but to be lived, but you can
hear it as "misery."</p><p>Don't make unnecessary problems for yourself, so that your whole
energy can become focused on the essential problem. And the essential
problem is only one: Know thyself.</p><p>The last question Question 3</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 42</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>OSHO, I AM IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN GOING TO THE MOON. THIS</p><p>LONGING HAS ALWAYS HAUNTED ME AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. CAN</p><p>YOU TELL ME ONE OR TWO JOKES ABOUT THE MOON?</p><p>Gandharva, perhaps that's why you have come to me -- my name means
the moon. You are moonstruck; that means you are a lunatic! "Lunatic"
simply means struck by the moon... and this is a gathering of mad
people. You have come to the moon! Your long-cherished desire is
fulfilled... the goose is out!</p><p>But I have two jokes for you:</p><p>Shortly after his spaceship landed on the moon, the astronaut
debarked and began exploring the strange new terrain. He had walked for
only fifteen minutes when he came upon a lovely young moon girl who was
busily stirring an empty pot with a stick.</p><p>"Hi," he said, introducing himself, "I'm an astronaut here to
discover things about the moon."</p><p>The moon girl stopped stirring long enough to throw him quite a
pleasant smile. "How nice it is that you are formed just like our moon
men," she observed. Throwing off her clothes, she asked, "And am I
structured as are Earth women?"</p><p>"Yes, you are," answered the now excited astronaut. "But tell me, why
do you stir that pot?"</p><p>"I'm making a baby," she said. And, sure enough, a few minutes later
a baby appeared in the pot.</p><p>"Now would you like to see how we make babies on Earth?" asked the
astronaut. The girl agreed, and the astronaut proceeded with his
passionate demonstration.</p><p>"That was enjoyable," she said afterward, "but where is the baby?"
"Oh, that takes nine months," explained the astronaut.</p><p>"Nine months?" she asked. "Then why did you stop stirring?"</p><p>A small group of scientists had spent an enlightening week on the
moon comparing life there with our own.</p><p>"Tell me," one Earth scientist asked his moon counter-part, "just how
do you reproduce the species here on this planet?"</p><p>"I shall be pleased to demonstrate," replied the leader of the moon
group, and he called forth a voluptuous moon beauty with three heads.
They then engaged their tentacles for a few moments, and almost at once
a small pouch began to form on the female's back; it grew, and within
little more than a minute it opened up very much like a blooming flower,
and a small moon child dropped out, as fully</p><p>developed as the adults but much smaller, and began scampering about
the room.</p><p>Once the Earth scientists had recovered from this unexpected
experience they attempted to explain how procreation differs in our
world. The Moonians insisted upon being shown, and after unsuccessful
attempts to dissuade them, the chief scientist of the expedition finally
Osho - The Goose is Out</p><p>43</p><p>Chapter 3 - No peaks, no valleys</p><p>agreed. Choosing a comely scientific aide from the group, he took her
to a cot in the corner of the room and there proceeded to make love to
her in a manner to which we here on Earth are more accustomed.</p><p>The Moonians examined the couple from every angle, and when they were
finished, their leader said, "That was certainly unusual and, I must
say, interesting, but where is the baby --</p><p>or was the demonstration a failure?"</p><p>"It is difficult to say," replied the Earth scientist. "We cannot
tell at once. But if the contact was successful, then the baby will
arrive in approximately nine months."</p><p>"Nine months!" exclaimed the Moonian. "Amazing! But tell us then,
doctor, if the Earth child will not be born for nine months, why were
you in such a hurry there at the end?"</p><p>Osho - The Goose is Out 44</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

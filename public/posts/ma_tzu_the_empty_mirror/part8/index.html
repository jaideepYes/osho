OUR BELOVED MASTER,
A MONK ONCE DREW FOUR LINES IN FRONT OF MA TZU. THE TOP LINE WAS LONG AND THE REMAINING THREE WERE SHORT. HE THEN DEMANDED OF THE MASTER, “BESIDES SAYING THAT ONE LINE IS LONG AND THE OTHER THREE ARE SHORT, WHAT ELSE COULD YOU SAY?”

GO AND ASK CHIZO.”\nTHE MONK WENT AND ASKED CHIZO, WHO SAID, “WHY DON’T YOU ASK THE MASTER?” “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU,” SAID THE MONK.\n“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU; GO AND ASK HYAKUJO.”\nTHE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF REALLY DON’T KNOW.”\nTHE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”\nManeesha, before I discuss Ma Tzu and his statements, I have to inaugurate another god to Avirbhava’s Museum of Gods. This is a very important god. I will tell you about the god before Avirbhava brings it in front of you.\nThe name of the god is horse. It has been worshipped around the world for centuries. Even today there are places where the horse is worshipped as a god.\n“The horse or mare is one of the forms of the corn spirit in Europe.\n“In Ancient Greece, Artemis and Aphrodite were associated with the horse, and Cronus is said to have taken the form of a horse.\n“In Gaul, there was a horse goddess called Epona and a horse god called Rudiobus.\n“The goddess mares, Medb of Tara and Macha of Ulster, were thought to have powers of the dead.\n“Horse worship also existed in Persia, where white horses were regarded as holy. In the Teutonic regions they were kept in holy enclosures.\n“Here, in India, in earlier times, horses were sanctified, and the cult exists still today. Koda Pen is the horse god of the Gonds.”\nIn ancient India horses were not only worshipped, they were also sacrificed to please God. It was not only horses who were sacrificed; cows were killed, even man was killed as a sacrifice. For cows, the ritual was called gomedh – go means cow. For horses, the ritual was called ashvamedh. Ashva means horse, medh means killing. For man the ritual was called naramedh. Nar means man and medh means killing.\nAnd these are the people who go on making a great fuss about stopping cow slaughter. They have slaughtered even man in the name of God. They themselves have slaughtered cows, horses, in the name of God. Sacrificing a living man in the name of God is very symbolic. To me it has more significance than just an ordinary sacrifice. The whole of humanity has been sacrificed by all the religions in the name of God.\nYou are living a crippled life because of the religions. They have not killed you, but they have not left you alive either. They have crippled you. They have cut you into parts. Certain parts in you have to be removed. Certain parts in you are worshipped, certain parts are condemned. Your wholeness is not accepted by any religion in the world. These religions are thought to be very intelligent, and they are worshipping animals of all kinds!\nThe first Hindu incarnation of God is the fish. Of course in Bengal, fish is eaten as something holy; rice and fish are their basic foods. The whole of Bengal stinks of fish. Every house has beautiful trees, even the poorest, and a beautiful pond in which they grow and cultivate fish. The scene is beautiful, very green. Nowhere is it so green as in Bengal, and every house has a pond, a big pond surrounded by big trees. You can know the riches of the family by the size of their pond. The richer families have vast ponds, and costly fishes are eaten in the name of God.\nIt is so easy to kill anything in the name of God. The name of God is a very protective shelter.\nYou will be surprised to know that when the Britishers came to India, they first captured Bengal, and Calcutta was their capital. Their first Indian servants, from the lowest to the highest, were all Bengalis. And because they were all stinking of fish, they started calling them “Babu.” Babu is a Persian word which means a man who stinks. But because they were government servants, on high posts, “Babu” became very respectable. Now to call somebody Babu is very respectful, honorable.\nThe first president of India, Doctor Rajendra Prasad, was always called Babu Rajendra Prasad. And even that president had no idea that Babu is a dirty word. But people have forgotten the connotation. Bu means smell, and ba means really bad smell.\nIn Hinduism not only the fish was an incarnation of God. There was the tortoise, there was the pig, there was the lion, and a strange lion – half lion, half man – narasinha; the upper part of the body is of the lion, and the lower part of the body is of man. And people have worshipped them. One just wonders whether humanity is mad. Something is certainly insane.\nAnd the last incarnation of God which is going to come is going to be a white horse. His name will be Kalki. And that white horse will save the virtuous and will destroy the sinners and will change the whole course of human history – a horse!\nAnd all these idiots who believe in these things will be sitting by the side watching. The tenth incarnation of God is called Kalki. He is to come to judge the world at the end of this yuga, the fourth\nand last cycle of one million, eight hundred thousand years in the Hindu concept of the world. He will destroy the wicked, reward the good, and enable Vishnu, the Hindu God, to create a new world.\nIn Buddhism, the horse represents the indestructible, the hidden nature of things. The winged or cosmic horse, called “Cloud,” is a form of Avalokiteshvara. It is an incarnation of Gautam Buddha.\nI am allowing these animal gods in this campus to make you aware of your past. And it is not passed completely, it is still hidden in your mind.\nIn Varanasi... it is a strange place, it is the ancientmost city in the world. Because of its being so ancient its streets are very small, because in those days there was no need for buses and trucks and cars to move. Even a rickshaw hardly manages to move through the streets.\nIt is thought to be a great virtue to take an ox and leave it in the city of Varanasi. The city of Varanasi is thought to be the city of the God Vishnu, and he loves cows. So in the city of Varanasi you will find more cows than men, and you cannot remove a cow that is standing in the street. You go on honking your horn and those gods are not going to listen to such ordinary human beings. Go on honking... they will just stand there without bothering.\nYou have to get down and push them to the side. You cannot hit them otherwise you will be killed. It will be hurting the Hindu religious feelings. They enter into shops, into vegetable shops, and they start eating. You cannot stop them. They are no ordinary people, they are VVIPs!\nVaranasi, in the whole world...\n(AT THIS MOMENT RIPPLES OF LAUGHTER SPREAD THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY AS A WHITE HORSE ENTERS THE AUDITORIUM THROUGH THE DOOR TO THE LEFT OF THE PODIUM, GALLOPS AROUND IT AND DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT.)\nSo, Avirbhava, you can come back, your horse is introduced. Come back to your seat. (GREAT APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE.)\nNow, Maneesha’s statements about Ma Tzu and his work:\nMA TZU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MASTERS TO USE A SPECIFICALLY ZEN TECHNIQUE IN TEACHING; THAT IS, THROUGH LIVING, NOT PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS. BY INDICATING THE ABSOLUTE IN THE RELATIVE – A RELATIVE WITHOUT RELIGIOUS DOGMA, ROMANCE, SYMBOLISM, OR INTELLECTUALISM, BUT WITH A DEEP SENSE OF THE EXISTENTIAL VALUE OF A THING – MA TZU BROUGHT ZEN INTO THE REALM OF ORDINARY, DAY-TO-DAY LIVING.\nHis contribution to Zen is immense. He brought it down from the heights to where you are. About Ma Tzu it can be said, just as it is said about Mohammed... Mohammed is reported to have said that if the thirsty will not come to the well, the well is going to go to the thirsty.\nTo go to the heights of buddhas is really an arduous thing. They shine forth like a full moon in the sky, and a tremendous longing arises in you to reach to the same heights. But there is a great fear\nof insecurity, of danger, of those mountainous regions where you will be alone. Many who want to reach to those heights think twice before they take their first step.\nMa Tzu saw this and he introduced something which was never known before. He came down from the mountains to the marketplace. He said, “The marketplace cannot change me, so why avoid it? I am going to change the marketplace. Sitting on my heights, I will not be able to change thousands of people. And if when it is possible I go to the people themselves, just as ordinary as they are, communication will be easier.”\nHence he dropped all philosophical teachings. He brought new devices, more in tune with the earth, not in tune with the sky, more in tune with the ordinary human activities. Once he has got hold of you, he will take you to the heights. But the first question is to take hold of you.\nHe is the first master in the history of Zen who has shown such compassion. He also introduced beating for the first time. That too is part of his compassion. His beating has to be understood because it will come again and again. He is beating you to wake you up. There is no need to go anywhere to find the buddha. The buddha is fast asleep within you. He just needs a little awakening. The beating was out of pure love and compassion.\nIt is very difficult for other religions in the world to understand: “What kind of teaching is this? Teach about God, teach about heaven and hell and virtues and ten commandments.” To them it will look... it does look almost crazy.\nBut Ma Tzu helped far more people to become enlightened than any other master. The end result shows that his devices worked.\nA MONK ONCE DREW FOUR LINES IN FRONT OF MA TZU. THE TOP LINE WAS LONG AND THE REMAINING THREE WERE SHORT. HE THEN DEMANDED OF THE MASTER, “BESIDES SAYING THAT ONE LINE IS LONG AND THE OTHER THREE ARE SHORT, WHAT ELSE COULD YOU SAY?”\nMA TZU DREW ONE LINE ON THE GROUND AND SAID, “THIS COULD BE CALLED EITHER LONG OR SHORT. THAT IS MY ANSWER.”\nIt reminds me of an incident in a court of a great Indian emperor, Akbar. One day he came into the court and drew a line on the wall and told all the members of his court... and he had collected the most wise people from all parts of the country into his court; it must have been the richest court in the world as far as wisdom is concerned. He had all the great artists, musicians, dancers – anybody who was at the top was invited to be part of his court.\nHe asked the court members, “Can you make this line smaller without touching it?” It looks like a Zen koan. How can you make it smaller without touching it? You will have to touch it, only then you can make it smaller. That seems to be obvious.\nBut one man laughed. He was the court joker, Birbal. Every court in the ancient days used to have a court joker, just to keep the court playful, nonserious. There were serious problems, but the joker would always keep it cool; he would cut a joke, and all the heat would disappear, and people would\ncome to their senses. Birbal perhaps is one of the most well known men, who had an immense sense of humor; but he was also a wise man. He stood up and he went to the wall and drew a bigger line above the small line that Akbar had drawn. And he said, “I have made it small without touching it” – because small, or long, or short, are all relative terms.\nIn itself you can draw a line... that’s what Ma Tzu is doing, drawing a line. And he says, “You can call it either long or short.” It is a question of relativity. If you are comparing it with a longer line, it is short; if you are comparing it with a shorter line, it is long. In itself it is just what it is. Relativity is a comparison with something else.\nWhy Ma Tzu did it has to be understood. And particularly now that Albert Einstein has introduced the theory of relativity in the scientific sphere, it has become more important to understand Ma Tzu’s meaning. He is saying, “Everyone is just himself, neither great nor small – because that greatness or smallness comes from relativity – neither beautiful nor ugly. Everyone is simply just himself.”\nYou can bring a taller man by his side and he becomes smaller, but he remains the same. Only relatively, conceptually, intellectually, can you see that he is smaller, but he has not changed even an inch. You can bring a pygmy by his side and suddenly he has become taller, and he has not changed a bit. What he is saying is that relativity is a dangerous concept to be applied to human beings.\nIt is relativity that makes some people big, great, famous, celebrities. Some people live in obscurity, some people are just nobodies. This is relativity; otherwise everybody is just himself, it does not make any difference. There is no question of inequality, everybody is unique. The person who is nobody is happy in his nobodiness. But this concept of relativity drives people mad. Everybody is trying to climb higher on the ladder, to become somebody special. And even the most special people are hankering for so many things which they are missing.\nFor example, Napoleon was one of the world conquerors. But he was suffering from a great inferiority complex because of his height – he was only five feet five inches tall. Even his bodyguards were over six feet and he felt very much embarrassed – on both sides bodyguards, and bodyguards are chosen particularly to be strong, tall. He looked just like a small child in comparison to his own bodyguards, and this was very embarrassing.\nOne day he was trying to fix a picture on the wall, but his reach was just a little bit short, he could not reach the picture. His bodyguard said, “Your honor, you need not bother about it. I am higher than you, I can do it without any difficulty.”\nNapoleon said, “I will shoot you. Change your word ‘higher’. You are simply taller than me, not higher.”\nThe poor bodyguard could not see why he had become so angry. He had touched the very soft spot in his unconscious. Higher? – nobody is higher. At the most you can say, physiologically, that you are taller. But Napoleon suffered immensely. Every time he saw a taller man, he was in immense misery.\nYou cannot have all the things in the world. There will be poets, there will be musicians, whose very touch is golden. There will be wrestlers whose bodies are almost a work of art. You cannot have\nall these things. Relatively, everybody is inferior in comparison to somebody else. You can find out to whom you are inferior, and you will find so many people to whom you are inferior. Somebody is a great flutist and you don’t know which side of the flute to put in your mouth. Somebody is a great mathematician... miraculous mathematicians have happened.\nIn India, just in this century, there were two people; one was Shankaran, a rickshaw wallah in Madras. Just by chance a professor in the Madras university took his rickshaw and on the way the rickshaw wallah asked him, “What do you teach in the university?”\nHe was an Englishman. He said, “I am a professor of mathematics.”\nThe rickshaw wallah said, “Mathematics? That is my special subject. You just tell me any number, multiplied by any other number, and before you have ended your question I will answer it.” And he did it.\nThe professor could not believe his own eyes and ears. The number that he had given to be multiplied by another number would have taken the greatest mathematician at least three minutes. Without going through the whole process, he had simply answered. And the professor had to work it out, whether his answer was right or wrong – and it was right.\nHe took him to the university. Shankaran convinced all the professors that he had an intuitive grasp. Asked how he managed it, he said he did not know. “Just as you ask, a number appears on the screen of my mind, and I simply repeat that number. I don’t know any process, I am not educated.”\nThe professor took him around the world as a show of intuitive mathematics – to Oxford, to Cambridge – and everywhere he was a celebrity. An uneducated rickshaw wallah – and great mathematicians like Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, they simply could not believe it.\nBertrand Russell has written the greatest book on mathematics. Just to explain two plus two is four, he has taken two hundred and forty pages. And this man – you give him any number to multiply or any kind of question, and he immediately writes the answer on the board. He goes through no process.\nAnd then there is another woman, her name is Shakuntala, and I think she is still alive – and strangely from the same place, Madras. She has been around the world showing her intuitive capacity for mathematics.\nEven great mathematicians have felt childish next to these people; they are not educated, they know nothing of mathematics, but they can make the greatest mathematicians feel inferior.\nIf you are going to compare, if you are going to think around, you will find thousands of people who will make you inferior. And you cannot do anything about it. You cannot be the greatest dancer, you cannot be the greatest mathematician, you cannot be the greatest poet, you cannot be the greatest painter; you cannot have all the greatness in the world at the same time.\nThe very idea of thinking in relativity about human beings is absurd. You are just yourself. Just be authentically yourself, without any comparison. No inferiority arises; no superiority arises. You are simply relaxed as you are. And whatever you are doing, you do your best, with joy and creativity.\nMa Tzu’s answer... he DREW ONE LINE ON THE GROUND AND SAID, “THIS COULD BE CALLED EITHER LONG OR SHORT. THAT IS MY ANSWER.”\nIt depends with what you are comparing it. But why compare in the first place?\nRelativity is perfectly good in scientific fields. It is absolutely wrong in the world of humanity. Human beings are not mathematical digits; human beings are unique. Everyone – however he is, whatever he is – has just to bring his potentiality to its totality, its profundity, to clean it and bring it to blossom. It does not matter whether it is a wildflower or a roseflower. What matters is flowering, bringing your potentiality to its uttermost height.\nAnd that will bring you joy and peace, and a rest, a relaxation with the universe. You will be in tune, and there will be no turmoil in your mind – how to become this, how to become that. How to be the richest person, how to be the most famous – all that is garbage; and it is driving thousands of people mad, unnecessarily mad.\nThey could be the most beautiful people if they were not thinking in terms of relativity. If they were satisfied with themselves and their potential, and they were working to bring their potential to its uttermost height, without any comparison to anyone – this is the only way a man can be psychologically healthy.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST?”\nThis is a traditional question in Zen, asked thousands of times, asked to hundreds of different masters by thousands of disciples; and every time a different answer.\nMa Tzu is not going to give any philosophical answer.\nThe philosophically oriented masters can give much meaning to Bodhidharma’s coming from India to China – remember that in China, India is the West.\nBodhidharma brought Gautam Buddha’s message, and he transformed the whole of China into a great love affair with Buddha. He did not create an organized religion, he simply spread the fragrance of Buddhism. No organized church, but everybody is allowed to drink from the well of Buddha, and quench his thirst. No priest exists in Buddhism – there is no need of the priest. He is a hindrance, not a bridge. You can be a buddha yourself, just by going within yourself. No priest is needed for that.\nChina was so happy to hear the message, “You are a buddha; you just don’t understand your interiority, your subjectivity.”\nSo much can be said about “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST?”\nBut MA TZU REPLIED, “AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”\nMa Tzu was a strange master with strange methods. Rather than answering the question, he turns the question into another question. He changes the whole thing.\nHe asks, “AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”\nAGAIN THE MONK ASKED THE QUESTION, AND MA TZU STRUCK HIM, SAYING, “IF I DIDN’T STRIKE YOU, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT ME.”\nA strange anecdote, but Ma Tzu is right. He is saying, “The whole meaning of Gautam Buddha and his message is you. Bodhidharma came here to wake you up. Rather than philosophizing about it, I will do exactly the same as Bodhidharma did.\nAT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”\nThat comes as a shock, because the monk was not thinking that somebody would ask this question. AGAIN THE MONK ASKED THE QUESTION, AND MA TZU STRUCK HIM, SAYING, “IF I DIDN’T\nSTRIKE YOU, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT ME – because you are the meaning, and you are asking it. You are the buddha, and you are asking where the buddha is. If I don’t strike you, for centuries people will laugh about me.”\nE OF ROKUTAN ASKED MA TZU THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST.\nMA TZU SAID, “LOWER YOUR VOICE AND COME A LITTLE NEARER!”\nE WENT NEARER. MA TZU STRUCK HIM ONCE, AND SAID, “SIX EARS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PLAN. COME ANOTHER DAY.”\nThe man could not understand. He is asking a traditionally simple question, “What was the meaning of Bodhidharma’s coming to China?” And Ma Tzu is answering it in two ways: first, “Lower your voice!”\nThe man must have asked as if the answer is not possible. The man must have asked with a great ego, expecting that Ma Tzu is going to accept defeat.\nSaying to him, “Lower your voice!” simply means, “Be quiet, be silent, be humble, because in your humbleness you will find the answer; in your silence you will find the meaning.”\nAnd, “Come a little nearer!” The man did not understand the meaning of coming a little nearer. He is saying, “Be a little more intimate with me, come a little closer to my heart, be a little more open. Don’t just stand there closed, and with a great ego. Be humble and come closer.”\nBut he did not understand the meaning either of lowering the voice, or of coming a little nearer. He went nearer – physically.\nMA TZU STRUCK HIM ONCE, AND SAID, “SIX EARS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PLAN. COME\nANOTHER DAY – you have not understood today, but who knows? – COME ANOTHER DAY. It is enough for today that I have given you a good hit. Think over it.”\nAnd “SIX EARS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PLAN.”\nHere you are thousands of ears, but behind your ears everybody has a different plan. So come another day and drop your plan. If you come with a prejudice, with an answer already within you, you cannot understand me.\nHere we don’t work philosophically. This is not the place for intellectuals. For that you can go anywhere, to any monastery where scriptures are thought to lead you to your inner nature. But if you want to hear the answer from me, come another day. For today it is enough.\nLATER, E WENT TO THE HALL AND SAID, “I IMPLORE YOU TO TELL ME!”\nMA TZU SAID TO HIM, “GO AWAY FOR A TIME AND COME TO THE HALL AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, AND I’LL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”\nE THEREUPON WAS ENLIGHTENED. HE SAID, “I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR CONFIRMATION,” AND MARCHED ROUND THE HALL ONCE, AND WENT OFF.\nEverything around Ma Tzu is very mysterious. The man did not go, he followed Ma Tzu to the assembly hall. And again in the assembly hall he repeated it, but now, just within a few moments, he was a different person. He said, “I IMPLORE YOU TO TELL ME!”\nThat old egoist of a few moments before is no longer there. The voice has become one of imploring, of humbleness.\nMA TZU SAID TO HIM, “GO AWAY FOR A TIME AND COME TO THE HALL AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, AND I WILL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”\nHe has not given the answer, but he has given something else. He is asking him to go away, “and come here only when you have a chance of getting the answer. That means when you have meditated over it, dropped all your preconceptions, when you don’t have any idea what is the answer. That will be your chance. Then you can come, AND I WILL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”\nBecause he has asked with humbleness, the man must have been of great intelligence. Time does not make any sense; why not do it now? So he dropped – that is not written in the anecdote, that cannot be written, it is something that is happening within him – he dropped all his notions. And as he dropped all his notions, there was no need for any answer for him.\nIt is a strange situation. When the question disappears, there is no need for the answer either. That is all mental gymnastics. Seeing the truth, that the master is not going to get involved in intellectual conversation... Perhaps there is no way to intellectually explain the meaning of Bodhidharma’s coming to the West. It is something that can be transmitted only when you are utterly silent and without any questions. Then a flame, a fire can jump from the master’s heart. And that actually happened.\nE THEREUPON WAS ENLIGHTENED. HE SAID, “I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR\nCONFIRMATION,” AND MARCHED ROUND THE HALL ONCE, which is a sign of reverence, AND WENT OFF.\nON A LATER OCCASION, ANOTHER MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “PLEASE TRANSCEND THE FOUR SAYINGS AND REFRAIN FROM THE HUNDRED NEGATIONS, AND TELL ME THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST.”\nMA TZU SAID, “TODAY I’M TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU. GO AND ASK CHIZO.”\nChizo was one of his nearest disciples.\nTHE MONK WENT AND ASKED CHIZO, WHO SAID, “WHY DON’T YOU ASK THE MASTER?” “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU,” SAID THE MONK.\n“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU; GO AND ASK\nHYAKUJO.” Hyakujo was the second most intimate disciple of Ma Tzu.\nTHE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF REALLY DON’T KNOW.”\nTHE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”\nNow the question is completely forgotten. Nobody has answered it. On the contrary, Hyakujo has accepted that he himself does not know what the answer is.\nThe white cap and the black cap refer to an old story of two robbers. One of the robbers wore a white cap, while the other wore a black cap. As the story goes, the one with the black cap was more ruthless and radical than the one with the white. So it was that Hyakujo was said to be more radical than Chizo in his methods of dealing with young monks.\nMa Tzu said that he was very tired. “TODAY I AM TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU.” The fact is, whether you are tired or not, you can’t tell it. The meaning of Bodhidharma is an experience, it is not an explanation. But to be humble, Ma Tzu did not say, “Nothing can be said about it.” On the contrary, he took the whole responsibility on himself. “TODAY I’M TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU. GO AND ASK CHIZO.”\nHe took this opportunity also to check upon Chizo and Hyakujo. He knew that Chizo would not be able to answer, neither would Hyakujo. This question in Zen is one of those unanswerable things which can only be experienced. There is no way to bring them to words. The man went to Chizo, who said, “Why don’t you ask the master? Why bother me? I am just a disciple.”\nBut the monk said, “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU”\n“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU; GO AND ASK HYAKUJO.”\nTHE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF REALLY DON’T KNOW.”\nTHE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”\nThat is referring to the story of those two robbers. The robber who used to use the black cap was a radical revolutionary. And Ma Tzu says that Hyakujo’s cap is black. It is a tremendous statement to say that you don’t know, it needs guts to accept your ignorance. Chizo’s cap is white. He is trying to hide – as if he knows, but because he has a great headache, today he cannot say it.\nMa Tzu worked in strange ways. Now he has worked with a single question on three persons: on the monk who has brought the question, on Chizo, who is trying to hide his ignorance, on Hyakujo, who comes out with his radical answer, “I don’t know.”\n“I don’t know” is the greatest answer in the whole experience of humanity.\nSocrates said, “I don’t know,” at the very last moment of his life. His whole life he was teaching the truth, and at the last moment he said, “I don’t know.” At the last moment he becomes really humble, and he sees the greatness of truth and its miraculousness, its inexpressibility – and that what he had been doing was just playing with words all his life. Now, no more; he is going to die within a few minutes. The poison is being prepared. At least the world should know that Socrates, before dying, uttered his honest answer, “I don’t know. I don’t know anything about anything. I am just as innocent and ignorant as a child.”\nBut this is the highest peak of wisdom. When you don’t know, the mind is empty, you have arrived at the empty heart. When you know, the mind is full. Knowledge is the greatest barrier in reaching to the universal, to the immortal, to the eternal truth. Knowledge is the greatest barrier, which is preventing you from recognizing your buddha-nature.\nChizo was closer to Ma Tzu but he did not get the succession. Hyakujo was chosen to be the successor. When Ma Tzu died... before dying he declared Hyakujo. Nobody was expecting that; everybody knew that Chizo would be the successor. But Hyakujo was chosen for the simple reason that he had the guts to express his ignorance, his innocence.\nThe statement “I don’t know,” is the greatest statement anybody can make. It makes your heart completely empty. Here in our meditations we are doing exactly this. My whole effort is to take away all your knowledge, because it is all borrowed, and unnecessarily you are carrying it. It does not allow your heart to be empty, and only an empty heart is capable of falling in tune with the universal heart. From that point life becomes a celebration.\nSoseki wrote,\nTHIS PIECE OF WILD LAND HAS NO BOUNDARIES –\nNORTH, SOUTH, EAST OR WEST.\nIT IS HARD TO SEE EVEN THE TREE\nIN THE MIDDLE OF IT. TURNING YOUR HEAD\nYOU CAN LOOK BEYOND EACH DIRECTION.\nFOR THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW THAT YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU.\nWhen you go inwards there is no east, no west, no south, no north; just pure space, in all directions the same. You have gone to your very roots, and now you know for the first time that all these many lives your eyes have been deceiving you because they were keeping you attached to the objects of the outside. They were not allowing you to enter into yourself. You were kept engaged in something outside – money, knowledge, respectability.\nThere are thousands of ways to keep you engaged so that you don’t turn inwards. Life is being managed by the society in such a way that from the very beginning you are forced to remain engaged. It becomes a habit. If you don’t have anything to do, you find something to do. I know people... on Sundays they are in the most uncomfortable position – nothing to do! They may open an old grandfather clock to repair it – it was working already. Or they may go to the car and open the bonnet, and the car is functioning perfectly well – but it is something to do. They may read the same newspaper again.\nI used to live with a relative for a few days. He was retired and he used to read the same newspaper from the morning till the night. And I would say, “How many times do you read your newspaper?”\nHe said, “It is not a question of reading. The question is that I have nothing to do. My wife is dead. She used to keep me engaged – ‘Bring this, bring that’ – and she used to nag me. Now I miss her so much. At that time I used to think that it would be good if she died because she was a pain in the neck. But at least there was something to be engaged in. Now I am utterly useless.”\nHere you all know Maitreya who is lying in his samadhi. He used to keep all the newspapers – old newspapers. Once I looked into his room. I could not go into his room because he used to eat garlic so much that the whole room was stinking with garlic. He has been connected with me for almost forty years. He has been a member of the parliament. He always asked me to stay with him in his house in Delhi, and I always said, “No. Until you drop your garlic there is no way. I cannot enter your house.”\nHe said, “It is very difficult for me to drop the garlic. I can drop everything” – and he dropped everything: he dropped his wife, he dropped his house, he dropped his membership of the parliament, he became a sannyasin – but garlic, that he could not manage. So I never entered into his room – he lived with me in my own house – just from the outside of the door I would have a look at how many old papers... they were going almost to the ceiling. And I asked him, “What are you going to do with these old newspapers? Are you mad or something?”\nAnd he would laugh and he would say, “Sometimes, when one has nothing to do, it is perfectly good to read some old newspapers. It is just an old politician’s habit.”\nHis constituency was Patna. In Patna he insisted very much that I should stay in his home. I said, “I can stay in a hotel. But even if my life is at risk, I will not enter into your house. Garlic I cannot tolerate. It is so dangerous, the very smell.” When he died, I said, “My God, it is good. At least now nobody will be bringing garlic into this house!”\nAnd I have said that now nobody should be allowed to stay in my house who is a fan of garlic – and there are fans! This Sarjano, making all kinds of spaghetti, is a garlic fan. It is good that the government of Italy does not allow me to enter into Italy. I am so happy about it. And my sannyasins, Sarjano, Majid, and others, they go on forcing the parliament and I am much worried that someday...\nFor two years continuously the parliament has been discussing it. Finally they agreed to give me a three-week visa, with conditions. That was very good. I refused; I refused completely. “With conditions I cannot enter into your country. Remove all conditions, then I will consider it.” So the government is still considering, and I hope that they will not allow me because I am certainly worried that the whole of Italy must be stinking of garlic. I know so many Italian sannyasins – I keep them a little far away.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nI DON’T KNOW THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST, BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANCE IN HIS TAKING THE EXISTENTIAL RELIGION OF ZEN TO THE EAST, AND YOU – SO MANY CENTURIES LATER – BRINGING IT BACK AGAIN TO CONTEMPORARY MAN. THROUGH THE TWO OF YOU, ZEN HAS MADE A FULL CIRCLE. ARE YOU IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BODHIDHARMA?\nManeesha, that is an open secret. It is Sardar Gurudayal Singh’s time.\nSardar Gurudayal Singh has a new job as a waiter in the swank Ken’s House of Pancakes. Two gentlemen have just finished their dinner, and Sardar Gurudayal Singh approaches them.\n“Tea or coffee, gentlemen?” asks Sardar Gurudayal Singh. “I will have tea,” says the first man.\n“Yes, I will also have tea,” says the second, “but make certain the glass is clean.”\nA few minutes later, Sardar Gurudayal Singh returns and says, “Here we are, two teas. Now, which one of you gentlemen asked for the clean glass?”\nDoctor Feelgood is at a psychiatrists’ convention in New York. During one of the breaks he goes into the cafeteria. He notices a beautiful woman sitting alone in the corner, drinking coffee. She is so beautiful and attractive that Feelgood cannot resist the temptation to talk to her.\nHe goes up close to her and asks quietly, “Can I join you?”\nThe young lady shrink looks at him for a few seconds and then replies, “Why, do I look like I’m falling apart?”\nGet it now?\nWalter and Larry, two Australian boundary riders, are drinking beer and discussing how smart their dogs are.\n“My dog Rex is so smart,” says Walter, “that I can give him five instructions at once and he will carry them out, one by one.”\n“That’s nothing!” replies Larry. “My dog Butch just needs one instruction from me, and then he anticipates the rest.”\nAfter a few more beers, Walter whistles for Rex. He tells him to run down the street, turn left at the traffic lights, go half a mile and bring back a black sheep from the field there.\nTen minutes later, Rex is back with the sheep.\n“Not bad,” says Larry, “but watch this!” Then he calls to Butch. “Butch,” says Larry, “I am hungry!”\nButch races away down the road until he sees a chicken shed. He digs a hole under the fence, lifts a hen off its nest, and picks up an egg from underneath it.\nThen he races back to Larry, puts down the egg, picks up a small pot, races off to fetch some water, puts the pot on the fire and then drops the egg in.\nExactly three minutes after the water boils, Butch tips out the water, picks up the egg, delivers it to Larry and then stands on his head with his tail in the air.\n“That is incredible!” says Walter, “but tell me – why is he standing on his head like that, with his ass in the air?”\n“Well, he’s a smart dog,” replies Larry. “He knows that I don’t have an egg cup.” Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nBe silent.\nClose your eyes.\nFeel your body to be completely frozen. Look inwards with great urgency.\nYou have to reach, this very moment, to your center. Your center is your eternity.\nThe moment you are at the center, you are just a witness –\na mirror that reflects the body, the mind, but knows perfectly well it is utterly empty. The empty mirror...\nand the doors of all the mysteries of existence open for you.\nDeeper and deeper...\nMake this evening a milestone in your life.\nRecognize your buddha\nand then act it out twenty-four hours, round the clock –\nin every gesture, in every activity, peacefully, gracefully,\nwith a watching heart, silently.\nThis is the very essence of religion; all other things are only nonessential commentaries.\nThe word witness contains all the scriptures. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nMake it clear that you are not the body, nor the mind, but just the watching consciousness,\nthe witness.\nThe evening is great,\nand your silence has made it greater. It is so beautiful,\nand your witnessing has added immense beauty to it.\nOn the whole earth at this moment, this place, where ten thousand people are simply witnessing, has a unique character.\nIn the past, many places like this used to be. Unfortunately, those golden days are past,\nbut my effort is to bring those golden moments again in the future of humanity.\nYou are going to be the vehicles. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) Come back...\nbut come back as a buddha, without any hesitation,\nwithout any doubt.\nThis is the only trust I teach. You are the buddha.\nSit down for a few moments,\njust to recollect the whole experience. The rains have come to welcome you. What a splendor, this moment.\nWhat a silence, this moment. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nCan we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7460","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/ma_tzu_the_empty_mirror/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/ma_tzu_the_empty_mirror/>Ma Tzu.

THE TOP LINE WAS LONG
AND THE REMAINING THREE WERE SHORT. HE THEN DEMANDED OF THE MASTER,
“BESIDES SAYING THAT ONE LINE IS LONG AND THE OTHER THREE ARE SHORT,
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU SAY?”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU DREW ONE LINE ON THE GROUND AND SAID, “THIS COULD BE CALLED
EITHER LONG OR SHORT. THAT IS MY ANSWER.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF
BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST?”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU REPLIED, “AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”</p><p><br></p><p>AGAIN THE MONK ASKED THE QUESTION, AND MA TZU STRUCK HIM, SAYING, “IF
I DIDN’T STRIKE YOU, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>E OF ROKUTAN ASKED MA TZU THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT BODHIDHARMA’S
COMING FROM THE WEST.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “LOWER YOUR VOICE AND COME A LITTLE NEARER!”</p><p><br></p><p>E WENT NEARER. MA TZU STRUCK HIM ONCE, AND SAID, “SIX EARS DO NOT
HAVE THE SAME PLAN. COME ANOTHER DAY.”</p><p>LATER, E WENT TO THE HALL AND SAID, “I IMPLORE YOU TO TELL ME!”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID TO HIM, “GO AWAY FOR A TIME AND COME TO THE HALL AGAIN
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, AND I’LL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>E THEREUPON WAS ENLIGHTENED. HE SAID, “I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR
CONFIRMATION,” AND MARCHED ROUND THE HALL ONCE, AND WENT OFF.</p><p><br></p><p>ON A LATER OCCASION, ANOTHER MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “PLEASE TRANSCEND
THE FOUR SAYINGS AND REFRAIN FROM THE HUNDRED NEGATIONS, AND TELL ME THE
MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST.”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “TODAY I’M TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU. GO AND ASK
CHIZO.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK WENT AND ASKED CHIZO, WHO SAID, “WHY DON’T YOU ASK THE
MASTER?” “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU,” SAID THE MONK.</p><p>“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU;
GO AND ASK HYAKUJO.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF
REALLY DON’T KNOW.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS
BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, before I discuss Ma Tzu and his statements, I have to
inaugurate another god to Avirbhava’s Museum of Gods. This is a very
important god. I will tell you about the god before Avirbhava brings it
in front of you.</p><p><br></p><p>The name of the god is horse. It has been worshipped around the world
for centuries. Even today there are places where the horse is worshipped
as a god.</p><p><br></p><p>“The horse or mare is one of the forms of the corn spirit in
Europe.</p><p><br></p><p>“In Ancient Greece, Artemis and Aphrodite were associated with the
horse, and Cronus is said to have taken the form of a horse.</p><p><br></p><p>“In Gaul, there was a horse goddess called Epona and a horse god
called Rudiobus.</p><p><br></p><p>“The goddess mares, Medb of Tara and Macha of Ulster, were thought to
have powers of the dead.</p><p><br></p><p>“Horse worship also existed in Persia, where white horses were
regarded as holy. In the Teutonic regions they were kept in holy
enclosures.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here, in India, in earlier times, horses were sanctified, and the
cult exists still today. Koda Pen is the horse god of the Gonds.”</p><p>In ancient India horses were not only worshipped, they were also
sacrificed to please God. It was not only horses who were sacrificed;
cows were killed, even man was killed as a sacrifice. For cows, the
ritual was called gomedh – go means cow. For horses, the ritual was
called ashvamedh. Ashva means horse, medh means killing. For man the
ritual was called naramedh. Nar means man and medh means killing.</p><p><br></p><p>And these are the people who go on making a great fuss about stopping
cow slaughter. They have slaughtered even man in the name of God. They
themselves have slaughtered cows, horses, in the name of God.
Sacrificing a living man in the name of God is very symbolic. To me it
has more significance than just an ordinary sacrifice. The whole of
humanity has been sacrificed by all the religions in the name of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>You are living a crippled life because of the religions. They have
not killed you, but they have not left you alive either. They have
crippled you. They have cut you into parts. Certain parts in you have to
be removed. Certain parts in you are worshipped, certain parts are
condemned. Your wholeness is not accepted by any religion in the world.
These religions are thought to be very intelligent, and they are
worshipping animals of all kinds!</p><p><br></p><p>The first Hindu incarnation of God is the fish. Of course in Bengal,
fish is eaten as something holy; rice and fish are their basic foods.
The whole of Bengal stinks of fish. Every house has beautiful trees,
even the poorest, and a beautiful pond in which they grow and cultivate
fish. The scene is beautiful, very green. Nowhere is it so green as in
Bengal, and every house has a pond, a big pond surrounded by big trees.
You can know the riches of the family by the size of their pond. The
richer families have vast ponds, and costly fishes are eaten in the name
of God.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so easy to kill anything in the name of God. The name of God is
a very protective shelter.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that when the Britishers came to India,
they first captured Bengal, and Calcutta was their capital. Their first
Indian servants, from the lowest to the highest, were all Bengalis. And
because they were all stinking of fish, they started calling them
“Babu.” Babu is a Persian word which means a man who stinks. But because
they were government servants, on high posts, “Babu” became very
respectable. Now to call somebody Babu is very respectful,
honorable.</p><p><br></p><p>The first president of India, Doctor Rajendra Prasad, was always
called Babu Rajendra Prasad. And even that president had no idea that
Babu is a dirty word. But people have forgotten the connotation. Bu
means smell, and ba means really bad smell.</p><p><br></p><p>In Hinduism not only the fish was an incarnation of God. There was
the tortoise, there was the pig, there was the lion, and a strange lion
– half lion, half man – narasinha; the upper part of the body is of the
lion, and the lower part of the body is of man. And people have
worshipped them. One just wonders whether humanity is mad. Something is
certainly insane.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last incarnation of God which is going to come is going to be
a white horse. His name will be Kalki. And that white horse will save
the virtuous and will destroy the sinners and will change the whole
course of human history – a horse!</p><p><br></p><p>And all these idiots who believe in these things will be sitting by
the side watching. The tenth incarnation of God is called Kalki. He is
to come to judge the world at the end of this yuga, the fourth</p><p>and last cycle of one million, eight hundred thousand years in the
Hindu concept of the world. He will destroy the wicked, reward the good,
and enable Vishnu, the Hindu God, to create a new world.</p><p><br></p><p>In Buddhism, the horse represents the indestructible, the hidden
nature of things. The winged or cosmic horse, called “Cloud,” is a form
of Avalokiteshvara. It is an incarnation of Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>I am allowing these animal gods in this campus to make you aware of
your past. And it is not passed completely, it is still hidden in your
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>In Varanasi... it is a strange place, it is the ancientmost city in
the world. Because of its being so ancient its streets are very small,
because in those days there was no need for buses and trucks and cars to
move. Even a rickshaw hardly manages to move through the streets.</p><p><br></p><p>It is thought to be a great virtue to take an ox and leave it in the
city of Varanasi. The city of Varanasi is thought to be the city of the
God Vishnu, and he loves cows. So in the city of Varanasi you will find
more cows than men, and you cannot remove a cow that is standing in the
street. You go on honking your horn and those gods are not going to
listen to such ordinary human beings. Go on honking... they will just
stand there without bothering.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to get down and push them to the side. You cannot hit them
otherwise you will be killed. It will be hurting the Hindu religious
feelings. They enter into shops, into vegetable shops, and they start
eating. You cannot stop them. They are no ordinary people, they are
VVIPs!</p><p><br></p><p>Varanasi, in the whole world...</p><p><br></p><p>(AT THIS MOMENT RIPPLES OF LAUGHTER SPREAD THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY AS A
WHITE HORSE ENTERS THE AUDITORIUM THROUGH THE DOOR TO THE LEFT OF THE
PODIUM, GALLOPS AROUND IT AND DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR ON THE
RIGHT.)</p><p><br></p><p>So, Avirbhava, you can come back, your horse is introduced. Come back
to your seat. (GREAT APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE.)</p><p>Now, Maneesha’s statements about Ma Tzu and his work:</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MASTERS TO USE A SPECIFICALLY ZEN
TECHNIQUE IN TEACHING; THAT IS, THROUGH LIVING, NOT PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS.
BY INDICATING THE ABSOLUTE IN THE RELATIVE – A RELATIVE WITHOUT
RELIGIOUS DOGMA, ROMANCE, SYMBOLISM, OR INTELLECTUALISM, BUT WITH A DEEP
SENSE OF THE EXISTENTIAL VALUE OF A THING – MA TZU BROUGHT ZEN INTO THE
REALM OF ORDINARY, DAY-TO-DAY LIVING.</p><p><br></p><p>His contribution to Zen is immense. He brought it down from the
heights to where you are. About Ma Tzu it can be said, just as it is
said about Mohammed... Mohammed is reported to have said that if the
thirsty will not come to the well, the well is going to go to the
thirsty.</p><p><br></p><p>To go to the heights of buddhas is really an arduous thing. They
shine forth like a full moon in the sky, and a tremendous longing arises
in you to reach to the same heights. But there is a great fear</p><p>of insecurity, of danger, of those mountainous regions where you will
be alone. Many who want to reach to those heights think twice before
they take their first step.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu saw this and he introduced something which was never known
before. He came down from the mountains to the marketplace. He said,
“The marketplace cannot change me, so why avoid it? I am going to change
the marketplace. Sitting on my heights, I will not be able to change
thousands of people. And if when it is possible I go to the people
themselves, just as ordinary as they are, communication will be
easier.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hence he dropped all philosophical teachings. He brought new devices,
more in tune with the earth, not in tune with the sky, more in tune with
the ordinary human activities. Once he has got hold of you, he will take
you to the heights. But the first question is to take hold of you.</p><p><br></p><p>He is the first master in the history of Zen who has shown such
compassion. He also introduced beating for the first time. That too is
part of his compassion. His beating has to be understood because it will
come again and again. He is beating you to wake you up. There is no need
to go anywhere to find the buddha. The buddha is fast asleep within you.
He just needs a little awakening. The beating was out of pure love and
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult for other religions in the world to understand:
“What kind of teaching is this? Teach about God, teach about heaven and
hell and virtues and ten commandments.” To them it will look... it does
look almost crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ma Tzu helped far more people to become enlightened than any
other master. The end result shows that his devices worked.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ONCE DREW FOUR LINES IN FRONT OF MA TZU. THE TOP LINE WAS LONG
AND THE REMAINING THREE WERE SHORT. HE THEN DEMANDED OF THE MASTER,
“BESIDES SAYING THAT ONE LINE IS LONG AND THE OTHER THREE ARE SHORT,
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU SAY?”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU DREW ONE LINE ON THE GROUND AND SAID, “THIS COULD BE CALLED
EITHER LONG OR SHORT. THAT IS MY ANSWER.”</p><p><br></p><p>It reminds me of an incident in a court of a great Indian emperor,
Akbar. One day he came into the court and drew a line on the wall and
told all the members of his court... and he had collected the most wise
people from all parts of the country into his court; it must have been
the richest court in the world as far as wisdom is concerned. He had all
the great artists, musicians, dancers – anybody who was at the top was
invited to be part of his court.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the court members, “Can you make this line smaller without
touching it?” It looks like a Zen koan. How can you make it smaller
without touching it? You will have to touch it, only then you can make
it smaller. That seems to be obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>But one man laughed. He was the court joker, Birbal. Every court in
the ancient days used to have a court joker, just to keep the court
playful, nonserious. There were serious problems, but the joker would
always keep it cool; he would cut a joke, and all the heat would
disappear, and people would</p><p>come to their senses. Birbal perhaps is one of the most well known
men, who had an immense sense of humor; but he was also a wise man. He
stood up and he went to the wall and drew a bigger line above the small
line that Akbar had drawn. And he said, “I have made it small without
touching it” – because small, or long, or short, are all relative
terms.</p><p><br></p><p>In itself you can draw a line... that’s what Ma Tzu is doing, drawing
a line. And he says, “You can call it either long or short.” It is a
question of relativity. If you are comparing it with a longer line, it
is short; if you are comparing it with a shorter line, it is long. In
itself it is just what it is. Relativity is a comparison with something
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Why Ma Tzu did it has to be understood. And particularly now that
Albert Einstein has introduced the theory of relativity in the
scientific sphere, it has become more important to understand Ma Tzu’s
meaning. He is saying, “Everyone is just himself, neither great nor
small – because that greatness or smallness comes from relativity –
neither beautiful nor ugly. Everyone is simply just himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can bring a taller man by his side and he becomes smaller, but he
remains the same. Only relatively, conceptually, intellectually, can you
see that he is smaller, but he has not changed even an inch. You can
bring a pygmy by his side and suddenly he has become taller, and he has
not changed a bit. What he is saying is that relativity is a dangerous
concept to be applied to human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>It is relativity that makes some people big, great, famous,
celebrities. Some people live in obscurity, some people are just
nobodies. This is relativity; otherwise everybody is just himself, it
does not make any difference. There is no question of inequality,
everybody is unique. The person who is nobody is happy in his
nobodiness. But this concept of relativity drives people mad. Everybody
is trying to climb higher on the ladder, to become somebody special. And
even the most special people are hankering for so many things which they
are missing.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Napoleon was one of the world conquerors. But he was
suffering from a great inferiority complex because of his height – he
was only five feet five inches tall. Even his bodyguards were over six
feet and he felt very much embarrassed – on both sides bodyguards, and
bodyguards are chosen particularly to be strong, tall. He looked just
like a small child in comparison to his own bodyguards, and this was
very embarrassing.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was trying to fix a picture on the wall, but his reach was
just a little bit short, he could not reach the picture. His bodyguard
said, “Your honor, you need not bother about it. I am higher than you, I
can do it without any difficulty.”</p><p><br></p><p>Napoleon said, “I will shoot you. Change your word ‘higher’. You are
simply taller than me, not higher.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor bodyguard could not see why he had become so angry. He had
touched the very soft spot in his unconscious. Higher? – nobody is
higher. At the most you can say, physiologically, that you are taller.
But Napoleon suffered immensely. Every time he saw a taller man, he was
in immense misery.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot have all the things in the world. There will be poets,
there will be musicians, whose very touch is golden. There will be
wrestlers whose bodies are almost a work of art. You cannot have</p><p>all these things. Relatively, everybody is inferior in comparison to
somebody else. You can find out to whom you are inferior, and you will
find so many people to whom you are inferior. Somebody is a great
flutist and you don’t know which side of the flute to put in your mouth.
Somebody is a great mathematician... miraculous mathematicians have
happened.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, just in this century, there were two people; one was
Shankaran, a rickshaw wallah in Madras. Just by chance a professor in
the Madras university took his rickshaw and on the way the rickshaw
wallah asked him, “What do you teach in the university?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was an Englishman. He said, “I am a professor of mathematics.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rickshaw wallah said, “Mathematics? That is my special subject.
You just tell me any number, multiplied by any other number, and before
you have ended your question I will answer it.” And he did it.</p><p><br></p><p>The professor could not believe his own eyes and ears. The number
that he had given to be multiplied by another number would have taken
the greatest mathematician at least three minutes. Without going through
the whole process, he had simply answered. And the professor had to work
it out, whether his answer was right or wrong – and it was right.</p><p><br></p><p>He took him to the university. Shankaran convinced all the professors
that he had an intuitive grasp. Asked how he managed it, he said he did
not know. “Just as you ask, a number appears on the screen of my mind,
and I simply repeat that number. I don’t know any process, I am not
educated.”</p><p><br></p><p>The professor took him around the world as a show of intuitive
mathematics – to Oxford, to Cambridge – and everywhere he was a
celebrity. An uneducated rickshaw wallah – and great mathematicians like
Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, they simply could not believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>Bertrand Russell has written the greatest book on mathematics. Just
to explain two plus two is four, he has taken two hundred and forty
pages. And this man – you give him any number to multiply or any kind of
question, and he immediately writes the answer on the board. He goes
through no process.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is another woman, her name is Shakuntala, and I think
she is still alive – and strangely from the same place, Madras. She has
been around the world showing her intuitive capacity for
mathematics.</p><p><br></p><p>Even great mathematicians have felt childish next to these people;
they are not educated, they know nothing of mathematics, but they can
make the greatest mathematicians feel inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are going to compare, if you are going to think around, you
will find thousands of people who will make you inferior. And you cannot
do anything about it. You cannot be the greatest dancer, you cannot be
the greatest mathematician, you cannot be the greatest poet, you cannot
be the greatest painter; you cannot have all the greatness in the world
at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of thinking in relativity about human beings is absurd.
You are just yourself. Just be authentically yourself, without any
comparison. No inferiority arises; no superiority arises. You are simply
relaxed as you are. And whatever you are doing, you do your best, with
joy and creativity.</p><p>Ma Tzu’s answer... he DREW ONE LINE ON THE GROUND AND SAID, “THIS
COULD BE CALLED EITHER LONG OR SHORT. THAT IS MY ANSWER.”</p><p><br></p><p>It depends with what you are comparing it. But why compare in the
first place?</p><p><br></p><p>Relativity is perfectly good in scientific fields. It is absolutely
wrong in the world of humanity. Human beings are not mathematical
digits; human beings are unique. Everyone – however he is, whatever he
is – has just to bring his potentiality to its totality, its profundity,
to clean it and bring it to blossom. It does not matter whether it is a
wildflower or a roseflower. What matters is flowering, bringing your
potentiality to its uttermost height.</p><p><br></p><p>And that will bring you joy and peace, and a rest, a relaxation with
the universe. You will be in tune, and there will be no turmoil in your
mind – how to become this, how to become that. How to be the richest
person, how to be the most famous – all that is garbage; and it is
driving thousands of people mad, unnecessarily mad.</p><p><br></p><p>They could be the most beautiful people if they were not thinking in
terms of relativity. If they were satisfied with themselves and their
potential, and they were working to bring their potential to its
uttermost height, without any comparison to anyone – this is the only
way a man can be psychologically healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, A MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF
BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a traditional question in Zen, asked thousands of times,
asked to hundreds of different masters by thousands of disciples; and
every time a different answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu is not going to give any philosophical answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The philosophically oriented masters can give much meaning to
Bodhidharma’s coming from India to China – remember that in China, India
is the West.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma brought Gautam Buddha’s message, and he transformed the
whole of China into a great love affair with Buddha. He did not create
an organized religion, he simply spread the fragrance of Buddhism. No
organized church, but everybody is allowed to drink from the well of
Buddha, and quench his thirst. No priest exists in Buddhism – there is
no need of the priest. He is a hindrance, not a bridge. You can be a
buddha yourself, just by going within yourself. No priest is needed for
that.</p><p><br></p><p>China was so happy to hear the message, “You are a buddha; you just
don’t understand your interiority, your subjectivity.”</p><p><br></p><p>So much can be said about “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S
COMING FROM THE WEST?”</p><p><br></p><p>But MA TZU REPLIED, “AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
‘MEANING’?”</p><p>Ma Tzu was a strange master with strange methods. Rather than
answering the question, he turns the question into another question. He
changes the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>He asks, “AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”</p><p><br></p><p>AGAIN THE MONK ASKED THE QUESTION, AND MA TZU STRUCK HIM, SAYING, “IF
I DIDN’T STRIKE YOU, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>A strange anecdote, but Ma Tzu is right. He is saying, “The whole
meaning of Gautam Buddha and his message is you. Bodhidharma came here
to wake you up. Rather than philosophizing about it, I will do exactly
the same as Bodhidharma did.</p><p><br></p><p>AT THIS MOMENT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ‘MEANING’?”</p><p>That comes as a shock, because the monk was not thinking that
somebody would ask this question. AGAIN THE MONK ASKED THE QUESTION, AND
MA TZU STRUCK HIM, SAYING, “IF I DIDN’T</p><p>STRIKE YOU, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT ME – because you are the meaning,
and you are asking it. You are the buddha, and you are asking where the
buddha is. If I don’t strike you, for centuries people will laugh about
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>E OF ROKUTAN ASKED MA TZU THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT BODHIDHARMA’S
COMING FROM THE WEST.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “LOWER YOUR VOICE AND COME A LITTLE NEARER!”</p><p><br></p><p>E WENT NEARER. MA TZU STRUCK HIM ONCE, AND SAID, “SIX EARS DO NOT
HAVE THE SAME PLAN. COME ANOTHER DAY.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man could not understand. He is asking a traditionally simple
question, “What was the meaning of Bodhidharma’s coming to China?” And
Ma Tzu is answering it in two ways: first, “Lower your voice!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man must have asked as if the answer is not possible. The man
must have asked with a great ego, expecting that Ma Tzu is going to
accept defeat.</p><p><br></p><p>Saying to him, “Lower your voice!” simply means, “Be quiet, be
silent, be humble, because in your humbleness you will find the answer;
in your silence you will find the meaning.”</p><p><br></p><p>And, “Come a little nearer!” The man did not understand the meaning
of coming a little nearer. He is saying, “Be a little more intimate with
me, come a little closer to my heart, be a little more open. Don’t just
stand there closed, and with a great ego. Be humble and come
closer.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he did not understand the meaning either of lowering the voice,
or of coming a little nearer. He went nearer – physically.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU STRUCK HIM ONCE, AND SAID, “SIX EARS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME
PLAN. COME</p><p>ANOTHER DAY – you have not understood today, but who knows? – COME
ANOTHER DAY. It is enough for today that I have given you a good hit.
Think over it.”</p><p>And “SIX EARS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PLAN.”</p><p><br></p><p>Here you are thousands of ears, but behind your ears everybody has a
different plan. So come another day and drop your plan. If you come with
a prejudice, with an answer already within you, you cannot understand
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Here we don’t work philosophically. This is not the place for
intellectuals. For that you can go anywhere, to any monastery where
scriptures are thought to lead you to your inner nature. But if you want
to hear the answer from me, come another day. For today it is
enough.</p><p><br></p><p>LATER, E WENT TO THE HALL AND SAID, “I IMPLORE YOU TO TELL ME!”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID TO HIM, “GO AWAY FOR A TIME AND COME TO THE HALL AGAIN
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, AND I’LL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>E THEREUPON WAS ENLIGHTENED. HE SAID, “I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR
CONFIRMATION,” AND MARCHED ROUND THE HALL ONCE, AND WENT OFF.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything around Ma Tzu is very mysterious. The man did not go, he
followed Ma Tzu to the assembly hall. And again in the assembly hall he
repeated it, but now, just within a few moments, he was a different
person. He said, “I IMPLORE YOU TO TELL ME!”</p><p><br></p><p>That old egoist of a few moments before is no longer there. The voice
has become one of imploring, of humbleness.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID TO HIM, “GO AWAY FOR A TIME AND COME TO THE HALL AGAIN
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, AND I WILL PUBLICLY CONFIRM IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has not given the answer, but he has given something else. He is
asking him to go away, “and come here only when you have a chance of
getting the answer. That means when you have meditated over it, dropped
all your preconceptions, when you don’t have any idea what is the
answer. That will be your chance. Then you can come, AND I WILL PUBLICLY
CONFIRM IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because he has asked with humbleness, the man must have been of great
intelligence. Time does not make any sense; why not do it now? So he
dropped – that is not written in the anecdote, that cannot be written,
it is something that is happening within him – he dropped all his
notions. And as he dropped all his notions, there was no need for any
answer for him.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange situation. When the question disappears, there is no
need for the answer either. That is all mental gymnastics. Seeing the
truth, that the master is not going to get involved in intellectual
conversation... Perhaps there is no way to intellectually explain the
meaning of Bodhidharma’s coming to the West. It is something that can be
transmitted only when you are utterly silent and without any questions.
Then a flame, a fire can jump from the master’s heart. And that actually
happened.</p><p><br></p><p>E THEREUPON WAS ENLIGHTENED. HE SAID, “I THANK EVERYBODY FOR
THEIR</p><p>CONFIRMATION,” AND MARCHED ROUND THE HALL ONCE, which is a sign of
reverence, AND WENT OFF.</p><p>ON A LATER OCCASION, ANOTHER MONK SAID TO MA TZU, “PLEASE TRANSCEND
THE FOUR SAYINGS AND REFRAIN FROM THE HUNDRED NEGATIONS, AND TELL ME THE
MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST.”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “TODAY I’M TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU. GO AND ASK
CHIZO.”</p><p><br></p><p>Chizo was one of his nearest disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK WENT AND ASKED CHIZO, WHO SAID, “WHY DON’T YOU ASK THE
MASTER?” “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU,” SAID THE MONK.</p><p>“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU;
GO AND ASK</p><p>HYAKUJO.” Hyakujo was the second most intimate disciple of Ma
Tzu.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF
REALLY DON’T KNOW.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS
BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the question is completely forgotten. Nobody has answered it. On
the contrary, Hyakujo has accepted that he himself does not know what
the answer is.</p><p><br></p><p>The white cap and the black cap refer to an old story of two robbers.
One of the robbers wore a white cap, while the other wore a black cap.
As the story goes, the one with the black cap was more ruthless and
radical than the one with the white. So it was that Hyakujo was said to
be more radical than Chizo in his methods of dealing with young
monks.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu said that he was very tired. “TODAY I AM TIRED AND I CAN’T
TELL YOU.” The fact is, whether you are tired or not, you can’t tell it.
The meaning of Bodhidharma is an experience, it is not an explanation.
But to be humble, Ma Tzu did not say, “Nothing can be said about it.” On
the contrary, he took the whole responsibility on himself. “TODAY I’M
TIRED AND I CAN’T TELL YOU. GO AND ASK CHIZO.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took this opportunity also to check upon Chizo and Hyakujo. He
knew that Chizo would not be able to answer, neither would Hyakujo. This
question in Zen is one of those unanswerable things which can only be
experienced. There is no way to bring them to words. The man went to
Chizo, who said, “Why don’t you ask the master? Why bother me? I am just
a disciple.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the monk said, “HE TOLD ME TO COME AND ASK YOU<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’VE GOT AN AWFUL HEADACHE TODAY,” SAID CHIZO, “SO I CAN’T TELL YOU;
GO AND ASK HYAKUJO.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK THEN WENT TO HYAKUJO, WHO SAID, “WELL, AS TO THAT, I MYSELF
REALLY DON’T KNOW.”</p><p>THE MONK REPORTED ALL THIS TO MA TZU, WHO SAID, “HYAKUJO’S CAP IS
BLACK; CHIZO’S CAP IS WHITE.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is referring to the story of those two robbers. The robber who
used to use the black cap was a radical revolutionary. And Ma Tzu says
that Hyakujo’s cap is black. It is a tremendous statement to say that
you don’t know, it needs guts to accept your ignorance. Chizo’s cap is
white. He is trying to hide – as if he knows, but because he has a great
headache, today he cannot say it.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu worked in strange ways. Now he has worked with a single
question on three persons: on the monk who has brought the question, on
Chizo, who is trying to hide his ignorance, on Hyakujo, who comes out
with his radical answer, “I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know” is the greatest answer in the whole experience of
humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “I don’t know,” at the very last moment of his life.
His whole life he was teaching the truth, and at the last moment he
said, “I don’t know.” At the last moment he becomes really humble, and
he sees the greatness of truth and its miraculousness, its
inexpressibility – and that what he had been doing was just playing with
words all his life. Now, no more; he is going to die within a few
minutes. The poison is being prepared. At least the world should know
that Socrates, before dying, uttered his honest answer, “I don’t know. I
don’t know anything about anything. I am just as innocent and ignorant
as a child.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the highest peak of wisdom. When you don’t know, the mind
is empty, you have arrived at the empty heart. When you know, the mind
is full. Knowledge is the greatest barrier in reaching to the universal,
to the immortal, to the eternal truth. Knowledge is the greatest
barrier, which is preventing you from recognizing your
buddha-nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Chizo was closer to Ma Tzu but he did not get the succession. Hyakujo
was chosen to be the successor. When Ma Tzu died... before dying he
declared Hyakujo. Nobody was expecting that; everybody knew that Chizo
would be the successor. But Hyakujo was chosen for the simple reason
that he had the guts to express his ignorance, his innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>The statement “I don’t know,” is the greatest statement anybody can
make. It makes your heart completely empty. Here in our meditations we
are doing exactly this. My whole effort is to take away all your
knowledge, because it is all borrowed, and unnecessarily you are
carrying it. It does not allow your heart to be empty, and only an empty
heart is capable of falling in tune with the universal heart. From that
point life becomes a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Soseki wrote,</p><p><br></p><p>THIS PIECE OF WILD LAND HAS NO BOUNDARIES –</p><p>NORTH, SOUTH, EAST OR WEST.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS HARD TO SEE EVEN THE TREE</p><p>IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. TURNING YOUR HEAD</p><p>YOU CAN LOOK BEYOND EACH DIRECTION.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW THAT YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN DECEIVING
YOU.</p><p>When you go inwards there is no east, no west, no south, no north;
just pure space, in all directions the same. You have gone to your very
roots, and now you know for the first time that all these many lives
your eyes have been deceiving you because they were keeping you attached
to the objects of the outside. They were not allowing you to enter into
yourself. You were kept engaged in something outside – money, knowledge,
respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>There are thousands of ways to keep you engaged so that you don’t
turn inwards. Life is being managed by the society in such a way that
from the very beginning you are forced to remain engaged. It becomes a
habit. If you don’t have anything to do, you find something to do. I
know people... on Sundays they are in the most uncomfortable position –
nothing to do! They may open an old grandfather clock to repair it – it
was working already. Or they may go to the car and open the bonnet, and
the car is functioning perfectly well – but it is something to do. They
may read the same newspaper again.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with a relative for a few days. He was retired and he
used to read the same newspaper from the morning till the night. And I
would say, “How many times do you read your newspaper?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is not a question of reading. The question is that I
have nothing to do. My wife is dead. She used to keep me engaged –
‘Bring this, bring that’ – and she used to nag me. Now I miss her so
much. At that time I used to think that it would be good if she died
because she was a pain in the neck. But at least there was something to
be engaged in. Now I am utterly useless.”</p><p><br></p><p>Here you all know Maitreya who is lying in his samadhi. He used to
keep all the newspapers – old newspapers. Once I looked into his room. I
could not go into his room because he used to eat garlic so much that
the whole room was stinking with garlic. He has been connected with me
for almost forty years. He has been a member of the parliament. He
always asked me to stay with him in his house in Delhi, and I always
said, “No. Until you drop your garlic there is no way. I cannot enter
your house.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is very difficult for me to drop the garlic. I can drop
everything” – and he dropped everything: he dropped his wife, he dropped
his house, he dropped his membership of the parliament, he became a
sannyasin – but garlic, that he could not manage. So I never entered
into his room – he lived with me in my own house – just from the outside
of the door I would have a look at how many old papers... they were
going almost to the ceiling. And I asked him, “What are you going to do
with these old newspapers? Are you mad or something?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would laugh and he would say, “Sometimes, when one has nothing
to do, it is perfectly good to read some old newspapers. It is just an
old politician’s habit.”</p><p>His constituency was Patna. In Patna he insisted very much that I
should stay in his home. I said, “I can stay in a hotel. But even if my
life is at risk, I will not enter into your house. Garlic I cannot
tolerate. It is so dangerous, the very smell.” When he died, I said, “My
God, it is good. At least now nobody will be bringing garlic into this
house!”</p><p><br></p><p>And I have said that now nobody should be allowed to stay in my house
who is a fan of garlic – and there are fans! This Sarjano, making all
kinds of spaghetti, is a garlic fan. It is good that the government of
Italy does not allow me to enter into Italy. I am so happy about it. And
my sannyasins, Sarjano, Majid, and others, they go on forcing the
parliament and I am much worried that someday...</p><p><br></p><p>For two years continuously the parliament has been discussing it.
Finally they agreed to give me a three-week visa, with conditions. That
was very good. I refused; I refused completely. “With conditions I
cannot enter into your country. Remove all conditions, then I will
consider it.” So the government is still considering, and I hope that
they will not allow me because I am certainly worried that the whole of
Italy must be stinking of garlic. I know so many Italian sannyasins – I
keep them a little far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>I DON’T KNOW THE MEANING OF BODHIDHARMA’S COMING FROM THE WEST, BUT
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANCE IN HIS TAKING THE EXISTENTIAL
RELIGION OF ZEN TO THE EAST, AND YOU – SO MANY CENTURIES LATER –

HAS MADE A FULL CIRCLE. ARE YOU IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BODHIDHARMA?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, that is an open secret. It is Sardar Gurudayal Singh’s
time.</p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh has a new job as a waiter in the swank Ken’s
House of Pancakes. Two gentlemen have just finished their dinner, and
Sardar Gurudayal Singh approaches them.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tea or coffee, gentlemen?” asks Sardar Gurudayal Singh. “I will have
tea,” says the first man.</p><p>“Yes, I will also have tea,” says the second, “but make certain the
glass is clean.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, Sardar Gurudayal Singh returns and says, “Here
we are, two teas. Now, which one of you gentlemen asked for the clean
glass?”</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Feelgood is at a psychiatrists’ convention in New York. During
one of the breaks he goes into the cafeteria. He notices a beautiful
woman sitting alone in the corner, drinking coffee. She is so beautiful
and attractive that Feelgood cannot resist the temptation to talk to
her.</p><p>He goes up close to her and asks quietly, “Can I join you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The young lady shrink looks at him for a few seconds and then
replies, “Why, do I look like I’m falling apart?”</p><p><br></p><p>Get it now?</p><p><br></p><p>Walter and Larry, two Australian boundary riders, are drinking beer
and discussing how smart their dogs are.</p><p><br></p><p>“My dog Rex is so smart,” says Walter, “that I can give him five
instructions at once and he will carry them out, one by one.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s nothing!” replies Larry. “My dog Butch just needs one
instruction from me, and then he anticipates the rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a few more beers, Walter whistles for Rex. He tells him to run
down the street, turn left at the traffic lights, go half a mile and
bring back a black sheep from the field there.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten minutes later, Rex is back with the sheep.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not bad,” says Larry, “but watch this!” Then he calls to Butch.
“Butch,” says Larry, “I am hungry!”</p><p>Butch races away down the road until he sees a chicken shed. He digs
a hole under the fence, lifts a hen off its nest, and picks up an egg
from underneath it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he races back to Larry, puts down the egg, picks up a small pot,
races off to fetch some water, puts the pot on the fire and then drops
the egg in.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly three minutes after the water boils, Butch tips out the
water, picks up the egg, delivers it to Larry and then stands on his
head with his tail in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>“That is incredible!” says Walter, “but tell me – why is he standing
on his head like that, with his ass in the air?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, he’s a smart dog,” replies Larry. “He knows that I don’t have
an egg cup.” Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent.</p><p><br></p><p>Close your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel your body to be completely frozen. Look inwards with great
urgency.</p><p>You have to reach, this very moment, to your center. Your center is
your eternity.</p><p>The moment you are at the center, you are just a witness –</p><p>a mirror that reflects the body, the mind, but knows perfectly well
it is utterly empty. The empty mirror...</p><p>and the doors of all the mysteries of existence open for you.</p><p>Deeper and deeper...</p><p><br></p><p>Make this evening a milestone in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Recognize your buddha</p><p><br></p><p>and then act it out twenty-four hours, round the clock –</p><p>in every gesture, in every activity, peacefully, gracefully,</p><p>with a watching heart, silently.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the very essence of religion; all other things are only
nonessential commentaries.</p><p>The word witness contains all the scriptures. Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Make it clear that you are not the body, nor the mind, but just the
watching consciousness,</p><p>the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>The evening is great,</p><p><br></p><p>and your silence has made it greater. It is so beautiful,</p><p>and your witnessing has added immense beauty to it.</p><p>On the whole earth at this moment, this place, where ten thousand
people are simply witnessing, has a unique character.</p><p>In the past, many places like this used to be. Unfortunately, those
golden days are past,</p><p>but my effort is to bring those golden moments again in the future of
humanity.</p><p>You are going to be the vehicles. Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Come back...</p><p>but come back as a buddha, without any hesitation,</p><p>without any doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only trust I teach. You are the buddha.</p><p>Sit down for a few moments,</p><p><br></p><p>just to recollect the whole experience. The rains have come to
welcome you. What a splendor, this moment.</p><p>What a silence, this moment. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

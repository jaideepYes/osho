WHY DON’T YOU LIKE THAT?” MA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING TO ME.”\nTHE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?” MA TZU SAID, “THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”\nManeesha, these are some of the great episodes in the history of Zen. They show your realization in your action. When a master acts in a certain way, the disciple spontaneously has to respond, not through thinking, but through his very empty heart.\nZen is ultimately a device, thousands of devices, created by different masters to provoke awakening in you. Reading them one may think they are just anecdotes, stories, puzzles. They are not, they are communications, and communications of the greatest value.\nONE DAY, AS HYAKUJO WAS VISITING HIS MASTER, MA TZU, A FLOCK OF WILD GEESE FLEW OVERHEAD. MA TZU ASKED, “WHAT ARE THEY?”\n“THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR,” SAID HYAKUJO. “WHERE ARE THEY?” ASKED THE MASTER.\n“THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, SIR,” REPLIED HYAKUJO.\nMA TZU SUDDENLY TOOK HOLD OF HYAKUJO’S NOSE AND TWISTED IT. OVERCOME WITH PAIN, HYAKUJO CRIED OUT. MA TZU SAID, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”\nAT THAT MOMENT, HYAKUJO ATTAINED ENLIGHTENMENT.\nTo any ordinary rational thinker this will look like an absurd statement. But to a man attuned in meditation, this can become a tremendous awakening point. It is not that Ma Tzu does not know that the geese have flown away. It is not that he does not know that the geese were there. He is not asking for any knowledgeable answer. He is asking for the response which Hyakujo missed in the beginning, when Ma Tzu asked him, “WHAT ARE THEY?” Obviously Ma Tzu knows what they are.\nSo remember, it is not a question or inquiry about knowing the object. At this point Hyakujo missed. His response was through the mind; he said, “THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR.”\nThat would be the response of anybody else in the whole world. It is not out of the empty heart. It is not out of the mirror of nothingness. It is just... any child would say it. The answer is right, but Hyakujo’s response was not through the heart, it was through the mind.\n“THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR,” SAID HYAKUJO.\nHere he missed. He should have responded to the question without thinking of any consequences. “WHERE ARE THEY?” – the master gave him another chance – ASKED THE MASTER.\n“THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, SIR,” REPLIED HYAKUJO.\nHe is just functioning on the mental level.\nMA TZU SUDDENLY TOOK HOLD OF HYAKUJO’S NOSE AND TWISTED IT. OVERCOME WITH PAIN, HYAKUJO CRIED OUT. MA TZU SAID, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”\nWhere can they go? They have always been here and will be here. The here is vast enough – wherever they are, they are in the here. They cannot go out of the here. That’s what he was expecting from Hyakujo. But he had to take Hyakujo by his nose and twist the nose to make him aware that he was functioning through the mind. And the mind can only bring pain; the mind is pain.\nMa Tzu’s twisting the nose of Hyakujo and giving him tremendous pain so that he cried out – don’t take it superficially, don’t take it as it appears on the surface. This crying out was not out of the mind. This crying out came as the spontaneous response of his whole being. At this moment the master could speak to him. He was in the right space now; he was no more in the mind, his whole being was awake because of the pain.\nPain has a tremendous value in awakening. Pain has been used by many masters to awaken the sleeping disciple. All your old religions, on the contrary, console the disciple and help him to sleep well – God is in heaven and everything is okay on the earth, you don’t be worried! But Zen is not at all interested in consoling you. It is interested in awakening you.\nWhen Hyakujo cried out, Ma Tzu did not say a single word of sympathy. He did not give any explanation, why he had twisted his nose. On the contrary he said, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”\nIn that moment there was no thought except pain. The mind was empty, the nose was hurting – and Ma Tzu did not care about the nose or the pain; he simply stated a tremendously meaningful statement, that nobody, nothing, can go away out of here. Here is immense and vast, so is now. Wherever they are, they are here.\nHyakujo was now in a right state to understand the meaning of the master – that everything is always here. Those wild geese were just an excuse to explain to Hyakujo that nothing moves, nothing goes anywhere.\nAT THAT MOMENT HYAKUJO ATTAINED ENLIGHTENMENT.\nSeeing the point, the eternity and the wideness of now and here, he immediately fell into the emptiness of his heart and realized the truth. In an instant something was triggered in him by what Ma Tzu was saying, which Zen calls enlightenment. He became aware of his own hereness, of his own nowness. The wild geese were just an excuse.\nBut such anecdotes have never happened anywhere else. They have no parallel, hence the difficulty of understanding them. They are anecdotes on the path of meditation. Only people of the path who have gone deep into meditation will be able to understand something which looks absolutely absurd as far as reason is concerned.\nThe nose has nothing to do with attainment, otherwise it would be very easy. The disciple simply comes, gets a twisted nose, becomes enlightened and goes home. And Ma Tzu would not twist the nose of any disciple, any XYZ.\nHyakujo is ready. It is just a push. He is just on the boundary line, where anything can push him just that one single step inwards. It is such a great statement, that there is no time and there is no space – here is the only space and now is the only time.\nAnd it is not applicable only to the wild geese, it is applicable to you, to everything – the great statement and the silent watchfulness. Awakened by the twisted nose, Hyakujo attained enlightenment.\nTHE NEXT DAY, AT A REGULAR ASSEMBLY, MA TZU HAD HARDLY SAT DOWN WHEN HYAKUJO CAME TO ROLL UP HIS MAT, WHICH MADE THE MASTER DESCEND FROM THE PLATFORM. HYAKUJO FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM.\nMA TZU SAID, “JUST NOW, BEFORE I HAD BEGUN MY SERMON, WHAT MADE YOU ROLL UP MY MAT?”\nHYAKUJO SAID, “YESTERDAY YOUR REVERENCE TWISTED MY NOSE AND I FELT ACUTE PAIN.”\n“WHERE DID YOU APPLY YOUR MIND YESTERDAY?” MA TZU ASKED.\nALL THAT THE DISCIPLE SAID WAS, “I FEEL NO MORE PAIN IN THE NOSE TODAY.”\nTHEREUPON THE MASTER COMMENTED, “YOU HAVE PROFOUNDLY UNDERSTOOD YESTERDAY’S EPISODE.”\nThis is a little more subtle than the first episode. Usually the Zen master gives the sermon and the chief disciple, when the sermon is over, rolls up the mat on which he was sitting and takes the mat to his room. But in this case HYAKUJO CAME TO ROLL UP HIS MAT, WHICH MADE THE MASTER DESCEND FROM THE PLATFORM. HYAKUJO FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM.\nHe has not even uttered a single word. Hyakujo has become an enlightened master himself. Yesterday’s experience... Now he is responding the way a master responds; he is saying, by rolling up the mat, “Now I don’t need any sermon. All I needed, I got yesterday.”\nMA TZU SAID, “JUST NOW, BEFORE I HAD BEGUN MY SERMON, WHAT MADE YOU ROLL UP MY MAT?”\nHYAKUJO SAID, “YESTERDAY YOUR REVERENCE TWISTED MY NOSE AND I FELT ACUTE PAIN.”\n“WHERE DID YOU APPLY YOUR MIND YESTERDAY?”\n“Could you not have done something yesterday?” Ma Tzu is asking.\nALL THAT THE DISCIPLE SAID WAS, “I FEEL NO MORE PAIN IN THE NOSE TODAY.”\nHe is saying, “I don’t need any consolation. I feel no pain in the nose today and I don’t need any sermon anymore. You said everything yesterday.”\nTHEREUPON THE MASTER COMMENTED, “YOU HAVE PROFOUNDLY UNDERSTOOD YESTERDAY’S EPISODE.”\nON ANOTHER OCCASION, AS SOON AS MA TZU SAT DOWN ON THE ZAZEN BENCH AS USUAL, HE SPAT.\nA MONK ASKED, “WHY DID YOU SPIT?”\nMA TZU SAID, “WHEN I SAT HERE, THERE WERE MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND THE WHOLE NATURAL UNIVERSE IN FRONT OF ME. I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE THAT.”\nTHE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID! WHY DON’T YOU LIKE THAT?” MA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING TO ME.”\nTHE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?” MA TZU SAID, “THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”\nThis, the third part of the anecdote, is even more difficult to understand. Ma Tzu, spitting on the Zazen bench, is not really saying that he doesn’t like the mountains and the rivers and the stars.\nWhat he is doing is seeing whether the disciple remains silent and non-judgmental, or makes a judgment.\nZen’s whole attitude is non-judgmental. Don’t judge... and at least the disciple should not judge the action of his master, he should simply witness, he should simply see that Ma Tzu has spat. Ma Tzu is provoking him; he is provoking his judgmental mind. And the monk has forgotten that the whole teaching is to never judge. Just watch, and particularly watch the actions of the master. Do you think that Ma Tzu does not understand that spitting on the bench is simply disgusting? But he wants you to remain unwavering, non-judgmental, just watching, as a mirror.\nIf a mirror was watching, do you think the mirror would say “What are you doing? This is not good.” The disciple missed; this could have been a great opportunity to become enlightened. Remember it, devices don’t succeed all the time. Sometimes they fail.\nThe master makes his wholehearted effort but the disciple may not be in the right space to understand it. Now it is very clear to a man of a little meditation that Ma Tzu knows that spitting on the Zazen bench is disgusting, so there is no need to ask any question. Perhaps he is provoking you, he is provoking your judgmental mind. And the moment the judgmental mind comes in, your watching mind disappears. Remember these two words – judgmental and watching. You can watch only if you don’t judge.\nBut the disciple could not resist asking. He asked, “WHY DID YOU SPIT?” He forgot completely that here he has to learn watching, not making judgments, particularly of any action of the master.\nMA TZU SAID, “WHEN I SAT HERE, THERE WERE MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND THE WHOLE NATURAL UNIVERSE IN FRONT OF ME. I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE THAT.”\nStill the disciple could not understand that there were no mountains, no rivers, no universe there in front of the Zazen bench; the master’s explanation is just to test him.\nHe said, “I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE THAT.”\nA meditative disciple would have slapped Ma Tzu, he would not have asked anything, and that would have been greatly appreciated by Ma Tzu. That would have been the disciple’s enlightenment. It is not a question of asking, it is a question of responding. The master obviously is doing something wrong, just to provoke. If the disciple had slapped the master without saying anything, the master would have laughed and blessed the disciple, saying, “You have understood it.” But because the disciple missed the point, he again said, “I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE THAT.”\nHe wants the disciple to say to him, “What happened to your non-judgmental mind?” But the disciple had forgotten completely about the non-judgmental mind, which is the very foundation of Zen.\nTHE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID!”\nHe started arguing. With the master you don’t argue, you respond. You don’t start a verbal conversation – that will be missing the master and his great compassion.\nTHE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID! WHY DON’T YOU LIKE THAT?”\nHe has come down to the level of the mind and is on the point of discussing the matter. But Zen does not allow discussion. It is not a debate. It is pure awakening from the mind, pure freedom from judgment.\nMA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING TO ME.”\nHe is again and again trying to remind the disciple that he should slap him for being judgmental, that he has completely forgotten the foundation.\nTHE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?”\nHe is continuing on the mental state.\nMA TZU SAID, “THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”\nThis is the state of a buddha. Now there is nothing else to be said. Ma Tzu has closed the conversation, seeing that the device has failed.\nSo remember that a device will not always succeed, because there are two persons involved – the master who is enlightened, and the disciple who is not enlightened. And he will most probably behave in an unenlightened way, not knowing that this is the time to act spontaneously, not through the mind, but through the empty heart.\nDaio wrote in praise of Kannon:\nTHE CLIFFS ARE HIGH AND DEEP, THE WATERS RUSH AND TUMBLE.\nTHE REALM OF PERFECT COMMUNION IS NEW IN EACH PLACE.\nFACE TO FACE, THE PEOPLE WHO MEET HER DON’T RECOGNIZE HER. WHEN WILL THEY EVER BE FREE FROM THE HARBOR OF ILLUSION?\nEach moment in existence is a moment ready for communion. There is no special moment in which you can become enlightened. Every moment is special. Every moment is potential for your enlightenment – a beautiful sunset, a beautiful sunrise, a great sky full of stars, or just this silence. Anything will do, if you remember yourself to be a watcher – not getting involved, not getting identified, but just remaining a mirror, an empty mirror.\nBefore the empty mirror no illusion can remain for long. All illusions will disappear; they remain only because you get involved with them.\nDaio is asking with great compassion, WHEN WILL THEY EVER BE FREE FROM THE HARBOR OF ILLUSION?\nEvery moment the time comes for enlightenment. Every moment is the right season, the right climate; you just go on missing. Missing becomes your habit, and that habit has to be broken. You have to become stabilized, concentrated in the moment, at the center of your being; just watching without saying a single word of evaluation, good, bad or beautiful.\nNothing has to be said, just watching is enough and all illusions disappear, all that is false disappears.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nTHE STORY ABOUT MA TZU SPITTING BROUGHT HOME TO ME HOW EVERYTHING YOU DO AND SAY SEEMS TO BE ONLY FOR YOUR DISCIPLES’ SAKE.\nYOU RELATE TO SUCH A DIVERSE BUNCH OF US – FROM DANCING PLUMS TO HOT POTATOES, FROM GERMAN STONEHEADS TO LAUGHING SARDARJIS – AND YET YOU ARE NEVER OTHER THAN YOURSELF, JUST LIKE WATER THAT TAKES THE SHAPE OF WHATEVER CONTAINER IT FLOWS INTO AND YET DOESN’T LOSE ITS ESSENTIAL NATURE.\nIS IT THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOBODY, YOU CAN BE ANYBODY?\nManeesha, when you are nobody, you are already everybody. Nobody and everybody mean the same thing. And my calling some of you hot potatoes or dancing plums, German stoneheads or laughing sardarjis – they are all devices. And I know that you are in the right place and you will not misunderstand me. It is out of love and out of compassion that I call you any name. For example, I called Avirbhava a big ripe plum. She understood it. She waved me a kiss. And today she is sitting there, hiding an egg.\nAvirbhava, bring your egg here... bring it.\n(AVIRBHAVA PUTS A BIG GREEN EGG IN FRONT OF THE MASTER, ON THE PODIUM. SHE BREAKS IT, AND TWO BABY CHICKS JUMP OUT AND HOP AROUND WHILE THE MASTER CHUCKLES.)\nYeah, that is the right egg!\nNow the time for Sardarji has come. He is sitting exactly in the first row. From the very last row he has come to the first.\nPaddy is in a dark mood, so he goes to see the famous channeler, Madam Hippo. “Ah,” says the woman, staring into her crystal ball, “the signs are not good.”\n“Really?” says Paddy, wide-eyed. “What does it say?”\n“Well,” she intones, “it says that you will be a widower in one week!” Paddy wipes the sweat from his face and leans back.\n“I know that!” he says. “What I want to know is – will I get caught?”\nGeorge Bush, the American vice president, telephones the Justice Department at three o’clock in the morning. He insists that he must speak to the chief justice immediately.\nFinally, the housekeeper decides to wake him up. “Well, what is it?” demands the chief justice.\n“Your honor,” exclaims Bush, “Ronald and Nancy Reagan have just taken poison together in the White House underground bunker, and they are both dead!”\n“Really?” says the judge, yawning.\n“Yes, really!” cries Bush. “The undertaker is here already to put them in their coffins.” “Really?” says the sleepy judge.\n“Yes, really!” shouts Bush, “and since I’m the vice president, I want to take Reagan’s place!” “Well, it’s okay with me,” replies the judge, “if it’s okay with the undertaker!”\nWalter and Peggy Sue are out on a date together in Walter’s new Ford Thunderbird. He is going so slowly that it is driving Peggy Sue bananas.\n“Listen,” says Peggy Sue, excitedly, “every time you speed up the car ten miles per hour, I will take off a piece of my clothing!”\nWalter immediately puts his foot down on the accelerator, and off come her shoes. Walter smiles, pushes on the gas, and off comes her blouse. Walter’s eyes bulge out, he stomps the pedal to the floor, and off come Peggy Sue’s bra, skirt, and finally, her lace panties.\nWalter gets so excited that he gets his machinery stuck in the steering wheel and loses control of the car. It skids off the road, and rolls over. Neither of them are hurt, but Walter is stuck underneath the car.\n“Quick!” pants Walter. “Go for help!”\nFrantic and stark naked, Peggy Sue starts running around in all directions. She picks up one of Walter’s shoes, holds it over her pussy, and runs to the nearest garage.\nThere she bumps into big Rufus, the black guy, as he is fixing a car.\n“You have got to help!” Peggy Sue explains breathlessly to Rufus. “My boyfriend is stuck!” Rufus looks at the girl for a long minute.\n“Lady,” he replies slowly, “if he’s up that far, we’ll never get him out!” Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent.\nClose your eyes.\nFeel the body to be completely frozen. Go inwards with your total energy, with a great urgency,\nas if this is the last moment of your life and you have to reach to the center and the source of your being.\nDeeper and deeper, your life center is also\nthe center of the whole universe.\nIt is from your life center\nthat you are nourished by existence. Just watch the silence, the peace, the immense splendor of your being.\nYou are the buddha when you are watching;\nthe same mind when empty becomes the buddha. The buddha is nothing but an empty mirror –\nno judgment, just a watchfulness, a witnessing, and you have arrived.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax.\nLet go of the body, of the mind; leave them and just be a watcher. The body is not you,\nthe mind is not you,\nyou are only a pure witness. This is your buddhahood.\nRejoice in it.\nGet soaked and drenched in the blessing that spontaneously showers\nat the center of your being.\nThis center of your being has to become your circumference also.\nSlowly, slowly\nyou have to bring the buddha out in your actions, in your words,\nin your silences.\nDay in, day out, the buddha has to become\njust your heartbeat.\nThis immensely beautiful evening has become even more beautiful,\nwith ten thousand buddhas just watching. The eternity of existence,\nlike the wild geese, is always here.\nYou have never been anywhere else. You have always been here and now. Remember it.\nWhen you come back,\nbring that remembrance with you. It has to become your very life, your very character.\nNivedano...

USUAL, HE SPAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED, “WHY DID YOU SPIT?”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “WHEN I SAT HERE, THERE WERE MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND THE
WHOLE NATURAL UNIVERSE IN FRONT OF ME. I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE
THAT.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID! WHY DON’T YOU LIKE
THAT?” MA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING
TO ME.”</p><p>THE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?” MA TZU SAID,
“THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”</p><p>Maneesha, these are some of the great episodes in the history of Zen.
They show your realization in your action. When a master acts in a
certain way, the disciple spontaneously has to respond, not through
thinking, but through his very empty heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is ultimately a device, thousands of devices, created by
different masters to provoke awakening in you. Reading them one may
think they are just anecdotes, stories, puzzles. They are not, they are
communications, and communications of the greatest value.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY, AS HYAKUJO WAS VISITING HIS MASTER, MA TZU, A FLOCK OF WILD
GEESE FLEW OVERHEAD. MA TZU ASKED, “WHAT ARE THEY?”</p><p><br></p><p>“THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR,” SAID HYAKUJO. “WHERE ARE THEY?” ASKED THE
MASTER.</p><p>“THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, SIR,” REPLIED HYAKUJO.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SUDDENLY TOOK HOLD OF HYAKUJO’S NOSE AND TWISTED IT. OVERCOME
WITH PAIN, HYAKUJO CRIED OUT. MA TZU SAID, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN
AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”</p><p><br></p><p>AT THAT MOMENT, HYAKUJO ATTAINED ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p>To any ordinary rational thinker this will look like an absurd
statement. But to a man attuned in meditation, this can become a
tremendous awakening point. It is not that Ma Tzu does not know that the
geese have flown away. It is not that he does not know that the geese
were there. He is not asking for any knowledgeable answer. He is asking
for the response which Hyakujo missed in the beginning, when Ma Tzu
asked him, “WHAT ARE THEY?” Obviously Ma Tzu knows what they are.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, it is not a question or inquiry about knowing the
object. At this point Hyakujo missed. His response was through the mind;
he said, “THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR.”</p><p><br></p><p>That would be the response of anybody else in the whole world. It is
not out of the empty heart. It is not out of the mirror of nothingness.
It is just... any child would say it. The answer is right, but Hyakujo’s
response was not through the heart, it was through the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>“THEY ARE WILD GEESE, SIR,” SAID HYAKUJO.</p><p><br></p><p>Here he missed. He should have responded to the question without
thinking of any consequences. “WHERE ARE THEY?” – the master gave him
another chance – ASKED THE MASTER.</p><p>“THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, SIR,” REPLIED HYAKUJO.</p><p><br></p><p>He is just functioning on the mental level.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SUDDENLY TOOK HOLD OF HYAKUJO’S NOSE AND TWISTED IT. OVERCOME
WITH PAIN, HYAKUJO CRIED OUT. MA TZU SAID, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN
AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”</p><p><br></p><p>Where can they go? They have always been here and will be here. The
here is vast enough – wherever they are, they are in the here. They
cannot go out of the here. That’s what he was expecting from Hyakujo.
But he had to take Hyakujo by his nose and twist the nose to make him
aware that he was functioning through the mind. And the mind can only
bring pain; the mind is pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu’s twisting the nose of Hyakujo and giving him tremendous pain
so that he cried out – don’t take it superficially, don’t take it as it
appears on the surface. This crying out was not out of the mind. This
crying out came as the spontaneous response of his whole being. At this
moment the master could speak to him. He was in the right space now; he
was no more in the mind, his whole being was awake because of the
pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Pain has a tremendous value in awakening. Pain has been used by many
masters to awaken the sleeping disciple. All your old religions, on the
contrary, console the disciple and help him to sleep well – God is in
heaven and everything is okay on the earth, you don’t be worried! But
Zen is not at all interested in consoling you. It is interested in
awakening you.</p><p><br></p><p>When Hyakujo cried out, Ma Tzu did not say a single word of sympathy.
He did not give any explanation, why he had twisted his nose. On the
contrary he said, “YOU SAY THEY HAVE FLOWN AWAY, BUT ALL THE SAME THEY
HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.”</p><p>In that moment there was no thought except pain. The mind was empty,
the nose was hurting – and Ma Tzu did not care about the nose or the
pain; he simply stated a tremendously meaningful statement, that nobody,
nothing, can go away out of here. Here is immense and vast, so is now.
Wherever they are, they are here.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo was now in a right state to understand the meaning of the
master – that everything is always here. Those wild geese were just an
excuse to explain to Hyakujo that nothing moves, nothing goes
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>AT THAT MOMENT HYAKUJO ATTAINED ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the point, the eternity and the wideness of now and here, he
immediately fell into the emptiness of his heart and realized the truth.
In an instant something was triggered in him by what Ma Tzu was saying,
which Zen calls enlightenment. He became aware of his own hereness, of
his own nowness. The wild geese were just an excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>But such anecdotes have never happened anywhere else. They have no
parallel, hence the difficulty of understanding them. They are anecdotes
on the path of meditation. Only people of the path who have gone deep
into meditation will be able to understand something which looks
absolutely absurd as far as reason is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>The nose has nothing to do with attainment, otherwise it would be
very easy. The disciple simply comes, gets a twisted nose, becomes
enlightened and goes home. And Ma Tzu would not twist the nose of any
disciple, any XYZ.</p><p><br></p><p>Hyakujo is ready. It is just a push. He is just on the boundary line,
where anything can push him just that one single step inwards. It is
such a great statement, that there is no time and there is no space –
here is the only space and now is the only time.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not applicable only to the wild geese, it is applicable to
you, to everything – the great statement and the silent watchfulness.
Awakened by the twisted nose, Hyakujo attained enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>THE NEXT DAY, AT A REGULAR ASSEMBLY, MA TZU HAD HARDLY SAT DOWN WHEN
HYAKUJO CAME TO ROLL UP HIS MAT, WHICH MADE THE MASTER DESCEND FROM THE
PLATFORM. HYAKUJO FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “JUST NOW, BEFORE I HAD BEGUN MY SERMON, WHAT MADE YOU
ROLL UP MY MAT?”</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO SAID, “YESTERDAY YOUR REVERENCE TWISTED MY NOSE AND I FELT
ACUTE PAIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>“WHERE DID YOU APPLY YOUR MIND YESTERDAY?” MA TZU ASKED.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THAT THE DISCIPLE SAID WAS, “I FEEL NO MORE PAIN IN THE NOSE
TODAY.”</p><p>THEREUPON THE MASTER COMMENTED, “YOU HAVE PROFOUNDLY UNDERSTOOD
YESTERDAY’S EPISODE.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a little more subtle than the first episode. Usually the Zen
master gives the sermon and the chief disciple, when the sermon is over,
rolls up the mat on which he was sitting and takes the mat to his room.
But in this case HYAKUJO CAME TO ROLL UP HIS MAT, WHICH MADE THE MASTER
DESCEND FROM THE PLATFORM. HYAKUJO FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM.</p><p><br></p><p>He has not even uttered a single word. Hyakujo has become an
enlightened master himself. Yesterday’s experience... Now he is
responding the way a master responds; he is saying, by rolling up the
mat, “Now I don’t need any sermon. All I needed, I got yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “JUST NOW, BEFORE I HAD BEGUN MY SERMON, WHAT MADE YOU
ROLL UP MY MAT?”</p><p><br></p><p>HYAKUJO SAID, “YESTERDAY YOUR REVERENCE TWISTED MY NOSE AND I FELT
ACUTE PAIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>“WHERE DID YOU APPLY YOUR MIND YESTERDAY?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Could you not have done something yesterday?” Ma Tzu is asking.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THAT THE DISCIPLE SAID WAS, “I FEEL NO MORE PAIN IN THE NOSE
TODAY.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, “I don’t need any consolation. I feel no pain in the
nose today and I don’t need any sermon anymore. You said everything
yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>THEREUPON THE MASTER COMMENTED, “YOU HAVE PROFOUNDLY UNDERSTOOD
YESTERDAY’S EPISODE.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, AS SOON AS MA TZU SAT DOWN ON THE ZAZEN BENCH AS
USUAL, HE SPAT.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK ASKED, “WHY DID YOU SPIT?”</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “WHEN I SAT HERE, THERE WERE MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND THE
WHOLE NATURAL UNIVERSE IN FRONT OF ME. I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE
THAT.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID! WHY DON’T YOU LIKE
THAT?” MA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING
TO ME.”</p><p>THE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?” MA TZU SAID,
“THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”</p><p>This, the third part of the anecdote, is even more difficult to
understand. Ma Tzu, spitting on the Zazen bench, is not really saying
that he doesn’t like the mountains and the rivers and the stars.</p><p>What he is doing is seeing whether the disciple remains silent and
non-judgmental, or makes a judgment.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen’s whole attitude is non-judgmental. Don’t judge... and at least
the disciple should not judge the action of his master, he should simply
witness, he should simply see that Ma Tzu has spat. Ma Tzu is provoking
him; he is provoking his judgmental mind. And the monk has forgotten
that the whole teaching is to never judge. Just watch, and particularly
watch the actions of the master. Do you think that Ma Tzu does not
understand that spitting on the bench is simply disgusting? But he wants
you to remain unwavering, non-judgmental, just watching, as a
mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>If a mirror was watching, do you think the mirror would say “What are
you doing? This is not good.” The disciple missed; this could have been
a great opportunity to become enlightened. Remember it, devices don’t
succeed all the time. Sometimes they fail.</p><p><br></p><p>The master makes his wholehearted effort but the disciple may not be
in the right space to understand it. Now it is very clear to a man of a
little meditation that Ma Tzu knows that spitting on the Zazen bench is
disgusting, so there is no need to ask any question. Perhaps he is
provoking you, he is provoking your judgmental mind. And the moment the
judgmental mind comes in, your watching mind disappears. Remember these
two words – judgmental and watching. You can watch only if you don’t
judge.</p><p><br></p><p>But the disciple could not resist asking. He asked, “WHY DID YOU
SPIT?” He forgot completely that here he has to learn watching, not
making judgments, particularly of any action of the master.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “WHEN I SAT HERE, THERE WERE MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, AND THE
WHOLE NATURAL UNIVERSE IN FRONT OF ME. I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE
THAT.”</p><p><br></p><p>Still the disciple could not understand that there were no mountains,
no rivers, no universe there in front of the Zazen bench; the master’s
explanation is just to test him.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE THAT.”</p><p><br></p><p>A meditative disciple would have slapped Ma Tzu, he would not have
asked anything, and that would have been greatly appreciated by Ma Tzu.
That would have been the disciple’s enlightenment. It is not a question
of asking, it is a question of responding. The master obviously is doing
something wrong, just to provoke. If the disciple had slapped the master
without saying anything, the master would have laughed and blessed the
disciple, saying, “You have understood it.” But because the disciple
missed the point, he again said, “I SPAT BECAUSE I DIDN’T LIKE
THAT.”</p><p><br></p><p>He wants the disciple to say to him, “What happened to your
non-judgmental mind?” But the disciple had forgotten completely about
the non-judgmental mind, which is the very foundation of Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID!”</p><p><br></p><p>He started arguing. With the master you don’t argue, you respond. You
don’t start a verbal conversation – that will be missing the master and
his great compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO SPLENDID! WHY DON’T YOU LIKE
THAT?”</p><p>He has come down to the level of the mind and is on the point of
discussing the matter. But Zen does not allow discussion. It is not a
debate. It is pure awakening from the mind, pure freedom from
judgment.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU REPLIED, “IT MAY BE SPLENDID TO YOU, BUT IT IS DISGUSTING TO
ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is again and again trying to remind the disciple that he should
slap him for being judgmental, that he has completely forgotten the
foundation.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK CONTINUED, “WHAT KIND OF MENTAL STATE IS THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is continuing on the mental state.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU SAID, “THIS IS THE STATE OF A BODHISATTVA.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the state of a buddha. Now there is nothing else to be said.
Ma Tzu has closed the conversation, seeing that the device has
failed.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember that a device will not always succeed, because there are
two persons involved – the master who is enlightened, and the disciple
who is not enlightened. And he will most probably behave in an
unenlightened way, not knowing that this is the time to act
spontaneously, not through the mind, but through the empty heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Daio wrote in praise of Kannon:</p><p><br></p><p>THE CLIFFS ARE HIGH AND DEEP, THE WATERS RUSH AND TUMBLE.</p><p>THE REALM OF PERFECT COMMUNION IS NEW IN EACH PLACE.</p><p>FACE TO FACE, THE PEOPLE WHO MEET HER DON’T RECOGNIZE HER. WHEN WILL
THEY EVER BE FREE FROM THE HARBOR OF ILLUSION?</p><p>Each moment in existence is a moment ready for communion. There is no
special moment in which you can become enlightened. Every moment is
special. Every moment is potential for your enlightenment – a beautiful
sunset, a beautiful sunrise, a great sky full of stars, or just this
silence. Anything will do, if you remember yourself to be a watcher –
not getting involved, not getting identified, but just remaining a
mirror, an empty mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the empty mirror no illusion can remain for long. All
illusions will disappear; they remain only because you get involved with
them.</p><p>Daio is asking with great compassion, WHEN WILL THEY EVER BE FREE
FROM THE HARBOR OF ILLUSION?</p><p><br></p><p>Every moment the time comes for enlightenment. Every moment is the
right season, the right climate; you just go on missing. Missing becomes
your habit, and that habit has to be broken. You have to become
stabilized, concentrated in the moment, at the center of your being;
just watching without saying a single word of evaluation, good, bad or
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing has to be said, just watching is enough and all illusions
disappear, all that is false disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>THE STORY ABOUT MA TZU SPITTING BROUGHT HOME TO ME HOW EVERYTHING YOU
DO AND SAY SEEMS TO BE ONLY FOR YOUR DISCIPLES’ SAKE.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU RELATE TO SUCH A DIVERSE BUNCH OF US – FROM DANCING PLUMS TO HOT
POTATOES, FROM GERMAN STONEHEADS TO LAUGHING SARDARJIS – AND YET YOU ARE
NEVER OTHER THAN YOURSELF, JUST LIKE WATER THAT TAKES THE SHAPE OF
WHATEVER CONTAINER IT FLOWS INTO AND YET DOESN’T LOSE ITS ESSENTIAL
NATURE.</p><p><br></p><p>IS IT THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOBODY, YOU CAN BE ANYBODY?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, when you are nobody, you are already everybody. Nobody and
everybody mean the same thing. And my calling some of you hot potatoes
or dancing plums, German stoneheads or laughing sardarjis – they are all
devices. And I know that you are in the right place and you will not
misunderstand me. It is out of love and out of compassion that I call
you any name. For example, I called Avirbhava a big ripe plum. She
understood it. She waved me a kiss. And today she is sitting there,
hiding an egg.</p><p><br></p><p>Avirbhava, bring your egg here... bring it.</p><p><br></p><p>(AVIRBHAVA PUTS A BIG GREEN EGG IN FRONT OF THE MASTER, ON THE
PODIUM. SHE BREAKS IT, AND TWO BABY CHICKS JUMP OUT AND HOP AROUND WHILE
THE MASTER CHUCKLES.)</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, that is the right egg!</p><p><br></p><p>Now the time for Sardarji has come. He is sitting exactly in the
first row. From the very last row he has come to the first.</p><p>Paddy is in a dark mood, so he goes to see the famous channeler,
Madam Hippo. “Ah,” says the woman, staring into her crystal ball, “the
signs are not good.”</p><p>“Really?” says Paddy, wide-eyed. “What does it say?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” she intones, “it says that you will be a widower in one
week!” Paddy wipes the sweat from his face and leans back.</p><p>“I know that!” he says. “What I want to know is – will I get
caught?”</p><p><br></p><p>George Bush, the American vice president, telephones the Justice
Department at three o’clock in the morning. He insists that he must
speak to the chief justice immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the housekeeper decides to wake him up. “Well, what is it?”
demands the chief justice.</p><p>“Your honor,” exclaims Bush, “Ronald and Nancy Reagan have just taken
poison together in the White House underground bunker, and they are both
dead!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” says the judge, yawning.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, really!” cries Bush. “The undertaker is here already to put
them in their coffins.” “Really?” says the sleepy judge.</p><p>“Yes, really!” shouts Bush, “and since I’m the vice president, I want
to take Reagan’s place!” “Well, it’s okay with me,” replies the judge,
“if it’s okay with the undertaker!”</p><p>Walter and Peggy Sue are out on a date together in Walter’s new Ford
Thunderbird. He is going so slowly that it is driving Peggy Sue
bananas.</p><p><br></p><p>“Listen,” says Peggy Sue, excitedly, “every time you speed up the car
ten miles per hour, I will take off a piece of my clothing!”</p><p><br></p><p>Walter immediately puts his foot down on the accelerator, and off
come her shoes. Walter smiles, pushes on the gas, and off comes her
blouse. Walter’s eyes bulge out, he stomps the pedal to the floor, and
off come Peggy Sue’s bra, skirt, and finally, her lace panties.</p><p><br></p><p>Walter gets so excited that he gets his machinery stuck in the
steering wheel and loses control of the car. It skids off the road, and
rolls over. Neither of them are hurt, but Walter is stuck underneath the
car.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quick!” pants Walter. “Go for help!”</p><p><br></p><p>Frantic and stark naked, Peggy Sue starts running around in all
directions. She picks up one of Walter’s shoes, holds it over her pussy,
and runs to the nearest garage.</p><p><br></p><p>There she bumps into big Rufus, the black guy, as he is fixing a
car.</p><p>“You have got to help!” Peggy Sue explains breathlessly to Rufus. “My
boyfriend is stuck!” Rufus looks at the girl for a long minute.</p><p>“Lady,” he replies slowly, “if he’s up that far, we’ll never get him
out!” Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent.</p><p>Close your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel the body to be completely frozen. Go inwards with your total

showers</p><p>at the center of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>This center of your being has to become your circumference also.</p><p>Slowly, slowly</p><p><br></p><p>you have to bring the buddha out in your actions, in your words,</p><p>in your silences.</p><p><br></p><p>Day in, day out, the buddha has to become</p><p>just your heartbeat.</p><p><br></p><p>This immensely beautiful evening has become even more beautiful,</p><p>with ten thousand buddhas just watching. The eternity of
existence,</p><p>like the wild geese, is always here.</p><p>You have never been anywhere else. You have always been here and now.
Remember it.</p><p>When you come back,</p><p><br></p><p>bring that remembrance with you. It has to become your very life,
your very character.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but bring the buddha with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Come back as an empty mirror</p><p><br></p><p>and sit down for few seconds as a buddha – remembering,
recollecting</p><p>the great experience you have passed through. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the ten thousand buddhas? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

LISTEN TO MY GATHA:\n“THE GROUND OF THE NO-MIND CONTAINS MANY SEEDS\nWHICH WILL ALL SPROUT WHEN HEAVENLY SHOWERS COME. THE FLOWER OF SAMADHI\nIS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY MORE MUTABILITY?”\nIT IS SAID THAT AT THIS, MA TZU WAS TRULY ENLIGHTENED, HIS MIND HAVING TRANSCENDED THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA. HE ATTENDED UPON HIS MASTER FOR A FULL TEN YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD, HE DELVED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO MEDITATION.\nManeesha, a great master on his own authority, Nangaku, is working on a greater master, Ma Tzu, who is just a seed right now, but contains a great buddha.\nYou are also seeds. It is up to you if you remain closed. Then you will never know your ultimate nature as a buddha. A little courage, a little opening, a little dying of the cover of the seed and the buddha starts sprouting in you.\nYou cannot blame the climate. The rains are there. The clouds have even entered into the auditorium, they are just passing before my eyes. So close are the clouds... but the strange thing is that the closer the clouds are, the more the seed becomes afraid. Afraid of the unknown, afraid of... one never knows what is going to be outside. Hidden inside a cover, the seed feels safer, more secure.\nOn the path of Zen you have to learn these important words: openness, joy in insecurity – a challenge from the unknown has always to be welcomed. That is the way of growing up. Most of the people in the world, who Wilhelm Reich has called “little men,” die as little men, although their destiny is not to be little men. Wilhelm Reich was perfectly right in respect of the masses, the crowd, to call his book LISTEN, LITTLE MAN. But he was absolutely wrong because he could not see that hidden in the little man is the greatest buddha.\nHe simply condemned the little man because all the little men were condemning him. He was a genius; not a buddha but an intellectual giant, and he has been condemned by the crowds. Finally he was forced within the walls of a madhouse. And he was saying immensely sensible things. He was bringing a new territory to be explored.\nBut all those fearful people, afraid of the unknown, afraid of losing the security and the safety of the bank balance, forced him into a madhouse. And he was not mad. In his madhouse days he wrote\nhis best books. They are evidence that he was not mad. But the politicians and the crowd and the government all conspired to force him to live in a madhouse. They all laughed at his immensely valuable discoveries about human energy. Naturally he was angry.\nSo when he wrote the book LISTEN, LITTLE MAN, it was not out of compassion, it was out of reaction. They had done harm to him, and he at least was able to condemn them. His book is beautiful in describing the little man. But the essential part of the little man is the seed, his potentiality, which Reich completely forgets in his anger.\nOtherwise he was very close to becoming enlightened. But in his anger, his reaction, he was incapable of seeing the point that the people were bound to condemn him – his being a genius was enough reason for their condemnation. They were bound to crucify him and it had to be understood as the natural course of things. But he could not take it as the natural course of things. He could not understand that it is something that has to happen to every genius who opens the doors of insecurity.\nAnd because of this great cloud of anger, he was completely blind, unable to see that the little man is a buddha, hidden deep down as a seed.\nNangaku is instructing Ma Tzu.\nAFTER HIS FIRST INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIS MASTER, NANGAKU, ON THE MEANING OF THE DHARMA, MA TZU FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE NECTAR. AFTER BOWING TO THE MASTER, MA TZU ASKED HIM, “HOW MUST ONE BE ATTUNED TO THE FORMLESS SAMADHI?”\nThe first thing to understand is the meaning of dharma. Unfortunately the Sanskrit word ‘dharma’ – or the Pali word which Buddha used, ‘dhamma’ – has been wrongly translated as ‘religion’ by the theologians, and by scholars it has been translated as ‘law’, the ultimate law. Both have missed the point.\nDharma is not religion. In fact if you go to the roots of the words, religion means that which binds you, and dharma means that which frees you. They are absolutely contrary to each other. Dharma simply means your intrinsic nature. It is not written in scriptures and nobody can tell you what your dharma is. You have to find it yourself. This is a great dignity, conferred on the individual by existence, that you don’t have to live on borrowed knowledge. The living source of life is just flowing close by. Why not drink it and be quenched?\nMa Tzu says, after understanding the meaning of the dharma, that HE FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE NECTAR. The deeper you go in your meditations, the closer you will come to the eternal stream of your life sources. It is pure nectar, because it declares your immortality, it declares your eternity. It declares that death is a fiction; it has never happened and will never happen to anyone. One only changes the house; one gets into another form or maybe into the formless existence.\nMa Tzu’s statement that HE FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE NECTAR\nshows his tremendous understanding. He is very new in meditation, he is so young. But age has\nnothing to do with your realization. It is not that when you get old, you will be able to become a buddha easily. On the contrary, the older you become the more difficult it becomes for you to drop your lifelong habits, concepts, ideologies.\nJust two years ago Pope the Polack was in India and he was surprised to see that the very poor and the orphans who have been converted to Christianity were doing the same in their churches as they had been doing before: burning incense, bringing flowers for Jesus Christ. He could not believe what the priests were doing, because these people were doing exactly what they used to do in their temples. Instead of Krishna, now Christ is there, everything else is the same.\nBut the priests told him that they had to make a few considerations, a few compromises. These people cannot understand a religion without incense, without flowers. And the pope conceded that for Indian Christians it is okay.\nAs you become old, it becomes very difficult to change your ideology, your lifelong belief. It becomes hardened. The old man becomes hard, and in the same way everything around him becomes hard. The best situation in which to grow into your potential is childhood. Next to it is your youth. Most probably the childhood will be spoilt by the parents, by the priests.\nThe authentic religion has to depend on youth, because youth has a certain rebelliousness natural to it. A young man can rebel against the whole past without any guilt. He can clean his heart of all the old dead scriptures and statues, and the challenge of the unknown stirs his heart. He wants to accept the greatest challenge, and this is the greatest challenge in life – to allow your seed to open to the unknown skies, to the winds, the sun, the rain; one never knows what is going to happen.\nThere is nobody to guide the seed, there are no scriptures for the seed to read. The seed is taking a risk by coming out, and you should understand that the risk is not small. The risk is exactly a death. The seed has to die in the soil; only then the sprouts of the potentiality of the seed will start growing. Perhaps it will become a roseflower, or a lotus, or some other kind of flower. It does not matter. What matters is flowering, not the name of the flower. A wild flower is as beautiful as the most precious rose. They are brothers in one way, that they both have come to their flowering. They have both enjoyed the joy of growth, they both have seen with their own eyes what was hidden in their seed. They have both taken the same risk and the same challenge.\nIn fact it is a death and a resurrection. The seed dies and resurrects into many flowers, into many fruits, into many seeds. It is said that a single seed can make the whole earth green. Just one plant is not its potential. On that one plant there will come thousands of seeds again, each seed again carrying thousands of seeds.\nJust a single seed can fill the whole earth with absolute greenness. Such tremendous possibility in a small seed! And you are a living seed, conscious. The most precious thing in existence is within you: consciousness. The seed is groping in the dark, still finding the way. And you are conscious, you have a little light, but you don’t move from your position, you remain a little man. In fact you hate all those who have gone to the other shore because their very going condemns you, that you have failed to fulfill your own destiny.\nAFTER BOWING TO THE MASTER, MA TZU ASKED HIM, “HOW MUST ONE BE ATTUNED TO THE FORMLESS SAMADHI?”\nThe master must have said to him that unless you become attuned with existence in utter silence, you cannot know the dharma, the very principle of life and existence. Ma Tzu’s inquiry is that of an honest seeker. He loved what was said, he felt it as if it was exquisite nectar – but he would not believe it. There are still things to be settled. His question is not the question of a student, it is the question of a would-be master.\n“HOW MUST ONE BE ATTUNED TO FORMLESS SAMADHI?”\nHe cuts out all unnecessary questions and comes exactly to the right thing, how one should be attuned to the formless samadhi.\nSamadhi is a Sanskrit word, very beautiful in its meaning. It comes from a root which means, when there is no question and no answer, when your silence is so profound that you don’t even have the question; answers are left far away but you don’t have even the question. Such innocence which is just silent is called samadhi. And in this samadhi you can fall in tune with the heartbeat of the universe. Only in samadhi can you become one with the whole. There is no other way.\nEvery day what we are doing in the name of meditation is moving towards samadhi. Meditation is the beginning and samadhi is the end. Ma Tzu’s question is that of a potential buddha. He is not asking about non-essentials, just the very essential.\nTHE MASTER SAID, “WHEN YOU CULTIVATE THE WAY OF INTERIOR WISDOM, IT IS LIKE SOWING SEED. WHEN I EXPOUND TO YOU THE ESSENTIALS OF DHARMA, IT IS LIKE THE SHOWERS FROM HEAVEN. AS YOU ARE RECEPTIVE TO THE TEACHING, YOU ARE DESTINED TO SEE THE TAO.”\nTao is Chinese for what we call samadhi; the Japanese call it satori, the Chinese call it tao. Tao is perhaps the best of all these expressions, because it is not part of language. It simply indicates something inexpressible, something that you can know but cannot say, something that you can live but cannot explain. It is something that you can dance, you can sing, but you cannot utter a single word about it. You can be it; you can be the expression of Tao, but you cannot say what it is that you are expressing.\nMA TZU AGAIN ASKED: “SINCE THE TAO IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM, HOW CAN IT BE SEEN?”\nYou have to understand this dialogue very deeply, because it will give you the right direction for what has to be asked. There are thousands of things to ask, but the essentials are very few and unless you start by asking the essentials, you will not come close to the truth.\nAs Nangaku mentioned the Tao, Ma Tzu immediately asked: “SINCE THE TAO IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM, HOW CAN IT BE SEEN? – you are saying that if you enter into samadhi, you will see the Tao.”\nTHE MASTER SAID: “THE DHARMA-EYE OF YOUR INTERIOR SPIRIT IS CAPABLE OF PERCEIVING THE TAO. SO IT IS WITH THE FORMLESS SAMADHI.”\nIt was for this reason that the East had to develop the concept of the third eye. These two eyes can see only the form, the color, but they cannot see the formless and the colorless. For the formless and colorless they are blind. In samadhi you close these eyes and a new perceptivity, which can be metaphorically called ‘the third eye’, arises in you; a new sensitivity which can feel and see what is not possible for your outer senses.\nThe dharma-eye, which is the third eye of your interior spirit, is capable of perceiving the Tao. When I say to you in meditations, “Go deeper, look deeper,” I am trying in every way so that your third eye, which has remained dormant, opens up.\nMa Tzu still asked, “IS THERE STILL MAKING AND UNMAKING?”\nCan we do something inside? Can we make a buddha inside? Is there still some creativity inside? It is a very profound question.\nTO THIS, THE MASTER REPLIED, “IF ONE SEES THE TAO FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MAKING AND UNMAKING, OR GATHERING AND SCATTERING, ONE DOES NOT REALLY SEE THE TAO. LISTEN TO MY GATHA.”\nHe says that as far as your inner world is concerned your buddha is already there; you don’t have to make it. Everything is as it should be in your inner world.\nI am reminded of the Russian scientist, Kirlian, who brought a new vision to the objective scientist; its implications are immense. He was a great photographer and he went on perfecting and refining his lenses. His whole idea was that if something is hidden in a seed as a potential, then perhaps the photograph of the potential can be caught with a better lens.\nIt was a very strange idea, but scientists and mystics and philosophers and poets are all a little bit crazy. Everybody tried to persuade him: “Don’t do such nonsense, how can you see the rose in the seed?”\nHe said, “If it is going to be, then it must be present in some way – perhaps our eyes are not capable of seeing it.” And finally he succeeded. He managed to create lenses which could take a photograph of what was going to happen in the future. He would put the seed in front of his camera and a photograph would come of a rose flower.\nAnd then he would wait for the seed to die into the soil – and it was one of the miracles of modern genius, that when the real rose came, it would be exactly the same as the photograph. He has caught the future in his net.\nHe became convinced that if it is true about the seed then it can be used in many things. For example, Kirlian photography has now become an absolute must in Russian hospitals. People come just to be checked, to see if there is any possibility of disease in the future.\nHis lenses have become even more refined now after his death; a whole school of Kirlian photographers has been working on it. They can see at least six months ahead. If you are going to be sick in six months’ time, the photograph will show it – that after six months you will have cancer.\nThere is no other way to find it out, but it can be treated although it has not become manifest. It is a tremendous blessing to medicine. We can cure people before they become sick.\nWhat we see with our eyes is not all. Even in the outside world our eyes have limitations. Kirlian photography has gone beyond our eyes into the objective world. In the same way the third eye opens in the inner world and brings you your whole potentiality in its fullness. You don’t have to do anything, you have just to recognize it. A buddha is not made, a buddha is only remembered.\nNangaku said, “LISTEN TO MY GATHA.” That is an ancient way; ‘gatha’ means poetry. “What I could manage to say in prose, I have said. Now listen to my poetry. Something that I have not been able to say in prose can be said in poetry.\n“THE GROUND OF THE NO-MIND CONTAINS MANY SEEDS\nWHICH WILL ALL SPROUT WHEN HEAVENLY SHOWERS COME.”\nThey have come and now it is up to you to take the challenge. “THE FLOWER OF SAMADHI\nIS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY MORE MUTABILITY?”\nIT IS SAID THAT AT THIS, MA TZU WAS TRULY ENLIGHTENED, HIS MIND HAVING TRANSCENDED THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA. HE ATTENDED UPON HIS MASTER FOR A FULL TEN YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD, HE DELVED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO MEDITATION.\nKanzan wrote:\nIN MY HOUSE THERE IS A CAVE,\nAND IN THE CAVE IS NOTHING AT ALL – PURE AND WONDERFULLY EMPTY, RESPLENDENT, WITH A LIGHT\nLIKE THE SUN.\nA MEAL OF GREENS WILL DO\nFOR THIS OLD BODY,\nA RAGGED COAT WILL COVER THIS PHANTOM FORM.\nLET A THOUSAND SAINTS APPEAR BEFORE ME – I HAVE THE BUDDHA OF HEAVENLY TRUTH!\nOnce you have looked into your inner cave and found the light, the life, the very source of your being, then the so-called saints don’t mean anything. They are just moralists, following a certain system of morality, beliefs, but they don’t have the truth. If you have the truth then even a thousand saints cannot weigh more than your buddha. Your buddha is the ultimate and it is not borrowed. You have discovered it.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nI LOVE THE EXPRESSION, “TAKE ONE STEP TOWARDS ALLAH, AND HE WILL COME RUNNING A THOUSAND STEPS TOWARDS YOU.”\nIT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT RECEPTIVITY IS NOT A TOTALLY INACTIVE WAITING BUT REQUIRES A CERTAIN PARTICIPATION.\nEVEN TO RECEIVE A FLOWER, DOESN’T ONE NEED TO HOLD OUT ONE’S HAND? OR AM I ON THE WRONG TRACK AGAIN?\nYes, Maneesha, you are on a wrong track again. That saying comes from Mohammedanism, “Take one step towards Allah, and he will come running a thousand steps toward you.”\nBut in the world of Zen there is no Allah, and as far as your inside is concerned, just take one step and you are the Allah. Nobody comes running. On the contrary, you come to a standstill. Just one step, inside – that Mohammedan saying is still about the outside God – you take one step and God will come running towards you. But that kind of God does not exist, so don’t unnecessarily waste your step! Save it, you will need it to go in. And the moment you go one step in, you are the Allah. In the world of Zen that kind of statement is not applicable at all.\nNow the clouds have come, really with tremendous urgency! This year Poona is going to be flooded even without the Shankaracharya committing suicide. Just the laughter of ten thousand buddhas is enough to call all the clouds of the world. They don’t need any passport, any visa. They don’t have to pass any customs office. They are the free buddhas moving in the sky, and when they see ten\nthousand buddhas gathered, naturally they come running – particularly at the time when I am going to tell you the jokes.\nWhere is Sardar Gurudayal Singh? Just laugh loudly. This book is going to be dedicated to Sardar Gurudayal Singh, the only man in history who laughs before the joke is told. What a trust! You should learn trust from Sardar Gurudayal Singh.\nMaggie MacTavish dies and leaves old Hamish a widower. It is such a relief for him that he rushes excitedly round to see Mr. Tomb, the undertaker.\n“How much to bury my wife?” asks Hamish.\n“Five hundred pounds,” replies Tomb, rubbing his hands together.\n“Five hundred?” splutters Hamish, clutching his purse. “Can’t you do it for less?” “Well,” replies Mr Tomb, “the cheapest I can manage is three hundred pounds.”\n“My God!” wails Hamish, counting out his money, “I almost wish she was still alive!”\nMagic Mushroom Melvin, the old hippy, is busy making lunch for his old buddy, Buffalo Grass.\n“Wow, man!” says Melvin, stepping back from the sink and sitting down to smoke a few reefers. “That’s the wildest recipe I have ever tried.”\n“Groovy, man!” says Buffalo Grass, in a cloud of smoke. “What is it?” “It is salad, man!” says Melvin.\n“Hey, cool, man – salad!” agrees Buffalo Grass. “How do you make it?”\n“Well, it’s really easy, man!” says Melvin, “you cut up lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots; then you throw in some LSD, stand back, and watch the salad toss itself!”\nDilly and Dally are identical twin brothers, who live in a small town near the sea. Dilly is married and Dally is single, but he keeps a small rowing boat.\nOne day Dilly’s wife dies, and a few days later, Dally’s rowing boat sinks.\nWalking in the street a week later, Dally meets Mrs. Godball, the bishop’s wife. Mrs. Godball mistakes Dally, the boatman, for Dilly, who has just lost his wife.\n“I’m sorry to hear about your terrible loss!” says Mrs. Godball.\n“Oh, thank you very much!” replies Dally, the boatman, “but I am not sorry at all. She was a rotten old thing from the start. She had a huge crack in the front of her and a big hole behind, which kept\ngetting bigger every time I used her. She stank of old fish and used to leak water all the time. Her bottom was really badly scratched up, and whenever there was wind, it was not safe to go near her.\n“Last week, three men came around looking for some fun, so I hired her out to them. I told them to take it easy with her, but the three idiots all tried to get into her at the same time. Of course, she split from back to front. Now she is gone, and I am very happy about it!”\nMrs. Godball faints. Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent.\nClose your eyes,\nand feel your body to be completely frozen. Look inwards with absolute urgency.\nDeeper and deeper,\nuntil you reach the source of your very being.\nIt is very close – just one step and you are the buddha.\nSuch a beautiful evening,\nand the dancing rains rejoicing in your silence, rejoicing in your samadhi.\nThese cloud buddhas have come from so far away, don’t let them down.\nDeeper and deeper,\nthere is no need to fear.\nIt is your own space and it is your own birthright to be a buddha.\nTo make it absolutely clear\nthat you are not the body, nor the mind, but just a witness,\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, and just be a witness.\nThis witnessing is another name of the buddha. Witnessing makes you an empty mirror, reflecting everything without getting identified. And this is the miracle of meditation;\nit gives you freedom, it gives you the beyond. Gather the experience, the fragrance,\nbecause the time is close that you will be called back. Taste the nectar,\nthe eternally running stream of your life, let it sink deep in your every fiber,\nbecause it is going to be a twenty-four hour lifestyle. Living or dead, you have to remain as a buddha.\nNivedano...

OF THE DHARMA, MA TZU FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE

SAMADHI</p><p>IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY MORE MUTABILITY?”</p><p>IT IS SAID THAT AT THIS, MA TZU WAS TRULY ENLIGHTENED, HIS MIND
HAVING TRANSCENDED THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA. HE ATTENDED UPON HIS MASTER
FOR A FULL TEN YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD, HE DELVED DEEPER AND DEEPER
INTO MEDITATION.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, a great master on his own authority, Nangaku, is working on
a greater master, Ma Tzu, who is just a seed right now, but contains a
great buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also seeds. It is up to you if you remain closed. Then you
will never know your ultimate nature as a buddha. A little courage, a
little opening, a little dying of the cover of the seed and the buddha
starts sprouting in you.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot blame the climate. The rains are there. The clouds have
even entered into the auditorium, they are just passing before my eyes.
So close are the clouds... but the strange thing is that the closer the
clouds are, the more the seed becomes afraid. Afraid of the unknown,
afraid of... one never knows what is going to be outside. Hidden inside
a cover, the seed feels safer, more secure.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of Zen you have to learn these important words: openness,
joy in insecurity – a challenge from the unknown has always to be
welcomed. That is the way of growing up. Most of the people in the
world, who Wilhelm Reich has called “little men,” die as little men,
although their destiny is not to be little men. Wilhelm Reich was
perfectly right in respect of the masses, the crowd, to call his book
LISTEN, LITTLE MAN. But he was absolutely wrong because he could not see
that hidden in the little man is the greatest buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>He simply condemned the little man because all the little men were
condemning him. He was a genius; not a buddha but an intellectual giant,
and he has been condemned by the crowds. Finally he was forced within
the walls of a madhouse. And he was saying immensely sensible things. He
was bringing a new territory to be explored.</p><p><br></p><p>But all those fearful people, afraid of the unknown, afraid of losing
the security and the safety of the bank balance, forced him into a
madhouse. And he was not mad. In his madhouse days he wrote</p><p>his best books. They are evidence that he was not mad. But the
politicians and the crowd and the government all conspired to force him
to live in a madhouse. They all laughed at his immensely valuable
discoveries about human energy. Naturally he was angry.</p><p><br></p><p>So when he wrote the book LISTEN, LITTLE MAN, it was not out of
compassion, it was out of reaction. They had done harm to him, and he at
least was able to condemn them. His book is beautiful in describing the
little man. But the essential part of the little man is the seed, his
potentiality, which Reich completely forgets in his anger.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise he was very close to becoming enlightened. But in his
anger, his reaction, he was incapable of seeing the point that the
people were bound to condemn him – his being a genius was enough reason
for their condemnation. They were bound to crucify him and it had to be
understood as the natural course of things. But he could not take it as
the natural course of things. He could not understand that it is
something that has to happen to every genius who opens the doors of
insecurity.</p><p><br></p><p>And because of this great cloud of anger, he was completely blind,
unable to see that the little man is a buddha, hidden deep down as a
seed.</p><p><br></p><p>Nangaku is instructing Ma Tzu.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER HIS FIRST INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIS MASTER, NANGAKU, ON THE MEANING
OF THE DHARMA, MA TZU FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE
NECTAR. AFTER BOWING TO THE MASTER, MA TZU ASKED HIM, “HOW MUST ONE BE
ATTUNED TO THE FORMLESS SAMADHI?”</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to understand is the meaning of dharma. Unfortunately
the Sanskrit word ‘dharma’ – or the Pali word which Buddha used,
‘dhamma’ – has been wrongly translated as ‘religion’ by the theologians,
and by scholars it has been translated as ‘law’, the ultimate law. Both
have missed the point.</p><p><br></p><p>Dharma is not religion. In fact if you go to the roots of the words,
religion means that which binds you, and dharma means that which frees
you. They are absolutely contrary to each other. Dharma simply means
your intrinsic nature. It is not written in scriptures and nobody can
tell you what your dharma is. You have to find it yourself. This is a
great dignity, conferred on the individual by existence, that you don’t
have to live on borrowed knowledge. The living source of life is just
flowing close by. Why not drink it and be quenched?</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu says, after understanding the meaning of the dharma, that HE
FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST EXQUISITE NECTAR. The deeper you go
in your meditations, the closer you will come to the eternal stream of
your life sources. It is pure nectar, because it declares your
immortality, it declares your eternity. It declares that death is a
fiction; it has never happened and will never happen to anyone. One only
changes the house; one gets into another form or maybe into the formless
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu’s statement that HE FELT AS IF HE WERE DRINKING THE MOST
EXQUISITE NECTAR</p><p>shows his tremendous understanding. He is very new in meditation, he
is so young. But age has</p><p>nothing to do with your realization. It is not that when you get old,
you will be able to become a buddha easily. On the contrary, the older
you become the more difficult it becomes for you to drop your lifelong
habits, concepts, ideologies.</p><p><br></p><p>Just two years ago Pope the Polack was in India and he was surprised
to see that the very poor and the orphans who have been converted to
Christianity were doing the same in their churches as they had been
doing before: burning incense, bringing flowers for Jesus Christ. He
could not believe what the priests were doing, because these people were
doing exactly what they used to do in their temples. Instead of Krishna,
now Christ is there, everything else is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>But the priests told him that they had to make a few considerations,
a few compromises. These people cannot understand a religion without
incense, without flowers. And the pope conceded that for Indian
Christians it is okay.</p><p><br></p><p>As you become old, it becomes very difficult to change your ideology,
your lifelong belief. It becomes hardened. The old man becomes hard, and
in the same way everything around him becomes hard. The best situation
in which to grow into your potential is childhood. Next to it is your
youth. Most probably the childhood will be spoilt by the parents, by the
priests.</p><p><br></p><p>The authentic religion has to depend on youth, because youth has a
certain rebelliousness natural to it. A young man can rebel against the
whole past without any guilt. He can clean his heart of all the old dead
scriptures and statues, and the challenge of the unknown stirs his
heart. He wants to accept the greatest challenge, and this is the
greatest challenge in life – to allow your seed to open to the unknown
skies, to the winds, the sun, the rain; one never knows what is going to
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nobody to guide the seed, there are no scriptures for the
seed to read. The seed is taking a risk by coming out, and you should
understand that the risk is not small. The risk is exactly a death. The
seed has to die in the soil; only then the sprouts of the potentiality
of the seed will start growing. Perhaps it will become a roseflower, or
a lotus, or some other kind of flower. It does not matter. What matters
is flowering, not the name of the flower. A wild flower is as beautiful
as the most precious rose. They are brothers in one way, that they both
have come to their flowering. They have both enjoyed the joy of growth,
they both have seen with their own eyes what was hidden in their seed.
They have both taken the same risk and the same challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it is a death and a resurrection. The seed dies and
resurrects into many flowers, into many fruits, into many seeds. It is
said that a single seed can make the whole earth green. Just one plant
is not its potential. On that one plant there will come thousands of
seeds again, each seed again carrying thousands of seeds.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a single seed can fill the whole earth with absolute greenness.
Such tremendous possibility in a small seed! And you are a living seed,
conscious. The most precious thing in existence is within you:
consciousness. The seed is groping in the dark, still finding the way.
And you are conscious, you have a little light, but you don’t move from
your position, you remain a little man. In fact you hate all those who
have gone to the other shore because their very going condemns you, that
you have failed to fulfill your own destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER BOWING TO THE MASTER, MA TZU ASKED HIM, “HOW MUST ONE BE
ATTUNED TO THE FORMLESS SAMADHI?”</p><p>The master must have said to him that unless you become attuned with
existence in utter silence, you cannot know the dharma, the very
principle of life and existence. Ma Tzu’s inquiry is that of an honest
seeker. He loved what was said, he felt it as if it was exquisite nectar
– but he would not believe it. There are still things to be settled. His
question is not the question of a student, it is the question of a
would-be master.</p><p><br></p><p>“HOW MUST ONE BE ATTUNED TO FORMLESS SAMADHI?”</p><p><br></p><p>He cuts out all unnecessary questions and comes exactly to the right
thing, how one should be attuned to the formless samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>Samadhi is a Sanskrit word, very beautiful in its meaning. It comes
from a root which means, when there is no question and no answer, when
your silence is so profound that you don’t even have the question;
answers are left far away but you don’t have even the question. Such
innocence which is just silent is called samadhi. And in this samadhi
you can fall in tune with the heartbeat of the universe. Only in samadhi
can you become one with the whole. There is no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day what we are doing in the name of meditation is moving
towards samadhi. Meditation is the beginning and samadhi is the end. Ma
Tzu’s question is that of a potential buddha. He is not asking about
non-essentials, just the very essential.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER SAID, “WHEN YOU CULTIVATE THE WAY OF INTERIOR WISDOM, IT
IS LIKE SOWING SEED. WHEN I EXPOUND TO YOU THE ESSENTIALS OF DHARMA, IT
IS LIKE THE SHOWERS FROM HEAVEN. AS YOU ARE RECEPTIVE TO THE TEACHING,
YOU ARE DESTINED TO SEE THE TAO.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tao is Chinese for what we call samadhi; the Japanese call it satori,
the Chinese call it tao. Tao is perhaps the best of all these
expressions, because it is not part of language. It simply indicates
something inexpressible, something that you can know but cannot say,
something that you can live but cannot explain. It is something that you
can dance, you can sing, but you cannot utter a single word about it.
You can be it; you can be the expression of Tao, but you cannot say what
it is that you are expressing.</p><p><br></p><p>MA TZU AGAIN ASKED: “SINCE THE TAO IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM, HOW CAN
IT BE SEEN?”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand this dialogue very deeply, because it will
give you the right direction for what has to be asked. There are
thousands of things to ask, but the essentials are very few and unless
you start by asking the essentials, you will not come close to the
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>As Nangaku mentioned the Tao, Ma Tzu immediately asked: “SINCE THE
TAO IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM, HOW CAN IT BE SEEN? – you are saying that
if you enter into samadhi, you will see the Tao.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER SAID: “THE DHARMA-EYE OF YOUR INTERIOR SPIRIT IS CAPABLE
OF PERCEIVING THE TAO. SO IT IS WITH THE FORMLESS SAMADHI.”</p><p>It was for this reason that the East had to develop the concept of
the third eye. These two eyes can see only the form, the color, but they
cannot see the formless and the colorless. For the formless and
colorless they are blind. In samadhi you close these eyes and a new
perceptivity, which can be metaphorically called ‘the third eye’, arises
in you; a new sensitivity which can feel and see what is not possible
for your outer senses.</p><p><br></p><p>The dharma-eye, which is the third eye of your interior spirit, is
capable of perceiving the Tao. When I say to you in meditations, “Go
deeper, look deeper,” I am trying in every way so that your third eye,
which has remained dormant, opens up.</p><p><br></p><p>Ma Tzu still asked, “IS THERE STILL MAKING AND UNMAKING?”</p><p><br></p><p>Can we do something inside? Can we make a buddha inside? Is there
still some creativity inside? It is a very profound question.</p><p><br></p><p>TO THIS, THE MASTER REPLIED, “IF ONE SEES THE TAO FROM THE STANDPOINT
OF MAKING AND UNMAKING, OR GATHERING AND SCATTERING, ONE DOES NOT REALLY
SEE THE TAO. LISTEN TO MY GATHA.”</p><p><br></p><p>He says that as far as your inner world is concerned your buddha is
already there; you don’t have to make it. Everything is as it should be
in your inner world.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of the Russian scientist, Kirlian, who brought a new
vision to the objective scientist; its implications are immense. He was
a great photographer and he went on perfecting and refining his lenses.
His whole idea was that if something is hidden in a seed as a potential,
then perhaps the photograph of the potential can be caught with a better
lens.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very strange idea, but scientists and mystics and
philosophers and poets are all a little bit crazy. Everybody tried to
persuade him: “Don’t do such nonsense, how can you see the rose in the
seed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “If it is going to be, then it must be present in some way –
perhaps our eyes are not capable of seeing it.” And finally he
succeeded. He managed to create lenses which could take a photograph of
what was going to happen in the future. He would put the seed in front
of his camera and a photograph would come of a rose flower.</p><p><br></p><p>And then he would wait for the seed to die into the soil – and it was
one of the miracles of modern genius, that when the real rose came, it
would be exactly the same as the photograph. He has caught the future in
his net.</p><p><br></p><p>He became convinced that if it is true about the seed then it can be
used in many things. For example, Kirlian photography has now become an
absolute must in Russian hospitals. People come just to be checked, to
see if there is any possibility of disease in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>His lenses have become even more refined now after his death; a whole
school of Kirlian photographers has been working on it. They can see at
least six months ahead. If you are going to be sick in six months’ time,
the photograph will show it – that after six months you will have
cancer.</p><p>There is no other way to find it out, but it can be treated although
it has not become manifest. It is a tremendous blessing to medicine. We
can cure people before they become sick.</p><p><br></p><p>What we see with our eyes is not all. Even in the outside world our
eyes have limitations. Kirlian photography has gone beyond our eyes into
the objective world. In the same way the third eye opens in the inner
world and brings you your whole potentiality in its fullness. You don’t
have to do anything, you have just to recognize it. A buddha is not
made, a buddha is only remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>Nangaku said, “LISTEN TO MY GATHA.” That is an ancient way; ‘gatha’
means poetry. “What I could manage to say in prose, I have said. Now
listen to my poetry. Something that I have not been able to say in prose
can be said in poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>“THE GROUND OF THE NO-MIND CONTAINS MANY SEEDS</p><p>WHICH WILL ALL SPROUT WHEN HEAVENLY SHOWERS COME.”</p><p>They have come and now it is up to you to take the challenge. “THE
FLOWER OF SAMADHI</p><p>IS BEYOND COLOR AND FORM. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY MORE MUTABILITY?”</p><p>IT IS SAID THAT AT THIS, MA TZU WAS TRULY ENLIGHTENED, HIS MIND
HAVING TRANSCENDED THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA. HE ATTENDED UPON HIS MASTER
FOR A FULL TEN YEARS. DURING THIS PERIOD, HE DELVED DEEPER AND DEEPER
INTO MEDITATION.</p><p><br></p><p>Kanzan wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>IN MY HOUSE THERE IS A CAVE,</p><p><br></p><p>AND IN THE CAVE IS NOTHING AT ALL – PURE AND WONDERFULLY EMPTY,
RESPLENDENT, WITH A LIGHT</p><p>LIKE THE SUN.</p><p><br></p><p>A MEAL OF GREENS WILL DO</p><p>FOR THIS OLD BODY,</p><p><br></p><p>A RAGGED COAT WILL COVER THIS PHANTOM FORM.</p><p>LET A THOUSAND SAINTS APPEAR BEFORE ME – I HAVE THE BUDDHA OF
HEAVENLY TRUTH!</p><p>Once you have looked into your inner cave and found the light, the
life, the very source of your being, then the so-called saints don’t
mean anything. They are just moralists, following a certain system of
morality, beliefs, but they don’t have the truth. If you have the truth
then even a thousand saints cannot weigh more than your buddha. Your
buddha is the ultimate and it is not borrowed. You have discovered
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE THE EXPRESSION, “TAKE ONE STEP TOWARDS ALLAH, AND HE WILL COME
RUNNING A THOUSAND STEPS TOWARDS YOU.”</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT RECEPTIVITY IS NOT A TOTALLY INACTIVE
WAITING BUT REQUIRES A CERTAIN PARTICIPATION.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN TO RECEIVE A FLOWER, DOESN’T ONE NEED TO HOLD OUT ONE’S HAND? OR
AM I ON THE WRONG TRACK AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Maneesha, you are on a wrong track again. That saying comes from
Mohammedanism, “Take one step towards Allah, and he will come running a
thousand steps toward you.”</p><p><br></p><p>But in the world of Zen there is no Allah, and as far as your inside
is concerned, just take one step and you are the Allah. Nobody comes
running. On the contrary, you come to a standstill. Just one step,
inside – that Mohammedan saying is still about the outside God – you
take one step and God will come running towards you. But that kind of
God does not exist, so don’t unnecessarily waste your step! Save it, you
will need it to go in. And the moment you go one step in, you are the
Allah. In the world of Zen that kind of statement is not applicable at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the clouds have come, really with tremendous urgency! This year
Poona is going to be flooded even without the Shankaracharya committing
suicide. Just the laughter of ten thousand buddhas is enough to call all
the clouds of the world. They don’t need any passport, any visa. They
don’t have to pass any customs office. They are the free buddhas moving
in the sky, and when they see ten</p><p>thousand buddhas gathered, naturally they come running – particularly
at the time when I am going to tell you the jokes.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is Sardar Gurudayal Singh? Just laugh loudly. This book is
going to be dedicated to Sardar Gurudayal Singh, the only man in history
who laughs before the joke is told. What a trust! You should learn trust
from Sardar Gurudayal Singh.</p><p><br></p><p>Maggie MacTavish dies and leaves old Hamish a widower. It is such a
relief for him that he rushes excitedly round to see Mr. Tomb, the
undertaker.</p><p><br></p><p>“How much to bury my wife?” asks Hamish.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five hundred pounds,” replies Tomb, rubbing his hands together.</p><p><br></p><p>“Five hundred?” splutters Hamish, clutching his purse. “Can’t you do
it for less?” “Well,” replies Mr Tomb, “the cheapest I can manage is
three hundred pounds.”</p><p>“My God!” wails Hamish, counting out his money, “I almost wish she
was still alive!”</p><p><br></p><p>Magic Mushroom Melvin, the old hippy, is busy making lunch for his
old buddy, Buffalo Grass.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow, man!” says Melvin, stepping back from the sink and sitting down
to smoke a few reefers. “That’s the wildest recipe I have ever
tried.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Groovy, man!” says Buffalo Grass, in a cloud of smoke. “What is it?”
“It is salad, man!” says Melvin.</p><p>“Hey, cool, man – salad!” agrees Buffalo Grass. “How do you make
it?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it’s really easy, man!” says Melvin, “you cut up lettuce,
tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots; then you throw in some LSD, stand
back, and watch the salad toss itself!”</p><p><br></p><p>Dilly and Dally are identical twin brothers, who live in a small town
near the sea. Dilly is married and Dally is single, but he keeps a small
rowing boat.</p><p>One day Dilly’s wife dies, and a few days later, Dally’s rowing boat
sinks.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking in the street a week later, Dally meets Mrs. Godball, the
bishop’s wife. Mrs. Godball mistakes Dally, the boatman, for Dilly, who
has just lost his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sorry to hear about your terrible loss!” says Mrs. Godball.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, thank you very much!” replies Dally, the boatman, “but I am not
sorry at all. She was a rotten old thing from the start. She had a huge
crack in the front of her and a big hole behind, which kept</p><p>getting bigger every time I used her. She stank of old fish and used
to leak water all the time. Her bottom was really badly scratched up,
and whenever there was wind, it was not safe to go near her.</p><p><br></p><p>“Last week, three men came around looking for some fun, so I hired
her out to them. I told them to take it easy with her, but the three
idiots all tried to get into her at the same time. Of course, she split
from back to front. Now she is gone, and I am very happy about it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Godball faints. Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano...
(Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent.</p><p><br></p><p>Close your eyes,</p><p><br></p><p>and feel your body to be completely frozen. Look inwards with
absolute urgency.</p><p>Deeper and deeper,</p><p><br></p><p>until you reach the source of your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very close – just one step and you are the buddha.</p><p>Such a beautiful evening,</p><p><br></p><p>and the dancing rains rejoicing in your silence, rejoicing in your
samadhi.</p><p>These cloud buddhas have come from so far away, don’t let them
down.</p><p>Deeper and deeper,</p><p><br></p><p>there is no need to fear.</p><p>It is your own space and it is your own birthright to be a
buddha.</p><p>To make it absolutely clear</p><p><br></p><p>that you are not the body, nor the mind, but just a witness,</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, and just be a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>This witnessing is another name of the buddha. Witnessing makes you
an empty mirror, reflecting everything without getting identified. And
this is the miracle of meditation;</p><p>it gives you freedom, it gives you the beyond. Gather the experience,
the fragrance,</p><p>because the time is close that you will be called back. Taste the
nectar,</p><p>the eternally running stream of your life, let it sink deep in your
every fiber,</p><p>because it is going to be a twenty-four hour lifestyle. Living or
dead, you have to remain as a buddha.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but come back as a buddha with a samadhi,</p><p>with a feel of the nectar.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit down for a few moments, just to recollect the experience of where
you have been,</p><p>what you have been.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day it has to become deeper and deeper. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the buddhas?

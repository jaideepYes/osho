OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND \"HH\".\n20. CENTER ON THE SOUND \"AUM\" WITHOUT ANY \"A\" OR \"M\".\nTantra divides life into two dimensions: one is the SANSAR -- that which is, the world; and the other is MOKSHA -- that which can be, the ultimate, the hidden which can become manifest. But there is no contradiction between these two. The hidden is just here and now, in the world -- of course, unknown to you, but not non-existent. It is there. The ultimate and the immediate are not two things, but just two dimensions of one existence. So for tantra there is no contradiction, there is no duality. The one appears as two because of our limitations; because we cannot see the whole. The moment we can see the whole, one appears as one. The division is not in reality, but in our limited knowledge. That which we know is SANSAR -- the world; and that which is unknown but which can be known is MOKSHA -- the transcendental, the ultimate, the absolute.\nFor other traditions, there is a conflict between the two; for tantra there is no conflict. This has to be understood very deeply in the mind and in the heart. Unless this is understood deeply, you will never be able to understand the viewpoint of tantra.\nAnd whatsoever is your belief, that belief is of duality. Whether you are a Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu or a Jain, your belief is of duality, of conflict. The world appears to be something which is against the divine, and you have to fight the world to reach the divine. This is the common belief of all so-called religions, particularly organized religions.\nMind can understand duality very easily. Rather, it can understand only duality because the very function of the mind is to divide. The very function of the mind is to cut the whole into fragments.\nThe mind works like a prism, and when a ray of light enters the prism it is divided into seven colors. Mind is a prism and reality is divided through it. That is why mind revels in analysis. It goes on dividing things into fragments, and it cannot prevent itself unless there is nothing to be divided anymore. So mind has a tendency to reach to the atomic, the lowest division. It goes on dividing, dividing, until a moment comes when no division is possible. If division is still possible, it will divide still further.\nMind goes to the fragment, to the minutest fragment, and reality is a whole, not the fragment. So a completely reverse process is needed to know the real: a process which is of synthesis, not of analysis; a process which crystallizes, not one which divides. A no- mind process is needed.\nTantra denies divisions and tantra says that the whole is whole. The part that we know is the world, the part that is hidden is the divine, or God, or whatsoever you name it -- but the hidden is just here and now. You are not aware of it, but it is here and now. It is already. For you it will be in the future, but in the existence it is here and now. You may have to travel to it; you may have to attain a no-mind attitude of looking at things -- then\nit will be revealed. You are just standing and the morning sun is rising, but you are standing with closed eyes. The morning is here and now, but for you it is not here and now. When you will open your eyes, only then will it become a fact for you.\nIn the existence the morning exists, but not for you. You are closed to it, it is hidden for you. For you there is only darkness and the light is hidden. But if you open your eyes, any moment the morning will become a fact to you. It was already a fact, only you were blind.\nTantra says that the world is already the divine, but you are blind. So whatsoever you know in your blindness is to be called the world, and whatsoever is hidden because of your blindness is the divine. This is one of the basic tenets -- that this sansar is the moksha, this very world is divine, this very world is the ultimate. The immediate and the ultimate are not two, but one. The here and there are not two, but one.\nBecause of this insistence, many things become possible for tantra. One: tantra can accept everything, and the deep acceptance relaxes you completely. Nothing else can relax you.\nIf there is no division between this world and that, if the transcendental is imminent here and now, if matter is just the body of the divine, then nothing is denied, nothing is condemned and you need not be tense. Even if it may take ages for you to come to realize the divine, there is no hurry for tantra. It is already there, and time is not lacking. It is eternally here; whenever you will open your eyes you will find it. And whatsoever you are already getting is the hidden divine.\nSo the Christian attitude of condemnation, of sin, or other such religious attitudes, is totally a lie to tantra -- and absurd, because if you condemn something you also become divided inwardly. You cannot divide things only outwardly. If you divide, you also will be divided in parallel. If you say that this world is wrong, then your body will become wrong because your body is part of this world.\nIf you say that this world is something which is a hindrance to reaching the ultimate, then your whole life will be condemned and you will feel guilty. Then you cannot enjoy, then you cannot live, then you cannot laugh. Then seriousness will become your face. You can be only serious; you cannot be non-serious, you cannot be playful.\nThat has happened to all the minds all over the world. They become dead, serious. Through seriousness they become dead because they cannot accept life as it is. They deny it, and they feel that unless they deny they cannot reach the other world.\nSo the other world becomes the ideal, the future, the desire, the vision, and this world becomes a sin. Then one feels guilty with it. And any religion that makes you guilty, makes you neurotic. It drives you crazy! In this sense, tantra is the only healthy religion. And whenever any religion becomes healthy, it becomes tantra -- it becomes tantric. So every religion has two aspects. One is the outer aspect: the church, the organization, the publicized, the public face, the exoteric. This aspect is always life-denying. The other aspect is the inner core. Every religion has that too: the esoteric. It is always tantric -- totally accepting.\nUnless you accept the world totally, you cannot be at ease within. Non-acceptance creates a tension. Once you accept everything as it is, you are at home in the world. Tantra says this is a basic thing: you must be at home. Only then does something more become possible. If you are tense, divided, in conflict, in anguish, in guilt, how can you\ntranscend? You are so much mad inside, you cannot travel further. You are so much engaged here, so much possessed by the here, you cannot go beyond.\nThis seems paradoxical. Those who are too much against the world are too much in it; they have to be. You cannot go away from your enemy, you are possessed by the enemy. If the world is your enemy, no matter what you do or pretend to do you will remain worldly. You may even renounce it, but your very approach will be worldly.\nI have seen one saint, a very renowned one... He will not touch money, and if you put some coins before him, he will close his eyes. This is neurotic, this man is ill! What is he doing? But people worship him because of this. They think he is so otherworldly. He is not, he is too much in the world. Even you are not so much in the world. What is he doing? He has just reversed the process; now he is standing on his head. He is the same man -- the same man who was greedy for money. Constantly he must have been thinking of money, accumulating possessions. Now he has become quite the opposite, but he remains the same within. Now he is against money, now he cannot touch it.\nWhy this fear? Why this hatred? Remember, whenever there is hatred it is love in reverse. You can hate a thing only if you have been in love with it. Hate is always possible only through love. You can be against something only if you have been so much for it, but the basic attitude remains the same: this man is greedy.\nI asked this man, \"Why are you so much afraid?\"\nHe said, \"Money is the hindrance. Unless I use will against my greed toward money, I cannot reach the divine.\"\nSo now it is only a new sort of greed. He is in a bargain: if he touches money he loses the divine. And he wants to get the divine, he wants to possess the divine, so he is against the money.\nTantra says, do not be for the world, do not be against the world, just accept it as it is. Do not create any problem out of it. How is this going to help you? If you do not create any problem out of it, if you do not grow neurotic over it -- this way or that -- if you remain simply in it and accept it as it is, your whole energy is relieved from it and can move to the hidden realm, to the hidden dimension.\nAcceptance in this world becomes transcendence for that. Total acceptance here will lead you, will transform you to the other dimension, the hidden dimension, because all your energy is relieved; it is not engaged here. Tantra believes deeply in the concept of NIYATI -- fate. Tantra says, take this world as your fate and do not be worried about it. Once you take it as your niyati, as your fate, you accept it, whatsoever it is. You are not worried about changing it, about making it different, about making it according to your desire. Once you accept it as it is and you are not bothered by it, your total energy is relieved, and then this energy can penetrate inwards.\nThese techniques can be helpful only if you take this attitude; otherwise they will not be helpful.\nAnd they look so simple. If you start them directly as you are, they will seem simple, but you will not succeed in them. The basic framework is lacking. Acceptance is the basic framework. Once the acceptance is there in the background, these very simple methods will work wonders.\nThe sixth method concerning sound:\nINTONE A SOUND AUDIBLY, THEN LESS AND LESS AUDIBLY AS FEELING DEEPENS INTO THIS SILENT HARMONY.\nAny sound will do, but if you love a certain sound it will be better, because if you love a certain sound then the sound is not just sound. When you intone the sound, then you are also intoning a hidden feeling with it, and by and by the sound will be dropped and only feeling will remain.\nThe sound has to be used as a passage toward feeling. Sound is mind and feeling is heart. Mind has to use a passage toward the heart. It is difficult to enter the heart directly.\nBecause we have been missing it so much and for so many lives, we do not know from where to move to the heart. How to enter it? The door seems closed.\nWe go on talking about the heart, but that talk also is just in the mind. We say that we love through the heart, but this too is cerebral; in the head. Even the talk of the heart is in the head. And we do not know where the heart is. I do not mean the physical part of it, we know about that. But then physicians will say, medical science will say, that there is no possibility of love in it.\nIt is just a pumping system. Nothing else is in it, and all else is just myth and poetry and dreaming.\nBut tantra knows a deep center hidden behind your physical heart. That deep center can only be reached through the mind because we are standing in the mind. We are there in the head, and any travel inwards has to begin from there. Mind is sound. If all sound stops, you won't have any mind. In silence there is no mind -- that is why there is so much insistence on silence. Silence is a no-mind state.\nOrdinarily we say, \"My mind is silent.\" This is absurd, meaningless, because mind means absence of silence. So you cannot say that the mind is silent. If mind is, there cannot be any silence, and when silence is, there is no mind. So there is no such thing as a silent mind; there cannot be. It is just like saying that someone is alive-dead. It makes no sense. If he is dead, then he is not alive. If he is alive, then he is not dead. You cannot be alive- dead.\nSo there is nothing like a silent mind. When silence comes, mind is not there. Really, mind goes out and silence comes in; silence comes in and mind goes out. Both cannot be there. Mind is sound. If the sound is systematic you are sane, if the sound has gone chaotic you are insane; but in both the cases sound is there, and we exist at the point of the mind.\nSo how to drop from that point to the inner point of the heart? Use sound, intone sound.\nOne sound will be helpful. If there are many sounds in the mind, it is difficult to leave them. If there is only one sound, it can be left easily. So first many sounds are to be sacrificed for one sound. That is the use of concentration.\nIntone one sound. Go on intoning it, first audibly so that you can hear it, and then by and by, slowly, inaudibly. No one else can hear it then, but you can hear it inside. Make it more quiet, make it less and less audible, and then suddenly drop it. There will be silence, an explosion of silence -- but feeling will be there. Now there will be no thought, but feeling will be there.\nThat is why it is good to use a sound, a name, a mantra, for which you have some feeling. If a Hindu uses \"Ram,\" he has some feeling for it. It is not simply a word for him, it is not only in his head. The vibrations reach to his heart also. He may not be aware, but it is deep-rooted in his bones, in his very blood. There has been a long tradition, a long\nconditioning, for many lives. If you have been attached to one sound continuously, it is very deep-rooted. Use it. It can be used.\nA Christian can use \"Ram,\" but it will remain in the mind, it will not go deep. It is better that he uses \"Jesus\" or \"Maria\" or something else. It is very easy to be influenced by a new idea, but it is difficult to use it. You do not have any feeling for it. Even if you are convinced in the mind that this will be better, this conviction is on the surface.\nOne of my friends was living in Germany. He was there for thirty years and he completely forgot his mother tongue -- he was a Maharashtrian and his mother tongue was Marathi. But he had forgotten it, for thirty years he was using German. German became just like his mother tongue. I say just like because no other tongue can become your mother tongue. There is no possibility because the mother tongue remains deep down inside of you. He consciously forgot it, and he was not able to speak or understand it.\nThen he fell ill, and he was so ill that his whole family had to go there to see him. He was unconscious, but sometimes consciousness would come. Whenever he would become conscious he would speak German and whenever he would become unconscious he would mutter in Marathi. Consciously he couldn't understand anything of Marathi; unconsciously he couldn't understand anything of German.\nDeep in the unconscious Marathi remained; it was the mother tongue. And you cannot replace the mother tongue. You can put other things over and above it, you can overimpose other things, but you cannot replace it. Deep down, it will remain.\nSo if you have a feeling for a certain sound, it is better to use it. Do not use an intellectual sound, it will be of no help because the sound has to be used to make a passage from the mind to the heart. So use some sound for which you have a deep love, a certain feeling.\nIf a Mohammedan uses \"Ram,\" it is very difficult, the word means nothing to him. That is why the two oldest religions never believe in conversion -- Hinduism and Judaism.\nThey are the two oldest religions, the two original religions, all other religions are just offshoots of these two. Christianity and Islam are offshoots of the Jewish tradition; Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism are offshoots of Hinduism. These two original religions never believed in conversion, and the reason was this: that you can convert a man intellectually, but you cannot convert a man from his heart. You can convert a Hindu into a Christian, you can convert a Christian into a Hindu, but the conversion will remain of the mind.\nDeep down a converted Hindu remains a Hindu. He may go to a church and he may pray to Mary or to Jesus, but his prayer remains of the head. You cannot change the unconscious. And if you hypnotize him, you will find he is a Hindu. If you hypnotize him and let him reveal his unconscious, you will find he is a Hindu.\nHindus and Jews never believed in conversion because of this basic fact. You cannot change a man's religion because you cannot change his heart and unconscious feelings. And if you try, then you disturb him, because you give him something which will remain on the surface and you divide him. Then he becomes a split personality. Deep down he is a Hindu; on the surface he is a Christian.\nHe will use Christian sounds, mantras, which will not go deep, and he cannot use Hindu\nsounds which can go deep. You have disturbed his life.\nSo find a certain sound for which you have some feeling. Even your own name may be helpful. If you do not have any feeling for anything else, then your own name will be helpful. There are many cases on record... One very famous mystic, Bukkh, used his own name, because he said, \"I do not believe in any God. I do not know about him, I do not know what his name is. There are names I have heard, but there is no proof that they are his name. And I am in search of myself, so why not use my own name?\" So he would use his own name, and just by using his own name he would drop down into silence.\nIf you do not have any love for anything else, use your own name. But it is very difficult because you are so condemning toward yourself that you do not have any feeling, you do not have any respect toward yourself. Others may be respectful toward you, but you are not respectful toward yourself.\nSo the first thing is to find any sound that will be helpful: for example, your lover's name, your beloved's name. If you love a flower, then \"rose\" will do, anything -- any sound that you feel good using, uttering, listening to, from which you feel a certain well -- being coming to you. If you cannot find one, then there are some suggestions from traditional sources.\n\"Aum\" can be used, \"Amen\" can be used, \"Maria\" can be used, \"Ram\" can be used, or Buddha's name, or Mahavir's name, or any name that you have a love for. But a feeling must be there. That is why the Master's name can be helpful, if you have the feeling. But feeling is essential!\nINTONE A SOUND AUDIBLY, THEN LESS AND LESS AUDIBLY AS FEELING\nDEEPENS INTO THIS SILENT HARMONY. And go on reducing the sound. Intone it more slowly, more inaudibly so that even you have to make an effort to hear it inside. Go on dropping, go on dropping, and you will feel the change. The more sound will drop, the more you will be filled with feeling. When sound disappears, only feeling remains. This feeling cannot be named. It is a love, a deep love, but not toward anyone -- this is the difference.\nWhen you use a sound or a word, the love is attached to a label. You say, \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\" You have a deep feeling for this word, but the feeling is addressed to \"Ram,\" narrowed down to \"Ram.\" When you go on reducing the \"Ram,\" a moment will come when \"Ram\" disappears, the sound disappears. Now only the feeling remains, the feeling of love -- not toward Ram, it is now not addressed. There is simply a feeling of love -- not toward anyone, not even toward; there is simply a feeling of love, as if you are in an ocean of love.\nWhen it is not addressed, then it is of the heart. When it is addressed, it is of the head.\nLove toward someone is through the head; simple love is of the heart. And when love is simple, unaddressed, it becomes prayer. If it is addressed, it is not yet prayer; you are just on the way. That is why I say if you are a Christian you cannot start as a Hindu, you should start as a Christian. If you are a Mohammedan you cannot start as a Christian, you should start as a Mohammedan. But the deeper you go, the less you will be a Mohammedan or a Christian or a Hindu.\nOnly the start will be Hindu, Mohammedan or Christian. The more you will proceed toward the heart, as the sound will be less and less and feeling more and more, you will be less a Hindu, less a Mohammedan. When the sound disappears, you will simply be a human being -- not Hindu, not Mohammedan, not Christian.\nIt is like the difference between 'sects' and 'religion'. Religion is one, sects are many. Sects help you to begin. If you think that they are the end, then you are finished. They are just the beginning. You have to leave them and go beyond, because the beginning is not the end. In the end there is religion; in the beginning there is just a sect. Use the sect to go toward religion; use the limited to go toward the unlimited; use the finite to go toward the infinite.\nAny sound will do. Find your own sound. And when you intone it, you will feel whether you have a loving relationship with it, because the heart will start vibrating.\nYour whole body will begin to be more sensitive. You will feel as if you are falling into something warm, just like your beloved's lap; something warm begins enveloping you. And this is a physical feeling also, not simply a mental feeling. If you intone a sound which you love, you will feel a certain warmth around you, inside you. Then the world is not a cold world, it is warm.\nIf you have gone to a Hindu temple, then you must have heard of the GARBHAGRIHA\n-- the womb house. The innermost center of the temple is known as GARBHA -- the womb. You might not have observed why it is called the womb. If you intone the sound of the temple -- and every temple has its own sound, its own mantra, its own ISHTA DEVATA, its own deity, and the related mantra of the deity -- if you intone that sound, the same warmth as there is in the womb of the mother is created. That is why the garbha, the womb of the temple, is made just similar to the womb of the mother: round-shaped, almost closed, with only one opening.\nWhen Christians came for the first time to India and discovered Hindu temples, they felt that these temples were really unhygienic -- not ventilated at all, with only one little door. But the womb is with only one door and not ventilated at all. That is why the temple was made only with one door, just like a womb, and if you intone that sound, that womb becomes alive.\nAnd also it is called the garbha because you can get a new birth there, you can become a new man.\nIf you intone a sound that you love, that you have feeling for, you will create a sound- womb around you. So it is good not to practice this method under the open sky. You are very weak, you cannot fill the whole sky with your sound. It is better to choose a small room, and if the room is such that it vibrates your sound it is good, it will help you. And if you can choose the same place every day, it will be very good. It becomes charged. If the same sound is repeated every day, every atom, the very space becomes a milieu.\nThat is why followers of other religions are not allowed in the temples. In Mecca, no one can enter if he is not a Mohammedan, and this is good. Nothing is wrong in it, it is because Mecca belongs to a particular science. One who is not a Mohammedan goes there with a sound which will be disturbing to the whole milieu. If a Mohammedan is not allowed into a Hindu temple, there is no insult in it. And all those social reformers who do not know anything about temples, religion and esoteric science, they go on giving slogans, nonsense slogans, and they are disturbing everything.\nA Hindu temple is for Hindus because a Hindu temple is a particular place -- a created place. For millennia they have been working on it to make it alive, and anyone can disturb it.\nThat disturbance is very dangerous. A temple is not a public place. It is for a particular\npurpose and for particular people; it is not for visitors. That is why visitors were not allowed in the old days. Now they are allowed because we do not know what we are doing. A visitor should not be allowed. It is not a place to see, to go to for sightseeing. It is a created space filled with particular vibrations.\nIf it is a Ram temple and you were born in a family where Ram's name has been sacred, loved, then when you enter an alive space which is always filled with Ram's name, even if you do not want to chant, even if you are not using the Ram mantra, you will start chanting. The space all around will press you. Those vibrations all around will hit you, and you will start chanting from deep down. So use a place -- a temple is good.\nThese methods are temple methods. A temple is good, or a mosque or a church. Your own house is not good for these methods, because with so many sounds you have a chaotic space around you and you are not so strong that just by your sound you can change the space. So it is better to go to a certain place which belongs to a certain sound, and then use it. And it is good to go to the same place every day.\nBy and by you will become powerful. By and by you will drop down from the mind to the heart. Then you can do this method anywhere and the whole cosmos becomes your temple.\nThen there is no problem. But in the beginning it is good to choose the place, and if you can even choose the time, exactly the same time every day, it is good because then the temple waits for you. Right at that exact time, the temple waits for you. It is more receptive; it is happy that you have come. And I mean physically; this is not a symbolic thing, but a physical one.\nIt is just as if you take your meals every day at a particular time. At that particular time your whole body feels the hunger. The body has its own inner clock, it feels the hunger exactly at that time. If you go to sleep every day at a particular time, your whole body gets ready at that particular period. If you change every day your sleeping time and your food time, you are disturbing your body.\nNow they say your age will be affected by it. If you go on daily changing your body routine, then if you were going to be alive for eighty years you will be alive only for seventy years. Ten years will be lost. And if you go regularly with the body clock, then if you were going to live for eighty years you will live for ninety very easily. Ten years can be added.\nExactly like this, everything all around you has its own clock, and the world moves in cosmic time. If you enter the temple at exactly the same time every day, the temple is ready for you and you are ready for the temple. These two readinesses meet, and the results are magnified a thousandfold.\nOr you can create a small corner in your house. But then do not use that corner for any other purpose, because every purpose has its own vibrations. If you use that corner for a business purpose or you play cards there, that space becomes confused. And now these confusions can even be recorded on mechanical devices; it can be known if the space is confused.\nIf you can create a corner in your house, a small temple, it is very good. If you can afford a small temple, that is the first thing to be tried. But do not use it for any other purpose. Let it be absolutely private for you, and results will come very soon then.\nThe seventh sound technique:\nWITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN, KEEP MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TONGUE. OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND \"HH.\"\nMind can be focused anywhere in the body. Ordinarily, we have focused it in the head, but it can be focused anywhere. And with a change of the focus, your qualities change. For example, in many Eastern countries -- Japan, China, Korea -- traditionally it has been taught that mind is in the belly, not in the head. And because of this, those who thought that mind is in the belly had different qualities of mind. You cannot have those qualities because you think mind is in the head.\nReally, the mind is nowhere. The brain is in the head; the mind is not there.\n\"Mind\" means your focusing. You can focus it anywhere, and once focused it is very difficult to remove it from that point.\nFor example, now psychologists and workers who are doing in depth human research say that when you are making love your mind must move from the head to the genital area; otherwise your sex will be a frustration. If it remains in the head, you cannot go deep into sex. No orgasm will result, the experience will not be orgasmic. It will not give you a peak. You may produce children, but you will not have known what is the highest peak of love.\nYou have not known that about which tantra talks or Khajuraho depicts, you cannot. Have you seen Khajuraho? Or if you have not seen Khajuraho, you might have seen pictures of the Khajuraho temple. Then look at the faces, at couples making love. Look at the faces, the faces look divine. They are in the act of sex, but the faces are as ecstatic as any buddha's face. What is happening to them? This sex is not cerebral. They are not making love through the head; they are not thinking about it. They have dropped down from the head. Their focusing has changed.\nBecause of this dropping from the head, the consciousness has moved to the genital area. The mind is no more. The mind has become no-mind. Their faces have the same ecstasy as a buddha has. This sex has become a meditation. Why? Because the focus has changed.\nIf once you can change the focus of your mind, if you can remove it from the head, the head is relaxed, the face is relaxed. Then all tensions have dissolved. You are not there, the ego is not there.\nThat is why the more mind becomes intellectual, rational, the less capable it becomes of love, because love needs a different focusing. In love you need a focusing near the heart; in sex you need a focusing near the genital center. If you are doing mathematics, the head is okay. But love is not mathematics and sex is absolutely not. And if the mathematics continues in the head and you are making love, you are simply wasting energy. Then this whole effort will be disgusting.\nBut mind can be changed. Tantra says there are seven centers, and mind can be changed to any center. Each center has a different functioning. If you concentrate on a particular center, you become a different man.\nIn Japan there has been a military group, which is just like the KSHATRIYAS in India, known as the SAMURAI. They are trained to be soldiers, and their first training is to bring the mind down to just two inches below the navel. In Japan this center is called the HARA. The samurai are trained to bring the mind to the hara. Unless a soldier can bring his mind's focusing to the hara, he is not allowed to go to fight, and this is right. The\nsamurai are the greatest fighters the world has ever known, the greatest warriors; in the world there is no comparison with a samurai.\nHe is a different man, a different being, because his focusing is different.\nThey say that when you are fighting there is no time. Mind needs time to function; it calculates. If you are attacked and your mind thinks about how to protect, you have missed the point already, you have lost. There is no time. You must function timelessly and mind cannot function timelessly, mind needs time. Howsoever short, mind needs time.\nBelow the navel there is a center, the hara, which functions timelessly. If the focusing is at the hara and the fighter is fighting, then this fight is intuitive, not intellectual. Before you attack him, he knows. It is a subtle feeling in the hara, not in the head. It is not an inference, it is a psychic telepathy. Before you attack him, before you think of attacking him, the thought has reached him. His hara is hit and he is ready to protect himself. Even before you have attacked, he is in defense, he has protected himself.\nSometimes, if two persons are fighting and both are samurais, defeating the other is a problem. Neither can defeat the other; it is a problem. No one can be declared the winner. In a way it is impossible because you cannot attack the man -- before you attack, he knows.\nThere was one Indian mathematician... The whole world was wonderstruck because he would not calculate. Ramanujam was his name. You would give him the problem and he would give you the answer immediately.\nOne of England's best mathematicians, Hardy, visited Ramanujam. Hardy was one of the best mathematicians ever born, and he had to work with a particular problem for six hours. But Ramanujam was given the same problem and he answered immediately. There was no possibility for the mind to function in this way, as the mind needs time.\nRamanujam was asked again and again, \"How do you do it?\" He would say, \"I don't know. You give me the problem, and the answer comes to me. It comes from somewhere below. It is not from my head.\" It was coming from the hara. He was not aware, he was not trained, but this is my feeling: he must have been a Japanese in his previous birth because in India we have not worked much upon the hara.\nTantra says, focus your mind on different centers and the results will be different. This technique is concerned with focusing on the tongue, in the middle of the tongue. WITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN -- as if you are going to speak. Not closed, but slightly open as if you are going to speak; not like when you are speaking, but like when you are just going to speak.\nThen keep the mind in the middle of the tongue. You will have a very strange feeling, because the tongue has a center just in the middle which controls your thoughts. If you suddenly become aware and you focus on that, your thoughts will stop. Focus as if your whole mind has come to the tongue -- just in the middle.\nLet the mouth be slightly open as if you were going to speak, and then focus the mind as if it is not in the head. Feel it as if it is in the tongue, just in the middle.\nThe tongue has the center of speech, and thought is speech. What are you doing when you are thinking? Talking within. Can you think anything without talking within? You are alone; you are not talking to anyone, you are thinking. What are you doing while you are thinking? Talking within, talking to yourself. Your tongue is involved. Next time,\nwhile you are thinking, be aware: feel your tongue. It is vibrating as if you are talking to someone else. Then feel it again, and you can feel that the vibrations are centered in the middle. They arise from the middle and then they spread all over the tongue.\nThinking is talking within. If you can bring your total consciousness, your mind, to the center of the tongue, thinking stops. So those who have been practicing silence, they are simply practicing not talking. If you stop talking outwardly, then you will become very deeply aware of talking inside. And if you remain completely silent for one month or two months or one year, not talking, you will feel your tongue vibrating violently. You are not feeling it because you go on talking and the vibrations are released. But even now, if you stop and become conscious while thinking, you will feel your tongue vibrating a little.\nStop your tongue completely and then try to think -- you cannot think. Stop your tongue completely as if it is frozen; do not allow it to move. You cannot think then.\nThe center is just in the middle, so bring your mind there. WITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN, KEEP MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TONGUE. OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND \"HH.\"\nThis is the second technique. It is just similar: OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND \"HH.\"\nWith the first technique your thinking will stop, you will feel a solidity within -- as if you have become solid. When thoughts are not there you become immovable; thoughts are the inner movement. And when thoughts are not there and you have become immovable, you have become part of the eternal, which only appears to move but which is immovable, which remains unmoved.\nIn thoughtlessness you become part of the eternal, the unmoved. With thought you are part of the movement, because nature is movement. The world is movement, that is why we have called it the SANSAR, the wheel -- it is moving and moving and moving. The world is movement and the hidden, the ultimate, is unmoved, unmoving, immovable.\nIt is just like a wheel that is moving, but a wheel is moving on something which never moves. A wheel can move only because in the center there is something which never moves, which remains unmoved.\nThe world moves and the transcendental remains unmoved. If your thoughts stop, suddenly you drop from this world to the other. With the movement stopped inside, you become part of the eternal -- that which never changes.\nOR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND \"HH.\" Open your\nmouth slightly, as if you are going to speak. Then inhale, and be aware of the sound which is created by inhaling. It is just \"HH\" -- whether you are exhaling or inhaling. You are not to make the sound, you are just to feel the incoming breath on your tongue. It is very silent. You will feel \"HH.\" It will be very silent, very slightly audible. You have to be very alert to be aware of it. But do not try to create it. If you create it, you have missed the point. Your created sound will be of no help, it is the natural sound that happens when you inhale or exhale.\nBut the technique says while inhaling, not exhaling -- because while exhaling you will go out, and with the sound YOU will go out, while the effort is to go in. So while inhaling, hear the sound \"HH.\" Go on inhaling and go on feeling the sound \"HH.\" Sooner or later you will feel that the sound is not being created only at the tongue, it is being created in the throat also. But then it is very, very inaudible. With very deep alertness you can\nbecome aware of it.\nStart from the tongue, then by and by be alert; go on feeling it.\nYou will hear it in the throat, then you will start hearing it in the heart. And when it reaches the heart, you have gone beyond mind. All these techniques are just to give you a bridge from where you can move from thought to no-thought, from mind to no-mind, from the surface to the center.\nThe eighth sound technique:\nCENTER ON THE SOUND \"AUM\" WITHOUT ANY \"A\" OR \"M\".\nCENTER ON THE SOUND \"AUM\" -- A-U-M, AUM -- WITHOUT ANY \"A\" OR \"M\".\nJust the \"U\" remains. This is a difficult technique, but for some it may be suitable, particularly for those who work with sound: musicians, poets, those who have a very sensitive ear, for them this technique can be helpful. For others, those who have no sensitive ear, this is very difficult because it is very delicate.\nYou have to intone Aum, and you have to feel in this Aum three sounds separately: A-U-\nM. Intone Aum, and in the sound you have to feel three sounds -- A-U-M. They are there, infused together. A very delicate ear can be aware, can hear A-U-M separately while intoning. They are separate -- very close, but separate. If you cannot hear them separately, then this technique cannot be done. Your ears will have to be trained for it.\nIn Japan, particularly in Zen, they train the ears first. They have a method of training the ears. The wind is blowing outside -- it has a sound. The master will say, \"Concentrate on it. Feel all the nuances, the changes: when the sound is angry, when the sound is furious, when the sound is compassionate, when the sound is loving, when the sound is strong, when the sound is delicate. Feel the nuances of the sound. The wind is blowing through the trees -- feel it. The river is running -- feel the nuances.\"\nFor months together the seeker, the meditator, will be sitting by the side of the bank of the river, listening to it. It has different sounds. Everything is changing. In the rain it will be flooded; it will be very much alive, overflowing. The sounds will be different. In the summer it will be reduced to nothingness, sounds will cease. But there will be inaudible sounds if one is listening, if you listen. All the year round the river will be changing, and one has to be aware.\nIn Hermann Hesse's book SIDDHARTHA, Siddhartha lives with a boatman. And there is no one, just the river, the boatman and Siddhartha. And the boatman is a very silent man. He has lived all his life with the river. He has become silent, he rarely speaks. Whenever Siddhartha feels lonely, he tells Siddhartha to go to the river, to listen to the river. It is better than listening to human words.\nAnd then by and by, Siddhartha is attuned to the river. Then he begins to feel its moods -- the river changes moods. Sometimes it is friendly and sometimes it is not, and sometimes it is singing and sometimes it is weeping and crying, and sometimes there is laughter and sometimes there is sadness.\nAnd then he begins to feel the slight, delicate differences. His ear becomes attuned.\nSo in the beginning you may feel it to be difficult, but try. Intone Aum, go on intoning it, feeling A-U-M. Three sounds are combined together in it: Aum is a synthesis of three sounds. Once you start feeling them differently, then drop \"A\" and \"M\". Then you cannot say Aum: \"A\" will be dropped, \"M\" will be dropped. Then \"U\" will remain. Why? What will happen? The real thing is not the mantra. It is not A-U-M or the dropping. The real\nthing is your sensitivity.\nFirst you become sensitive of three sounds, which is very difficult. And when you become so sensitive that you can drop the \"A\" and \"M\" and only the middle sound remains, in this effort you will lose your mind. You will be so much engrossed in it, so deeply attentive to it, so sensitive to it, that you will forget to think. And if you think, you cannot do this.\nThis is just an indirect way to bring you out of your head. So many ways have been tried, and they look very simple. You wonder, \"What can happen? Nothing will happen by such simple methods.\" But miracles happen, because it is just indirect. Your mind is being focused on something very subtle. If you focus, you cannot go on thinking; mind will drop. Suddenly one day you will become aware, and you will wonder what has happened. In Zen they use koans.\nOne of the famous koans they tell to the beginner is, \"Go and try to hear the sound of one hand. You can create a sound with two hands. If one hand can create a sound, hear it.\" One small boy was serving a Zen master. He would see many people coming. They would come to the master, put their head at his feet, and then they would ask the master to tell them something to meditate on. He would give them a koan. The boy was just doing some work for the master, he was serving him. He was just nine or ten years of age.\nSeeing every day many people coming and going, one day he also came very seriously, put his head at the master's feet, and then asked him, \"Give me some koan, some object for meditation.\" The master laughed, but the boy was very serious, so the master said, \"Okay! Try to hear the sound of one hand. And when you have heard it, then come to me and tell me.\"\nThe boy tried and tried. He couldn't sleep the whole night. In the morning he came and he said, \"I have heard. It is the sound of the wind blowing through the trees.\" The master said, \"But where is the hand involved in it? Go again and try.\" So he would come every day. He would find some sound and then he would come, and the master would say, \"This is also not it. Go on trying, go on trying!\"\nThen one day the boy didn't come. The master waited and waited, and then he told his other disciples to go and find out what had happened -- it seemed the boy had heard.\nSo they went around. He was sitting under a tree, absorbed -- just a newborn buddha. They came back and they said, \"But we are afraid to disturb the boy. He is looking just like a newborn buddha. It seems he has heard the sound.\" So the master came, put his head at the boy's feet and asked him, \"Have you heard? It seems you have heard.\" The boy said, \"Yes, but it is soundlessness.\"\nHow did this boy develop? His sensitivity developed. He tried every sound, he listened attentively. Attention developed. He would not sleep. The whole night he would listen for what is the sound of one hand. He was not so intellectual as you are, so he never thought that there cannot be any sound of one hand. If the koan is given to you, you are not going to try. You will say, \"What nonsense! There cannot be any sound with one hand.\"\nBut the boy tried. The master had said there must be something in it, so he tried. He was a simple boy, so whenever he would hear something, whenever he would feel this was something new, he would come again. But by this process his sensitivity developed. He became attentive, alert, aware. He became one-pointed. He was in search, and the mind dropped because the master said, \"If you go on thinking you may miss. Sometimes there\nis the sound which is of one hand. Be so alert that you do not miss it.\"\nHe tried and tried. There is no sound of one hand, but that was just an indirect method to create sensitivity, awareness.\nAnd one day, suddenly, everything disappeared. He was so attentive that only attention was there, so sensitive that only sensitivity was there, so aware -- not aware of something, but simply aware! And then he said, \"I have heard it, but it is soundlessness. It is soundlessness!\" But you have to be trained to be attentive, to be alert.\nThis is just a method to make you very delicately aware of the subtle nuances of sound. Just doing this, you will forget Aum. Not only will \"A\" drop, not only will \"M\" drop, but one day suddenly you will also drop, and there will be soundlessness, and you will be a newborn buddha sitting under a tree.\nTHE END.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8647","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/part29/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/>Chapter 1.rtf</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 29- Sound methods for the dropping of the mind</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8647 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Book_of_Secrets/part29.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

DEEPENS INTO THIS SILENT HARMONY.</p><p>19. WITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN, KEEP MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TONGUE.
OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND "HH".</p><p>20. CENTER ON THE SOUND "AUM" WITHOUT ANY "A" OR "M".</p><p>Tantra divides life into two dimensions: one is the SANSAR -- that
which is, the world; and the other is MOKSHA -- that which can be, the
ultimate, the hidden which can become manifest. But there is no
contradiction between these two. The hidden is just here and now, in the
world -- of course, unknown to you, but not non-existent. It is there.
The ultimate and the immediate are not two things, but just two
dimensions of one existence. So for tantra there is no contradiction,
there is no duality. The one appears as two because of our limitations;
because we cannot see the whole. The moment we can see the whole, one
appears as one. The division is not in reality, but in our limited
knowledge. That which we know is SANSAR -- the world; and that which is
unknown but which can be known is MOKSHA -- the transcendental, the
ultimate, the absolute.</p><p>For other traditions, there is a conflict between the two; for tantra
there is no conflict. This has to be understood very deeply in the mind
and in the heart. Unless this is understood deeply, you will never be
able to understand the viewpoint of tantra.</p><p>And whatsoever is your belief, that belief is of duality. Whether you
are a Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu or a Jain, your belief is of
duality, of conflict. The world appears to be something which is against
the divine, and you have to fight the world to reach the divine. This is
the common belief of all so-called religions, particularly organized
religions.</p><p>Mind can understand duality very easily. Rather, it can understand
only duality because the very function of the mind is to divide. The
very function of the mind is to cut the whole into fragments.</p><p>The mind works like a prism, and when a ray of light enters the prism
it is divided into seven colors. Mind is a prism and reality is divided
through it. That is why mind revels in analysis. It goes on dividing
things into fragments, and it cannot prevent itself unless there is
nothing to be divided anymore. So mind has a tendency to reach to the
atomic, the lowest division. It goes on dividing, dividing, until a
moment comes when no division is possible. If division is still
possible, it will divide still further.</p><p>Mind goes to the fragment, to the minutest fragment, and reality is a
whole, not the fragment. So a completely reverse process is needed to
know the real: a process which is of synthesis, not of analysis; a
process which crystallizes, not one which divides. A no- mind process is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra denies divisions and tantra says that the whole is whole. The
part that we know is the world, the part that is hidden is the divine,
or God, or whatsoever you name it -- but the hidden is just here and
now. You are not aware of it, but it is here and now. It is already. For
you it will be in the future, but in the existence it is here and now.
You may have to travel to it; you may have to attain a no-mind attitude
of looking at things -- then</p><p>it will be revealed. You are just standing and the morning sun is
rising, but you are standing with closed eyes. The morning is here and
now, but for you it is not here and now. When you will open your eyes,
only then will it become a fact for you.</p><p>In the existence the morning exists, but not for you. You are closed
to it, it is hidden for you. For you there is only darkness and the
light is hidden. But if you open your eyes, any moment the morning will
become a fact to you. It was already a fact, only you were blind.</p><p>Tantra says that the world is already the divine, but you are blind.
So whatsoever you know in your blindness is to be called the world, and
whatsoever is hidden because of your blindness is the divine. This is
one of the basic tenets -- that this sansar is the moksha, this very
world is divine, this very world is the ultimate. The immediate and the
ultimate are not two, but one. The here and there are not two, but
one.</p><p>Because of this insistence, many things become possible for tantra.
One: tantra can accept everything, and the deep acceptance relaxes you
completely. Nothing else can relax you.</p><p>If there is no division between this world and that, if the
transcendental is imminent here and now, if matter is just the body of
the divine, then nothing is denied, nothing is condemned and you need
not be tense. Even if it may take ages for you to come to realize the
divine, there is no hurry for tantra. It is already there, and time is
not lacking. It is eternally here; whenever you will open your eyes you
will find it. And whatsoever you are already getting is the hidden
divine.</p><p>So the Christian attitude of condemnation, of sin, or other such
religious attitudes, is totally a lie to tantra -- and absurd, because
if you condemn something you also become divided inwardly. You cannot
divide things only outwardly. If you divide, you also will be divided in
parallel. If you say that this world is wrong, then your body will
become wrong because your body is part of this world.</p><p>If you say that this world is something which is a hindrance to
reaching the ultimate, then your whole life will be condemned and you
will feel guilty. Then you cannot enjoy, then you cannot live, then you
cannot laugh. Then seriousness will become your face. You can be only
serious; you cannot be non-serious, you cannot be playful.</p><p><br></p><p>That has happened to all the minds all over the world. They become
dead, serious. Through seriousness they become dead because they cannot
accept life as it is. They deny it, and they feel that unless they deny
they cannot reach the other world.</p><p>So the other world becomes the ideal, the future, the desire, the
vision, and this world becomes a sin. Then one feels guilty with it. And
any religion that makes you guilty, makes you neurotic. It drives you
crazy! In this sense, tantra is the only healthy religion. And whenever
any religion becomes healthy, it becomes tantra -- it becomes tantric.
So every religion has two aspects. One is the outer aspect: the church,
the organization, the publicized, the public face, the exoteric. This
aspect is always life-denying. The other aspect is the inner core. Every
religion has that too: the esoteric. It is always tantric -- totally
accepting.</p><p>Unless you accept the world totally, you cannot be at ease within.
Non-acceptance creates a tension. Once you accept everything as it is,
you are at home in the world. Tantra says this is a basic thing: you
must be at home. Only then does something more become possible. If you
are tense, divided, in conflict, in anguish, in guilt, how can you</p><p>transcend? You are so much mad inside, you cannot travel further. You
are so much engaged here, so much possessed by the here, you cannot go
beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems paradoxical. Those who are too much against the world are
too much in it; they have to be. You cannot go away from your enemy, you
are possessed by the enemy. If the world is your enemy, no matter what
you do or pretend to do you will remain worldly. You may even renounce
it, but your very approach will be worldly.</p><p>I have seen one saint, a very renowned one... He will not touch
money, and if you put some coins before him, he will close his eyes.
This is neurotic, this man is ill! What is he doing? But people worship
him because of this. They think he is so otherworldly. He is not, he is
too much in the world. Even you are not so much in the world. What is he
doing? He has just reversed the process; now he is standing on his head.
He is the same man -- the same man who was greedy for money. Constantly
he must have been thinking of money, accumulating possessions. Now he
has become quite the opposite, but he remains the same within. Now he is
against money, now he cannot touch it.</p><p>Why this fear? Why this hatred? Remember, whenever there is hatred it
is love in reverse. You can hate a thing only if you have been in love
with it. Hate is always possible only through love. You can be against
something only if you have been so much for it, but the basic attitude
remains the same: this man is greedy.</p><p>I asked this man, "Why are you so much afraid?"</p><p>He said, "Money is the hindrance. Unless I use will against my greed
toward money, I cannot reach the divine."</p><p>So now it is only a new sort of greed. He is in a bargain: if he
touches money he loses the divine. And he wants to get the divine, he
wants to possess the divine, so he is against the money.</p><p>Tantra says, do not be for the world, do not be against the world,
just accept it as it is. Do not create any problem out of it. How is
this going to help you? If you do not create any problem out of it, if
you do not grow neurotic over it -- this way or that -- if you remain
simply in it and accept it as it is, your whole energy is relieved from
it and can move to the hidden realm, to the hidden dimension.</p><p>Acceptance in this world becomes transcendence for that. Total
acceptance here will lead you, will transform you to the other
dimension, the hidden dimension, because all your energy is relieved; it
is not engaged here. Tantra believes deeply in the concept of NIYATI --
fate. Tantra says, take this world as your fate and do not be worried
about it. Once you take it as your niyati, as your fate, you accept it,
whatsoever it is. You are not worried about changing it, about making it
different, about making it according to your desire. Once you accept it
as it is and you are not bothered by it, your total energy is relieved,
and then this energy can penetrate inwards.</p><p>These techniques can be helpful only if you take this attitude;
otherwise they will not be helpful.</p><p>And they look so simple. If you start them directly as you are, they
will seem simple, but you will not succeed in them. The basic framework
is lacking. Acceptance is the basic framework. Once the acceptance is
there in the background, these very simple methods will work
wonders.</p><p>The sixth method concerning sound:</p><p>INTONE A SOUND AUDIBLY, THEN LESS AND LESS AUDIBLY AS FEELING DEEPENS
INTO THIS SILENT HARMONY.</p><p>Any sound will do, but if you love a certain sound it will be better,
because if you love a certain sound then the sound is not just sound.
When you intone the sound, then you are also intoning a hidden feeling
with it, and by and by the sound will be dropped and only feeling will
remain.</p><p>The sound has to be used as a passage toward feeling. Sound is mind
and feeling is heart. Mind has to use a passage toward the heart. It is
difficult to enter the heart directly.</p><p>Because we have been missing it so much and for so many lives, we do
not know from where to move to the heart. How to enter it? The door
seems closed.</p><p>We go on talking about the heart, but that talk also is just in the
mind. We say that we love through the heart, but this too is cerebral;
in the head. Even the talk of the heart is in the head. And we do not
know where the heart is. I do not mean the physical part of it, we know
about that. But then physicians will say, medical science will say, that
there is no possibility of love in it.</p><p>It is just a pumping system. Nothing else is in it, and all else is
just myth and poetry and dreaming.</p><p>But tantra knows a deep center hidden behind your physical heart.
That deep center can only be reached through the mind because we are
standing in the mind. We are there in the head, and any travel inwards
has to begin from there. Mind is sound. If all sound stops, you won't
have any mind. In silence there is no mind -- that is why there is so
much insistence on silence. Silence is a no-mind state.</p><p>Ordinarily we say, "My mind is silent." This is absurd, meaningless,
because mind means absence of silence. So you cannot say that the mind
is silent. If mind is, there cannot be any silence, and when silence is,
there is no mind. So there is no such thing as a silent mind; there
cannot be. It is just like saying that someone is alive-dead. It makes
no sense. If he is dead, then he is not alive. If he is alive, then he
is not dead. You cannot be alive- dead.</p><p>So there is nothing like a silent mind. When silence comes, mind is
not there. Really, mind goes out and silence comes in; silence comes in
and mind goes out. Both cannot be there. Mind is sound. If the sound is
systematic you are sane, if the sound has gone chaotic you are insane;
but in both the cases sound is there, and we exist at the point of the
mind.</p><p>So how to drop from that point to the inner point of the heart? Use
sound, intone sound.</p><p>One sound will be helpful. If there are many sounds in the mind, it
is difficult to leave them. If there is only one sound, it can be left
easily. So first many sounds are to be sacrificed for one sound. That is
the use of concentration.</p><p>Intone one sound. Go on intoning it, first audibly so that you can
hear it, and then by and by, slowly, inaudibly. No one else can hear it
then, but you can hear it inside. Make it more quiet, make it less and
less audible, and then suddenly drop it. There will be silence, an
explosion of silence -- but feeling will be there. Now there will be no
thought, but feeling will be there.</p><p>That is why it is good to use a sound, a name, a mantra, for which
you have some feeling. If a Hindu uses "Ram," he has some feeling for
it. It is not simply a word for him, it is not only in his head. The
vibrations reach to his heart also. He may not be aware, but it is
deep-rooted in his bones, in his very blood. There has been a long
tradition, a long</p><p>conditioning, for many lives. If you have been attached to one sound
continuously, it is very deep-rooted. Use it. It can be used.</p><p>A Christian can use "Ram," but it will remain in the mind, it will
not go deep. It is better that he uses "Jesus" or "Maria" or something
else. It is very easy to be influenced by a new idea, but it is
difficult to use it. You do not have any feeling for it. Even if you are
convinced in the mind that this will be better, this conviction is on
the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends was living in Germany. He was there for thirty
years and he completely forgot his mother tongue -- he was a
Maharashtrian and his mother tongue was Marathi. But he had forgotten
it, for thirty years he was using German. German became just like his
mother tongue. I say just like because no other tongue can become your
mother tongue. There is no possibility because the mother tongue remains
deep down inside of you. He consciously forgot it, and he was not able
to speak or understand it.</p><p>Then he fell ill, and he was so ill that his whole family had to go
there to see him. He was unconscious, but sometimes consciousness would
come. Whenever he would become conscious he would speak German and
whenever he would become unconscious he would mutter in Marathi.
Consciously he couldn't understand anything of Marathi; unconsciously he
couldn't understand anything of German.</p><p>Deep in the unconscious Marathi remained; it was the mother tongue.
And you cannot replace the mother tongue. You can put other things over
and above it, you can overimpose other things, but you cannot replace
it. Deep down, it will remain.</p><p>So if you have a feeling for a certain sound, it is better to use it.
Do not use an intellectual sound, it will be of no help because the
sound has to be used to make a passage from the mind to the heart. So
use some sound for which you have a deep love, a certain feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If a Mohammedan uses "Ram," it is very difficult, the word means
nothing to him. That is why the two oldest religions never believe in
conversion -- Hinduism and Judaism.</p><p>They are the two oldest religions, the two original religions, all
other religions are just offshoots of these two. Christianity and Islam
are offshoots of the Jewish tradition; Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism are
offshoots of Hinduism. These two original religions never believed in
conversion, and the reason was this: that you can convert a man
intellectually, but you cannot convert a man from his heart. You can
convert a Hindu into a Christian, you can convert a Christian into a
Hindu, but the conversion will remain of the mind.</p><p>Deep down a converted Hindu remains a Hindu. He may go to a church
and he may pray to Mary or to Jesus, but his prayer remains of the head.
You cannot change the unconscious. And if you hypnotize him, you will
find he is a Hindu. If you hypnotize him and let him reveal his
unconscious, you will find he is a Hindu.</p><p>Hindus and Jews never believed in conversion because of this basic
fact. You cannot change a man's religion because you cannot change his
heart and unconscious feelings. And if you try, then you disturb him,
because you give him something which will remain on the surface and you
divide him. Then he becomes a split personality. Deep down he is a
Hindu; on the surface he is a Christian.</p><p>He will use Christian sounds, mantras, which will not go deep, and he
cannot use Hindu</p><p>sounds which can go deep. You have disturbed his life.</p><p>So find a certain sound for which you have some feeling. Even your
own name may be helpful. If you do not have any feeling for anything
else, then your own name will be helpful. There are many cases on
record... One very famous mystic, Bukkh, used his own name, because he
said, "I do not believe in any God. I do not know about him, I do not
know what his name is. There are names I have heard, but there is no
proof that they are his name. And I am in search of myself, so why not
use my own name?" So he would use his own name, and just by using his
own name he would drop down into silence.</p><p>If you do not have any love for anything else, use your own name. But
it is very difficult because you are so condemning toward yourself that
you do not have any feeling, you do not have any respect toward
yourself. Others may be respectful toward you, but you are not
respectful toward yourself.</p><p>So the first thing is to find any sound that will be helpful: for
example, your lover's name, your beloved's name. If you love a flower,
then "rose" will do, anything -- any sound that you feel good using,
uttering, listening to, from which you feel a certain well -- being
coming to you. If you cannot find one, then there are some suggestions
from traditional sources.</p><p>"Aum" can be used, "Amen" can be used, "Maria" can be used, "Ram" can
be used, or Buddha's name, or Mahavir's name, or any name that you have
a love for. But a feeling must be there. That is why the Master's name
can be helpful, if you have the feeling. But feeling is essential!</p><p>INTONE A SOUND AUDIBLY, THEN LESS AND LESS AUDIBLY AS FEELING</p><p>DEEPENS INTO THIS SILENT HARMONY. And go on reducing the sound.
Intone it more slowly, more inaudibly so that even you have to make an
effort to hear it inside. Go on dropping, go on dropping, and you will
feel the change. The more sound will drop, the more you will be filled
with feeling. When sound disappears, only feeling remains. This feeling
cannot be named. It is a love, a deep love, but not toward anyone --
this is the difference.</p><p>When you use a sound or a word, the love is attached to a label. You
say, "Ram, Ram, Ram..." You have a deep feeling for this word, but the
feeling is addressed to "Ram," narrowed down to "Ram." When you go on
reducing the "Ram," a moment will come when "Ram" disappears, the sound
disappears. Now only the feeling remains, the feeling of love -- not
toward Ram, it is now not addressed. There is simply a feeling of love
-- not toward anyone, not even toward; there is simply a feeling of
love, as if you are in an ocean of love.</p><p>When it is not addressed, then it is of the heart. When it is
addressed, it is of the head.</p><p>Love toward someone is through the head; simple love is of the heart.
And when love is simple, unaddressed, it becomes prayer. If it is
addressed, it is not yet prayer; you are just on the way. That is why I
say if you are a Christian you cannot start as a Hindu, you should start
as a Christian. If you are a Mohammedan you cannot start as a Christian,
you should start as a Mohammedan. But the deeper you go, the less you
will be a Mohammedan or a Christian or a Hindu.</p><p>Only the start will be Hindu, Mohammedan or Christian. The more you
will proceed toward the heart, as the sound will be less and less and
feeling more and more, you will be less a Hindu, less a Mohammedan. When
the sound disappears, you will simply be a human being -- not Hindu, not
Mohammedan, not Christian.</p><p>It is like the difference between 'sects' and 'religion'. Religion is
one, sects are many. Sects help you to begin. If you think that they are
the end, then you are finished. They are just the beginning. You have to
leave them and go beyond, because the beginning is not the end. In the
end there is religion; in the beginning there is just a sect. Use the
sect to go toward religion; use the limited to go toward the unlimited;
use the finite to go toward the infinite.</p><p>Any sound will do. Find your own sound. And when you intone it, you
will feel whether you have a loving relationship with it, because the
heart will start vibrating.</p><p>Your whole body will begin to be more sensitive. You will feel as if
you are falling into something warm, just like your beloved's lap;
something warm begins enveloping you. And this is a physical feeling
also, not simply a mental feeling. If you intone a sound which you love,
you will feel a certain warmth around you, inside you. Then the world is
not a cold world, it is warm.</p><p>If you have gone to a Hindu temple, then you must have heard of the
GARBHAGRIHA</p><p>-- the womb house. The innermost center of the temple is known as
GARBHA -- the womb. You might not have observed why it is called the
womb. If you intone the sound of the temple -- and every temple has its
own sound, its own mantra, its own ISHTA DEVATA, its own deity, and the
related mantra of the deity -- if you intone that sound, the same warmth
as there is in the womb of the mother is created. That is why the
garbha, the womb of the temple, is made just similar to the womb of the
mother: round-shaped, almost closed, with only one opening.</p><p>When Christians came for the first time to India and discovered Hindu
temples, they felt that these temples were really unhygienic -- not
ventilated at all, with only one little door. But the womb is with only
one door and not ventilated at all. That is why the temple was made only
with one door, just like a womb, and if you intone that sound, that womb
becomes alive.</p><p>And also it is called the garbha because you can get a new birth
there, you can become a new man.</p><p>If you intone a sound that you love, that you have feeling for, you
will create a sound- womb around you. So it is good not to practice this
method under the open sky. You are very weak, you cannot fill the whole
sky with your sound. It is better to choose a small room, and if the
room is such that it vibrates your sound it is good, it will help you.
And if you can choose the same place every day, it will be very good. It
becomes charged. If the same sound is repeated every day, every atom,
the very space becomes a milieu.</p><p>That is why followers of other religions are not allowed in the
temples. In Mecca, no one can enter if he is not a Mohammedan, and this
is good. Nothing is wrong in it, it is because Mecca belongs to a
particular science. One who is not a Mohammedan goes there with a sound
which will be disturbing to the whole milieu. If a Mohammedan is not
allowed into a Hindu temple, there is no insult in it. And all those
social reformers who do not know anything about temples, religion and
esoteric science, they go on giving slogans, nonsense slogans, and they
are disturbing everything.</p><p>A Hindu temple is for Hindus because a Hindu temple is a particular
place -- a created place. For millennia they have been working on it to
make it alive, and anyone can disturb it.</p><p>That disturbance is very dangerous. A temple is not a public place.
It is for a particular</p><p>purpose and for particular people; it is not for visitors. That is
why visitors were not allowed in the old days. Now they are allowed
because we do not know what we are doing. A visitor should not be
allowed. It is not a place to see, to go to for sightseeing. It is a
created space filled with particular vibrations.</p><p>If it is a Ram temple and you were born in a family where Ram's name
has been sacred, loved, then when you enter an alive space which is
always filled with Ram's name, even if you do not want to chant, even if
you are not using the Ram mantra, you will start chanting. The space all
around will press you. Those vibrations all around will hit you, and you
will start chanting from deep down. So use a place -- a temple is
good.</p><p>These methods are temple methods. A temple is good, or a mosque or a
church. Your own house is not good for these methods, because with so
many sounds you have a chaotic space around you and you are not so
strong that just by your sound you can change the space. So it is better
to go to a certain place which belongs to a certain sound, and then use
it. And it is good to go to the same place every day.</p><p>By and by you will become powerful. By and by you will drop down from
the mind to the heart. Then you can do this method anywhere and the
whole cosmos becomes your temple.</p><p>Then there is no problem. But in the beginning it is good to choose
the place, and if you can even choose the time, exactly the same time
every day, it is good because then the temple waits for you. Right at
that exact time, the temple waits for you. It is more receptive; it is
happy that you have come. And I mean physically; this is not a symbolic
thing, but a physical one.</p><p>It is just as if you take your meals every day at a particular time.
At that particular time your whole body feels the hunger. The body has
its own inner clock, it feels the hunger exactly at that time. If you go
to sleep every day at a particular time, your whole body gets ready at
that particular period. If you change every day your sleeping time and
your food time, you are disturbing your body.</p><p>Now they say your age will be affected by it. If you go on daily
changing your body routine, then if you were going to be alive for
eighty years you will be alive only for seventy years. Ten years will be
lost. And if you go regularly with the body clock, then if you were
going to live for eighty years you will live for ninety very easily. Ten
years can be added.</p><p>Exactly like this, everything all around you has its own clock, and
the world moves in cosmic time. If you enter the temple at exactly the
same time every day, the temple is ready for you and you are ready for
the temple. These two readinesses meet, and the results are magnified a
thousandfold.</p><p><br></p><p>Or you can create a small corner in your house. But then do not use
that corner for any other purpose, because every purpose has its own
vibrations. If you use that corner for a business purpose or you play
cards there, that space becomes confused. And now these confusions can
even be recorded on mechanical devices; it can be known if the space is
confused.</p><p>If you can create a corner in your house, a small temple, it is very
good. If you can afford a small temple, that is the first thing to be
tried. But do not use it for any other purpose. Let it be absolutely
private for you, and results will come very soon then.</p><p>The seventh sound technique:</p><p>WITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN, KEEP MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TONGUE. OR,
AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND "HH."</p><p>Mind can be focused anywhere in the body. Ordinarily, we have focused
it in the head, but it can be focused anywhere. And with a change of the
focus, your qualities change. For example, in many Eastern countries --
Japan, China, Korea -- traditionally it has been taught that mind is in
the belly, not in the head. And because of this, those who thought that
mind is in the belly had different qualities of mind. You cannot have
those qualities because you think mind is in the head.</p><p>Really, the mind is nowhere. The brain is in the head; the mind is
not there.</p><p>"Mind" means your focusing. You can focus it anywhere, and once
focused it is very difficult to remove it from that point.</p><p>For example, now psychologists and workers who are doing in depth
human research say that when you are making love your mind must move
from the head to the genital area; otherwise your sex will be a
frustration. If it remains in the head, you cannot go deep into sex. No
orgasm will result, the experience will not be orgasmic. It will not
give you a peak. You may produce children, but you will not have known
what is the highest peak of love.</p><p>You have not known that about which tantra talks or Khajuraho
depicts, you cannot. Have you seen Khajuraho? Or if you have not seen
Khajuraho, you might have seen pictures of the Khajuraho temple. Then
look at the faces, at couples making love. Look at the faces, the faces
look divine. They are in the act of sex, but the faces are as ecstatic
as any buddha's face. What is happening to them? This sex is not
cerebral. They are not making love through the head; they are not
thinking about it. They have dropped down from the head. Their focusing
has changed.</p><p>Because of this dropping from the head, the consciousness has moved
to the genital area. The mind is no more. The mind has become no-mind.
Their faces have the same ecstasy as a buddha has. This sex has become a
meditation. Why? Because the focus has changed.</p><p>If once you can change the focus of your mind, if you can remove it
from the head, the head is relaxed, the face is relaxed. Then all
tensions have dissolved. You are not there, the ego is not there.</p><p>That is why the more mind becomes intellectual, rational, the less
capable it becomes of love, because love needs a different focusing. In
love you need a focusing near the heart; in sex you need a focusing near
the genital center. If you are doing mathematics, the head is okay. But
love is not mathematics and sex is absolutely not. And if the
mathematics continues in the head and you are making love, you are
simply wasting energy. Then this whole effort will be disgusting.</p><p>But mind can be changed. Tantra says there are seven centers, and
mind can be changed to any center. Each center has a different
functioning. If you concentrate on a particular center, you become a
different man.</p><p>In Japan there has been a military group, which is just like the
KSHATRIYAS in India, known as the SAMURAI. They are trained to be
soldiers, and their first training is to bring the mind down to just two
inches below the navel. In Japan this center is called the HARA. The
samurai are trained to bring the mind to the hara. Unless a soldier can
bring his mind's focusing to the hara, he is not allowed to go to fight,
and this is right. The</p><p>samurai are the greatest fighters the world has ever known, the
greatest warriors; in the world there is no comparison with a
samurai.</p><p>He is a different man, a different being, because his focusing is
different.</p><p>They say that when you are fighting there is no time. Mind needs time
to function; it calculates. If you are attacked and your mind thinks
about how to protect, you have missed the point already, you have lost.
There is no time. You must function timelessly and mind cannot function
timelessly, mind needs time. Howsoever short, mind needs time.</p><p>Below the navel there is a center, the hara, which functions
timelessly. If the focusing is at the hara and the fighter is fighting,
then this fight is intuitive, not intellectual. Before you attack him,
he knows. It is a subtle feeling in the hara, not in the head. It is not
an inference, it is a psychic telepathy. Before you attack him, before
you think of attacking him, the thought has reached him. His hara is hit
and he is ready to protect himself. Even before you have attacked, he is
in defense, he has protected himself.</p><p>Sometimes, if two persons are fighting and both are samurais,
defeating the other is a problem. Neither can defeat the other; it is a
problem. No one can be declared the winner. In a way it is impossible
because you cannot attack the man -- before you attack, he knows.</p><p>There was one Indian mathematician... The whole world was
wonderstruck because he would not calculate. Ramanujam was his name. You
would give him the problem and he would give you the answer
immediately.</p><p>One of England's best mathematicians, Hardy, visited Ramanujam. Hardy
was one of the best mathematicians ever born, and he had to work with a
particular problem for six hours. But Ramanujam was given the same
problem and he answered immediately. There was no possibility for the
mind to function in this way, as the mind needs time.</p><p>Ramanujam was asked again and again, "How do you do it?" He would
say, "I don't know. You give me the problem, and the answer comes to me.
It comes from somewhere below. It is not from my head." It was coming
from the hara. He was not aware, he was not trained, but this is my
feeling: he must have been a Japanese in his previous birth because in
India we have not worked much upon the hara.</p><p>Tantra says, focus your mind on different centers and the results
will be different. This technique is concerned with focusing on the
tongue, in the middle of the tongue. WITH MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN -- as if
you are going to speak. Not closed, but slightly open as if you are
going to speak; not like when you are speaking, but like when you are
just going to speak.</p><p>Then keep the mind in the middle of the tongue. You will have a very
strange feeling, because the tongue has a center just in the middle
which controls your thoughts. If you suddenly become aware and you focus
on that, your thoughts will stop. Focus as if your whole mind has come
to the tongue -- just in the middle.</p><p>Let the mouth be slightly open as if you were going to speak, and
then focus the mind as if it is not in the head. Feel it as if it is in
the tongue, just in the middle.</p><p>The tongue has the center of speech, and thought is speech. What are
you doing when you are thinking? Talking within. Can you think anything
without talking within? You are alone; you are not talking to anyone,
you are thinking. What are you doing while you are thinking? Talking
within, talking to yourself. Your tongue is involved. Next time,</p><p>while you are thinking, be aware: feel your tongue. It is vibrating
as if you are talking to someone else. Then feel it again, and you can
feel that the vibrations are centered in the middle. They arise from the
middle and then they spread all over the tongue.</p><p>Thinking is talking within. If you can bring your total
consciousness, your mind, to the center of the tongue, thinking stops.
So those who have been practicing silence, they are simply practicing
not talking. If you stop talking outwardly, then you will become very
deeply aware of talking inside. And if you remain completely silent for
one month or two months or one year, not talking, you will feel your
tongue vibrating violently. You are not feeling it because you go on
talking and the vibrations are released. But even now, if you stop and
become conscious while thinking, you will feel your tongue vibrating a
little.</p><p>Stop your tongue completely and then try to think -- you cannot
think. Stop your tongue completely as if it is frozen; do not allow it
to move. You cannot think then.</p><p>The center is just in the middle, so bring your mind there. WITH
MOUTH SLIGHTLY OPEN, KEEP MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TONGUE. OR, AS
BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND "HH."</p><p>This is the second technique. It is just similar: OR, AS BREATH COMES
SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND "HH."</p><p>With the first technique your thinking will stop, you will feel a
solidity within -- as if you have become solid. When thoughts are not
there you become immovable; thoughts are the inner movement. And when
thoughts are not there and you have become immovable, you have become
part of the eternal, which only appears to move but which is immovable,
which remains unmoved.</p><p>In thoughtlessness you become part of the eternal, the unmoved. With
thought you are part of the movement, because nature is movement. The
world is movement, that is why we have called it the SANSAR, the wheel
-- it is moving and moving and moving. The world is movement and the
hidden, the ultimate, is unmoved, unmoving, immovable.</p><p>It is just like a wheel that is moving, but a wheel is moving on
something which never moves. A wheel can move only because in the center
there is something which never moves, which remains unmoved.</p><p>The world moves and the transcendental remains unmoved. If your
thoughts stop, suddenly you drop from this world to the other. With the
movement stopped inside, you become part of the eternal -- that which
never changes.</p><p>OR, AS BREATH COMES SILENTLY IN, FEEL THE SOUND "HH." Open your</p><p>mouth slightly, as if you are going to speak. Then inhale, and be
aware of the sound which is created by inhaling. It is just "HH" --
whether you are exhaling or inhaling. You are not to make the sound, you
are just to feel the incoming breath on your tongue. It is very silent.
You will feel "HH." It will be very silent, very slightly audible. You
have to be very alert to be aware of it. But do not try to create it. If
you create it, you have missed the point. Your created sound will be of
no help, it is the natural sound that happens when you inhale or
exhale.</p><p>But the technique says while inhaling, not exhaling -- because while
exhaling you will go out, and with the sound YOU will go out, while the
effort is to go in. So while inhaling, hear the sound "HH." Go on
inhaling and go on feeling the sound "HH." Sooner or later you will feel
that the sound is not being created only at the tongue, it is being
created in the throat also. But then it is very, very inaudible. With
very deep alertness you can</p><p>become aware of it.</p><p>Start from the tongue, then by and by be alert; go on feeling it.</p><p>You will hear it in the throat, then you will start hearing it in the
heart. And when it reaches the heart, you have gone beyond mind. All
these techniques are just to give you a bridge from where you can move
from thought to no-thought, from mind to no-mind, from the surface to
the center.</p><p>The eighth sound technique:</p><p>CENTER ON THE SOUND "AUM" WITHOUT ANY "A" OR "M".</p><p>CENTER ON THE SOUND "AUM" -- A-U-M, AUM -- WITHOUT ANY "A" OR
"M".</p><p>Just the "U" remains. This is a difficult technique, but for some it
may be suitable, particularly for those who work with sound: musicians,
poets, those who have a very sensitive ear, for them this technique can
be helpful. For others, those who have no sensitive ear, this is very
difficult because it is very delicate.</p><p>You have to intone Aum, and you have to feel in this Aum three sounds
separately: A-U-</p><p>M. Intone Aum, and in the sound you have to feel three sounds --
A-U-M. They are there, infused together. A very delicate ear can be
aware, can hear A-U-M separately while intoning. They are separate --
very close, but separate. If you cannot hear them separately, then this
technique cannot be done. Your ears will have to be trained for it.</p><p>In Japan, particularly in Zen, they train the ears first. They have a
method of training the ears. The wind is blowing outside -- it has a
sound. The master will say, "Concentrate on it. Feel all the nuances,
the changes: when the sound is angry, when the sound is furious, when
the sound is compassionate, when the sound is loving, when the sound is
strong, when the sound is delicate. Feel the nuances of the sound. The
wind is blowing through the trees -- feel it. The river is running --
feel the nuances."</p><p>For months together the seeker, the meditator, will be sitting by the
side of the bank of the river, listening to it. It has different sounds.
Everything is changing. In the rain it will be flooded; it will be very
much alive, overflowing. The sounds will be different. In the summer it
will be reduced to nothingness, sounds will cease. But there will be
inaudible sounds if one is listening, if you listen. All the year round
the river will be changing, and one has to be aware.</p><p>In Hermann Hesse's book SIDDHARTHA, Siddhartha lives with a boatman.
And there is no one, just the river, the boatman and Siddhartha. And the
boatman is a very silent man. He has lived all his life with the river.
He has become silent, he rarely speaks. Whenever Siddhartha feels
lonely, he tells Siddhartha to go to the river, to listen to the river.
It is better than listening to human words.</p><p>And then by and by, Siddhartha is attuned to the river. Then he
begins to feel its moods -- the river changes moods. Sometimes it is
friendly and sometimes it is not, and sometimes it is singing and
sometimes it is weeping and crying, and sometimes there is laughter and
sometimes there is sadness.</p><p>And then he begins to feel the slight, delicate differences. His ear
becomes attuned.</p><p>So in the beginning you may feel it to be difficult, but try. Intone
Aum, go on intoning it, feeling A-U-M. Three sounds are combined
together in it: Aum is a synthesis of three sounds. Once you start
feeling them differently, then drop "A" and "M". Then you cannot say
Aum: "A" will be dropped, "M" will be dropped. Then "U" will remain.
Why? What will happen? The real thing is not the mantra. It is not A-U-M
or the dropping. The real</p><p>thing is your sensitivity.</p><p>First you become sensitive of three sounds, which is very difficult.
And when you become so sensitive that you can drop the "A" and "M" and
only the middle sound remains, in this effort you will lose your mind.
You will be so much engrossed in it, so deeply attentive to it, so
sensitive to it, that you will forget to think. And if you think, you
cannot do this.</p><p>This is just an indirect way to bring you out of your head. So many
ways have been tried, and they look very simple. You wonder, "What can
happen? Nothing will happen by such simple methods." But miracles
happen, because it is just indirect. Your mind is being focused on
something very subtle. If you focus, you cannot go on thinking; mind
will drop. Suddenly one day you will become aware, and you will wonder
what has happened. In Zen they use koans.</p><p>One of the famous koans they tell to the beginner is, "Go and try to
hear the sound of one hand. You can create a sound with two hands. If
one hand can create a sound, hear it." One small boy was serving a Zen
master. He would see many people coming. They would come to the master,
put their head at his feet, and then they would ask the master to tell
them something to meditate on. He would give them a koan. The boy was
just doing some work for the master, he was serving him. He was just
nine or ten years of age.</p><p>Seeing every day many people coming and going, one day he also came
very seriously, put his head at the master's feet, and then asked him,
"Give me some koan, some object for meditation." The master laughed, but
the boy was very serious, so the master said, "Okay! Try to hear the
sound of one hand. And when you have heard it, then come to me and tell
me."</p><p>The boy tried and tried. He couldn't sleep the whole night. In the
morning he came and he said, "I have heard. It is the sound of the wind
blowing through the trees." The master said, "But where is the hand
involved in it? Go again and try." So he would come every day. He would
find some sound and then he would come, and the master would say, "This
is also not it. Go on trying, go on trying!"</p><p>Then one day the boy didn't come. The master waited and waited, and
then he told his other disciples to go and find out what had happened --
it seemed the boy had heard.</p><p>So they went around. He was sitting under a tree, absorbed -- just a
newborn buddha. They came back and they said, "But we are afraid to
disturb the boy. He is looking just like a newborn buddha. It seems he
has heard the sound." So the master came, put his head at the boy's feet
and asked him, "Have you heard? It seems you have heard." The boy said,
"Yes, but it is soundlessness."</p><p>How did this boy develop? His sensitivity developed. He tried every
sound, he listened attentively. Attention developed. He would not sleep.
The whole night he would listen for what is the sound of one hand. He
was not so intellectual as you are, so he never thought that there
cannot be any sound of one hand. If the koan is given to you, you are
not going to try. You will say, "What nonsense! There cannot be any
sound with one hand."</p><p>But the boy tried. The master had said there must be something in it,
so he tried. He was a simple boy, so whenever he would hear something,
whenever he would feel this was something new, he would come again. But
by this process his sensitivity developed. He became attentive, alert,
aware. He became one-pointed. He was in search, and the mind dropped
because the master said, "If you go on thinking you may miss. Sometimes
there</p><p>is the sound which is of one hand. Be so alert that you do not miss
it."</p><p>He tried and tried. There is no sound of one hand, but that was just
an indirect method to create sensitivity, awareness.</p><p>And one day, suddenly, everything disappeared. He was so attentive
that only attention was there, so sensitive that only sensitivity was
there, so aware -- not aware of something, but simply aware! And then he
said, "I have heard it, but it is soundlessness. It is soundlessness!"
But you have to be trained to be attentive, to be alert.</p><p>This is just a method to make you very delicately aware of the subtle
nuances of sound. Just doing this, you will forget Aum. Not only will
"A" drop, not only will "M" drop, but one day suddenly you will also
drop, and there will be soundlessness, and you will be a newborn buddha
sitting under a tree.</p><p>THE END.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

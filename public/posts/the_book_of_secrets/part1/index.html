WHAT CONSTITUTES SEED?\nWHO CENTERS THE UNIVERSAL WHEEL?\nWHAT IS THIS LIFE BEYOND FORM PERVADING FORMS?\nHOW MAY WE ENTER IT FULLY, ABOVE SPACE AND TIME, NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS?\nLET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED!\nSome introductory points. First, the world of VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA is not intellectual, it is not philosophical. Doctrine is meaningless to it. It is concerned with method, with technique -- not with principles at all. The word `tantra' means technique, the method, the path. So it is not philosophical -- note this. It is not concerned with intellectual problems and inquiries. It is not concerned with the \"why\" of things, it is concerned with \"how\"; not with what is truth, but how the truth can be attained.\nTANTRA means technique. So this treatise is a scientific one. Science is not concerned with why, science is concerned with how. That is the basic difference between philosophy and science. Philosophy asks, \"Why this existence?\" Science asks, \"How this existence?\" The moment you ask the question, how?, method, technique, become important. Theories become meaningless; experience becomes the center.\nTantra is science, tantra is not philosophy. To understand philosophy is easy because only your intellect is required.\nIf you can understand language, if you can understand concept, you can understand philosophy. You need not change; you require no transformation. As you are, you can understand philosophy -- but not tantra.\nYou will need a change... rather, a mutation. Unless YOU are different tantra cannot be understood, because tantra is not an intellectual proposition, it is an experience. Unless you are receptive, ready, vulnerable to the experience, it is not going to come to you.\nPhilosophy is concerned with the mind. Your head is enough; your totality is not required. Tantra needs you in your totality. It is a deeper challenge. You will have to be in it wholly. It is not fragmentary. A different approach, a different attitude, a different mind to receive it is required. Because of this, Devi is asking apparently philosophical questions. Tantra starts with Devi's questions. All the questions can be tackled philosophically.\nReally, any question can be tackled in two ways: philosophically or totally, antellectually or existentially. For example, if someone asks, \"What is love?\" you can tackle it intellectually, you can discuss, you can propose theories, you can argue for a particular hypothesis. You can create a system, a doctrine -- and you may not have known love at all.\nTo create a doctrine, experience is not needed. Really, on the contrary, the less you know the better because then you can propose a system unhesitatingly.\nOnly a blind man can easily define what light is. When you do not know you are bold. Ignorance is always bold; knowledge hesitates. And the more you know, the more you feel that the ground underneath is dissolving. The more you know, the more you feel how ignorant you are. And those who are really wise, they become ignorant. They become as simple as children, or as simple as idiots.\nThe less you know, the better. To be philosophical, to be dogmatic, to be doctrinaire -- this is easy. To tackle a problem intellectually is very easy. But to tackle a problem existentially -- not just to think about it, but to live it through, to go through it, to allow yourself to be transformed through it -- is difficult. That is, to know love one will have to be in love. That is dangerous because you will not remain the same. The experience is going to change you. The moment you enter love, you enter a different person. And when you come out you will not be able to recognize your old face; it will not belong to you. A discontinuity will have happened. Now there is a gap, the old man is dead and the new man has come. That is what is known as rebirth -- being twice-born.\nTantra is non-philosophical and existential. So of course Devi asks questions which appear to be philosophical, but Shiva is not going to answer them that way. So it is better to understand it in the beginning; otherwise you will be puzzled, because Shiva is not going to answer a single question.\nAll the questions that Devi is asking, Shiva is not going to answer at all. And still he answers! And really, only he has answered them and no one else -- but on a different plane.\nDevi asks, \"What is your reality, my lord?\" He is not going to answer it. On the contrary, he will give a technique. And if Devi goes through this technique, she will know. So the answer is round-about; it is not direct. He is not going to answer \"Who am I.\" He will give a technique -- do it and you will know.\nFor tantra, doing is knowing, and there is no other knowing. Unless you do something, unless you change, unless you have a different perspective to look at, to look with, unless you move in an altogether different dimension than the intellect, there is no answer.\nAnswers can be given -- they are all lies. All philosophies are lies. You ask a question and the philosophy gives you an answer. It satisfies you or doesn't satisfy you. If it satisfies you, you become a convert to the philosophy, but you remain the same. If it doesn't satisfy you, you go on searching for some other philosophy to be converted to. But you remain the same; you are not touched at all, you are not changed.\nSo whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian or a Jain, it makes no difference. The real person behind the facade of a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian is the same. Only words differ, or clothes.\nThe man who is going to the church or to the temple or to the mosque is the same man. Only faces differ, and they are faces which are false; they are masks. Behind the masks you will find the same man -- the same anger, the same aggression, the same violence, the same greed, the same lust -- everything the same. Is Mohammedan sexuality different from Hindu sexuality? Is Christian violence different from Hindu violence? It is the same! The reality remains the same; only clothes differ.\nTantra is not concerned with your clothes, tantra is concerned with you. If you ask a question it shows where you are. It shows also that wherever you are you cannot see; that is why there is the question. A blind man asks, \"What is light?\" and philosophy will start answering what is light. Tantra will know only this: if a man is asking \"What is light?\" it\nshows only that he is blind. Tantra will start operating on the man, changing the man, so that he can see. Tantra will not say what is light. Tantra will tell how to attain insight, how to attain seeing, how to attain vision. When the vision is there, the answer will be there. Tantra will not give you the answer; tantra will give you the technique to attain the answer.\nNow, this answer is not going to be intellectual. If you say something about light to a blind man, this is intellectual. If the blind man himself becomes capable of seeing, this is existential.\nThis is what I mean when I say that tantra is existential. So Shiva is not going to answer Devi's questions, still, he will answer -- the first thing.\nThe second thing: this is a different type of language. You must know something about it before we enter into it. All the tantra treatises are dialogues between Shiva and Devi.\nDevi questions and Shiva answers. All the tantra treatises start that way. Why? Why this method? It is very significant. It is not a dialogue between a teacher and a disciple, it is a dialogue between two lovers. And tantra signifies through it a very meaningful thing: that the deeper teachings cannot be given unless there is love between the two -- the disciple and the master. The disciple and master must become deep lovers. Only then can the higher, the beyond, be expressed.\nSo it is a language of love; the disciple must be in an attitude of love. But not only this, because friends can be lovers. Tantra says a disciple moves as receptivity, so the disciple must be in a feminine receptivity; only then is something possible. You need not be a woman to be a disciple, but you need to be in a feminine attitude of receptivity. When Devi asks, it means the feminine attitude asks. Why this emphasis on the feminine attitude?\nMan and woman are not only physically different, they are psychologically different. Sex is not only a difference in the body; it is a difference in psychologies also.\nA feminine mind means receptivity -- total receptivity, surrender, love. A disciple needs a feminine psychology; otherwise he will not be able to learn. You can ask, but if you are not open then you cannot be answered. You can ask a question and still remain closed.\nThen the answer cannot penetrate you. Your doors are closed; you are dead. You are not open.\nA feminine receptivity means a womb-like receptivity in the inner depth, so that you can receive. And not only that -- much more is implied. A woman is not only receiving something, the moment she receives it, it becomes a part of her body. A child is received. A woman conceives; the moment there is conception, the child has become part of the feminine body. It is not alien, it is not foreign. It has been absorbed. Now the child will live not as something added to the mother, but just as a part, just as the mother. And the child is not only received: the feminine body becomes creative; the child begins to grow. A disciple needs a womb-like receptivity. Whatsoever is received is not to be gathered as dead knowledge. It must grow in you; it must become blood and bones in you. It must become a part, now. It must grow! This growth will change you, will transform you -- the receiver. That is why tantra uses this device. Every treatise starts with Devi asking a question and Shiva replying to it. Devi is Shiva's consort, his feminine part.\nOne thing more. Now modern psychology, depth psychology particularly, says that\nman is both man and woman. No one is just male and no one is just female; everyone is bi-sexual. Both sexes are there. This is a very recent research in the West, but for tantra this has been one of the most basic concepts for thousands of years. You must have seen some pictures of Shiva as ARDHANARISHWAR -- half man, half woman. There is no other concept like it in the whole history of man. Shiva is depicted as half man, half woman.\nSo Devi is not just a consort, she is Shiva's other half. And unless a disciple becomes the other half of the master it is impossible to convey the higher teachings, the esoteric methods. When you become one then there is no doubt. When you are one with the master -- so totally one, so deeply one -- there is no argument, no logic, no reason. One simply absorbs; one becomes a womb. And then the teaching begins to grow in you and change you.\nThat is why tantra is written in love language. Something must also be understood about love language. There are two types of language: logical language and love language.\nThere are basic differences between the two.\nLogical language is aggressive, argumentative, violent. If I use logical language I become aggressive upon your mind. I try to convince you, to convert you, to make a puppet of you.\nMy argument is \"right\" and you are \"wrong.\" Logical language is egocentric: \"I am right and you are wrong, so I must prove that I am right and you are wrong.\" I am not concerned with you, I am concerned with my ego. My ego is always \"right.\"\nLove language is totally different. I am not concerned with my ego; I am concerned with you. I am not concerned to prove something, to strengthen my ego. I am concerned to help you. It is a compassion to help you to grow, to help you to transform, to help you to be reborn.\nSecondly, logic will always be intellectual. Concepts and principles will be significant, arguments will be significant. With love language what is said is not so significant; rather, it is the way it is said. The container, the word is not important; the content, the message is more important. It is a heart-to-heart talk, not a mind-to-mind discussion. It is not a debate, it is a communion.\nSo this is rare: Devi is sitting in the lap of Shiva and asking, and Shiva answers. It is a love dialogue -- no conflict, as if Shiva is speaking to himself. Why this emphasis on love\n-- love language? Because if you are in love with your master, then the whole gestalt changes; it becomes different. Then you are not hearing his words. Then you are drinking him. Then words are irrelevant. Really, the silence between the words becomes more significant. What he is saying may be meaningful or it may not be meaningful.\n.. but it is his eyes, his gestures, his compassion, his love.\nThat is why tantra has a fixed device, a structure. Every treatise starts with Devi asking and Shiva answering. No argument is going to be there, no wastage of words. There are very simple statements of fact, telegraphic messages with no view to convince, but just to relate.\nIf you encounter Shiva with a question with a closed mind, he will not answer you in this way. First your closedness has to be broken. Then he will have to be aggressive. Then your prejudices, then your preconceptions have to be destroyed. Unless you are cleared completely of your past, nothing can be given to you. But this is not so with his consort Devi; with Devi there is no past.\nRemember, when you are deeply in love your mind ceases to be. There is no past; only the present moment becomes everything. When you are in love the present is the only time, the now is all -- no past, no future. So Devi is just open. There is no defense -- nothing to be cleared, nothing to be destroyed. The ground is ready, only a seed has to be dropped. The ground is not only ready, but welcoming, receptive, asking to be impregnated.\nSo all these sayings that we are going to discuss will be telegraphic. They are just sutras, but each sutra, each telegraphic message given by Shiva is worth a Veda, worth a Bible, worth a Koran. Each single sentence can become the base of a great scripture.\nScriptures are logical -- you have to propose, defend, argue. Here there is no argument, just simple statements of love.\nThirdly, the very words VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA mean the technique of going beyond consciousness. VIGYANA means consciousness, BHAIRAVA means the state which is beyond consciousness, and TANTRA means the method: the method of going beyond consciousness. This is the supreme doctrine -- without any doctrine.\nWe are unconscious, so all the religious teachings are concerned with how to go beyond unconsciousness, how to be conscious. For example, Krishnamurti, Zen, they are all concerned with how to create more consciousness, because we are unconscious. So how to be more aware, alert? From unconsciousness, how to move toward consciousness?\nBut tantra says that this is a duality -- unconscious and conscious. If you move from unconsciousness to consciousness, you are moving from one duality to another. Move beyond both! Unless you move beyond both you can never reach the ultimate, so be neither the unconscious nor the conscious; just go beyond, just be. Be neither the conscious nor the unconscious -- just BE! This is going beyond yoga, going beyond Zen, going beyond all teachings.\n'Vigyana' means consciousness, and 'bhairava' is a specific term, a tantra term for one who has gone beyond. That is why Shiva is known as Bhairava and Devi is known as Bhairavi -- those who have gone beyond the dualities.\nIn our experience only love can give a glimpse. That is why love becomes the very basic device to impart tantric wisdom. In our experience we can say that only love is something which goes beyond duality. When two persons are in love, the deeper they move into it, the less and less they are two, the more and more they become one. And a point comes and a peak is reached when only apparently they are two. Inwardly they are one; the duality is transcended.\nOnly in this sense does Jesus' saying that \"God is love\" become meaningful; otherwise not. In our experience love is nearest to God. It is not that God is loving, as Christians go on interpreting -- that God has a fatherly love for you. Nonsense! \"God is love\" is a tantric statement. It means love is the only reality in our experience which reaches nearest to God, to the divine. Why? Because in love oneness is felt. Bodies remain two, but something beyond the bodies merges and becomes one.\nThat is why there is so much hankering after sex. The real hankering is after oneness, but that oneness is not sexual. In sex two bodies have only a deceptive feeling of becoming one, but they are not one, they are only joined together. But for a single moment two bodies forget themselves in each other, and a certain physical oneness is felt. This hankering is not bad, but to stop at it is dangerous. This hankering shows a deeper urge to\nfeel oneness.\nIn love, on a higher plane, the inner one moves, merges into the other, and there is a feeling of oneness. Duality dissolves. Only in this non-dual love can we have a glimpse of what is the state of a Bhairava. We may say that the state of a Bhairava is absolute love with no coming back, from the peak of love there is no falling back. It is remaining on the peak.\nWe have made Shiva's abode on Kailash. That is simply symbolic: it is the highest peak, the holiest peak. We have made it Shiva's abode. We can go there but we will have to come down, it cannot be our abode. We can go on a pilgrimage. It is a TEERTHYATRA\n-- a pilgrimage, a journey. We can touch for a single moment the highest peak; then we will have to come back.\nIn love this holy pilgrimage happens, but not for all because almost no one moves beyond sex. So we go on living in the valley, the dark valley. Sometimes someone moves to the peak of love, but then he falls back because it is so dizzying. It is so high and you are so low,. and it is so difficult to live there. Those who have loved, they know how difficult it is to be constantly in love. One has to come back again and again. It is Shiva's abode. He lives there; it is his home.\nA Bhairava lives in love; that is his abode. When I say that is his abode, I mean now he is not even aware of love -- because if you live on Kailash you will not be aware that this is Kailash, this is a peak.\nThe peak becomes a plain. Shiva is not aware of love. We are aware of love because we live in non-love. And because of the contrast we feel love. Shiva IS love. The state of Bhairava means that one has become love, not loving; one has become LOVE, one lives on the peak. The peak has become his abode.\nHow to make this highest peak possible: beyond duality, beyond unconsciousness, beyond consciousness, beyond the body and beyond the soul, beyond the world and beyond the so-called MOKSHA -- liberation? How to reach this peak? The technique is tantra. But tantra is pure technique, so it is going to be difficult to understand. First let us understand the questions, what Devi is asking.\nOH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Why this question? You can also ask this question, but it will not carry the same meaning. So try to understand why Devi asks, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Devi is in deep love. When you are in deep love, for the first time you encounter the inner reality. Then Shiva is not the form, then Shiva is not the body. When you are in love, the body of the beloved falls away, disappears. The form is no more and the formless is revealed. You are facing an abyss. That is why we are so afraid of love. We can face a body, we can face a face, we can face a form, but we are afraid of facing an abyss.\nIf you love someone, if you really love, his body is bound to disappear.\nIn some moments of climax, of peak, the form will dissolve, and through the beloved you will enter the formless. That is why we are afraid -- it is falling into a bottomless abyss. So this question is not just a simple curiosity: OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Devi must have fallen in love with the form. Things start that way. She must have loved this man as a man, and now when the love has come of age, when the love has flowered,\nthis man has disappeared. He has become formless. Now he is to be found nowhere. OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? It is a question asked in a very intense love moment. And when questions are raised, they become different according to the mind in which they are asked.\nSo create the situation, the milieu of the question in your mind. Devi must be at a loss -- Shiva has disappeared. When love reaches its peak the lover disappears. Why does this happen? This happens because really, everyone is formless. You are not a body. You move as a body, you live as a body, but you are not a body. When we see someone from the outside, he is a body. Love penetrates within. Then we are not seeing the person from the outside. Love can see a person as the person can see himself from within. Then the form disappears.\nA Zen monk, Rinzai, attained his enlightenment, and the first thing he asked was, \"Where is my body? Where has my body gone?\" And he began to search.\nHe called his disciples and said, \"Go and find out where my body is. I have lost my body.\"\nHe had entered the formless. You are also a formless existence, but you know yourself not directly, but from others' eyes. You know through the mirror. Sometime, while looking in the mirror, close your eyes and then think, meditate: if there was no mirror, how could you have known your face? If there was no mirror, there would have been no face. You do not have a face; mirrors give you faces. Think of a world where there are no mirrors. You are alone -- no mirror at all, not even others' eyes working as mirrors. You are alone on a lonely island; nothing can mirror you. Then will you have any face? Or will you have any body? You cannot have one. You do not have one at all. We know ourselves only through others, and the others can only know the outer form. That is why we become identified with it.\nAnother Zen mystic, Hui-Hai used to say to his disciples, \"When you have lost your head meditating, come immediately to me. When you lose your head, come immediately to me. When you begin to feel there is no head, do not be afraid; come immediately to me. This is the right moment. Now something can be taught to you.\" With a head, no teaching is possible. The head always comes in between.\nDevi asks Shiva, OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? -- who are you? The form has disappeared; hence the question.\nIn love you enter the other as himself. It is not you answering. You become one, and for the first time you know an abyss -- a formless presence.\nThat is why for centuries together, centuries and centuries, we were not making any sculptures, any pictures of Shiva. We were only making SHIVALINGA -- the symbol. The Shivalinga is just a formless form. When you love someone, when you enter someone, he becomes just a luminous presence. The Shivalinga is just a luminous presence, just an aura of light.\nThat is why Devi asks, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY?\nWHAT IS THIS WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE? We know the universe, but we never know it as wonder-filled. Children know, lovers know. Sometimes poets and madmen know. We do not know that the world is wonder-filled. Everything is just repetitive -- no wonder, no poetry, just flat prose. It doesn't create a song in you; it doesn't create a dance in you; it doesn't give birth to the poetry inside. The whole universe looks mechanical.\nChildren look at it with wonder-filled eyes. When the eyes are wonder-filled, the universe is wonder-filled.\nWhen you are in love, you again become like children. Jesus says, \"Only those who are like children will enter my kingdom of God.\" Why? Because if the universe is not a wonder, you cannot be religious. The universe can be explained -- then your approach is scientific. The universe is either known or unknown, but that which is unknown can be known any day; it is not unknowable.\nThe universe becomes unknowable, a mystery, only when your eyes are wonder-filled. Devi says, WHAT IS THIS WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE? Suddenly there is the jump from a personal question to a very impersonal one. She was asking, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? and then suddenly, WHAT IS THIS WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE?\nWhen form disappears, your beloved becomes the universe, the formless, the infinite. Suddenly Devi becomes aware that she is not asking a question about Shiva; she is asking a question about the whole universe. Now Shiva has become the whole universe. Now all the stars are moving in him, and the whole firmament and the whole space is surrounded by him. Now he is the great engulfing factor -- \"the great encompassing.\" Karl Jaspers has defined God as \"the great encompassing.\"\nWhen you enter into love, into a deep, intimate world of love, the person disappears, the form disappears, and the lover becomes just a door to the universe. Your curiosity can be a scientific one -- then you have to approach through logic. Then you must not think of the formless. Then beware of the formless; then remain content with the form. Science is always concerned with the form. If anything formless is proposed to a scientific mind, he will cut it into form -- unless it takes a form it is meaningless. First give it a form, a definite form; only then does the inquiry start.\nIn love, if there is form then there is no end to it.\nDissolve the form! When things become formless, dizzy, without boundaries, every thing entering another, the whole universe becoming a oneness, then only is it a wonder-filled universe.\nWHAT CONSTITUTES SEED? Then Devi goes on. From the universe she goes on to ask, WHAT CONSTITUTES SEED? This formless, wonder-filled universe, from where does it come? From where does it originate? Or does it NOT originate? What is the seed?\nWHO CENTERS THE UNIVERSAL WHEEL? asks Devi. This wheel goes on moving and moving -- this great change, this constant flux. But who centers this wheel? Where is the axis, the center, the unmoving center?\nShe doesn't stop for any answer. She goes on asking as if she is not asking anyone, as if talking to herself.\nWHAT IS THIS LIFE BEYOND FORM PERVADING FORMS?\nHOW MAY WE ENTER IT FULLY, ABOVE SPACE AND TIME, NAMES AND DESCRIPTION?\nLET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED. The emphasis is not on questions but on doubts: LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED! This is very significant. If you are asking an intellectual question, you are asking for a definite answer so that your problem is solved.\nBut Devi says, LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED. She is not really asking about answers. She is asking for a transformation of her mind, because a doubting mind will remain a doubting mind whatsoever answers are given. Note it: a doubting mind will remain a doubting mind.\nAnswers are irrelevant. If I give you one answer and you have a doubting mind, you will doubt it. If I give you another answer, you will doubt that also. You have a doubting mind. A doubting mind means you will put a question mark to anything.\nSo answers are useless. You ask me, \"Who created the world?\" and I tell you \"A\" created the world. Then you are bound to ask, \"Who created 'A'?\" So the real problem is not how to answer questions. The real problem is how to change the doubting mind, how to create a mind which is not doubting -- or, which is trustful. So Devi says, LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED.\nTwo or three things more. When you ask a question, you may be asking for many\nreasons. One may be just this, that you want a confirmation. You already know the answer, you have the answer, you just want it to be confirmed that your answer is right. Then your question is false, pseudo; it is not a question. You may be asking a question not because you are ready to change yourself, but just as a curiosity.\nThe mind goes on questioning. In the mind questions come as leaves come on a tree. That is the very nature of the mind -- to question. So it goes on questioning. It matters not what you are questioning, with anything given to the mind it will create a question. It is a machine to grind out, to create questions. So give it anything and it will cut it into pieces and create many questions.\nOne question answered, and the mind will create many questions from the answer. This has been the whole history of philosophy.\nBertrand Russell remembers that when he was a child he thought that one day, when he will be mature enough to understand all philosophy, all questions will be answered. Then later, when he was eighty, he said, \"Now I can say that my own questions are there standing, as they were standing when I was a child. No other questions have come up because of these theories of philosophy.\" So he said, \"When I was young I used to say, philosophy is an inquiry for ultimate answers. Now I cannot say it. It is an inquiry for endless questions.\"\nSo one question creates one answer and many questions. The doubting mind is the problem. Devi says, \"Do not be concerned with my questions. I have asked so many things: What is your reality? What is this wonder-filled universe? What constitutes seed? Who centers the universal wheel? What is life beyond form? How can we enter it fully above time and space? But do not be concerned with my questions. Let my doubts be cleared. I ask these questions because they are in my mind. I ask them just to show you my mind, but do not pay much attention to them. Really, answers will not fulfill my need. My need is. let my doubts be cleared.\"\nBut how can the doubts be cleared? Will any answer do? Is there any answer which will clear your doubts? Mind IS the doubt.\nIt is not that the mind doubts, mind is the doubt! Unless the mind dissolves, doubts cannot be cleared.\nShiva will answer. His answers are techniques -- the oldest, most ancient techniques. But you can call them the latest also because nothing can be added to them. They are\ncomplete -- one hundred and twelve techniques. They have taken in all the possibilities, all the ways of cleaning the mind, transcending the mind. Not a single method could be added to Shiva's one hundred and twelve methods. And this book, VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA, is five thousand years old. Nothing can be added; there is no possibility to add anything. It is exhaustive, complete. It is the most ancient and yet the latest, yet the newest. Old like old hills -- the methods seem eternal -- and they are new like a dewdrop before the sun, because they are so fresh.\nThese one hundred and twelve methods of meditation constitute the whole science of transforming mind. We will enter them one by one. We will try to comprehend first intellectually. But use your intellect only as an instrument, not as a master. Use it as an instrument to understand something, but do not go on creating barriers with it. When we will be talking about these techniques, just put aside your past knowledge, your knowing, whatsoever information you have collected. Put them aside -- they are just dust gathered on the road.\nEncounter these methods with a fresh mind -- with alertness, of course, but not with argumentation.\nAnd do not create the fallacy that an argumentative mind is an alert mind. It is not, because the moment you move into arguments you have lost the awareness, you have lost the alertness. Then you are not here.\nThese methods do not belong to any religion. Remember, they are not Hindu, just as the theory of relativity is not Jewish because Einstein conceived it. And radio and television are not Christian. No one says, \"Why are you using electricity? This is Christian, because a Christian mind conceived it.\" Science does not belong to races and religions -- and tantra is a science. So remember, this is not Hindu at all. These techniques were conceived by Hindus, but these techniques are not Hindu. That is why these techniques will not mention any religious ritual. No temple is needed. You are quite enough of a temple yourself. You are the lab; the whole experiment is to go on within you. No belief is needed.\nThis is not religion, this is science. No belief is needed. It is not required to believe in the Koran or the Vedas or in Buddha or in Mahavira. No, no belief is needed. Only a daringness to experiment is enough, courage to experiment is enough; that is the beauty. A Mohammedan can practice and he will reach to the deeper meanings of the Koran. A Hindu can practice and he will for the first time know what the Vedas are. And a Jain can practice and a Buddhist can practice; they need not leave their religion.\nTantra will fulfill them, wherever they are. Tantra will be helpful, whatsoever their chosen path.\nSo remember this, tantra is pure science. You may be a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Parsee or whatsoever -- tantra doesn't touch your religion at all. Tantra says that religion is a social affair. So belong to any religion; it is irrelevant. But you can transform yourself, and that transformation needs a scientific methodology. When you are ill, when you have fallen ill or you have caught tuberculosis or anything, then whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan makes no difference. The tuberculosis remains indifferent to your Hinduism, to your Mohammedanism, to your beliefs -- political, social or religious. Tuberculosis has to be treated scientifically. There is no Hindu tuberculosis, no Mohammedan tuberculosis.\nYou are ignorant, you are in conflict, you are asleep. This is a disease, a spiritual disease.\nThis disease has to be treated by the tantra. You are irrelevant, your beliefs are irrelevant. It is just a coincidence that you are born somewhere and someone else is born somewhere else. This is just a coincidence. Your religion is a coincidence, so do not cling to it. Use some scientific methods to transform yourself.\nTantra is not very well known. And even if it is known, it is very much misunderstood. There are reasons for it. The higher and purer a science, the less is the possibility that the masses will know of it.\nWe have only heard the name of the theory of relativity. It used to be said that only twelve persons understood it when Einstein was alive. All over the world only one dozen minds could understand it. It was difficult even for Albert Einstein to make it understood to someone, to make it understandable, because it moves so high, it goes above your head. But it can be understood. A technical, mathematical knowledge is needed; a training is needed, and then it can be understood. But tantra is more difficult because no training will help. Only transformation can help.\nThat is why tantra could never become understood by the masses. And it always happens that when you cannot understand a thing, at least you will misunderstand, because then you can feel, \"Okay, I understand.\" You cannot simply remain in the vacuum.\nSecondly, when you cannot understand a thing, you begin to abuse it because it insults you. You cannot understand it! You? YOU cannot understand it? That is impossible. Something must be wrong with the thing itself. One begins to abuse, one begins to talk nonsense, and then he feels, \"Now it is okay.\"\nSo tantra was not understood; tantra was misunderstood. It was so deep and so high that this was natural. Secondly, because tantra moves beyond duality, the very standpoint is amoral. Please understand this word: 'moral', 'immoral', 'amoral'. We understand morality, we understand immorality, but it becomes difficult if something is amoral -- beyond both.\nTantra is amoral. Look at it in this way. A medicine is amoral; it is neither moral nor\nimmoral. If you give it to a thief it will help; if you give it to a saint it will help. It will make no differentiation between a thief and a saint. The medicine cannot say, \"This is a thief so I am going to kill him, and this is a saint so I am going to help him.\" A medicine is a scientific thing. Your being a thief or being a saint is irrelevant.\nTantra is amoral. Tantra says, no morality is needed -- no particular morality is needed. On the contrary, you are immoral because you have a very disturbed mind. So tantra cannot make a precondition, that first you become moral and then you can practice tantra. Tantra says, this is absurd.\nSomeone is ill, feverish, and the doctor comes and says, \"First bring down your fever; first be quite healthy. Only then can I give you the medicine.\" This is what is happening. One thief comes to a saint and he says, \"I am a thief. Tell me how to meditate.\" The saint says, \"First leave your profession. How can you meditate if you remain a thief?\"\nOne alcoholic comes and he says, \"I am an alcoholic. How can I meditate?\" The saint says, \"The first condition is, leave alcohol, only then can you meditate.\" The conditions become suicidal. The man is alcoholic or a thief or immoral because he has a disturbed mind, an ill mind.\nThese are the effects, the consequences of the diseased mind, and he is told, \"First be well and then you can meditate.\" But then who needs meditation? Meditation is\nmedicinal. It is a medicine.\nTantra is amoral. It doesn't ask you who you are. Your being a man is enough. Wherever you are, whatsoever you are, you are accepted.\nChoose a technique which fits you, put your total energy into it, and you will not be the same again. Real, authentic techniques always will be like that. If I make preconditions, it shows I have a pseudo technique -- I say, \"First do this and first do not do that, and then...\" And those are impossible conditions because a thief can change his objects, but be cannot become a non-thief.\nA greedy man can change the objects of his greed, but he cannot become non-greedy. You can force him or he can force upon himself non-greed, but it is also only because of a certain greed. If heaven is promised he may even try to be non-greedy. But this is greed par excellence. Heaven, MOKSHA -- liberation; SATCHITANANDA -- existence, consciousness, bliss, they will be the objects of his greed.\nTantra says, you cannot change man unless you give him authentic techniques with which to change. Just by preaching nothing is changed. And you can see this all over the world. Whatsoever tantra says is written all over the world -- so much preaching, so much moralizing, so many priests, preachers.\nThe whole world is filled with them, yet everything is so ugly and so immoral.\nWhy is this happening? The same will be the case if you give your hospitals to preachers. They will go there and they will start preaching. And they will make every ill man feel, \"You are guilty! You have created this disease; now change this disease.\" If preachers are given hospitals, what will be the condition of hospitals? The same as the condition of the whole world.\nPreachers go on preaching. They go on telling people, \"Don't be angry,\" without giving any technique. And we have heard this teaching for so long that we never even raise the question: \"What are you saying? I am angry and you simply say, `Don't be angry.' How is this possible? When I am angry it means `I' am anger, and you just tell me, `Don't be angry.' So I can only suppress myself.\"\nBut that will create more anger. That will create guilt -- because if I try to change and cannot change myself, that creates inferiority. It gives me a feeling of guilt, that I am incapable, I cannot win over my anger. No one can win! You need certain weapons, you need certain techniques, because your anger is just an indication of a disturbed mind.\nChange the disturbed mind and the indication will change. Anger is just showing what is within. Change the within and the without will change.\nSo tantra is not concerned with your so-called morality.\nReally, to emphasize morality is mean, degrading; it is inhuman. If someone comes to me and I say, \"Leave anger first, leave sex first, leave this and that,\" then I am inhuman.\nWhat I am saying is impossible. And that impossibility will make that man feel inwardly mean. He will begin to feel inferior; he will be degraded inside in his own eyes. If he tries the impossible, he is going to be a failure. And when he is a failure he will be convinced that he is a sinner.\nThe preachers have convinced the whole world that \"You are sinners.\" This is good for them, because unless you are convinced, their profession cannot continue. You must be sinners: only then can churches, temples and mosques continue to prosper. Your being in sin is their success. Your guilt is the base of all the highest churches. The more guilty you are, the more churches will go on rising higher and higher. They are built on your guilt,\non your sin, on your inferiority complex. Thus, they have created an inferior humanity. Tantra is not concerned with your so-called morality, your social formalities, etc. That doesn't mean that tantra says to be immoral -- no! Tantra is so much unconcerned with your morality that tantra cannot say to be immoral. Tantra gives you scientific techniques for changing the mind, and once the mind is different your character will be different.\nOnce the basis of your structure changes, your whole edifice will be different.\nBecause of this amoral attitude, tantra could not be tolerated by your so-called saints, they all went against it -- because if tantra succeeds, then all this nonsense which goes on in the name of religion will have to stop.\nSee this: Christianity fought very much against scientific progress. Why? Only because if scientific progress is there in the material world, then the time is not very far off when in the psychological and in the spiritual world also science will penetrate. So Christianity started fighting scientific progress, because once you know that you can change matter through technique, the time is not very far off when you will come to know that you can change mind through techniques -- because mind is nothing but subtle matter.\nThis is tantra's proposition, that mind is nothing but subtle matter; it can be changed. And once you have a different mind you have a different world, because you look through the mind. The world you are seeing, you are seeing because of a particular mind. Change the mind, and when you look there is a different world. And if there is no eind... that is the ultimate for tantra, to bring about a state where there is no mind. Then look at the world without a mediator. When the mediator is not, you are encountering the real, because now no one is between you and the real. Then nothing can be distorted.\nSo tantra says that when there is no mind, that is the state of a Bhairava -- a no-mind state.\nFor the farst time you look at the world, at that which is. If you have a mind, you go on CREATING a world; you go on imposing, projecting. So first change the mind, then change from mind to no-mind. And these one hundred and twelve methods can help each and everyone. Any particular method may not be of use to you. That is why Shiva goes on relating many methods. Choose any one method which suits you. It is not difficult to know which suits you.\nWe will try to understand each method and how to choose for yourself one method which can change you and your mind. This understanding, this intellectual understanding will be a basic necessity, but this is not the end. Whatsoever I talk about here, try it.\nReally, when you try the right method it clicks immediately. So I will go on talking about methods here every day. You try them. Just play with them -- go home and try. The right method, whenever you happen upon it, just clicks. Something explodes in you, and you know that \"This is the right method for me.\" But effort is needed, and you may be surprised that suddenly one day one method has gripped you.\nSo while I am talking here, parallel to it go on playing with these methods. I say playing because you should not be too serious. Just play! Something may fit you. If it fits you, then be serious, and then go deep into it -- intensely, honestly, with all your energy, with all your mind.\nBut before that just play.\nI have found that while you are playing your mind is more open. While you are serious your mind is not so open; it is closed. So just play. Do not be too serious, just play. And\nthese methods are simple, you can just play with them.\nTake one method and play with it for at least three days. If it gives you a certain feeling of affinity, if it gives you a certain feeling of well-being, if it gives you a certain feeling that this is for you, then be serious about it. Then forget the others, do not play with other methods. Stick to it -- at least for three months. Miracles are possible. The only thing is that the technique must be for you. If the technique is not for you, then nothing happens. Then you may go on with it for lives together, but nothing will happen. If the method is for you then even three minutes are enough.\nSo these one hundred and twelve methods can be a miraculous experience for you, or they may just be a listening -- it depends on you. I will go on describing each method from as many angles as possible. If you feel any affinity with it, play with it for three days. If you feel that it fits, that something clicks in you, continue it for three months. Life is a miracle. If you have not known its mystery, that only shows that you do not know the technique for how to approach it.\nShiva proposes one hundred and twelve methods.\nThese are all the methods possible. If nothing clicks and nothing gives you the feeling that this is for you, then there is no method left for you -- remember this. Then forget spirituality and be happy. Then it is not for you.\nBut these one hundred and twelve methods are for the whole humanity -- for all the ages that have passed and for all the ages that have yet to come. In no time has there ever been a single man, and there will never be one, who can say, \"These one hundred and twelve methods are all useless for me.\" Impossible! This is impossible!\nEvery type of mind has been taken into account. Every possible type of mind has been given a technique in tantra. There are many techniques for which no man exists yet; they are for the future. There are many techniques for which no man exists now; they are for the past. But do not be afraid. There are many methods which are for you.\nSo we will start this journey from tomorrow.

WHAT CONSTITUTES SEED?</p><p>WHO CENTERS THE UNIVERSAL WHEEL?</p><p>WHAT IS THIS LIFE BEYOND FORM PERVADING FORMS?</p><p>HOW MAY WE ENTER IT FULLY, ABOVE SPACE AND TIME, NAMES AND
DESCRIPTIONS?</p><p>LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED!</p><p>Some introductory points. First, the world of VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA
is not intellectual, it is not philosophical. Doctrine is meaningless to
it. It is concerned with method, with technique -- not with principles
at all. The word `tantra' means technique, the method, the path. So it
is not philosophical -- note this. It is not concerned with intellectual
problems and inquiries. It is not concerned with the "why" of things, it
is concerned with "how"; not with what is truth, but how the truth can
be attained.</p><p>TANTRA means technique. So this treatise is a scientific one. Science
is not concerned with why, science is concerned with how. That is the
basic difference between philosophy and science. Philosophy asks, "Why
this existence?" Science asks, "How this existence?" The moment you ask
the question, how?, method, technique, become important. Theories become
meaningless; experience becomes the center.</p><p>Tantra is science, tantra is not philosophy. To understand philosophy
is easy because only your intellect is required.</p><p>If you can understand language, if you can understand concept, you
can understand philosophy. You need not change; you require no
transformation. As you are, you can understand philosophy -- but not
tantra.</p><p>You will need a change... rather, a mutation. Unless YOU are
different tantra cannot be understood, because tantra is not an
intellectual proposition, it is an experience. Unless you are receptive,
ready, vulnerable to the experience, it is not going to come to you.</p><p>Philosophy is concerned with the mind. Your head is enough; your
totality is not required. Tantra needs you in your totality. It is a
deeper challenge. You will have to be in it wholly. It is not
fragmentary. A different approach, a different attitude, a different
mind to receive it is required. Because of this, Devi is asking
apparently philosophical questions. Tantra starts with Devi's questions.
All the questions can be tackled philosophically.</p><p>Really, any question can be tackled in two ways: philosophically or
totally, antellectually or existentially. For example, if someone asks,
"What is love?" you can tackle it intellectually, you can discuss, you
can propose theories, you can argue for a particular hypothesis. You can
create a system, a doctrine -- and you may not have known love at
all.</p><p>To create a doctrine, experience is not needed. Really, on the
contrary, the less you know the better because then you can propose a
system unhesitatingly.</p><p>Only a blind man can easily define what light is. When you do not
know you are bold. Ignorance is always bold; knowledge hesitates. And
the more you know, the more you feel that the ground underneath is
dissolving. The more you know, the more you feel how ignorant you are.
And those who are really wise, they become ignorant. They become as
simple as children, or as simple as idiots.</p><p>The less you know, the better. To be philosophical, to be dogmatic,
to be doctrinaire -- this is easy. To tackle a problem intellectually is
very easy. But to tackle a problem existentially -- not just to think
about it, but to live it through, to go through it, to allow yourself to
be transformed through it -- is difficult. That is, to know love one
will have to be in love. That is dangerous because you will not remain
the same. The experience is going to change you. The moment you enter
love, you enter a different person. And when you come out you will not
be able to recognize your old face; it will not belong to you. A
discontinuity will have happened. Now there is a gap, the old man is
dead and the new man has come. That is what is known as rebirth -- being
twice-born.</p><p>Tantra is non-philosophical and existential. So of course Devi asks
questions which appear to be philosophical, but Shiva is not going to
answer them that way. So it is better to understand it in the beginning;
otherwise you will be puzzled, because Shiva is not going to answer a
single question.</p><p>All the questions that Devi is asking, Shiva is not going to answer
at all. And still he answers! And really, only he has answered them and
no one else -- but on a different plane.</p><p>Devi asks, "What is your reality, my lord?" He is not going to answer
it. On the contrary, he will give a technique. And if Devi goes through
this technique, she will know. So the answer is round-about; it is not
direct. He is not going to answer "Who am I." He will give a technique
-- do it and you will know.</p><p>For tantra, doing is knowing, and there is no other knowing. Unless
you do something, unless you change, unless you have a different
perspective to look at, to look with, unless you move in an altogether
different dimension than the intellect, there is no answer.</p><p>Answers can be given -- they are all lies. All philosophies are lies.
You ask a question and the philosophy gives you an answer. It satisfies
you or doesn't satisfy you. If it satisfies you, you become a convert to
the philosophy, but you remain the same. If it doesn't satisfy you, you
go on searching for some other philosophy to be converted to. But you
remain the same; you are not touched at all, you are not changed.</p><p>So whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian or a Jain,
it makes no difference. The real person behind the facade of a Hindu or
a Mohammedan or a Christian is the same. Only words differ, or
clothes.</p><p>The man who is going to the church or to the temple or to the mosque
is the same man. Only faces differ, and they are faces which are false;
they are masks. Behind the masks you will find the same man -- the same
anger, the same aggression, the same violence, the same greed, the same
lust -- everything the same. Is Mohammedan sexuality different from
Hindu sexuality? Is Christian violence different from Hindu violence? It
is the same! The reality remains the same; only clothes differ.</p><p>Tantra is not concerned with your clothes, tantra is concerned with
you. If you ask a question it shows where you are. It shows also that
wherever you are you cannot see; that is why there is the question. A
blind man asks, "What is light?" and philosophy will start answering
what is light. Tantra will know only this: if a man is asking "What is
light?" it</p><p>shows only that he is blind. Tantra will start operating on the man,
changing the man, so that he can see. Tantra will not say what is light.
Tantra will tell how to attain insight, how to attain seeing, how to
attain vision. When the vision is there, the answer will be there.
Tantra will not give you the answer; tantra will give you the technique
to attain the answer.</p><p>Now, this answer is not going to be intellectual. If you say
something about light to a blind man, this is intellectual. If the blind
man himself becomes capable of seeing, this is existential.</p><p>This is what I mean when I say that tantra is existential. So Shiva
is not going to answer Devi's questions, still, he will answer -- the
first thing.</p><p>The second thing: this is a different type of language. You must know
something about it before we enter into it. All the tantra treatises are
dialogues between Shiva and Devi.</p><p>Devi questions and Shiva answers. All the tantra treatises start that
way. Why? Why this method? It is very significant. It is not a dialogue
between a teacher and a disciple, it is a dialogue between two lovers.
And tantra signifies through it a very meaningful thing: that the deeper
teachings cannot be given unless there is love between the two -- the
disciple and the master. The disciple and master must become deep
lovers. Only then can the higher, the beyond, be expressed.</p><p>So it is a language of love; the disciple must be in an attitude of
love. But not only this, because friends can be lovers. Tantra says a
disciple moves as receptivity, so the disciple must be in a feminine
receptivity; only then is something possible. You need not be a woman to
be a disciple, but you need to be in a feminine attitude of receptivity.
When Devi asks, it means the feminine attitude asks. Why this emphasis
on the feminine attitude?</p><p>Man and woman are not only physically different, they are
psychologically different. Sex is not only a difference in the body; it
is a difference in psychologies also.</p><p>A feminine mind means receptivity -- total receptivity, surrender,
love. A disciple needs a feminine psychology; otherwise he will not be
able to learn. You can ask, but if you are not open then you cannot be
answered. You can ask a question and still remain closed.</p><p>Then the answer cannot penetrate you. Your doors are closed; you are
dead. You are not open.</p><p>A feminine receptivity means a womb-like receptivity in the inner
depth, so that you can receive. And not only that -- much more is
implied. A woman is not only receiving something, the moment she
receives it, it becomes a part of her body. A child is received. A woman
conceives; the moment there is conception, the child has become part of
the feminine body. It is not alien, it is not foreign. It has been
absorbed. Now the child will live not as something added to the mother,
but just as a part, just as the mother. And the child is not only
received: the feminine body becomes creative; the child begins to grow.
A disciple needs a womb-like receptivity. Whatsoever is received is not
to be gathered as dead knowledge. It must grow in you; it must become
blood and bones in you. It must become a part, now. It must grow! This
growth will change you, will transform you -- the receiver. That is why
tantra uses this device. Every treatise starts with Devi asking a
question and Shiva replying to it. Devi is Shiva's consort, his feminine
part.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more. Now modern psychology, depth psychology particularly,
says that</p><p>man is both man and woman. No one is just male and no one is just
female; everyone is bi-sexual. Both sexes are there. This is a very
recent research in the West, but for tantra this has been one of the
most basic concepts for thousands of years. You must have seen some
pictures of Shiva as ARDHANARISHWAR -- half man, half woman. There is no
other concept like it in the whole history of man. Shiva is depicted as
half man, half woman.</p><p>So Devi is not just a consort, she is Shiva's other half. And unless
a disciple becomes the other half of the master it is impossible to
convey the higher teachings, the esoteric methods. When you become one
then there is no doubt. When you are one with the master -- so totally
one, so deeply one -- there is no argument, no logic, no reason. One
simply absorbs; one becomes a womb. And then the teaching begins to grow
in you and change you.</p><p>That is why tantra is written in love language. Something must also
be understood about love language. There are two types of language:
logical language and love language.</p><p>There are basic differences between the two.</p><p>Logical language is aggressive, argumentative, violent. If I use
logical language I become aggressive upon your mind. I try to convince
you, to convert you, to make a puppet of you.</p><p>My argument is "right" and you are "wrong." Logical language is
egocentric: "I am right and you are wrong, so I must prove that I am
right and you are wrong." I am not concerned with you, I am concerned
with my ego. My ego is always "right."</p><p>Love language is totally different. I am not concerned with my ego; I
am concerned with you. I am not concerned to prove something, to
strengthen my ego. I am concerned to help you. It is a compassion to
help you to grow, to help you to transform, to help you to be
reborn.</p><p>Secondly, logic will always be intellectual. Concepts and principles
will be significant, arguments will be significant. With love language
what is said is not so significant; rather, it is the way it is said.
The container, the word is not important; the content, the message is
more important. It is a heart-to-heart talk, not a mind-to-mind
discussion. It is not a debate, it is a communion.</p><p>So this is rare: Devi is sitting in the lap of Shiva and asking, and
Shiva answers. It is a love dialogue -- no conflict, as if Shiva is
speaking to himself. Why this emphasis on love</p><p>-- love language? Because if you are in love with your master, then
the whole gestalt changes; it becomes different. Then you are not
hearing his words. Then you are drinking him. Then words are irrelevant.
Really, the silence between the words becomes more significant. What he
is saying may be meaningful or it may not be meaningful.</p><p>.. but it is his eyes, his gestures, his compassion, his love.</p><p>That is why tantra has a fixed device, a structure. Every treatise
starts with Devi asking and Shiva answering. No argument is going to be
there, no wastage of words. There are very simple statements of fact,
telegraphic messages with no view to convince, but just to relate.</p><p>If you encounter Shiva with a question with a closed mind, he will
not answer you in this way. First your closedness has to be broken. Then
he will have to be aggressive. Then your prejudices, then your
preconceptions have to be destroyed. Unless you are cleared completely
of your past, nothing can be given to you. But this is not so with his
consort Devi; with Devi there is no past.</p><p>Remember, when you are deeply in love your mind ceases to be. There
is no past; only the present moment becomes everything. When you are in
love the present is the only time, the now is all -- no past, no future.
So Devi is just open. There is no defense -- nothing to be cleared,
nothing to be destroyed. The ground is ready, only a seed has to be
dropped. The ground is not only ready, but welcoming, receptive, asking
to be impregnated.</p><p>So all these sayings that we are going to discuss will be
telegraphic. They are just sutras, but each sutra, each telegraphic
message given by Shiva is worth a Veda, worth a Bible, worth a Koran.
Each single sentence can become the base of a great scripture.</p><p>Scriptures are logical -- you have to propose, defend, argue. Here
there is no argument, just simple statements of love.</p><p>Thirdly, the very words VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA mean the technique of
going beyond consciousness. VIGYANA means consciousness, BHAIRAVA means
the state which is beyond consciousness, and TANTRA means the method:
the method of going beyond consciousness. This is the supreme doctrine
-- without any doctrine.</p><p>We are unconscious, so all the religious teachings are concerned with
how to go beyond unconsciousness, how to be conscious. For example,
Krishnamurti, Zen, they are all concerned with how to create more
consciousness, because we are unconscious. So how to be more aware,
alert? From unconsciousness, how to move toward consciousness?</p><p>But tantra says that this is a duality -- unconscious and conscious.
If you move from unconsciousness to consciousness, you are moving from
one duality to another. Move beyond both! Unless you move beyond both
you can never reach the ultimate, so be neither the unconscious nor the
conscious; just go beyond, just be. Be neither the conscious nor the
unconscious -- just BE! This is going beyond yoga, going beyond Zen,
going beyond all teachings.</p><p>'Vigyana' means consciousness, and 'bhairava' is a specific term, a
tantra term for one who has gone beyond. That is why Shiva is known as
Bhairava and Devi is known as Bhairavi -- those who have gone beyond the
dualities.</p><p><br></p><p>In our experience only love can give a glimpse. That is why love
becomes the very basic device to impart tantric wisdom. In our
experience we can say that only love is something which goes beyond
duality. When two persons are in love, the deeper they move into it, the
less and less they are two, the more and more they become one. And a
point comes and a peak is reached when only apparently they are two.
Inwardly they are one; the duality is transcended.</p><p>Only in this sense does Jesus' saying that "God is love" become
meaningful; otherwise not. In our experience love is nearest to God. It
is not that God is loving, as Christians go on interpreting -- that God
has a fatherly love for you. Nonsense! "God is love" is a tantric
statement. It means love is the only reality in our experience which
reaches nearest to God, to the divine. Why? Because in love oneness is
felt. Bodies remain two, but something beyond the bodies merges and
becomes one.</p><p>That is why there is so much hankering after sex. The real hankering
is after oneness, but that oneness is not sexual. In sex two bodies have
only a deceptive feeling of becoming one, but they are not one, they are
only joined together. But for a single moment two bodies forget
themselves in each other, and a certain physical oneness is felt. This
hankering is not bad, but to stop at it is dangerous. This hankering
shows a deeper urge to</p><p>feel oneness.</p><p><br></p><p>In love, on a higher plane, the inner one moves, merges into the
other, and there is a feeling of oneness. Duality dissolves. Only in
this non-dual love can we have a glimpse of what is the state of a
Bhairava. We may say that the state of a Bhairava is absolute love with
no coming back, from the peak of love there is no falling back. It is
remaining on the peak.</p><p>We have made Shiva's abode on Kailash. That is simply symbolic: it is
the highest peak, the holiest peak. We have made it Shiva's abode. We
can go there but we will have to come down, it cannot be our abode. We
can go on a pilgrimage. It is a TEERTHYATRA</p><p>-- a pilgrimage, a journey. We can touch for a single moment the
highest peak; then we will have to come back.</p><p>In love this holy pilgrimage happens, but not for all because almost
no one moves beyond sex. So we go on living in the valley, the dark
valley. Sometimes someone moves to the peak of love, but then he falls
back because it is so dizzying. It is so high and you are so low,. and
it is so difficult to live there. Those who have loved, they know how
difficult it is to be constantly in love. One has to come back again and
again. It is Shiva's abode. He lives there; it is his home.</p><p>A Bhairava lives in love; that is his abode. When I say that is his
abode, I mean now he is not even aware of love -- because if you live on
Kailash you will not be aware that this is Kailash, this is a peak.</p><p>The peak becomes a plain. Shiva is not aware of love. We are aware of
love because we live in non-love. And because of the contrast we feel
love. Shiva IS love. The state of Bhairava means that one has become
love, not loving; one has become LOVE, one lives on the peak. The peak
has become his abode.</p><p>How to make this highest peak possible: beyond duality, beyond
unconsciousness, beyond consciousness, beyond the body and beyond the
soul, beyond the world and beyond the so-called MOKSHA -- liberation?
How to reach this peak? The technique is tantra. But tantra is pure
technique, so it is going to be difficult to understand. First let us
understand the questions, what Devi is asking.</p><p>OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Why this question? You can also ask
this question, but it will not carry the same meaning. So try to
understand why Devi asks, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Devi is in deep love.
When you are in deep love, for the first time you encounter the inner
reality. Then Shiva is not the form, then Shiva is not the body. When
you are in love, the body of the beloved falls away, disappears. The
form is no more and the formless is revealed. You are facing an abyss.
That is why we are so afraid of love. We can face a body, we can face a
face, we can face a form, but we are afraid of facing an abyss.</p><p>If you love someone, if you really love, his body is bound to
disappear.</p><p>In some moments of climax, of peak, the form will dissolve, and
through the beloved you will enter the formless. That is why we are
afraid -- it is falling into a bottomless abyss. So this question is not
just a simple curiosity: OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? Devi must have
fallen in love with the form. Things start that way. She must have loved
this man as a man, and now when the love has come of age, when the love
has flowered,</p><p>this man has disappeared. He has become formless. Now he is to be
found nowhere. OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? It is a question asked in
a very intense love moment. And when questions are raised, they become
different according to the mind in which they are asked.</p><p>So create the situation, the milieu of the question in your mind.
Devi must be at a loss -- Shiva has disappeared. When love reaches its
peak the lover disappears. Why does this happen? This happens because
really, everyone is formless. You are not a body. You move as a body,
you live as a body, but you are not a body. When we see someone from the
outside, he is a body. Love penetrates within. Then we are not seeing
the person from the outside. Love can see a person as the person can see
himself from within. Then the form disappears.</p><p>A Zen monk, Rinzai, attained his enlightenment, and the first thing
he asked was, "Where is my body? Where has my body gone?" And he began
to search.</p><p>He called his disciples and said, "Go and find out where my body is.
I have lost my body."</p><p>He had entered the formless. You are also a formless existence, but
you know yourself not directly, but from others' eyes. You know through
the mirror. Sometime, while looking in the mirror, close your eyes and
then think, meditate: if there was no mirror, how could you have known
your face? If there was no mirror, there would have been no face. You do
not have a face; mirrors give you faces. Think of a world where there
are no mirrors. You are alone -- no mirror at all, not even others' eyes
working as mirrors. You are alone on a lonely island; nothing can mirror
you. Then will you have any face? Or will you have any body? You cannot
have one. You do not have one at all. We know ourselves only through
others, and the others can only know the outer form. That is why we
become identified with it.</p><p>Another Zen mystic, Hui-Hai used to say to his disciples, "When you
have lost your head meditating, come immediately to me. When you lose
your head, come immediately to me. When you begin to feel there is no
head, do not be afraid; come immediately to me. This is the right
moment. Now something can be taught to you." With a head, no teaching is
possible. The head always comes in between.</p><p>Devi asks Shiva, OH SHIVA, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? -- who are you? The
form has disappeared; hence the question.</p><p>In love you enter the other as himself. It is not you answering. You
become one, and for the first time you know an abyss -- a formless
presence.</p><p>That is why for centuries together, centuries and centuries, we were
not making any sculptures, any pictures of Shiva. We were only making
SHIVALINGA -- the symbol. The Shivalinga is just a formless form. When
you love someone, when you enter someone, he becomes just a luminous
presence. The Shivalinga is just a luminous presence, just an aura of
light.</p><p>That is why Devi asks, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY?</p><p>WHAT IS THIS WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE? We know the universe, but we
never know it as wonder-filled. Children know, lovers know. Sometimes
poets and madmen know. We do not know that the world is wonder-filled.
Everything is just repetitive -- no wonder, no poetry, just flat prose.
It doesn't create a song in you; it doesn't create a dance in you; it
doesn't give birth to the poetry inside. The whole universe looks
mechanical.</p><p>Children look at it with wonder-filled eyes. When the eyes are
wonder-filled, the universe is wonder-filled.</p><p>When you are in love, you again become like children. Jesus says,
"Only those who are like children will enter my kingdom of God." Why?
Because if the universe is not a wonder, you cannot be religious. The
universe can be explained -- then your approach is scientific. The
universe is either known or unknown, but that which is unknown can be
known any day; it is not unknowable.</p><p>The universe becomes unknowable, a mystery, only when your eyes are
wonder-filled. Devi says, WHAT IS THIS WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE? Suddenly
there is the jump from a personal question to a very impersonal one. She
was asking, WHAT IS YOUR REALITY? and then suddenly, WHAT IS THIS
WONDER-FILLED UNIVERSE?</p><p>When form disappears, your beloved becomes the universe, the
formless, the infinite. Suddenly Devi becomes aware that she is not
asking a question about Shiva; she is asking a question about the whole
universe. Now Shiva has become the whole universe. Now all the stars are
moving in him, and the whole firmament and the whole space is surrounded
by him. Now he is the great engulfing factor -- "the great
encompassing." Karl Jaspers has defined God as "the great
encompassing."</p><p>When you enter into love, into a deep, intimate world of love, the
person disappears, the form disappears, and the lover becomes just a
door to the universe. Your curiosity can be a scientific one -- then you
have to approach through logic. Then you must not think of the formless.
Then beware of the formless; then remain content with the form. Science
is always concerned with the form. If anything formless is proposed to a
scientific mind, he will cut it into form -- unless it takes a form it
is meaningless. First give it a form, a definite form; only then does
the inquiry start.</p><p>In love, if there is form then there is no end to it.</p><p>Dissolve the form! When things become formless, dizzy, without
boundaries, every thing entering another, the whole universe becoming a
oneness, then only is it a wonder-filled universe.</p><p>WHAT CONSTITUTES SEED? Then Devi goes on. From the universe she goes
on to ask, WHAT CONSTITUTES SEED? This formless, wonder-filled universe,
from where does it come? From where does it originate? Or does it NOT
originate? What is the seed?</p><p>WHO CENTERS THE UNIVERSAL WHEEL? asks Devi. This wheel goes on moving
and moving -- this great change, this constant flux. But who centers
this wheel? Where is the axis, the center, the unmoving center?</p><p>She doesn't stop for any answer. She goes on asking as if she is not
asking anyone, as if talking to herself.</p><p>WHAT IS THIS LIFE BEYOND FORM PERVADING FORMS?</p><p>HOW MAY WE ENTER IT FULLY, ABOVE SPACE AND TIME, NAMES AND
DESCRIPTION?</p><p>LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED. The emphasis is not on questions but on
doubts: LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED! This is very significant. If you are
asking an intellectual question, you are asking for a definite answer so
that your problem is solved.</p><p>But Devi says, LET MY DOUBTS BE CLEARED. She is not really asking
about answers. She is asking for a transformation of her mind, because a
doubting mind will remain a doubting mind whatsoever answers are given.
Note it: a doubting mind will remain a doubting mind.</p><p>Answers are irrelevant. If I give you one answer and you have a
doubting mind, you will doubt it. If I give you another answer, you will
doubt that also. You have a doubting mind. A doubting mind means you
will put a question mark to anything.</p><p>So answers are useless. You ask me, "Who created the world?" and I
tell you "A" created the world. Then you are bound to ask, "Who created
'A'?" So the real problem is not how to answer questions. The real
problem is how to change the doubting mind, how to create a mind which
is not doubting -- or, which is trustful. So Devi says, LET MY DOUBTS BE
CLEARED.</p><p>Two or three things more. When you ask a question, you may be asking
for many</p><p>reasons. One may be just this, that you want a confirmation. You
already know the answer, you have the answer, you just want it to be
confirmed that your answer is right. Then your question is false,
pseudo; it is not a question. You may be asking a question not because
you are ready to change yourself, but just as a curiosity.</p><p>The mind goes on questioning. In the mind questions come as leaves
come on a tree. That is the very nature of the mind -- to question. So
it goes on questioning. It matters not what you are questioning, with
anything given to the mind it will create a question. It is a machine to
grind out, to create questions. So give it anything and it will cut it
into pieces and create many questions.</p><p>One question answered, and the mind will create many questions from
the answer. This has been the whole history of philosophy.</p><p>Bertrand Russell remembers that when he was a child he thought that
one day, when he will be mature enough to understand all philosophy, all
questions will be answered. Then later, when he was eighty, he said,
"Now I can say that my own questions are there standing, as they were
standing when I was a child. No other questions have come up because of
these theories of philosophy." So he said, "When I was young I used to
say, philosophy is an inquiry for ultimate answers. Now I cannot say it.
It is an inquiry for endless questions."</p><p>So one question creates one answer and many questions. The doubting
mind is the problem. Devi says, "Do not be concerned with my questions.
I have asked so many things: What is your reality? What is this
wonder-filled universe? What constitutes seed? Who centers the universal
wheel? What is life beyond form? How can we enter it fully above time
and space? But do not be concerned with my questions. Let my doubts be
cleared. I ask these questions because they are in my mind. I ask them
just to show you my mind, but do not pay much attention to them. Really,
answers will not fulfill my need. My need is. let my doubts be
cleared."</p><p>But how can the doubts be cleared? Will any answer do? Is there any
answer which will clear your doubts? Mind IS the doubt.</p><p>It is not that the mind doubts, mind is the doubt! Unless the mind
dissolves, doubts cannot be cleared.</p><p>Shiva will answer. His answers are techniques -- the oldest, most
ancient techniques. But you can call them the latest also because
nothing can be added to them. They are</p><p>complete -- one hundred and twelve techniques. They have taken in all
the possibilities, all the ways of cleaning the mind, transcending the
mind. Not a single method could be added to Shiva's one hundred and
twelve methods. And this book, VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA, is five thousand
years old. Nothing can be added; there is no possibility to add
anything. It is exhaustive, complete. It is the most ancient and yet the
latest, yet the newest. Old like old hills -- the methods seem eternal
-- and they are new like a dewdrop before the sun, because they are so
fresh.</p><p>These one hundred and twelve methods of meditation constitute the
whole science of transforming mind. We will enter them one by one. We
will try to comprehend first intellectually. But use your intellect only
as an instrument, not as a master. Use it as an instrument to understand
something, but do not go on creating barriers with it. When we will be
talking about these techniques, just put aside your past knowledge, your
knowing, whatsoever information you have collected. Put them aside --
they are just dust gathered on the road.</p><p>Encounter these methods with a fresh mind -- with alertness, of
course, but not with argumentation.</p><p>And do not create the fallacy that an argumentative mind is an alert
mind. It is not, because the moment you move into arguments you have
lost the awareness, you have lost the alertness. Then you are not
here.</p><p>These methods do not belong to any religion. Remember, they are not
Hindu, just as the theory of relativity is not Jewish because Einstein
conceived it. And radio and television are not Christian. No one says,
"Why are you using electricity? This is Christian, because a Christian
mind conceived it." Science does not belong to races and religions --
and tantra is a science. So remember, this is not Hindu at all. These
techniques were conceived by Hindus, but these techniques are not Hindu.
That is why these techniques will not mention any religious ritual. No
temple is needed. You are quite enough of a temple yourself. You are the
lab; the whole experiment is to go on within you. No belief is
needed.</p><p>This is not religion, this is science. No belief is needed. It is not
required to believe in the Koran or the Vedas or in Buddha or in
Mahavira. No, no belief is needed. Only a daringness to experiment is
enough, courage to experiment is enough; that is the beauty. A
Mohammedan can practice and he will reach to the deeper meanings of the
Koran. A Hindu can practice and he will for the first time know what the
Vedas are. And a Jain can practice and a Buddhist can practice; they
need not leave their religion.</p><p>Tantra will fulfill them, wherever they are. Tantra will be helpful,
whatsoever their chosen path.</p><p>So remember this, tantra is pure science. You may be a Hindu or a
Mohammedan or a Parsee or whatsoever -- tantra doesn't touch your
religion at all. Tantra says that religion is a social affair. So belong
to any religion; it is irrelevant. But you can transform yourself, and
that transformation needs a scientific methodology. When you are ill,
when you have fallen ill or you have caught tuberculosis or anything,
then whether you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan makes no difference. The
tuberculosis remains indifferent to your Hinduism, to your
Mohammedanism, to your beliefs -- political, social or religious.
Tuberculosis has to be treated scientifically. There is no Hindu
tuberculosis, no Mohammedan tuberculosis.</p><p>You are ignorant, you are in conflict, you are asleep. This is a
disease, a spiritual disease.</p><p>This disease has to be treated by the tantra. You are irrelevant,
your beliefs are irrelevant. It is just a coincidence that you are born
somewhere and someone else is born somewhere else. This is just a
coincidence. Your religion is a coincidence, so do not cling to it. Use
some scientific methods to transform yourself.</p><p>Tantra is not very well known. And even if it is known, it is very
much misunderstood. There are reasons for it. The higher and purer a
science, the less is the possibility that the masses will know of
it.</p><p>We have only heard the name of the theory of relativity. It used to
be said that only twelve persons understood it when Einstein was alive.
All over the world only one dozen minds could understand it. It was
difficult even for Albert Einstein to make it understood to someone, to
make it understandable, because it moves so high, it goes above your
head. But it can be understood. A technical, mathematical knowledge is
needed; a training is needed, and then it can be understood. But tantra
is more difficult because no training will help. Only transformation can
help.</p><p>That is why tantra could never become understood by the masses. And
it always happens that when you cannot understand a thing, at least you
will misunderstand, because then you can feel, "Okay, I understand." You
cannot simply remain in the vacuum.</p><p>Secondly, when you cannot understand a thing, you begin to abuse it
because it insults you. You cannot understand it! You? YOU cannot
understand it? That is impossible. Something must be wrong with the
thing itself. One begins to abuse, one begins to talk nonsense, and then
he feels, "Now it is okay."</p><p>So tantra was not understood; tantra was misunderstood. It was so
deep and so high that this was natural. Secondly, because tantra moves
beyond duality, the very standpoint is amoral. Please understand this
word: 'moral', 'immoral', 'amoral'. We understand morality, we
understand immorality, but it becomes difficult if something is amoral
-- beyond both.</p><p><br></p><p>Tantra is amoral. Look at it in this way. A medicine is amoral; it is
neither moral nor</p><p>immoral. If you give it to a thief it will help; if you give it to a
saint it will help. It will make no differentiation between a thief and
a saint. The medicine cannot say, "This is a thief so I am going to kill
him, and this is a saint so I am going to help him." A medicine is a
scientific thing. Your being a thief or being a saint is irrelevant.</p><p>Tantra is amoral. Tantra says, no morality is needed -- no particular
morality is needed. On the contrary, you are immoral because you have a
very disturbed mind. So tantra cannot make a precondition, that first
you become moral and then you can practice tantra. Tantra says, this is
absurd.</p><p>Someone is ill, feverish, and the doctor comes and says, "First bring
down your fever; first be quite healthy. Only then can I give you the
medicine." This is what is happening. One thief comes to a saint and he
says, "I am a thief. Tell me how to meditate." The saint says, "First
leave your profession. How can you meditate if you remain a thief?"</p><p>One alcoholic comes and he says, "I am an alcoholic. How can I
meditate?" The saint says, "The first condition is, leave alcohol, only
then can you meditate." The conditions become suicidal. The man is
alcoholic or a thief or immoral because he has a disturbed mind, an ill
mind.</p><p>These are the effects, the consequences of the diseased mind, and he
is told, "First be well and then you can meditate." But then who needs
meditation? Meditation is</p><p>medicinal. It is a medicine.</p><p>Tantra is amoral. It doesn't ask you who you are. Your being a man is
enough. Wherever you are, whatsoever you are, you are accepted.</p><p>Choose a technique which fits you, put your total energy into it, and
you will not be the same again. Real, authentic techniques always will
be like that. If I make preconditions, it shows I have a pseudo
technique -- I say, "First do this and first do not do that, and
then..." And those are impossible conditions because a thief can change
his objects, but be cannot become a non-thief.</p><p>A greedy man can change the objects of his greed, but he cannot
become non-greedy. You can force him or he can force upon himself
non-greed, but it is also only because of a certain greed. If heaven is
promised he may even try to be non-greedy. But this is greed par
excellence. Heaven, MOKSHA -- liberation; SATCHITANANDA -- existence,
consciousness, bliss, they will be the objects of his greed.</p><p>Tantra says, you cannot change man unless you give him authentic
techniques with which to change. Just by preaching nothing is changed.
And you can see this all over the world. Whatsoever tantra says is
written all over the world -- so much preaching, so much moralizing, so
many priests, preachers.</p><p>The whole world is filled with them, yet everything is so ugly and so
immoral.</p><p>Why is this happening? The same will be the case if you give your
hospitals to preachers. They will go there and they will start
preaching. And they will make every ill man feel, "You are guilty! You
have created this disease; now change this disease." If preachers are
given hospitals, what will be the condition of hospitals? The same as
the condition of the whole world.</p><p>Preachers go on preaching. They go on telling people, "Don't be
angry," without giving any technique. And we have heard this teaching
for so long that we never even raise the question: "What are you saying?
I am angry and you simply say, `Don't be angry.' How is this possible?
When I am angry it means `I' am anger, and you just tell me, `Don't be
angry.' So I can only suppress myself."</p><p>But that will create more anger. That will create guilt -- because if
I try to change and cannot change myself, that creates inferiority. It
gives me a feeling of guilt, that I am incapable, I cannot win over my
anger. No one can win! You need certain weapons, you need certain
techniques, because your anger is just an indication of a disturbed
mind.</p><p>Change the disturbed mind and the indication will change. Anger is
just showing what is within. Change the within and the without will
change.</p><p>So tantra is not concerned with your so-called morality.</p><p>Really, to emphasize morality is mean, degrading; it is inhuman. If
someone comes to me and I say, "Leave anger first, leave sex first,
leave this and that," then I am inhuman.</p><p>What I am saying is impossible. And that impossibility will make that
man feel inwardly mean. He will begin to feel inferior; he will be
degraded inside in his own eyes. If he tries the impossible, he is going
to be a failure. And when he is a failure he will be convinced that he
is a sinner.</p><p>The preachers have convinced the whole world that "You are sinners."
This is good for them, because unless you are convinced, their
profession cannot continue. You must be sinners: only then can churches,
temples and mosques continue to prosper. Your being in sin is their
success. Your guilt is the base of all the highest churches. The more
guilty you are, the more churches will go on rising higher and higher.
They are built on your guilt,</p><p>on your sin, on your inferiority complex. Thus, they have created an
inferior humanity. Tantra is not concerned with your so-called morality,
your social formalities, etc. That doesn't mean that tantra says to be
immoral -- no! Tantra is so much unconcerned with your morality that
tantra cannot say to be immoral. Tantra gives you scientific techniques
for changing the mind, and once the mind is different your character
will be different.</p><p>Once the basis of your structure changes, your whole edifice will be
different.</p><p>Because of this amoral attitude, tantra could not be tolerated by
your so-called saints, they all went against it -- because if tantra
succeeds, then all this nonsense which goes on in the name of religion
will have to stop.</p><p>See this: Christianity fought very much against scientific progress.
Why? Only because if scientific progress is there in the material world,
then the time is not very far off when in the psychological and in the
spiritual world also science will penetrate. So Christianity started
fighting scientific progress, because once you know that you can change
matter through technique, the time is not very far off when you will
come to know that you can change mind through techniques -- because mind
is nothing but subtle matter.</p><p>This is tantra's proposition, that mind is nothing but subtle matter;
it can be changed. And once you have a different mind you have a
different world, because you look through the mind. The world you are
seeing, you are seeing because of a particular mind. Change the mind,
and when you look there is a different world. And if there is no eind...
that is the ultimate for tantra, to bring about a state where there is
no mind. Then look at the world without a mediator. When the mediator is
not, you are encountering the real, because now no one is between you
and the real. Then nothing can be distorted.</p><p>So tantra says that when there is no mind, that is the state of a
Bhairava -- a no-mind state.</p><p>For the farst time you look at the world, at that which is. If you
have a mind, you go on CREATING a world; you go on imposing, projecting.
So first change the mind, then change from mind to no-mind. And these
one hundred and twelve methods can help each and everyone. Any
particular method may not be of use to you. That is why Shiva goes on
relating many methods. Choose any one method which suits you. It is not
difficult to know which suits you.</p><p>We will try to understand each method and how to choose for yourself
one method which can change you and your mind. This understanding, this
intellectual understanding will be a basic necessity, but this is not
the end. Whatsoever I talk about here, try it.</p><p>Really, when you try the right method it clicks immediately. So I
will go on talking about methods here every day. You try them. Just play
with them -- go home and try. The right method, whenever you happen upon
it, just clicks. Something explodes in you, and you know that "This is
the right method for me." But effort is needed, and you may be surprised
that suddenly one day one method has gripped you.</p><p>So while I am talking here, parallel to it go on playing with these
methods. I say playing because you should not be too serious. Just play!
Something may fit you. If it fits you, then be serious, and then go deep
into it -- intensely, honestly, with all your energy, with all your
mind.</p><p>But before that just play.</p><p>I have found that while you are playing your mind is more open. While
you are serious your mind is not so open; it is closed. So just play. Do
not be too serious, just play. And</p><p>these methods are simple, you can just play with them.</p><p>Take one method and play with it for at least three days. If it gives
you a certain feeling of affinity, if it gives you a certain feeling of
well-being, if it gives you a certain feeling that this is for you, then
be serious about it. Then forget the others, do not play with other
methods. Stick to it -- at least for three months. Miracles are
possible. The only thing is that the technique must be for you. If the
technique is not for you, then nothing happens. Then you may go on with
it for lives together, but nothing will happen. If the method is for you
then even three minutes are enough.</p><p>So these one hundred and twelve methods can be a miraculous
experience for you, or they may just be a listening -- it depends on
you. I will go on describing each method from as many angles as
possible. If you feel any affinity with it, play with it for three days.
If you feel that it fits, that something clicks in you, continue it for
three months. Life is a miracle. If you have not known its mystery, that
only shows that you do not know the technique for how to approach
it.</p><p>Shiva proposes one hundred and twelve methods.</p><p>These are all the methods possible. If nothing clicks and nothing
gives you the feeling that this is for you, then there is no method left
for you -- remember this. Then forget spirituality and be happy. Then it
is not for you.</p><p>But these one hundred and twelve methods are for the whole humanity
-- for all the ages that have passed and for all the ages that have yet
to come. In no time has there ever been a single man, and there will
never be one, who can say, "These one hundred and twelve methods are all
useless for me." Impossible! This is impossible!</p><p>Every type of mind has been taken into account. Every possible type
of mind has been given a technique in tantra. There are many techniques
for which no man exists yet; they are for the future. There are many
techniques for which no man exists now; they are for the past. But do
not be afraid. There are many methods which are for you.</p><p>So we will start this journey from tomorrow. THE END.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

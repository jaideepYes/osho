ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS SOUND, ALL SOUNDS.\nTantra is not a philosophy. Rather, it is a science with one difference: science is objective, tantra is subjective. But still, it is a science and not a philosophy. Philosophy thinks about the truth, the unknown, the ultimate; science tries to discover what is.\nScience enters the immediate; philosophy thinks of the ultimate. Philosophy is always looking toward the sky; science is more down to earth.\nTantra is not concerned with the ultimate. It is concerned with the immediate, the here and now. Tantra says, the ultimate is hidden in the immediate, so you need not worry about the ultimate. By worrying about the ultimate you will miss the immediate, and the ultimate is hidden in the immediate. So by thinking about the ultimate you will miss both. If the immediate should be missed, because of it you will miss the ultimate also. So philosophy is just smoke. The approach of tantra is scientific, but the OBJECT is different from that of so-called science.\nScience tries to understand the object, the objective world, the reality that is before your eyes. Tantra is the science of the reality that is behind your eyes, the subjectivity, but the approach is scientific.\nTantra doesn't believe in thinking, it believes in experimenting, in experiencing. And unless you can experience, everything is just a wastage of energy.\nI am reminded of one incident. Mulla Nasruddin was crossing a street. Just in front of a church he was knocked down by a hit-and-run driver. He was an old man, and a crowd gathered. Someone was saying that \"That man cannot survive.\" The priest of the church ran out. He came near and he found out that the old man was just going to die, so he prepared to administer the last rites. He came near and asked the dying Mulla, \"Do you believe in God the Father? Do you believe in God the Son? Do you believe in God the Holy Ghost?\" Mulla opened his eyes and said, \"My God! I am dying and he is asking me puzzles!\"\nAll philosophy is like this: it is asking puzzles while you are dying. Every moment you are dying, every moment everyone is on his deathbed - because death can occur at any moment. But philosophy goes on asking and answering puzzles. Tantra says, it is good for children to philosophize but those who are wise will not waste their time in philosophy. They should try to know - not to think, because through thinking there is no knowledge. Through thinking you go on webbing words, creating patterns of words. It leads nowhere, you remain the same -- no transformation, no new insights. The old man just goes on gathering dust.\nKnowing is a different phenomenon. It does not mean \"thinking about,\" it means going deep into the existence itself in order to know, moving into the existence. Remember this,\nthat tantra is not a philosophy. It is science - a subjective science. The approach is scientific and non-philosophic. It is very down to earth, concerned with the immediate. The immediate is to be used as a door to the ultimate, the ultimate happens if you enter the immediate. It is there, and there is no other way to reach to it.\nPhilosophy is not a way in the eyes of tantra. It is a false way! It only appears that this is a way. It is a door which is not; it simply appears to be a door. It is a false door. The moment you try to enter it you come to know that you cannot enter, it is just a painted door, there is no door in reality. Philosophy is a painted door. If you sit by its side and go on thinking and thinking, it is good. If you try to enter it, it is a wall.\nSo every philosophy is good for philosophizing. For experiencing, every philosophy is impotent. That is why there is so much insistence on technique in tantra - SO MUCH insistence on technique, because a science can do nothing but give technology, whether of the outside world or of the inside. The very word `tantra' means technique. The very word `tantra' MEANS technique! That is why, in this small and yet one of the greatest and deepest books, only techniques are given, no philosophy, just one hundred and twelve techniques to reach the ultimate through the immediate.\nThe ninth technique concerning sound:\nSILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN \"AH.\" THEN IN THE \"HH,\" EFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY.\nSILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN \"AH \" Any word that ends in \"AH\" --\nintone it silently. Emphasis should be given to the ending \"AH.\" Why? Because the moment this sound \"AH\" is intoned, your breath goes out. You may not have observed it, but now you can observe: whenever your breath goes out you are more silent, and whenever your breath comes in you are more tense - because the outgoing breath is death and the incoming breath is life. Tension is part of life, not of death. Relaxation is part of death; death means total relaxation. Life cannot be totally relaxed; it is impossible.\nLife means tension, effort. Only death is relaxed. So whenever a person becomes absolutely relaxed, he is both - alive outwardly and dead within. You can see in the face of a buddha both life and death simultaneously. That is why there is so much silence and calm, they are part of death. Life is not relaxation. You relax in the night when you are asleep. That is why the old traditions say that death and sleep are similar. Sleep is a temporary death and death is permanent sleep. That is why night relaxes you, it is the outgoing breath. The morning is the incoming breath.\nThe day makes you tense and the night relaxes you. Light makes you tense, darkness relaxes you.\nThat is why you cannot sleep when there is light, it is difficult to relax because light is similar to life: it is anti-death. Darkness is similar to death: it is pro-death.\nSo darkness has deep relaxation in it, and those who are afraid of darkness cannot relax... impossible, because every relaxation is dark. And darkness surrounds your life on both the sides. Before you are born you are in darkness; when life ceases you are again in darkness. Darkness is infinite, and this light and this life is just a moment in it, just a wave arising and then falling back. If you can remember the darkness that surrounds both the ends, you will be relaxed here and now.\nLife, death - they both are two sides of existence. The incoming breath is life, the\noutgoing breath is death. So it is not that you die someday, you are dying with every breath. That is why the Hindus have been counting life in breaths, they do not count life in years. Tantra, yoga, all the old Indian systems, they count life in breaths: how many breaths you are going to live. So they say if you breathe very fast, with too much breathing in a short time, you will die very soon. If you breathe very slowly and your breaths are less in an interval, you will live very long. And this is so.\nIf you go and observe animals, those animals whose breathing is very slow live long. Take the elephant: the elephant lives long; the breath is very slow.\nThen there is the dog: the dog dies soon; the breath is very fast. Whenever you find an animal in which the breath is fast, any animal, the animal will not have a long life. A long life is always with slow breath.\nTantra and yoga and other Indian systems count your life in breaths. Really, with every breath you are born and with every breath you are dying. This mantra, this technique, uses the outgoing breath as the method, the medium, the vehicle, to go deep into silence. It is a death method. INTONE SILENTLY A WORD ENDING IN \"AH.\" The breath has gone -- that is why a word ending in \"AH.\"\nThis AH is meaningful because when you say AH it completely empties you. The whole breath has moved out; nothing remains within. You are totally empty - empty and dead. For a single moment, for a very small interval, life has moved out of you. You are dead - empty. This emptiness, if realized, if you can become aware of it, will change you completely. You will be a different man.\nThen you will know well that this life is not your life and this death is also not your death. Then you will know something which is beyond the incoming and outgoing breath\n- the witnessing soul. And this witnessing can happen easily when you are empty of breath, because life has subsided and with it all tensions have subsided. So try it, it is a very beautiful method. But the ordinary process, the ordinary habit, is to emphasize the incoming breath, never the outgoing breath.\nWe always take the breath in. We ALWAYS take it in, but we never throw it out. We take it in and THE BODY throws it out. Observe your breathing and you will know. We take it in. We never exhale, we only inhale. The exhaling is done by the body because we are afraid of death, that is the reason. If it was in our power we would not exhale at all, we would inhale and then control it within. No one emphasizes exhaling -- inhaling is emphasized. Because we HAVE to do exhaling after inhaling, that is why we go on \"suffering\" it. We tolerate it because we cannot inhale without exhaling.\nSo exhaling is accepted as a necessary evil, but basically we are not interested in exhaling. And this is not only about breath, this is our whole attitude toward life. We cling to everything that comes to us; we will not leave it. This is the miserliness of the mind.\nAnd remember, there are many implications in it. If you are suffering from constipation, this will be the basic cause: you always inhale and never exhale. The mind which never exhales but just inhales will suffer from constipation. The constipation is the other end of the same thing. He cannot exhale anything, he goes on accumulating, he is afraid. The fear is there. He can only accumulate, but anything that is accumulated becomes poisonous.\nIf you only inhale and do not exhale, your very breath becomes poison to you; you will\ndie because of it.\nYou can turn a life-giving force into poison if you behave in a miserly way, because the exhaling is absolutely necessary. It throws all the poisons out of you.\nSo really, death is a purifying process and life is a poisoning process. This will look paradoxical. Life is a poisoning process because to live you have to use many things - and the moment you have used them they turn into poison, they are converted into poisons. You take a breath in, you use oxygen, and then what remains becomes poison. It was life only because it was oxygen, but you have used it. So life goes on changing everything into a poison.\nNow there is a great movement in the West - ecology. Man has been using everything and turning it into poison, and the very Earth is just on the verge of dying. Any day it can die because we have turned everything into poison. Death is a purifying process. When your whole body has become poisonous, death will relieve you of the body. It will renew you, it will give you a new birth; a new body will be given to you. Through death all the accumulated poisons are dissolved back into nature. You are given a new mechanism.\nAnd this happens with every breath. The outgoing breath is similar to death -- it takes poisons out. And when it is going out, everything ebbs within. If you can throw the whole breath out, completely out so that no breath remains within, you touch a point of silence that can never be touched while the breath is in.\nIt is just like the ebb and tide: with every breath a tide of life comes to you; with every exhalation, everything ebbs - the tide has gone. You are just a vacant, empty shore. This is the use of this technique. SILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN \"AH.\" Emphasize the exhaling breath. And you can use it for many changes in the mind. If you are suffering from constipation, forget intaking. Just exhale and do not inhale. Let the body do the work of inhaling; you just do the work of exhaling. You force the breath out and do not inhale. The body will inhale by itself; you need not worry about it, you are not going to die. The body will take breath in, you just throw it out and let the body take it in. Your constipation will go.\nIf you are suffering from heart disease, just exhale, do not inhale. Then you will not suffer from heart disease. If while just going upwards on a staircase, or anywhere, you feel tired - very much tired, suffocated, breathless - simply do this: just exhale, do not inhale. Then you can climb up any amount of steps and you will not be tired. What happens? When you go with an emphasis on exhaling, you are ready to let go, you are ready to die. You are not afraid of death; that makes you open. Otherwise you are closed\n-- fear closes you.\nWhen you exhale, the whole system changes and accepts death. There is no fear, you are ready to die. And one who is ready to die can live.\nReally, only one who is ready to die can live. He alone becomes capable of life - because he is not afraid.\nOne who accepts death, welcomes it, receives it as a guest, lives with it, goes deep into life. Exhale, do not inhale, and that will change your total mind. Because of simple techniques tantra never appeals, because we think, \"My mind is such a complex thing.\" It is not complex - just foolish. And fools are very complex. A wise man is simple. Nothing is complex in your mind, it is a very simple mechanism. If you understand, you can\nchange it very easily.\nIf you have not seen anybody dying, if you have been protected from seeing death as Buddha was protected, you cannot understand anything about it. Buddha's father was afraid because some astrologer said that \"This boy is going to be a great sannyasin. He will renounce the world.\" The father asked, \"What is to be done to protect him from doing such a thing?\" So those astrologers thought and thought, and then they concluded and they said, \"Do not allow him to see death, because if he is not aware of death he will never think of renouncing life.\"\nThis is beautiful - very meaningful. That means all religion, all philosophy, all tantra and yoga, is basically death-oriented. If you are aware of death, only then does religion become meaningful. That is why no animal except man is religious, because no animal is aware of death.\nThey die, but they are not aware. They cannot conceive or imagine that there is going to be death.\nWhen one dog dies, other dogs never imagine that death is going to happen to them also. Always someone else dies, so how can a dog imagine that \"I am going to die\"? He has never seen himself dying. Someone else, some other dog dies, so how can he connect that \"I am going to die\"? No animal is aware of death; that is why no animal renounces. No animal can become a sannyasin. Only a very high quality of consciousness can lead you to renounce - when you become aware of death. And if even by being a man you are not aware of death, you belong to the animal kingdom; you are not yet a man. You become a man only when you encounter death. Otherwise there is no difference between you and the animal.\nEverything is similar; only death makes the difference. With death encountered, you are no more animal, something has happened to you which never happens to an animal. Now you will be a different consciousness.\nSo Buddha's father protected him from seeing any type of death - not only man's death, but the death of animals and even of flowers. So the gardeners were instructed not to allow the child to see a dead flower, a pale flower dying on the branch, a pale leaf, a dry leaf. No, nowhere should he come to realize that something dies -- he may infer from it that \"I am going to die.\"\nAnd you do not infer it even seeing your wife dying, your mother, your father, your child. You weep for them, but you never conceive that this is a sign that \"I am going to die.\" But the astrologers said, \"The boy is very, very sensitive, so protect him from any type of death.\" And the father was over-conscientious He would not allow even an old man or an old woman to be seen, because oldness is just death heard from a distance; death is there from a distance, just coming. So Buddha's father would not allow any old man or old woman to be seen by the child. If Buddha suddenly became aware that just by stopping the breath a man could die, it would be very difficult for him. \"Just because no breath is coming in, how can a man die?\" he would wonder. \"Life is such a big, complex process.\" If you have not seen anyone dying, even you cannot conceive that just by stopping the breath a man will die. Just by stopping the breath? Such a simple thing! And how can such a complex life die?\nIt is the same with these methods. They look simple, but they touch the basic reality. When the breath is going out, when you are completely emptied of life, you touch death: you are just near it, and everything becomes calm and silent within you.\nUse it as a mantra. Whenever you feel tired, whenever you feel tense, use any word which ends in \"AH.\" \"Allah\" will do - any word that brings your total breath out so that you exhale completely and you are emptied of breath.\nThe moment you are emptied of breath you are emptied of life also. And all your problems belong to life: no problem belongs to death. Your anxiety, your anguish, your anger, your sadness, they all belong to life.\nDeath is non-problematic. Death never gives any problem to anyone. And even if you think that \"I am afraid of death and death creates a problem,\" it is not death that creates the problem but your clinging to life. Only life creates problems; death dissolves all problems. So when the breath has moved completely out, \"AH,\" you are emptied of life. Look within at that moment when the breath is completely out. Before taking another breath in, go deep down in that interval and become aware of the inside calm, the silence. In that moment you are a buddha.\nIf you can catch that moment, you have known a taste of what Buddha might have known. And once known, you can detach this taste from the incoming-outgoing breath. Then the breath can go on coming in, going out, and you can remain in that quality of consciousness that you have come to know. It is always there; one has just to discover it. And it is easier to discover when life is emptied out.\nSILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN \"AH.\" THEN IN THE \"HH,\"\nEFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY. And when the breath goes out, \"HH,\" everything is emptied. EFFORTLESSLY: in this moment, there is no need to make any effort.\nThe SPONTANEITY: just be aware, be spontaneous, be sensitive, and realize this moment of death.\nIn this moment you are just near the door, just near the door!- very, very near to the ultimate. The immediate has moved out, the superfluous has moved out. In this moment you are not the wave: you are the ocean - just near, just near! If you can become aware you will forget that you are a wave. Again the wave will come, but now you can never be identified with it, you will remain the ocean. Once you have known that you are the ocean, you can never again be the wave.\nLife is waves... death is the ocean. That is why Buddha so much insists about his NIRVANA that it is death-like. He never says you will attain life immortal, he says you will simply die totally. Jesus says, \"Come to me and I will give you life, and life abundant.\" Buddha says, \"Come to me to realize your death. I will give you death totally.\" And both mean the same thing, but Buddha's terminology is more basic. But you will become afraid of it. That is why Buddha had no appeal in India; he was uprooted completely. And we go on saying that this land is a religious land, but the most religious person couldn't get roots here.\nWhat type of religious land is this? We have not produced another Buddha; he is incomparable. And whenever the world thinks India to be religious, the world remembers Buddha - no one else.\nBecause of Buddha, India is thought to be religious. What type of religious land is this? Buddha has no roots here; he was totally uprooted. He used the language of death - that is the cause, and brahmins were using the language of life. They say THE BRAHMAN and he says NIRVANA: `Brahman' means life -- life, infinite life; and `Nirvana' means just\ncessation, death - total death.\nBuddha says, \"Your ordinary death is not total; you will be born again. It is NOT total! You will be born again! I will give you a total death, and you will never be born again.\" A total death means now no birth is possible. So this so-called death, Buddha says, is not death. It is just a rest period, you will become alive again. It is just a breath gone out.\nYou will take the breath in again, you will be reborn. Buddha says, \"I will give you the way so that the breath will go out and will never come in again - total death, nirvana, cessation.\"\nWe become afraid because we cling to life. But this is the paradox: the more you cling to life, the more you will die, and the more you are ready to die, then the more you become deathless. If you are ready to die, then there is no possibility of death. No one can give you death if you accept it, because through that acceptance you become aware of something within you which is deathless.\nThis incoming breath and outgoing breath are the life and death of the body, not of \"me.\"\nBut \"I\" do not know anything other than the body; \"I\" am identified with the body. Then it will be difficult to be aware when the breath comes in, easy to be aware when the breath goes out. When the breath is going out, for that moment you have become old, dying, emptied completely of the breath; you are dead for a moment.\nIN THE \"HH,\" EFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY. Try it! Any moment you can try it. Just riding in a bus or traveling in a train or moving to the office, whenever you have time intone a sound like \"Allah\" - any sound ending with \"AH.\" This \"Allah\" helped so much in Islam - not because of any Allah there in the sky, but because of this \"AH.\" This word is beautiful. And then the more one goes on using this word \"Allah, Allah...\" it becomes reduced. Then what remains is \"Lah, Lah...\" Then it is reduced further; then it remains as \"Ah, Ah...\" It is good, but you can use any word that ends in \"AH\" - or just \"AH\" will do.\nHave you observed that whenever you are tense you will sigh -- \"AH\" -- and you will feel relaxed. Or whenever you are in joy, overjoyed, you say \"AH,\" and the whole breath is thrown out and you feel within a tranquility that you have never felt. Try this: when you are feeling very good, take the breath in and then see what you feel. You cannot feel that well-being that comes with \"AH.\" It is coming because of the breath.\nSo languages differ, but these two things never differ.\nAll over the world, whenever someone feels tired he will say \"AH.\" Really, he is calling for death to come and relax him. Whenever one feels overjoyed, blissful, he says \"AH.\" He is so overfilled with joy that he is not afraid of death now. He can relieve himself completely, relax completely.\nAnd what will happen if you go on trying it, trying it? You will become fully aware of something within you - the spontaneousness of your being; of SAHAJ of being spontaneous. That you are already, but you are too much engaged with life, too much occupied with life. You cannot become aware of the being which is behind.\nWhen you are not occupied with life, with the incoming breath, the being behind is revealed; there is a glimpse. But the glimpse will become, by and by, a realization. And once it is known you cannot forget it - and this is not something which you are creating. That is why it is spontaneous: it is not something you are creating. It is there, you have simply forgotten. It is a remembrance! It is a rediscovery!\nTry to see children, very small children, taking their breaths. They take them in a\ndifferent way. Look at a child sleeping. His belly comes up and down, not the chest. If you are sleeping and you are being observed, your chest comes up and down; your breath never goes down to the belly. The breath can go down to the belly only if you exhale and do not inhale.\nIf you inhale and do not exhale, the breath cannot go down to the belly. The reason why breath goes to the belly is that when one exhales, the whole breath is thrown out and then the BODY takes it in. And the body takes only that amount which is needed -- never more, never less.\nThe body has its own wisdom, and it is more wise than you. Do not disturb it. You can take more -- then it will be disturbed. You can take less -- then it will be disturbed. The body has its own wisdom, it only takes that amount which is needed. When more is needed, it creates the situation. When less is needed, it creates the situation. It never goes to the extreme, it is always balanced. But if YOU inhale it is never balanced, because you do not know what you are doing, you do not know what is the need of the body. And the need changes every moment.\nAllow the body! You just exhale, you just throw it out, and then the body will take breath in - and it will take it deeply and slowly, and the breath will go down to the belly. It will hit the navel point exactly and your belly will go up and down. If you inhale then really, you never exhale totally. Then the breath is in and you go on inhaling, so the breath which is already in will not allow your breath to go down to the very bottom. Then just shallow breathing happens. You go on taking breath in, and the poisonous breath is there, filling you up.\nThey say that you have six thousand sacs in your lungs and only two thousand are touched by your breath. The four thousand are always filled with poisonous gases which need to be exhaled, and that two-thirds portion of your chest creates much anxiety, much anguish and misery in the mind, in the body. A child exhales, he never inhales. Inhaling is done by the body itself.\nWhen the child is born, the first thing he is going to do is cry. With that cry his throat opens, with that cry comes the first \"AH.\" The oxygen and air that had been given by the mother is exhaled. This is his first effort with breathing. That is why if a child is not crying, then the doctor will become uneasy, because he has not shown the sign of life. He still feels dependent on the mother. He must cry! That cry shows that now he is becoming an individual; the mother is not needed, he will take his own breath. And the first thing is that he is going to cry in order to exhale that which was given by the mother, and then his body will start functioning, inhaling.\nA child is always exhaling, and when the child starts inhaling, when the emphasis moves to inhaling, be aware. He has already become old; he has learned things from you. He has become tense. Whenever you are tense, you cannot take a deep breath. Why? Your stomach becomes rigid. Whenever you are tense your stomach becomes rigid, it won't allow breath to go down.\nThen you have to take shallow breaths.\nTry with \"AH.\" It has a beautiful feeling around it. Whenever you feel tired, \"AH\" -- throw the breath. And make it a point to emphasize exhaling. You will be a different man, and a different mind will evolve. With the emphasis on breathing in, you have\ndeveloped a miser mind and a miser body. With exhaling, that miserliness will disappear and with it many problems. Possessiveness will disappear.\nSo tantra will not say leave possessiveness. Tantra says, change your system of breathing; you cannot possess then. Observe your own breathing and your moods, and you will become aware. Whatsoever is wrong is always associated with the emphasis that is given to the incoming breath and whatsoever is good, virtuous, beautiful, true, is always associated with exhaling. Whenever you are speaking a lie, you will hold your breath in. Whenever you speak truth, you never hold the breath. You fear that \"I am speaking a lie,\" so you hold the breath. You are afraid something may go out with it - the out-moving breath. Your hidden truth may be revealed, so you are afraid.\nGo on trying this \"AH\" more and more. You will be more healthy in body, more healthy in mind, and a different quality of calm, at-easeness, tranquillity will develop.\nThe tenth sound method:\nSTOPPING EARS BY PRESSING AND RECTUM BY CONTRACTING, ENTER THE SOUND.\nWe are not aware of the body even or how the body functions and what is its tao, what is its way. But if you observe, then you can become very easily aware. If you stop your ears and pull your rectum up, contract your rectum, everything will stop for you. It will be as if the whole world has become non-moving - as if everything has become static, stopped. Not only movements, you will feel as if time has stopped.\nWhat happens when you pull the rectum up, contract it? What happens? When both the ears are closed simultaneously, with closed ears you will hear a sound within. But if the rectum is not pulled up, that sound is released by the rectum. That sound is very subtle. If the rectum is pulled up, contracted, and the ears are closed, you will see within you a pillar of sound - and that sound is of silence. It is a negative sound. When all sounds have ceased, then you feel the sound of silence or the sound of soundlessness. But it will be released from the rectum.\nSo close the ears and pull the rectum up. Then you are closed from both the sides, and your body becomes closed and just filled with sound. This feeling of being filled with sound gives a deep fulfillment. So we will have to understand many things around it, only then will it become possible for you to have the feeling of what happens.\nWe are not aware of the body -- that is one of the basic problems for a seeker.\nAnd the society is against becoming aware of the body because society is afraid of the body. So we train every child not to be aware of the body, we make every child insensitive. We create a distance between the child's mind and body, so he is not very much aware of the body, because body awareness will create problems for the society. Many things are implied. If the child is aware of the body, he will become aware of sex sooner or later. And if he is too much aware of the body, he will feel too much sexual, sensuous. So we have to kill the very root. He should be \"made dull\" about his body, insensitive, so he never feels it. You do not feel your body. You feel it only when something wrong happens, when something goes wrong.\nYou have a headache in the head, then you feel your head. Some thorn is there, then you feel your leg, your feet. When your body aches, you feel that you have a body. You feel it only when something goes wrong, and then too not right away. You are never aware of\nyour diseases immediately. You become aware only when a period has passed and when the disease goes on knocking at your consciousness that, \"I am here.\" Only then do you become aware. So no one really goes to the doctor in time. Everyone reaches there late, when the disease has entered deep and has done much wrong.\nIf a child has grown up with sensitivity he will become aware of the disease even before the disease happens.\nAnd now, in Russia particularly, they are working on the theory that a disease can be known even six months before its happening if someone is very deeply sensitive about his body, because subtle changes start long in advance. They prepare the body for the disease. The impact is felt even six months before.\nBut never mind disease, we never become aware even of death! If you are going to die tomorrow, you are not aware even today. A thing like death which may happen the next moment, and you are not aware this moment. You are totally dead to your body, insensitive. This whole society, the whole culture up to now, creates this dullness, this deadness, because it has been against the body. You are not allowed to feel it. Only in accidents can you be pardoned, forgiven for being aware of it; otherwise \"do not be aware of the body.\"\nThis creates many problems, particularly for tantra, because tantra believes in deep sensitivity and knowledge of the body. You go on moving and your body goes on doing many things and you are unaware. Now much work is being done on body language. The body has its own language, and psychiatrists and psychologists and psychoanalysts in particular are being trained for body language, because they say you cannot believe the modern man. Whatsoever he says cannot be believed. Rather, one must observe his body, that will give a more true clue.\nA man enters a psychiatrist's office. The old psychiatry, Freudian psychoanalysis, will talk and talk with the man to bring out whatsoever is hidden in his mind. Modern psychiatry will observe his body because that gives clues. If a man is an egoist, if ego is his problem, he stands in a different way than a humble man. His neck has a different angle than a humble man, his spine is not flexible but dead, fixed. He looks wooden, not alive. If you touch his body it has a wooden feeling, not the warmth of a living body. He is like a soldier just moving to the front.\nLook at the soldier moving to the front. He has a wooden shape, a wooden feeling, and that is needed by a soldier because he is going to die or to kill. He must not be much aware of the body, so his whole training is to create a wooden body. Soldiers marching look like toys, like dead toys marching.\nIf you are humble you have a different body; you sit differently you stand differently. If you feel inferior, you stand differently; if you feel superior you stand differently. If you are always in fear, you stand in such a way as if you are protecting yourself from some unknown force. That is always there. If you are not afraid, you are just like a child playing with his mother; there is no fear. Wherever you go you are unafraid, at home with the universe around you. The man who is afraid is armored.\nAnd when I say armored it is not only symbolically, physiologically he is armored. Wilhelm Reich was working very much on body structure, and he came to see some deep associations between mind and body. If a man is afraid, his stomach is not flexible. You\ntouch his stomach and it is like a stone. If he becomes fearless, his stomach relaxes immediately. Or if you relax the stomach, then the fear disappears. Massage the stomach to relax, and you will feel more fearless, less afraid.\nA person who is loving has a different quality of body and warmth -- he is warm bodily. A person who is not loving is cold, physiologically he is cold. Cold and other things have moved into your body and they have become barriers, they do not allow you to know about your body. But the body goes on working in its own way and you go on working in your own way -- a rift is created. That rift has to be broken.\nI have seen that if someone is suppressive, if you have suppressed your anger, then your fingers, your hands, have the sensation of a suppressed anger. And a person who knows how to feel it can feel just by touching your hand that you have suppressed anger. And why in the hand? Because anger has to be released by the hands. If you have suppressed anger then in your teeth, in your gums, it is suppressed - and it can be felt by touching. It gives a vibration that \"I am suppressed here.\"\nIf you have suppressed sex, then in your erotic zones it is there. If a person has suppressed sex, then if you touch his erotic zones you can feel it. With any erotic zone touched, sex is there if it has been suppressed. The zone will become afraid and will withdraw from your touch, it will not be open. Because the person inside is withdrawing, the part of the body will withdraw. It will not allow you to bring about an opening.\nNow they say that fifty percent of women are frigid, and the reason is because we teach girls to be more suppressive than boys. So they have suppressed, and when a girl suppresses her sexual feelings up to the age of twenty, it has become a long habit - twenty years of suppression. Then when she will love, she will talk about love, but her body will not be open; the body will be closed. And then an opposite, a diametrically opposite phenomenon happens: two currents oppose each other. She wants to love but her body is repressive, the body withdraws; it is not ready to come closer.\nIf you see a woman sitting with a man, if the woman loves the man she will be inclining toward him, the body will be inclining. If they are sitting on a sofa, both of their bodies will be inclining toward each other. They are not aware, but you can see it. If the woman is afraid of the man, her body will be inclining to the opposite direction. If a woman loves a man she will never cross her legs when sitting near him.\nIf she is afraid of the man she will cross her legs. She is not aware; this is not done consciously. It is body armor. The body protects itself and works in its own ways. Tantra became aware of this phenomenon; the first awareness of such deep body feeling, sensitivity, was with tantra. And tantra says that if you can use your body consciously, the body becomes the vehicle to move to the spirit. Tantra says, it is foolish, absolutely idiotic, to be against the body. Use it! It is a vehicle! And use its energy in such a way that you can go beyond it.\nNow, STOPPING EARS BY PRESSING AND RECTUM BY CONTRACTING,\nENTER THE SOUND. Many times you have been contracting the rectum and sometimes the rectum is released even without your consciousness. If you suddenly become afraid, the rectum is released. You may defecate in fear, you may urinate in fear. Then you cannot control it. If a sudden fear grips you, your bladder will relax, your rectum will relax. What happens? In fear, what happens? Fear is a mental thing, so why do you urinate in fear? Why is the control lost? There must be some deep connecting root.\nFear happens in the head, in the mind. When you are unafraid this never happens. The child really has no mental control over his body. No animal controls his urine, bladder or anything. Whenever the bladder is full it is released. No animal controls it, but man has to control it of necessity.\nSo we force a child to control when he should go to the bathroom and when not. We tell him he has to control; we give timings. So the mind takes over the control of a function which is non-voluntary. That is why it is so difficult to train the child for the toilet. And now psychologists say that if we stop toilet training, humanity will very much improve. Toilet training is the first repression of the child and its natural spontaneity, but it seems difficult to listen to these psychologists. We cannot listen to them because then the children will create many problems. We have to train them of necessity. Only a very, very rich, affluent society will be able not to bother. Poor societies have to manage. We cannot afford it. If the child urinates anywhere, we cannot afford it. If he urinates on the sofa we cannot afford it, so we have to train. This training is mental. The body really has no built-in program for it. The body has NO built-in program for it!\nMan is an animal as far as body is concerned, and the body knows no culture, no society. That is why when you are in deep fear, the control mechanism that you have imposed on the body is relaxed. You are not in control; you are thrown off control. You can control only in normal conditions. In emergencies you cannot control because for emergencies you have never been trained. You have only been trained for the normal, day-to-day, routine world.\nIn an emergency the control is lost, your body starts functioning in its own animal way. But one relationship can be understood, that with a fearless man this will never happen. So this has become a sign of a coward.\nIf in fear you urinate or defecate, this shows you are a coward. A fearless man will not behave in this way, because a fearless man is taking deep breaths. His body and his breathing system are related; there is no gap. With a man who is a coward there is a gap, and because of that gap he is always overburdened with urine and defecation. So whenever an emergency comes, that overburdenedness has to be thrown: he has to be unburdened. And it has a reason in nature. A coward who is unburdened can escape more easily with his stomach relaxed, can run more easily. A burdened stomach will become a hindrance, so it is helpful for a coward to be relaxed.\nWhy am I talking about this? I am just saying this, that you have to be aware of your mental processes and your stomach processes; they are deeply related. Psychologists say that fifty to ninety percent of your dreams are because of your stomach processes. If you have taken a very heavy meal you are bound to see nightmares. They are not related with the mind, it is just that the heavy stomach creates them.\nMany dreams can be created by outside tricks. If you are sleeping, your hands can be crossed on your chest and immediately you will start dreaming some nightmare.\nA pillow can be put on your chest and you will dream that some demon is sitting on your chest just going to kill you. And this has been one of the problems. Why is there such a burden from the small weight of a pillow? If you are awake, there is no weight; you do not feel anything heavy. But why is it that a small pillow placed on you in the night when you are sleeping is felt as being so heavy that it is as if you have been burdened with a big stone or a rock? Why is so much weight felt?\nThe reason is this: when you are aware, when you are awake, your mind and body are not correlated; the gap is there. You cannot feel the body and its sensitivity. While asleep, the control, the culture, the conditioning, dissolves; you have again become a child and your body has become sensitive. Because of that sensitivity, a small pillow is felt as a rock. It is magnified because of sensitivity -- the sensitivity magnifies it. So body-mind processes are deeply related, and if you know what happens you can use this.\nRectum closed, pulled upwards, contracted, creates a situation in the body in which sound can be felt if present. You will feel a pillar of sound in silence within the closed space in your body. Close the ears and pull up the rectum, and then just remain with what is happening inside you. Just remain in that vacant state which is created by these two things. Your life energy is moving within and it has no way to go out.\nSound goes out either from your ears or from your rectum. Those are the two doors from where the sound can move out. If is not moving out, you can feel it more easily.\nAnd what will happen when you feel this inner sound? With the very phenomenon of hearing the inner sound, your thoughts dissolve. Just try it anytime during the day: just pull up the rectum and put your fingers in the ears. Press the ears and pull up the rectum. You will feel that your mind has stopped. It will not be functioning; thoughts will have stopped. That constant flow of thoughts is not there. It is good! And if one goes on doing it whenever there is time, in the day if you can do it for five or six times, within three or four months you will become an expert in it. And then such a well-being flows out of it! And the inner sound, once heard, remains with you. Then you can hear it the whole day. The market is noisy, the road is noisy, the traffic is noisy, but if even in that noise you have heard the inner sound, you will feel the still small voice that goes on inside. And then nothing will disturb you. If you can feel your inner sound, then nothing from the outside can disturb you. You remain silent; whatsoever happens around you makes no difference.\nThe last sound technique:\nENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS SOUND, ALL SOUNDS.\nYour own name can be used as a mantra very easily, and it is very helpful because your name has gone very deep into your unconscious.\nNothing else has gone so deep. If we are all are sitting here, and we all fall asleep and someone comes and calls \"Ram,\" no one will listen except the person whose name is Ram. He will listen to it; he will be disturbed in his sleep. No one else will listen to the sound \"Ram,\" but why does this man listen? It has gone down deep; it is not conscious now, it has become unconscious.\nYour name has gone very deep within you, but there is a very beautiful phenomenon about your name: you never call it, others call it. Others use it; you never use it.\nI have heard that in the first world war, for the first time in America rationing was created. Thomas Edison was a very great scientist, but he was very poor so he had to stand in the queue for his ration card. And he was such a great man that no one ever used his name before him. There was no need to use his name for himself, and no one else would use his name because he was so much respected. Everyone would call him Professor, so he had forgotten what was his name.\nHe was standing in the queue, and when his name was called, when it was asked who\nThomas Alva Edison was, he just stared blankly. Again the name was called, then someone who was a neighbor to Edison said to him, \"Why are you standing? Your name is being called. It is your name, Professor.\" Then he became aware and he said, \"But how can I recognize it? No one calls me Edison.\nIt has been so long... they just call me Professor.\"\nYou never use your own name. Only others use it -- you have heard it used by others. But it has gone deep, very deep. It has penetrated like an arrow into your unconscious. If you yourself use it, then it becomes a mantra. And for two reasons it helps: one, when you use your own name, if your name is \"Ram\" and you use \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\", suddenly you feel as if you are using someone else's name - as if it is not yours. Or if you feel that this IS yours, you feel that there is a separate entity within you which is using it. It may belong to the body, it may belong to the mind, but he who is calling \"Ram, Ram...\" becomes a witness.\nYou have always called others' names. When you call your own name it looks as if it belongs to someone else, not to you, and it is a very revealing phenomenon. You can become a witness to your own name, and with the name your whole life is involved. Separated from the name, you are separated from your whole life. And this name has penetrated deep within you because everyone has called you this from your very birth, you have always heard this. So use this sound, and with this sound you can go to the very depths to which the name has gone.\nIn the old days we gave everyone a name of God - everyone. Someone was Ram, someone was Narayan, someone was Krishna, someone was Vishnu, or something like that.\nThey say all the Mohammedan names are the names of God - ALL the Mohammedan names! And all over the world that was the practice, to give a name which is really a name of God.\nThis was for good reasons. One reason was this technique -- because if your name can be used as a mantra it will serve you a double purpose. It will be YOUR name - and you have heard it so much, so many times, and all your life it has penetrated deep. Then also, it is the name of God. So go on repeating it inside, and suddenly you will become aware that \"This name is different from me.\" Then by and by this name will have a sanctity of its own. You will remember any day that \"Narayan\" or \"Ram,\" this is God's name. Your name has turned into a mantra.\nUse it! This is very good! You can try many things with your name. If you want to be awakened at five o'clock in the morning, no alarm is so exact as your own name. Just repeat thrice inside, \"Ram, you have to be awake by five o'clock sharp.\" Repeat it three times, and then just fall asleep. You will be awakened at five o'clock because \"Ram,\" YOUR name, is very deep in the unconscious.\nCall your name and tell yourself that \"At five o'clock in the morning, let me be awakened.\" Someone WILL awaken you. And if you continue this practice, one day you will suddenly realize that at five o'clock someone calls you and says, \"Ram, be awake.\" That is your unconscious calling you.\nThis technique says, ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS\nSOUND, ALL SOUNDS. Your name becomes just a door for all names. But enter the\nsound. First, when you repeat \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\" it is just a word. But it means something when you go on repeating \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\"\nYou must have heard the story of Valmiki. He was given this mantra \"Ram,\" but he was an ignorant man - uneducated, simple, innocent, childlike. He started repeating \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\" but he was repeating so much that he forgot completely and reversed the whole thing. Instead he was chanting \"Mara, Mara...\" He was chanting \"Ram, Ram, Ram...\" so fast that it became \"Mara, Mara, Mara...\" And he achieved the goal through \"Mara, Mara, mara...\"\nIf you go on repeating the name fast inside, soon it will not be a word: it will become a sound, just meaningless. And then there is no difference between Ram and Mara - no difference! Whether you call Ram or Mara, it makes no sense, they are not words. It is just the sound, just the sound that matters. Enter the sound of your name. Forget the meaning of it, just enter the sound. Meaning is with the mind, sound is with the body. Meaning is in the head, sound spreads all over the body. So forget the meaning. Just repeat it as a meaningless sound, and through this sound you will enter all sounds. This sound will become the door to all sounds.\nAnd \"all sounds\" means all that exists.\nThis is one of the basic tenets of Indian inner search, that the basic unit of the existence is sound and not electricity. Modern science says that the basic unit of the existence is electricity, not sound, but they also say that sound is a form of electricity. Indians, however, have always been saying that electricity is nothing but a form of sound.\nYou may have heard that through a particular RAGA, a particular sound, fire can be created. It can be created - because this is the Indian idea, that sound is the basis of all electricity. So if you hit sound in a particular frequency, electricity will be created.\nOn long bridges, if a military, is passing, they are not allowed to march because many times it has happened that because of their march the bridge falls. It is because of sound, not because of their weight. They will be passing anyhow, but if they pass marching, then the particular sound of their feet breaks the bridge.\nIn old Hebrew history, the city of Jericho was very protected by great walls and it was impossible to break those walls by guns. But through a particular sound the walls were broken, and that sound was the secret of the breaking of those walls. If that sound is created before walls, the walls will give way.\nYou have heard the story of Ali Baba: a particular sound and the rock moves.\nThese are allegories. Whether they are right or not, one thing is certain: if you can create a particular sound so continuously that meaning is lost, mind is lost, the rock at your heart will be removed.\nTHE END.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9548","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/>Chapter 1.rtf</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 31- From sound to inner silence</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9548 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Book_of_Secrets/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE SOUND.</p><p>23. ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS SOUND, ALL
SOUNDS.</p><p>Tantra is not a philosophy. Rather, it is a science with one
difference: science is objective, tantra is subjective. But still, it is
a science and not a philosophy. Philosophy thinks about the truth, the
unknown, the ultimate; science tries to discover what is.</p><p>Science enters the immediate; philosophy thinks of the ultimate.
Philosophy is always looking toward the sky; science is more down to
earth.</p><p>Tantra is not concerned with the ultimate. It is concerned with the
immediate, the here and now. Tantra says, the ultimate is hidden in the
immediate, so you need not worry about the ultimate. By worrying about
the ultimate you will miss the immediate, and the ultimate is hidden in
the immediate. So by thinking about the ultimate you will miss both. If
the immediate should be missed, because of it you will miss the ultimate
also. So philosophy is just smoke. The approach of tantra is scientific,
but the OBJECT is different from that of so-called science.</p><p>Science tries to understand the object, the objective world, the
reality that is before your eyes. Tantra is the science of the reality
that is behind your eyes, the subjectivity, but the approach is
scientific.</p><p>Tantra doesn't believe in thinking, it believes in experimenting, in
experiencing. And unless you can experience, everything is just a
wastage of energy.</p><p>I am reminded of one incident. Mulla Nasruddin was crossing a street.
Just in front of a church he was knocked down by a hit-and-run driver.
He was an old man, and a crowd gathered. Someone was saying that "That
man cannot survive." The priest of the church ran out. He came near and
he found out that the old man was just going to die, so he prepared to
administer the last rites. He came near and asked the dying Mulla, "Do
you believe in God the Father? Do you believe in God the Son? Do you
believe in God the Holy Ghost?" Mulla opened his eyes and said, "My God!
I am dying and he is asking me puzzles!"</p><p>All philosophy is like this: it is asking puzzles while you are
dying. Every moment you are dying, every moment everyone is on his
deathbed - because death can occur at any moment. But philosophy goes on
asking and answering puzzles. Tantra says, it is good for children to
philosophize but those who are wise will not waste their time in
philosophy. They should try to know - not to think, because through
thinking there is no knowledge. Through thinking you go on webbing
words, creating patterns of words. It leads nowhere, you remain the same
-- no transformation, no new insights. The old man just goes on
gathering dust.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing is a different phenomenon. It does not mean "thinking about,"
it means going deep into the existence itself in order to know, moving
into the existence. Remember this,</p><p>that tantra is not a philosophy. It is science - a subjective
science. The approach is scientific and non-philosophic. It is very down
to earth, concerned with the immediate. The immediate is to be used as a
door to the ultimate, the ultimate happens if you enter the immediate.
It is there, and there is no other way to reach to it.</p><p>Philosophy is not a way in the eyes of tantra. It is a false way! It
only appears that this is a way. It is a door which is not; it simply
appears to be a door. It is a false door. The moment you try to enter it
you come to know that you cannot enter, it is just a painted door, there
is no door in reality. Philosophy is a painted door. If you sit by its
side and go on thinking and thinking, it is good. If you try to enter
it, it is a wall.</p><p>So every philosophy is good for philosophizing. For experiencing,
every philosophy is impotent. That is why there is so much insistence on
technique in tantra - SO MUCH insistence on technique, because a science
can do nothing but give technology, whether of the outside world or of
the inside. The very word `tantra' means technique. The very word
`tantra' MEANS technique! That is why, in this small and yet one of the
greatest and deepest books, only techniques are given, no philosophy,
just one hundred and twelve techniques to reach the ultimate through the
immediate.</p><p><br></p><p>The ninth technique concerning sound:</p><p>SILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN "AH." THEN IN THE "HH,"
EFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY.</p><p>SILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN "AH " Any word that ends in "AH"
--</p><p>intone it silently. Emphasis should be given to the ending "AH." Why?
Because the moment this sound "AH" is intoned, your breath goes out. You
may not have observed it, but now you can observe: whenever your breath
goes out you are more silent, and whenever your breath comes in you are
more tense - because the outgoing breath is death and the incoming
breath is life. Tension is part of life, not of death. Relaxation is
part of death; death means total relaxation. Life cannot be totally
relaxed; it is impossible.</p><p>Life means tension, effort. Only death is relaxed. So whenever a
person becomes absolutely relaxed, he is both - alive outwardly and dead
within. You can see in the face of a buddha both life and death
simultaneously. That is why there is so much silence and calm, they are
part of death. Life is not relaxation. You relax in the night when you
are asleep. That is why the old traditions say that death and sleep are
similar. Sleep is a temporary death and death is permanent sleep. That
is why night relaxes you, it is the outgoing breath. The morning is the
incoming breath.</p><p>The day makes you tense and the night relaxes you. Light makes you
tense, darkness relaxes you.</p><p>That is why you cannot sleep when there is light, it is difficult to
relax because light is similar to life: it is anti-death. Darkness is
similar to death: it is pro-death.</p><p>So darkness has deep relaxation in it, and those who are afraid of
darkness cannot relax... impossible, because every relaxation is dark.
And darkness surrounds your life on both the sides. Before you are born
you are in darkness; when life ceases you are again in darkness.
Darkness is infinite, and this light and this life is just a moment in
it, just a wave arising and then falling back. If you can remember the
darkness that surrounds both the ends, you will be relaxed here and
now.</p><p>Life, death - they both are two sides of existence. The incoming
breath is life, the</p><p>outgoing breath is death. So it is not that you die someday, you are
dying with every breath. That is why the Hindus have been counting life
in breaths, they do not count life in years. Tantra, yoga, all the old
Indian systems, they count life in breaths: how many breaths you are
going to live. So they say if you breathe very fast, with too much
breathing in a short time, you will die very soon. If you breathe very
slowly and your breaths are less in an interval, you will live very
long. And this is so.</p><p>If you go and observe animals, those animals whose breathing is very
slow live long. Take the elephant: the elephant lives long; the breath
is very slow.</p><p>Then there is the dog: the dog dies soon; the breath is very fast.
Whenever you find an animal in which the breath is fast, any animal, the
animal will not have a long life. A long life is always with slow
breath.</p><p>Tantra and yoga and other Indian systems count your life in breaths.
Really, with every breath you are born and with every breath you are
dying. This mantra, this technique, uses the outgoing breath as the
method, the medium, the vehicle, to go deep into silence. It is a death
method. INTONE SILENTLY A WORD ENDING IN "AH." The breath has gone --
that is why a word ending in "AH."</p><p>This AH is meaningful because when you say AH it completely empties
you. The whole breath has moved out; nothing remains within. You are
totally empty - empty and dead. For a single moment, for a very small
interval, life has moved out of you. You are dead - empty. This
emptiness, if realized, if you can become aware of it, will change you
completely. You will be a different man.</p><p>Then you will know well that this life is not your life and this
death is also not your death. Then you will know something which is
beyond the incoming and outgoing breath</p><p>- the witnessing soul. And this witnessing can happen easily when you
are empty of breath, because life has subsided and with it all tensions
have subsided. So try it, it is a very beautiful method. But the
ordinary process, the ordinary habit, is to emphasize the incoming
breath, never the outgoing breath.</p><p><br></p><p>We always take the breath in. We ALWAYS take it in, but we never
throw it out. We take it in and THE BODY throws it out. Observe your
breathing and you will know. We take it in. We never exhale, we only
inhale. The exhaling is done by the body because we are afraid of death,
that is the reason. If it was in our power we would not exhale at all,
we would inhale and then control it within. No one emphasizes exhaling
-- inhaling is emphasized. Because we HAVE to do exhaling after
inhaling, that is why we go on "suffering" it. We tolerate it because we
cannot inhale without exhaling.</p><p>So exhaling is accepted as a necessary evil, but basically we are not
interested in exhaling. And this is not only about breath, this is our
whole attitude toward life. We cling to everything that comes to us; we
will not leave it. This is the miserliness of the mind.</p><p>And remember, there are many implications in it. If you are suffering
from constipation, this will be the basic cause: you always inhale and
never exhale. The mind which never exhales but just inhales will suffer
from constipation. The constipation is the other end of the same thing.
He cannot exhale anything, he goes on accumulating, he is afraid. The
fear is there. He can only accumulate, but anything that is accumulated
becomes poisonous.</p><p>If you only inhale and do not exhale, your very breath becomes poison
to you; you will</p><p>die because of it.</p><p>You can turn a life-giving force into poison if you behave in a
miserly way, because the exhaling is absolutely necessary. It throws all
the poisons out of you.</p><p>So really, death is a purifying process and life is a poisoning
process. This will look paradoxical. Life is a poisoning process because
to live you have to use many things - and the moment you have used them
they turn into poison, they are converted into poisons. You take a
breath in, you use oxygen, and then what remains becomes poison. It was
life only because it was oxygen, but you have used it. So life goes on
changing everything into a poison.</p><p>Now there is a great movement in the West - ecology. Man has been
using everything and turning it into poison, and the very Earth is just
on the verge of dying. Any day it can die because we have turned
everything into poison. Death is a purifying process. When your whole
body has become poisonous, death will relieve you of the body. It will
renew you, it will give you a new birth; a new body will be given to
you. Through death all the accumulated poisons are dissolved back into
nature. You are given a new mechanism.</p><p>And this happens with every breath. The outgoing breath is similar to
death -- it takes poisons out. And when it is going out, everything ebbs
within. If you can throw the whole breath out, completely out so that no
breath remains within, you touch a point of silence that can never be
touched while the breath is in.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like the ebb and tide: with every breath a tide of life
comes to you; with every exhalation, everything ebbs - the tide has
gone. You are just a vacant, empty shore. This is the use of this
technique. SILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN "AH." Emphasize the exhaling
breath. And you can use it for many changes in the mind. If you are
suffering from constipation, forget intaking. Just exhale and do not
inhale. Let the body do the work of inhaling; you just do the work of
exhaling. You force the breath out and do not inhale. The body will
inhale by itself; you need not worry about it, you are not going to die.
The body will take breath in, you just throw it out and let the body
take it in. Your constipation will go.</p><p>If you are suffering from heart disease, just exhale, do not inhale.
Then you will not suffer from heart disease. If while just going upwards
on a staircase, or anywhere, you feel tired - very much tired,
suffocated, breathless - simply do this: just exhale, do not inhale.
Then you can climb up any amount of steps and you will not be tired.
What happens? When you go with an emphasis on exhaling, you are ready to
let go, you are ready to die. You are not afraid of death; that makes
you open. Otherwise you are closed</p><p>-- fear closes you.</p><p>When you exhale, the whole system changes and accepts death. There is
no fear, you are ready to die. And one who is ready to die can live.</p><p>Really, only one who is ready to die can live. He alone becomes
capable of life - because he is not afraid.</p><p>One who accepts death, welcomes it, receives it as a guest, lives
with it, goes deep into life. Exhale, do not inhale, and that will
change your total mind. Because of simple techniques tantra never
appeals, because we think, "My mind is such a complex thing." It is not
complex - just foolish. And fools are very complex. A wise man is
simple. Nothing is complex in your mind, it is a very simple mechanism.
If you understand, you can</p><p>change it very easily.</p><p>If you have not seen anybody dying, if you have been protected from
seeing death as Buddha was protected, you cannot understand anything
about it. Buddha's father was afraid because some astrologer said that
"This boy is going to be a great sannyasin. He will renounce the world."
The father asked, "What is to be done to protect him from doing such a
thing?" So those astrologers thought and thought, and then they
concluded and they said, "Do not allow him to see death, because if he
is not aware of death he will never think of renouncing life."</p><p>This is beautiful - very meaningful. That means all religion, all
philosophy, all tantra and yoga, is basically death-oriented. If you are
aware of death, only then does religion become meaningful. That is why
no animal except man is religious, because no animal is aware of
death.</p><p>They die, but they are not aware. They cannot conceive or imagine
that there is going to be death.</p><p>When one dog dies, other dogs never imagine that death is going to
happen to them also. Always someone else dies, so how can a dog imagine
that "I am going to die"? He has never seen himself dying. Someone else,
some other dog dies, so how can he connect that "I am going to die"? No
animal is aware of death; that is why no animal renounces. No animal can
become a sannyasin. Only a very high quality of consciousness can lead
you to renounce - when you become aware of death. And if even by being a
man you are not aware of death, you belong to the animal kingdom; you
are not yet a man. You become a man only when you encounter death.
Otherwise there is no difference between you and the animal.</p><p>Everything is similar; only death makes the difference. With death
encountered, you are no more animal, something has happened to you which
never happens to an animal. Now you will be a different
consciousness.</p><p>So Buddha's father protected him from seeing any type of death - not
only man's death, but the death of animals and even of flowers. So the
gardeners were instructed not to allow the child to see a dead flower, a
pale flower dying on the branch, a pale leaf, a dry leaf. No, nowhere
should he come to realize that something dies -- he may infer from it
that "I am going to die."</p><p>And you do not infer it even seeing your wife dying, your mother,
your father, your child. You weep for them, but you never conceive that
this is a sign that "I am going to die." But the astrologers said, "The
boy is very, very sensitive, so protect him from any type of death." And
the father was over-conscientious He would not allow even an old man or
an old woman to be seen, because oldness is just death heard from a
distance; death is there from a distance, just coming. So Buddha's
father would not allow any old man or old woman to be seen by the child.
If Buddha suddenly became aware that just by stopping the breath a man
could die, it would be very difficult for him. "Just because no breath
is coming in, how can a man die?" he would wonder. "Life is such a big,
complex process." If you have not seen anyone dying, even you cannot
conceive that just by stopping the breath a man will die. Just by
stopping the breath? Such a simple thing! And how can such a complex
life die?</p><p>It is the same with these methods. They look simple, but they touch
the basic reality. When the breath is going out, when you are completely
emptied of life, you touch death: you are just near it, and everything
becomes calm and silent within you.</p><p>Use it as a mantra. Whenever you feel tired, whenever you feel tense,
use any word which ends in "AH." "Allah" will do - any word that brings
your total breath out so that you exhale completely and you are emptied
of breath.</p><p>The moment you are emptied of breath you are emptied of life also.
And all your problems belong to life: no problem belongs to death. Your
anxiety, your anguish, your anger, your sadness, they all belong to
life.</p><p>Death is non-problematic. Death never gives any problem to anyone.
And even if you think that "I am afraid of death and death creates a
problem," it is not death that creates the problem but your clinging to
life. Only life creates problems; death dissolves all problems. So when
the breath has moved completely out, "AH," you are emptied of life. Look
within at that moment when the breath is completely out. Before taking
another breath in, go deep down in that interval and become aware of the
inside calm, the silence. In that moment you are a buddha.</p><p>If you can catch that moment, you have known a taste of what Buddha
might have known. And once known, you can detach this taste from the
incoming-outgoing breath. Then the breath can go on coming in, going
out, and you can remain in that quality of consciousness that you have
come to know. It is always there; one has just to discover it. And it is
easier to discover when life is emptied out.</p><p>SILENTLY INTONE A WORD ENDING IN "AH." THEN IN THE "HH,"</p><p>EFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY. And when the breath goes out, "HH,"
everything is emptied. EFFORTLESSLY: in this moment, there is no need to
make any effort.</p><p>The SPONTANEITY: just be aware, be spontaneous, be sensitive, and
realize this moment of death.</p><p>In this moment you are just near the door, just near the door!- very,
very near to the ultimate. The immediate has moved out, the superfluous
has moved out. In this moment you are not the wave: you are the ocean -
just near, just near! If you can become aware you will forget that you
are a wave. Again the wave will come, but now you can never be
identified with it, you will remain the ocean. Once you have known that
you are the ocean, you can never again be the wave.</p><p>Life is waves... death is the ocean. That is why Buddha so much
insists about his NIRVANA that it is death-like. He never says you will
attain life immortal, he says you will simply die totally. Jesus says,
"Come to me and I will give you life, and life abundant." Buddha says,
"Come to me to realize your death. I will give you death totally." And
both mean the same thing, but Buddha's terminology is more basic. But
you will become afraid of it. That is why Buddha had no appeal in India;
he was uprooted completely. And we go on saying that this land is a
religious land, but the most religious person couldn't get roots
here.</p><p>What type of religious land is this? We have not produced another
Buddha; he is incomparable. And whenever the world thinks India to be
religious, the world remembers Buddha - no one else.</p><p>Because of Buddha, India is thought to be religious. What type of
religious land is this? Buddha has no roots here; he was totally
uprooted. He used the language of death - that is the cause, and
brahmins were using the language of life. They say THE BRAHMAN and he
says NIRVANA: `Brahman' means life -- life, infinite life; and `Nirvana'
means just</p><p>cessation, death - total death.</p><p>Buddha says, "Your ordinary death is not total; you will be born
again. It is NOT total! You will be born again! I will give you a total
death, and you will never be born again." A total death means now no
birth is possible. So this so-called death, Buddha says, is not death.
It is just a rest period, you will become alive again. It is just a
breath gone out.</p><p>You will take the breath in again, you will be reborn. Buddha says,
"I will give you the way so that the breath will go out and will never
come in again - total death, nirvana, cessation."</p><p>We become afraid because we cling to life. But this is the paradox:
the more you cling to life, the more you will die, and the more you are
ready to die, then the more you become deathless. If you are ready to
die, then there is no possibility of death. No one can give you death if
you accept it, because through that acceptance you become aware of
something within you which is deathless.</p><p>This incoming breath and outgoing breath are the life and death of
the body, not of "me."</p><p>But "I" do not know anything other than the body; "I" am identified
with the body. Then it will be difficult to be aware when the breath
comes in, easy to be aware when the breath goes out. When the breath is
going out, for that moment you have become old, dying, emptied
completely of the breath; you are dead for a moment.</p><p>IN THE "HH," EFFORTLESSLY, THE SPONTANEITY. Try it! Any moment you
can try it. Just riding in a bus or traveling in a train or moving to
the office, whenever you have time intone a sound like "Allah" - any
sound ending with "AH." This "Allah" helped so much in Islam - not
because of any Allah there in the sky, but because of this "AH." This
word is beautiful. And then the more one goes on using this word "Allah,
Allah..." it becomes reduced. Then what remains is "Lah, Lah..." Then it
is reduced further; then it remains as "Ah, Ah..." It is good, but you
can use any word that ends in "AH" - or just "AH" will do.</p><p>Have you observed that whenever you are tense you will sigh -- "AH"
-- and you will feel relaxed. Or whenever you are in joy, overjoyed, you
say "AH," and the whole breath is thrown out and you feel within a
tranquility that you have never felt. Try this: when you are feeling
very good, take the breath in and then see what you feel. You cannot
feel that well-being that comes with "AH." It is coming because of the
breath.</p><p>So languages differ, but these two things never differ.</p><p>All over the world, whenever someone feels tired he will say "AH."
Really, he is calling for death to come and relax him. Whenever one
feels overjoyed, blissful, he says "AH." He is so overfilled with joy
that he is not afraid of death now. He can relieve himself completely,
relax completely.</p><p>And what will happen if you go on trying it, trying it? You will
become fully aware of something within you - the spontaneousness of your
being; of SAHAJ of being spontaneous. That you are already, but you are
too much engaged with life, too much occupied with life. You cannot
become aware of the being which is behind.</p><p>When you are not occupied with life, with the incoming breath, the
being behind is revealed; there is a glimpse. But the glimpse will
become, by and by, a realization. And once it is known you cannot forget
it - and this is not something which you are creating. That is why it is
spontaneous: it is not something you are creating. It is there, you have
simply forgotten. It is a remembrance! It is a rediscovery!</p><p>Try to see children, very small children, taking their breaths. They
take them in a</p><p>different way. Look at a child sleeping. His belly comes up and down,
not the chest. If you are sleeping and you are being observed, your
chest comes up and down; your breath never goes down to the belly. The
breath can go down to the belly only if you exhale and do not
inhale.</p><p>If you inhale and do not exhale, the breath cannot go down to the
belly. The reason why breath goes to the belly is that when one exhales,
the whole breath is thrown out and then the BODY takes it in. And the
body takes only that amount which is needed -- never more, never
less.</p><p>The body has its own wisdom, and it is more wise than you. Do not
disturb it. You can take more -- then it will be disturbed. You can take
less -- then it will be disturbed. The body has its own wisdom, it only
takes that amount which is needed. When more is needed, it creates the
situation. When less is needed, it creates the situation. It never goes
to the extreme, it is always balanced. But if YOU inhale it is never
balanced, because you do not know what you are doing, you do not know
what is the need of the body. And the need changes every moment.</p><p>Allow the body! You just exhale, you just throw it out, and then the
body will take breath in - and it will take it deeply and slowly, and
the breath will go down to the belly. It will hit the navel point
exactly and your belly will go up and down. If you inhale then really,
you never exhale totally. Then the breath is in and you go on inhaling,
so the breath which is already in will not allow your breath to go down
to the very bottom. Then just shallow breathing happens. You go on
taking breath in, and the poisonous breath is there, filling you up.</p><p><br></p><p>They say that you have six thousand sacs in your lungs and only two
thousand are touched by your breath. The four thousand are always filled
with poisonous gases which need to be exhaled, and that two-thirds
portion of your chest creates much anxiety, much anguish and misery in
the mind, in the body. A child exhales, he never inhales. Inhaling is
done by the body itself.</p><p>When the child is born, the first thing he is going to do is cry.
With that cry his throat opens, with that cry comes the first "AH." The
oxygen and air that had been given by the mother is exhaled. This is his
first effort with breathing. That is why if a child is not crying, then
the doctor will become uneasy, because he has not shown the sign of
life. He still feels dependent on the mother. He must cry! That cry
shows that now he is becoming an individual; the mother is not needed,
he will take his own breath. And the first thing is that he is going to
cry in order to exhale that which was given by the mother, and then his
body will start functioning, inhaling.</p><p>A child is always exhaling, and when the child starts inhaling, when
the emphasis moves to inhaling, be aware. He has already become old; he
has learned things from you. He has become tense. Whenever you are
tense, you cannot take a deep breath. Why? Your stomach becomes rigid.
Whenever you are tense your stomach becomes rigid, it won't allow breath
to go down.</p><p>Then you have to take shallow breaths.</p><p>Try with "AH." It has a beautiful feeling around it. Whenever you
feel tired, "AH" -- throw the breath. And make it a point to emphasize
exhaling. You will be a different man, and a different mind will evolve.
With the emphasis on breathing in, you have</p><p>developed a miser mind and a miser body. With exhaling, that
miserliness will disappear and with it many problems. Possessiveness
will disappear.</p><p>So tantra will not say leave possessiveness. Tantra says, change your
system of breathing; you cannot possess then. Observe your own breathing
and your moods, and you will become aware. Whatsoever is wrong is always
associated with the emphasis that is given to the incoming breath and
whatsoever is good, virtuous, beautiful, true, is always associated with
exhaling. Whenever you are speaking a lie, you will hold your breath in.
Whenever you speak truth, you never hold the breath. You fear that "I am
speaking a lie," so you hold the breath. You are afraid something may go
out with it - the out-moving breath. Your hidden truth may be revealed,
so you are afraid.</p><p>Go on trying this "AH" more and more. You will be more healthy in
body, more healthy in mind, and a different quality of calm,
at-easeness, tranquillity will develop.</p><p>The tenth sound method:</p><p>STOPPING EARS BY PRESSING AND RECTUM BY CONTRACTING, ENTER THE
SOUND.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not aware of the body even or how the body functions and what
is its tao, what is its way. But if you observe, then you can become
very easily aware. If you stop your ears and pull your rectum up,
contract your rectum, everything will stop for you. It will be as if the
whole world has become non-moving - as if everything has become static,
stopped. Not only movements, you will feel as if time has stopped.</p><p>What happens when you pull the rectum up, contract it? What happens?
When both the ears are closed simultaneously, with closed ears you will
hear a sound within. But if the rectum is not pulled up, that sound is
released by the rectum. That sound is very subtle. If the rectum is
pulled up, contracted, and the ears are closed, you will see within you
a pillar of sound - and that sound is of silence. It is a negative
sound. When all sounds have ceased, then you feel the sound of silence
or the sound of soundlessness. But it will be released from the
rectum.</p><p>So close the ears and pull the rectum up. Then you are closed from
both the sides, and your body becomes closed and just filled with sound.
This feeling of being filled with sound gives a deep fulfillment. So we
will have to understand many things around it, only then will it become
possible for you to have the feeling of what happens.</p><p>We are not aware of the body -- that is one of the basic problems for
a seeker.</p><p>And the society is against becoming aware of the body because society
is afraid of the body. So we train every child not to be aware of the
body, we make every child insensitive. We create a distance between the
child's mind and body, so he is not very much aware of the body, because
body awareness will create problems for the society. Many things are
implied. If the child is aware of the body, he will become aware of sex
sooner or later. And if he is too much aware of the body, he will feel
too much sexual, sensuous. So we have to kill the very root. He should
be "made dull" about his body, insensitive, so he never feels it. You do
not feel your body. You feel it only when something wrong happens, when
something goes wrong.</p><p>You have a headache in the head, then you feel your head. Some thorn
is there, then you feel your leg, your feet. When your body aches, you
feel that you have a body. You feel it only when something goes wrong,
and then too not right away. You are never aware of</p><p>your diseases immediately. You become aware only when a period has
passed and when the disease goes on knocking at your consciousness that,
"I am here." Only then do you become aware. So no one really goes to the
doctor in time. Everyone reaches there late, when the disease has
entered deep and has done much wrong.</p><p>If a child has grown up with sensitivity he will become aware of the
disease even before the disease happens.</p><p>And now, in Russia particularly, they are working on the theory that
a disease can be known even six months before its happening if someone
is very deeply sensitive about his body, because subtle changes start
long in advance. They prepare the body for the disease. The impact is
felt even six months before.</p><p>But never mind disease, we never become aware even of death! If you
are going to die tomorrow, you are not aware even today. A thing like
death which may happen the next moment, and you are not aware this
moment. You are totally dead to your body, insensitive. This whole
society, the whole culture up to now, creates this dullness, this
deadness, because it has been against the body. You are not allowed to
feel it. Only in accidents can you be pardoned, forgiven for being aware
of it; otherwise "do not be aware of the body."</p><p>This creates many problems, particularly for tantra, because tantra
believes in deep sensitivity and knowledge of the body. You go on moving
and your body goes on doing many things and you are unaware. Now much
work is being done on body language. The body has its own language, and
psychiatrists and psychologists and psychoanalysts in particular are
being trained for body language, because they say you cannot believe the
modern man. Whatsoever he says cannot be believed. Rather, one must
observe his body, that will give a more true clue.</p><p><br></p><p>A man enters a psychiatrist's office. The old psychiatry, Freudian
psychoanalysis, will talk and talk with the man to bring out whatsoever
is hidden in his mind. Modern psychiatry will observe his body because
that gives clues. If a man is an egoist, if ego is his problem, he
stands in a different way than a humble man. His neck has a different
angle than a humble man, his spine is not flexible but dead, fixed. He
looks wooden, not alive. If you touch his body it has a wooden feeling,
not the warmth of a living body. He is like a soldier just moving to the
front.</p><p>Look at the soldier moving to the front. He has a wooden shape, a
wooden feeling, and that is needed by a soldier because he is going to
die or to kill. He must not be much aware of the body, so his whole
training is to create a wooden body. Soldiers marching look like toys,
like dead toys marching.</p><p>If you are humble you have a different body; you sit differently you
stand differently. If you feel inferior, you stand differently; if you
feel superior you stand differently. If you are always in fear, you
stand in such a way as if you are protecting yourself from some unknown
force. That is always there. If you are not afraid, you are just like a
child playing with his mother; there is no fear. Wherever you go you are
unafraid, at home with the universe around you. The man who is afraid is
armored.</p><p>And when I say armored it is not only symbolically, physiologically
he is armored. Wilhelm Reich was working very much on body structure,
and he came to see some deep associations between mind and body. If a
man is afraid, his stomach is not flexible. You</p><p>touch his stomach and it is like a stone. If he becomes fearless, his
stomach relaxes immediately. Or if you relax the stomach, then the fear
disappears. Massage the stomach to relax, and you will feel more
fearless, less afraid.</p><p>A person who is loving has a different quality of body and warmth --
he is warm bodily. A person who is not loving is cold, physiologically
he is cold. Cold and other things have moved into your body and they
have become barriers, they do not allow you to know about your body. But
the body goes on working in its own way and you go on working in your
own way -- a rift is created. That rift has to be broken.</p><p>I have seen that if someone is suppressive, if you have suppressed
your anger, then your fingers, your hands, have the sensation of a
suppressed anger. And a person who knows how to feel it can feel just by
touching your hand that you have suppressed anger. And why in the hand?
Because anger has to be released by the hands. If you have suppressed
anger then in your teeth, in your gums, it is suppressed - and it can be
felt by touching. It gives a vibration that "I am suppressed here."</p><p><br></p><p>If you have suppressed sex, then in your erotic zones it is there. If
a person has suppressed sex, then if you touch his erotic zones you can
feel it. With any erotic zone touched, sex is there if it has been
suppressed. The zone will become afraid and will withdraw from your
touch, it will not be open. Because the person inside is withdrawing,
the part of the body will withdraw. It will not allow you to bring about
an opening.</p><p>Now they say that fifty percent of women are frigid, and the reason
is because we teach girls to be more suppressive than boys. So they have
suppressed, and when a girl suppresses her sexual feelings up to the age
of twenty, it has become a long habit - twenty years of suppression.
Then when she will love, she will talk about love, but her body will not
be open; the body will be closed. And then an opposite, a diametrically
opposite phenomenon happens: two currents oppose each other. She wants
to love but her body is repressive, the body withdraws; it is not ready
to come closer.</p><p>If you see a woman sitting with a man, if the woman loves the man she
will be inclining toward him, the body will be inclining. If they are
sitting on a sofa, both of their bodies will be inclining toward each
other. They are not aware, but you can see it. If the woman is afraid of
the man, her body will be inclining to the opposite direction. If a
woman loves a man she will never cross her legs when sitting near
him.</p><p>If she is afraid of the man she will cross her legs. She is not
aware; this is not done consciously. It is body armor. The body protects
itself and works in its own ways. Tantra became aware of this
phenomenon; the first awareness of such deep body feeling, sensitivity,
was with tantra. And tantra says that if you can use your body
consciously, the body becomes the vehicle to move to the spirit. Tantra
says, it is foolish, absolutely idiotic, to be against the body. Use it!
It is a vehicle! And use its energy in such a way that you can go beyond
it.</p><p>Now, STOPPING EARS BY PRESSING AND RECTUM BY CONTRACTING,</p><p>ENTER THE SOUND. Many times you have been contracting the rectum and
sometimes the rectum is released even without your consciousness. If you
suddenly become afraid, the rectum is released. You may defecate in
fear, you may urinate in fear. Then you cannot control it. If a sudden
fear grips you, your bladder will relax, your rectum will relax. What
happens? In fear, what happens? Fear is a mental thing, so why do you
urinate in fear? Why is the control lost? There must be some deep
connecting root.</p><p>Fear happens in the head, in the mind. When you are unafraid this
never happens. The child really has no mental control over his body. No
animal controls his urine, bladder or anything. Whenever the bladder is
full it is released. No animal controls it, but man has to control it of
necessity.</p><p>So we force a child to control when he should go to the bathroom and
when not. We tell him he has to control; we give timings. So the mind
takes over the control of a function which is non-voluntary. That is why
it is so difficult to train the child for the toilet. And now
psychologists say that if we stop toilet training, humanity will very
much improve. Toilet training is the first repression of the child and
its natural spontaneity, but it seems difficult to listen to these
psychologists. We cannot listen to them because then the children will
create many problems. We have to train them of necessity. Only a very,
very rich, affluent society will be able not to bother. Poor societies
have to manage. We cannot afford it. If the child urinates anywhere, we
cannot afford it. If he urinates on the sofa we cannot afford it, so we
have to train. This training is mental. The body really has no built-in
program for it. The body has NO built-in program for it!</p><p>Man is an animal as far as body is concerned, and the body knows no
culture, no society. That is why when you are in deep fear, the control
mechanism that you have imposed on the body is relaxed. You are not in
control; you are thrown off control. You can control only in normal
conditions. In emergencies you cannot control because for emergencies
you have never been trained. You have only been trained for the normal,
day-to-day, routine world.</p><p>In an emergency the control is lost, your body starts functioning in
its own animal way. But one relationship can be understood, that with a
fearless man this will never happen. So this has become a sign of a
coward.</p><p>If in fear you urinate or defecate, this shows you are a coward. A
fearless man will not behave in this way, because a fearless man is
taking deep breaths. His body and his breathing system are related;
there is no gap. With a man who is a coward there is a gap, and because
of that gap he is always overburdened with urine and defecation. So
whenever an emergency comes, that overburdenedness has to be thrown: he
has to be unburdened. And it has a reason in nature. A coward who is
unburdened can escape more easily with his stomach relaxed, can run more
easily. A burdened stomach will become a hindrance, so it is helpful for
a coward to be relaxed.</p><p>Why am I talking about this? I am just saying this, that you have to
be aware of your mental processes and your stomach processes; they are
deeply related. Psychologists say that fifty to ninety percent of your
dreams are because of your stomach processes. If you have taken a very
heavy meal you are bound to see nightmares. They are not related with
the mind, it is just that the heavy stomach creates them.</p><p>Many dreams can be created by outside tricks. If you are sleeping,
your hands can be crossed on your chest and immediately you will start
dreaming some nightmare.</p><p>A pillow can be put on your chest and you will dream that some demon
is sitting on your chest just going to kill you. And this has been one
of the problems. Why is there such a burden from the small weight of a
pillow? If you are awake, there is no weight; you do not feel anything
heavy. But why is it that a small pillow placed on you in the night when
you are sleeping is felt as being so heavy that it is as if you have
been burdened with a big stone or a rock? Why is so much weight
felt?</p><p>The reason is this: when you are aware, when you are awake, your mind
and body are not correlated; the gap is there. You cannot feel the body
and its sensitivity. While asleep, the control, the culture, the
conditioning, dissolves; you have again become a child and your body has
become sensitive. Because of that sensitivity, a small pillow is felt as
a rock. It is magnified because of sensitivity -- the sensitivity
magnifies it. So body-mind processes are deeply related, and if you know
what happens you can use this.</p><p>Rectum closed, pulled upwards, contracted, creates a situation in the
body in which sound can be felt if present. You will feel a pillar of
sound in silence within the closed space in your body. Close the ears
and pull up the rectum, and then just remain with what is happening
inside you. Just remain in that vacant state which is created by these
two things. Your life energy is moving within and it has no way to go
out.</p><p>Sound goes out either from your ears or from your rectum. Those are
the two doors from where the sound can move out. If is not moving out,
you can feel it more easily.</p><p>And what will happen when you feel this inner sound? With the very
phenomenon of hearing the inner sound, your thoughts dissolve. Just try
it anytime during the day: just pull up the rectum and put your fingers
in the ears. Press the ears and pull up the rectum. You will feel that
your mind has stopped. It will not be functioning; thoughts will have
stopped. That constant flow of thoughts is not there. It is good! And if
one goes on doing it whenever there is time, in the day if you can do it
for five or six times, within three or four months you will become an
expert in it. And then such a well-being flows out of it! And the inner
sound, once heard, remains with you. Then you can hear it the whole day.
The market is noisy, the road is noisy, the traffic is noisy, but if
even in that noise you have heard the inner sound, you will feel the
still small voice that goes on inside. And then nothing will disturb
you. If you can feel your inner sound, then nothing from the outside can
disturb you. You remain silent; whatsoever happens around you makes no
difference.</p><p>The last sound technique:</p><p>ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH THIS SOUND, ALL SOUNDS.</p><p>Your own name can be used as a mantra very easily, and it is very
helpful because your name has gone very deep into your unconscious.</p><p>Nothing else has gone so deep. If we are all are sitting here, and we
all fall asleep and someone comes and calls "Ram," no one will listen
except the person whose name is Ram. He will listen to it; he will be
disturbed in his sleep. No one else will listen to the sound "Ram," but
why does this man listen? It has gone down deep; it is not conscious
now, it has become unconscious.</p><p>Your name has gone very deep within you, but there is a very
beautiful phenomenon about your name: you never call it, others call it.
Others use it; you never use it.</p><p>I have heard that in the first world war, for the first time in
America rationing was created. Thomas Edison was a very great scientist,
but he was very poor so he had to stand in the queue for his ration
card. And he was such a great man that no one ever used his name before
him. There was no need to use his name for himself, and no one else
would use his name because he was so much respected. Everyone would call
him Professor, so he had forgotten what was his name.</p><p>He was standing in the queue, and when his name was called, when it
was asked who</p><p>Thomas Alva Edison was, he just stared blankly. Again the name was
called, then someone who was a neighbor to Edison said to him, "Why are
you standing? Your name is being called. It is your name, Professor."
Then he became aware and he said, "But how can I recognize it? No one
calls me Edison.</p><p>It has been so long... they just call me Professor."</p><p>You never use your own name. Only others use it -- you have heard it
used by others. But it has gone deep, very deep. It has penetrated like
an arrow into your unconscious. If you yourself use it, then it becomes
a mantra. And for two reasons it helps: one, when you use your own name,
if your name is "Ram" and you use "Ram, Ram, Ram...", suddenly you feel
as if you are using someone else's name - as if it is not yours. Or if
you feel that this IS yours, you feel that there is a separate entity
within you which is using it. It may belong to the body, it may belong
to the mind, but he who is calling "Ram, Ram..." becomes a witness.</p><p>You have always called others' names. When you call your own name it
looks as if it belongs to someone else, not to you, and it is a very
revealing phenomenon. You can become a witness to your own name, and
with the name your whole life is involved. Separated from the name, you
are separated from your whole life. And this name has penetrated deep
within you because everyone has called you this from your very birth,
you have always heard this. So use this sound, and with this sound you
can go to the very depths to which the name has gone.</p><p>In the old days we gave everyone a name of God - everyone. Someone
was Ram, someone was Narayan, someone was Krishna, someone was Vishnu,
or something like that.</p><p>They say all the Mohammedan names are the names of God - ALL the
Mohammedan names! And all over the world that was the practice, to give
a name which is really a name of God.</p><p>This was for good reasons. One reason was this technique -- because
if your name can be used as a mantra it will serve you a double purpose.
It will be YOUR name - and you have heard it so much, so many times, and
all your life it has penetrated deep. Then also, it is the name of God.
So go on repeating it inside, and suddenly you will become aware that
"This name is different from me." Then by and by this name will have a
sanctity of its own. You will remember any day that "Narayan" or "Ram,"
this is God's name. Your name has turned into a mantra.</p><p>Use it! This is very good! You can try many things with your name. If
you want to be awakened at five o'clock in the morning, no alarm is so
exact as your own name. Just repeat thrice inside, "Ram, you have to be
awake by five o'clock sharp." Repeat it three times, and then just fall
asleep. You will be awakened at five o'clock because "Ram," YOUR name,
is very deep in the unconscious.</p><p>Call your name and tell yourself that "At five o'clock in the
morning, let me be awakened." Someone WILL awaken you. And if you
continue this practice, one day you will suddenly realize that at five
o'clock someone calls you and says, "Ram, be awake." That is your
unconscious calling you.</p><p><br></p><p>This technique says, ENTER THE SOUND OF YOUR NAME AND, THROUGH
THIS</p><p>SOUND, ALL SOUNDS. Your name becomes just a door for all names. But
enter the</p><p>sound. First, when you repeat "Ram, Ram, Ram..." it is just a word.
But it means something when you go on repeating "Ram, Ram, Ram..."</p><p>You must have heard the story of Valmiki. He was given this mantra
"Ram," but he was an ignorant man - uneducated, simple, innocent,
childlike. He started repeating "Ram, Ram, Ram..." but he was repeating
so much that he forgot completely and reversed the whole thing. Instead
he was chanting "Mara, Mara..." He was chanting "Ram, Ram, Ram..." so
fast that it became "Mara, Mara, Mara..." And he achieved the goal
through "Mara, Mara, mara..."</p><p>If you go on repeating the name fast inside, soon it will not be a
word: it will become a sound, just meaningless. And then there is no
difference between Ram and Mara - no difference! Whether you call Ram or
Mara, it makes no sense, they are not words. It is just the sound, just
the sound that matters. Enter the sound of your name. Forget the meaning
of it, just enter the sound. Meaning is with the mind, sound is with the
body. Meaning is in the head, sound spreads all over the body. So forget
the meaning. Just repeat it as a meaningless sound, and through this
sound you will enter all sounds. This sound will become the door to all
sounds.</p><p>And "all sounds" means all that exists.</p><p>This is one of the basic tenets of Indian inner search, that the
basic unit of the existence is sound and not electricity. Modern science
says that the basic unit of the existence is electricity, not sound, but
they also say that sound is a form of electricity. Indians, however,
have always been saying that electricity is nothing but a form of
sound.</p><p>You may have heard that through a particular RAGA, a particular
sound, fire can be created. It can be created - because this is the
Indian idea, that sound is the basis of all electricity. So if you hit
sound in a particular frequency, electricity will be created.</p><p>On long bridges, if a military, is passing, they are not allowed to
march because many times it has happened that because of their march the
bridge falls. It is because of sound, not because of their weight. They
will be passing anyhow, but if they pass marching, then the particular
sound of their feet breaks the bridge.</p><p>In old Hebrew history, the city of Jericho was very protected by
great walls and it was impossible to break those walls by guns. But
through a particular sound the walls were broken, and that sound was the
secret of the breaking of those walls. If that sound is created before
walls, the walls will give way.</p><p>You have heard the story of Ali Baba: a particular sound and the rock
moves.</p><p>These are allegories. Whether they are right or not, one thing is
certain: if you can create a particular sound so continuously that
meaning is lost, mind is lost, the rock at your heart will be
removed.</p><p>THE END.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OR, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT TOUCH THE ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER.\n4. OR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN (DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF VANISHES. THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE IMPURE.\nTruth is always here. It is already the case. It is not something to be achieved in the future. YOU are the truth just here and now, so it is not something which is to be created or something which is to be devised or something which is to be sought. Understand this very clearly; then these techniques will be easy to understand and also to do.\nMind is a mechanism of desiring. Mind is always in desire, always seeking something, asking for something. Always the object is in the future; mind is not concerned with the present at all. In this very moment the mind cannot move -- there is no space. The mind needs the future in order to move. It can move either in the past or in the future. It cannot move in the present; there is no space. The truth is in the present, and mind is always in the future or in the past, so there is no meeting between mind and truth.\nWhen the mind is seeking worldly objects it is not so difficult, the problem is not absurd; it can be solved. But when the mind starts seeking the truth the very effort becomes nonsense, because the truth is here and now and the mind is always then and there. There is no meeting. So understand the first thing: you cannot seek truth. You can find it, but you cannot seek it. The very seeking is the hindrance.\nThe moment you start seeking you have moved away from the present, away from yourself, because YOU are always in the present. The seeker is always in the present and the seeking is in the future, you are not going to meet whatsoever you are seeking. Lao Tzu says, \"Seek not; otherwise you will miss. Seek not and find. Don't seek and find.\" All these techniques of Shiva's are simply turning the mind from the future or the past to the present. That which you are seeking is already there, it is the case already. The mind has to be turned from seeking to non-seeking. It is difficult. If you think about it intellectually it is very difficult. How to turn the mind from seeking to non-seeking? -- because then the mind makes non-seeking itself the object! Then the mind says, \"Don't seek.\" Then the mind says, \"I should not seek.\" Then the mind says, \"Now non-seeking is my object. Now I desire the state of desirelessness.\" The seeking has entered again, the desire has come again through the back door.\nThat is why there are people who are seeking worldly objects, and there are people who think they are seeking non-worldly objects. All objects are worldly because \"seeking\" is\nthe world.\nSo you cannot seek anything non-worldly. The moment you seek, it becomes the world. If you are seeking God, your God is part of the world. If you are seeking MOKSHA -- liberation -- NIRVANA, your liberation is part of the world, your liberation is not something that transcends the world, because seeking is the world, desiring is the world. So you cannot desire nirvana, you cannot desire non-desire. If you try to understand intellectually, it will become a puzzle.\nShiva says nothing about it, he immediately proceeds to give techniques. They are non- intellectual. He doesn't say to Devi, \"The truth is here. Don't seek it and you will find it.\" He immediately gives techniques. Those techniques are non-intellectual. Do them, and the mind turns. The turning is just a consequence, just a by-product -- not an object. The turning is just a by-product.\nIf you do a technique, your mind will turn from its journey into the future or the past. Suddenly you will find yourself in the present. That is why Buddha has given techniques, Lao Tzu has given techniques, Krishna has given techniques. But they always introduce their techniques with intellectual concepts. Only Shiva is different.\nHe immediately gives techniques, and no intellectual understanding, no intellectual introduction, because he knows that the mind is tricky, the most cunning thing possible. It can turn anything into a problem. Non-seeking will become the problem.\nThere are people who come to me who ask how not to desire. They are desiring non- desire. Somebody has told them, or they have read somewhere, or they have heard spiritual gossip, that if you do not desire you will reach bliss, if you do not desire you will be free, if you do not desire there will be no suffering. Now their minds hanker to attain that state where there is no suffering, so they ask how not to desire. Their minds are playing tricks. They are still desiring, it is only that now the object has changed. They were desiring money, they were desiring fame, they were desiring prestige, they were desiring power. Now they are desiring non-desire. Only the object has changed, and they remain the same and their desiring remains the same. But now the desire has become more deceptive.\nBecause of this, Shiva proceeds immediately with no introduction whatsoever. He immediately starts talking about techniques. Those techniques, if followed, suddenly turn your mind: it comes to the present. And when the mind comes to the present it stops, it is no more. You cannot be a mind in the present, that is impossible. Just now, if you are here and now, how can you be a mind? Thoughts cease because they cannot move.\nThe present has no space in which to move; you cannot think. If you are in this very moment, how can you move? Mind stops, you attain to no-mind.\nSo the real thing is how to be here and now. You can try, but effort may prove futile -- because if you make it a point to be in the present, then this point has moved into the future. When you ask how to be in the present, again you are asking about the future. This moment is passing in the inquiry, \"How to be present? How to be here and now?\" This present moment is passing in the inquiry, and your mind will begin to weave and create dreams in the future: some day you will be in a state of mind where there is no movement, no motive, no seeking, and then there will be bliss -- so how to be in the present?\nShiva doesn't say anything about it, he simply gives a technique. You do it, and suddenly you find you are here and now. And your being here and now is the truth, and your being\nhere and now is the freedom, and your being here and now is the nirvana.\nThe first nine techniques are concerned with breathing. So let us understand something about breathing, and then we will proceed to the techniques. We are breathing continuously from the moment of birth to the moment of death. Everything changes between these two points. Everything changes, nothing remains the same, only breathing is a constant thing between birth and death.\nThe child will become a youth; the youth will become old. He will be diseased, his body will become ugly, ill, everything will change. He will be happy, unhappy, in suffering; everything will go on changing. But whatsoever happens between these two points, one must breathe. Whether happy or unhappy, young or old, successful or unsuccessful -- whatsoever you are, it is irrelevant -- one thing is certain: between these two points of birth and death you must breathe.\nBreathing will be a continuous flow; no gap is possible. If even for a single moment you forget to breathe, you will be no more. That is why YOU are not required to breathe, because then it would be difficult. Someone might forget to breathe for a single moment, and then nothing could be done. So, really, YOU are not breathing, because YOU are not needed. You are fast asleep, and breathing goes on; you are unconscious, and breathing goes on; you are in a deep coma, and breathing goes on. YOU are not required; breathing is something which goes on in spite of you.\nIt is one of the constant factors in your personality -- that is the first thing. It is something which is very essential and basic to life -- that is the second thing. You cannot be alive without breath. So breath and life have become synonymous. Breathing is the mechanism of life, and life is deeply related with breathing. That is why in India we call it PRANA.\nWe have given one word for both -- PRANA means the vitality, the aliveness. Your life is your breath.\nThirdly, your breath is a bridge between you and your body. Constantly, breath is bridging you to your body, connecting you, relating you to your body. Not only is the breath a bridge to your body, it is also a bridge between you and the universe. The body is just the universe which has come to you, which is nearer to you.\nYour body is part of the universe. Everything in the body is part of the universe -- every particle, every cell. It is the nearest approach to the universe. Breath is the bridge. If the bridge is broken, you are no more in the body. If the bridge is broken, you are no more in the universe. You move into some unknown dimension; then you cannot be found in space and time. So, thirdly, breath is also the bridge between you, and space and time.\nBreath, therefore, becomes very significant -- the most significant thing. So the first nine techniques are concerned with breath. If you can do something with the breath, you will suddenly turn to the present. If you can do something with breath, you will attain to the source of life. If you can do something with breath, you can transcend time and space. If you can do something with breath, you will be in the world and also beyond it.\nBreath has two points. One is where it touches the body and the universe, and another is where it touches you and that which transcends the universe.\nWe know only one part of the breath. When it moves into the universe, into the body, we know it. But it is always moving from the body to the \"no-body,\" from the \"no-body\" to the body. We do not know the other point. If you become aware of the other point, the\nother part of the bridge, the other pole of the bridge, suddenly you will be transformed, transplanted into a different dimension.\nBut remember, what Shiva is going to say is not yoga, it is tantra. Yoga also works on breath, but the work of yoga and tantra is basically different. Yoga tries to systematize breathing. If you systematize your breathing your health will improve. If you systematize your breathing, if you know the secrets of breathing, your life will become longer; you will be more healthy and you will live longer. You will be more strong, more filled with energy, more vital, alive, young, fresh.\nBut tantra is not concerned with that. Tantra is concerned not with any systematization of breath, but with using breath just as a technique to turn inward. One has not to practice a particular style of breathing, a particular system of breathing or a particular rhythm of breathing -- no! One has to take breathing as it is. One has just to become aware of certain points in the breathing.\nThere are certain points, but we are not aware of them. We have been breathing and we will go on breathing -- we are born breathing and we will die breathing -- but we are not aware of certain points.\nAnd this is strange. Man is searching, probing deep into space. Man is going to the moon; man is trying to reach farther, from earth into space, and man has not yet learned the nearest part of his life. There are certain points in breathing which you have never observed, and those points are the doors -- the nearest doors to you from where you can enter into a different world, into a different being, into a different consciousness. But they are very subtle.\nTo observe a moon is not very difficult. Even to reach the moon is not very difficult; it is a gross journey. You need mechanization, you need technology, you need accumulated information, and then you can reach it. Breathing is the nearest thing to you, and the nearer a thing is, the more difficult it is to perceive it. The nearer it is, the more difficult; the more obvious it is, the more difficult. It is so near to you that again there is no space between you and your breathing. Or, there is such a small space that you will need a very minute observation, only then will you become aware of certain points. These points are the basis of these techniques.\nSo now I will take each technique. SHIVA REPLIES:\nRADIANT ONE, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY DAWN BETWEEN TWO BREATHS. AFTER BREATH COMES IN (DOWN) AND JUST BEFORE TURNING UP (OUT) -- THE BENEFICENCE.\nThat is the technique:\nRADIANT ONE, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY DAWN BETWEEN TWO BREATHS.\nAfter breath comes in -- that is, down -- and just before turning out -- that is, going up -- THE BENEFICENCE. Be aware between these two points, and the happening. When your breath comes in, observe. For a single moment, or a thousandth part of a moment, there is no breathing -- before it turns up, before it turns outward. One breath comes in; then there is a certain point and breathing stops. Then the breathing goes out. When the breath goes out, then again for a single moment, or a part of a moment, breathing stops. Then breathing comes in.\nBefore the breath is turning in or turning out, there is a moment when you are not\nbreathing. In that moment the happening is possible, because when you are not breathing you are not in the world. Understand this: when you are not breathing you are dead; you ARE still, but dead. But the moment is of such a short duration that you never observe it. For tantra, each outgoing breath is a death and each new breath is a rebirth. Breath coming in is rebirth; breath going out is death. The outgoing breath is synonymous with death; the incoming breath is synonymous with life. So with each breath you are dying and being reborn. The gap between the two is of a very short duration, but keen, sincere observation and attention will make you feel the gap. If you can feel the gap, Shiva says, THE BENEFICENCE. Then nothing else is needed.\nYou are blessed, you have known; the thing has happened.\nYou are not to train the breath. Leave it just as it is. Why such a simple technique? It looks so simple. Such a simple technique to know the truth? To know the truth means to know that which is neither born nor dies, to know that eternal element which is always. You can know the breath going out, you can know the breath coming in, but you never know the gap between the two.\nTry it. Suddenly you will get the point -- and you can get it; it is already there. Nothing is to be added to you or to your structure, it is already there. Everything is already there except a certain awareness. So how to do this? First, become aware of the breath coming in. Watch it. Forget everything, just watch breath coming in -- the very passage.\nWhen the breath touches your nostrils, feel it there. Then let the breath move in. Move with the breath fully consciously. When you are going down, down, down with the breath, do not miss the breath. Do not go ahead and do not follow behind, just go with it. Remember this: do not go ahead, do not follow it like a shadow; be simultaneous with it. Breath and consciousness should become one. The breath goes in -- you go in. Only then will it be possible to get the point which is between two breaths. It will not be easy. Move in with the breath, then move out with the breath: in-out, in-out.\nBuddha tried particularly to use this method, so this method has become a Buddhist method. In Buddhist terminology it is known as Anapanasati Yoga. And Buddha's enlightenment was based on this technique -- only this.\nAll the religions of the world, all the seers of the world, have reached through some technique or other, and all those techniques will be in these one hundred and twelve techniques. This first one is a Buddhist technique. It has become known in the world as a Buddhist technique because Buddha attained his enlightenment through this technique. Buddha said, \"Be aware of your breath as it is coming in, going out -- coming in, going out.\" He never mentions the gap because there is no need. Buddha thought and felt that if you become concerned with the gap, the gap between two breaths, that concern may disturb your awareness. So he simply said, \"Be aware. When the breath is going in move with it, and when the breath is going out move with it. Do simply this: going in, going out, with the breath.\" He never says anything about the latter part of the technique.\nThe reason is that Buddha was talking with very ordinary men, and even that might create a desire to attain the interval. That desire to attain the interval will become a barrier to awareness, because if you are desiring to get to the interval you will move ahead. Breath will be coming in, and you will move ahead because you are interested in the gap which is going to be in the future.\nBuddha never mentions it, so Buddha's technique is just half.\nBut the other half follows automatically. If you go on practicing breath consciousness, breath awareness, suddenly, one day, without knowing, you will come to the interval. Because as your awareness will become keen and deep and intense, as your awareness will become bracketed -- the whole world is bracketed out; only your breath coming in or going out is your world, the whole arena for your consciousness -- suddenly you are bound to feel the gap in which there is no breath.\nWhen you are moving with breath minutely, when there is no breath, how can you remain unaware? You will suddenly become aware that there is no breath, and the moment will come when you will feel that the breath is neither going out nor coming in. The breath has stopped completely. In that stopping, THE BENEFICENCE.\nThis one technique is enough for millions. The whole of Asia tried and lived with this technique for centuries. Tibet, China, Japan, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon -- the whole of Asia except India has tried this technique. Only one technique and thousands and thousands have attained enlightenment through it. And this is only the first technique. But unfortunately, because the technique became associated with Buddha's name, Hindus have been trying to avoid it. Because it became more and more known as a Buddhist method, Hindus have completely forgotten it.\nAnd not only that, they have also tried to avoid it for another reason. Because this technique is the first technique mentioned by Shiva, many Buddhists have claimed that this book, VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA, is a Buddhist book, not a Hindu book. It is neither Hindu nor Buddhist -- a technique is just a technique. Buddha used it, but it was there already to be used. Buddha became a buddha, an enlightened one, because of\nthe technique. The technique preceded Buddha; the technique was already there. Try it. It is one of the most simple techniques -- simple compared to other techniques; I am not saying simple for you. Other techniques will be more difficult. That is why it is mentioned as the first technique.\nThe second technique -- all these nine techniques are concerned with breath.\nAS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP, AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP TO DOWN -- THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE.\nIt is the same, but with a slight difference. The emphasis is now not on the gap, but on the turning. The outgoing and ingoing breath make a circle. Remember, these are not two parallel lines. We always think of them as two parallel lines -- breath going in and breath going out. Do you think that these are two parallel lines? They are not. Breath going in is half the circle; breath going out is the other half of the circle.\nSo understand this: first, breathing in and out creates a circle.\nThey are not parallel lines, because parallel lines never meet anywhere. Secondly, the breath coming in and the breath going out are not two breaths, they are one breath. The same breath which comes in, goes out, so it must have a turn inside. It must turn somewhere. There must be a point where the incoming breath becomes outgoing.\nWhy put such emphasis upon turning? Because, Shiva says, AS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP TO DOWN,\nTHROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE. Very simple, but he says: realize the turns and you will realize the self.\nWhy the turn? If you know driving you know about gears. Each time you change the\ngear, you have to pass through the neutral gear, which is not a gear at all. From the first gear you move to the second or from the second to the third, but always you have to move through the neutral gear. That neutral gear is a turning point. In that turning point the first gear becomes the second and the second becomes the third. When your breath goes in and turns out, it passes through the neutral gear; otherwise it cannot turn out. It passes through the neutral territory.\nIn that neutral territory you are neither a body nor a soul, neither physical nor mental, because the physical is a gear of your being and the mental is another gear of your being. You go on moving from gear to gear, but you must have a neutral gear where you are neither body nor mind.\nIn that neutral gear you simply are: you are simply an existence -- pure, simple, unembodied, with no mind.\nThat is why there is the emphasis on the turn. Man is a machine -- a large, very complicated machine. You have many gears in your body, many gears in your mind. You are not aware of your great mechanism, but you are a great machine. And it is good that you are not aware; otherwise you could go mad. The body is such a great machine that scientists say if we had to create a factory parallel to the human body, it would require four square miles of land, and the noise would be such that one hundred square miles of land would be disturbed by it.\nThe body is a great mechanical device -- the greatest. You have millions and millions of cells and each cell is alive. So you are a big city of seventy million cells; there are seventy million citizens inside you, and the whole city is running very silently, smoothly. Every moment the mechanism is working. It is very complicated. These techniques will be related at many points with the mechanism of your body and the mechanism of your mind. But always the emphasis will be on those points where suddenly you are not part of the mechanism -- remember this. Suddenly you are not part of the mechanism. There are moments when you change gears.\nFor example, in the night when you drop into sleep you change gears, because during the day you need a different mechanism for a waking consciousness -- a different part of the mind functions.\nThen you drop into sleep, and that part becomes non-functioning. Another part of the mind begins to function, and there is a gap, an interval, a turning. A gear is changed. In the morning when you are again getting up, the gear is changed. You are silently sitting, and suddenly someone says something and you get angry -- you move into a different gear. That is why everything changes.\nIf you get angry, your breathing will suddenly change. Your breathing will become irritated, chaotic. A trembling will get into your breathing; you will feel suffocated. Your whole body would like to do something, shatter something, only then can the suffocation disappear. Your breathing will change; your blood will take a different rhythm, a different movement. Different chemicals will have to be released in the body, the whole glandular system will have to change. You become a different man when you are angry. A car is standing... you start it. Do not put it in any gear, let it be in neutral. It will go on pulling, vibrating, trembling, but it cannot move; it will get hot. That is why, when you are angry and you cannot do something, you will get hot. The mechanism is ready to run and do something and you are not doing -- you will get hot. You are a mechanism, but, of course, not only a mechanism. You are more, but the \"more\" has to be found. When you\nget into a gear, everything changes inside.\nWhen you change the gear, there is a turning. Shiva says,\nAS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP, AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP TO DOWN -- THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE.\nBe aware at the turn. But it is a very short turn; very minute observation will be needed. And we are just without any observing capacity; we cannot observe anything. If I say to you, \"Observe this flower; observe this flower which I give to you,\" you cannot observe it. For a single moment you will see it, and then you will begin to think of something else. It may be about the flower, but it will not be THE FLOWER. You may think about the flower, about how beautiful it is -- then you have moved. Now the flower is no more in your observation, your field has changed. You may say that it is red, it is blue, it is white... then you have moved. Observation means remaining with no word, with no verbalization, with no bubbling inside -- just remaining WITH. If you can remain with a flower for three minutes, completely, with no movement of the mind, the thing will happen -- the beneficence. You will realize.\nBut we are not at all observers. We are not aware, we are not alert; we cannot pay attention to anything. We just go on jumping. This is part of our heritage, our monkey heritage. Our mind is just the growth of the monkey mind, so the monkey moves on. He goes on jumping from here to there.\nThe monkey cannot sit still. That is why Buddha insisted so much on just sitting without any movement, because then the monkey mind is not allowed to go on its way.\nIn Japan they have a particular type of meditation which they call Zazen. The word 'zazen' in Japan means just sitting, doing nothing. No movement is allowed. One is just sitting like a statue -- dead, not moving at all. But there is no need to sit like a statue for years together. If you can observe the turn of your breath without any movement of the mind, you will enter. You will enter into yourself or into the beyond within.\nWhy are these turnings so important? They are important because on turning, the breath leaves you to move in a different direction. It was with you when it was coming in; it will be with you again when it goes out. But at the turning point it is not with you and you are not with it. In that moment the breath is different from you, and you are different from it: if breathing is life, then you are dead; if breathing is your body, then you are no-body; if breathing is your mind, then you are no-mind... in that moment.\nI wonder whether you have observed it or not: if you stop your breath, the mind stops suddenly. If you stop your breath just now, your mind will stop suddenly; the mind cannot function. A sudden stoppage of breath and the mind stops. Why? Because they are disjoined.\nOnly a moving breath is joined with the mind, with the body; a non-moving breath is disjoined. Then you are in the neutral gear. The car is running, the power is on, the car is making a noise -- it is ready to go forward -- but it is not in gear, so the body of the car and the mechanism of the car are not joined. The car is divided into two. It is ready to move, but the moving mechanism is not joined with it.\nThe same happens when breath takes a turn. You are not joined with it. In that moment you can easily become aware of who you are. What is this being? What is it to be? Who is inside this house of the body? Who is the master? Am I just the house or is there some\nmaster also? Am I just the mechanism or does something else also penetrate this mechanism? In that turning gap, Shiva says, REALIZE. He says just be aware of the turning, and you become a realized soul.\nThe third technique:\nOR, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT TOUCH THE ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER.\nWe are divided into the center and the periphery. The body is the periphery; we know the body, we know the periphery. We know the circumference, but we do not know where the center is. When the out-breath fuses with the in-breath, when they become one, when you cannot say whether it is the out-breath or the in-breath... when it is difficult to demarcate and define whether the breath is going out or coming in, when the breath has penetrated in and starts moving out, there is a moment of fusion.\nIt is neither going out nor moving in. The breath is static. When it is moving out it is dynamic; when it is coming in it is dynamic. When it is neither, when it is silent, non- moving, you are near to the center. The fusion point of the in and outgoing breath is your center.\nLook at it in this way: when the breath goes in, where does it go? It goes to your center, it touches your center. When it goes out, from where does it go out? It moves from your center. Your center has to be touched. That is why Taoist mystics and Zen mystics say that the head is not the center, the navel is your center. The breath goes to the navel, then it moves out. It goes to the center.\nAs I said, it is a bridge between you and your body. You know the body, but you do not know where your center is. The breath is constantly going to the center and moving out, but we are not taking enough breath. Thus, ordinarily it does not really go to the center -- now, at least, it is not going to the center. That is why everyone feels \"off-center.\" In the whole modern world, those who can think at all feel they are missing their center.\nLook at a child sleeping, observe his breath. The breath goes in; the abdomen comes up. The chest remains unaffected. That is why children have no chests, only abdomens -- very dynamic abdomens. The breath goes in and the abdomen comes up; the breath goes out and the abdomen goes down.\n.. the abdomen moves. Children are in their center, at their center. That is why they are so happy, so bliss-filled, so energy-filled, never tired -- overflowing, and always in the present moment with no past, no future.\nA child can be angry. When he is angry, he is totally angry; he becomes the anger. Then his anger is also a beautiful thing. When one is totally angry, anger has a beauty of its own, because totality always has beauty.\nYou cannot be angry and beautiful, you will become ugly, because partiality is always ugly. And not only with anger. When you love you are ugly because you are again partial, fragmentary; you are not total. Look at your face when you are loving someone, making love. Make love before a mirror and look at your face -- it will be ugly, animal- like. In love also your face becomes ugly. Why? Love is also a conflict, you are withholding something. You are giving very miserly. Even in your love you are not total; you do not give completely, wholly.\nA child even in anger and violence is total. His face becomes radiant and beautiful; he is here and now. His anger is not something concerned with the past or something\nconcerned with the future, he is not calculating, he is just angry. The child is at his center. When you are at your center you are always total. Whatsoever you do will be a total act; good or bad, it will be total. When you are fragmentary, when you are off-center, your every act is bound to be a fragment of yourself.\nYour totality is not responding, just a part, and the part is going against the whole -- -that creates ugliness.\nWe all were children. Why is it that as we grow our breathing becomes shallow? It never goes to the abdomen; it never touches the navel. If it could go down more and more it would become less and less shallow, but it just touches the chest and goes out. It never goes to the center. You are afraid of the center, because if you go to the center you will become total. If you want to be fragmentary, this is the mechanism to be fragmentary.\nYou love -- if you breathe from the center, you will flow in it totally. You are afraid. You are afraid to be so vulnerable, so open to someone, to anyone. You may call him your lover, you may call her your beloved, but you are afraid. The other is there. If you are totally vulnerable, open, you do not know what is going to happen. Then YOU ARE completely, in another sense. You are afraid to be so completely given to someone. You cannot breathe; you cannot take a deep breath. You cannot relax your breathing so that it goes to the center -- because the moment breathing goes to the center your act becomes total.\nBecause you are afraid of being total, you breathe shallowly. You breathe just at the minimum, not at the maximum. That is why life seems so lifeless. If you are breathing at the minimum, life will become lifeless; you are living at the minimum, not at the maximum.\nYou can live at the maximum -- then life is an overflowing. But then there will be difficulty. You cannot be a husband, you cannot be a wife, if life is overflowing. Everything will become difficult.\nIf life is overflowing, love will be overflowing. Then you cannot stick to one. Then you will be flowing all over; all dimensions will be filled by you. And then the mind feels danger, so it is better not to be alive. The more you are dead, the more you are secure. The more you are dead, the more everything is in control. You can control; then you remain the master. You feel that you are the master because you can control. You can control your anger, you can control your love, you can control everything. But this controlling is possible only at the minimum level of your energy.\nEveryone must have felt at some time or other that there are moments when he suddenly changes from the minimum level to the maximum. You go out to a hill station. Suddenly you are out of the city and the prison of it. You feel free. The sky is vast, and the forest is green, and the height touches the clouds. Suddenly you take a deep breath. You may not have observed it.\nNow if you go to a hill station, observe. It is not really the hill station that makes the change. It is your breathing. You take a deep breath. You say, \"Ah! Ah!\" You touch the center, you become total for a moment, and everything is bliss.\nThat bliss is not coming from the hill station, that bliss is coming from your center -- you have touched it suddenly.\nYou were afraid in the city. Everywhere there were others present and you were controlling. You could not scream, you could not laugh. What a misfortune! You could\nnot sing on the street and dance. You were afraid -- a policeman was somewhere around the corner, or the priest or the judge or the politician or the moralist. Someone was just around the corner, so you could not just dance in the street.\nBertrand Russell has said somewhere, \"I love civilization, but we have achieved civilization at a very great cost.\" You cannot dance in the streets, but you go to a hill station and suddenly you can dance. You are alone with the sky, and the sky is not an imprisonment. It is just opening, opening and opening -- vast, infinite. Suddenly you take a breath deeply, it touches the center and the bliss. But it is not so for long. Within an hour or two, the hill station will disappear. You may be there, but the hill station will disappear.\nYour worries will come back. You will begin to think to make a call to the city, to write a letter to your wife, or you will begin to think that since after three days you are going back you should make arrangements. You have just reached and you are making arrangements to leave. You are back.\nThat breath was not from you really; it suddenly happened.\nBecause of the change of situation the gear changed. You were in a new situation, you could not breathe in the old way, so for a moment a new breath came in. It touched the center, and you felt the bliss.\nShiva says you are every moment touching the center, or if you are not touching you CAN touch it. Take deep, slow breaths. Touch the center; do not breathe from the chest -- that is a trick. Civilization, education, morality, they have created shallow breathing. It will be good to go deep into the center, because otherwise you cannot take deep breaths. Unless humanity becomes non-suppressive toward sex, man cannot breathe really. If the breath goes deep down to the abdomen, it gives energy to the sex center. It touches the sex center; it massages the sex center from within. The sex center becomes more active, more alive. Civilization is afraid of sex. We do not allow our children to touch their sex centers, their sex organs. We say, \"Stop! Don't touch!\"\nLook at a child when he first touches his sex center, and then say \"Stop!\" and then observe his breathing. When you say \"Stop! Don't touch your sex center!\" the breath will become shallow immediately -- because it is not only his hand which is touching the sex center, deep down the breath is touching it. And if the breath goes on touching at, it is difficult to stop the hand. If the hand stops, then basically it is necessary, required, that the breath should not touch, should not go deep.\nIt must remain shallow.\nWe are afraid of sex. The lower part of the body is not only lower physically, it has become lower as a value. It is condemned as \"lower.\" So do not go deep, just remain shallow. It is unfortunate that we can only breathe downwards. If some preachers were allowed, they would change the whole mechanism. They would only allow you to breathe upward into the head. Then you would absolutely not feel sex.\nIf we are to create a sexless humanity, then we will have to change the breathing system. The breath must go into the head, to the SAHASRAR -- the seventh center in the head -- then come back to the mouth. This should be the passage: from the mouth to the sahasrar. It must not go deep down because down is dangerous. The deeper you go, the nearer you reach to the deeper layers of biology. You reach to the center, and that center is just near the sex center -- just near. It has to be, because sex is life.\nLook at it in this way: breath is life from above downwards; sex is life from just the other\ncorner -- from down upwards. Sex energy is flowing and breath energy is flowing. The breath passage is in the upper body and the sex passage is in the lower body. When they meet they create life; when they meet they create biology, bio-energy. So if you are afraid of sex, create a distance between the two, do not allow them to meet. So really, civilized man is a castrated man; that is why we do not know about breath, and this sutra will be difficult to understand.\nShiva says, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT TOUCH THE ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER. He uses very\ncontradictory terms: \"energy-less, energy-filled.\" It is energy-less because your bodies, your minds, cannot give any energy to it. Your body energy is not there, your mind energy is not there, so it is energy-less as far as you know your identity. But it is energy- filled because it has the cosmic source of energy, not because of your body energy.\nYour body energy is just fuel energy. It is nothing but petrol. You eat something, you drink something -- it creates energy. It is just giving fuel to the body. Stop eating and drinking and your body will fall dead. Not just now, it will take three months at least, because you have reservoirs of petrol. You have accumulated much energy; it can run for at least three months without going to any petrol station. It can run; it has a reservoir. For an emergency, any emergency, you may need it.\nThis is \"fuel\" energy. The center is not getting any fuel energy. That is why Shiva says it is energy-less. It is not dependent on your eating and drinking. It is connected with the cosmic source; it is cosmic energy. That is why he says ENERGY- LESS, ENERGY- FILLED CENTER. The moment you can feel the center from where breath goes out or comes in, the very point where the breaths fuse -- that center -- if you become aware of it, then enlightenment.\nThe fourth technique:\nOR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN (DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF\nVANISHES. THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE IMPURE. But then it is difficult for everyone because, he says, THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE IMPURE. But who is the pure one? It is difficult for you; you cannot practice it. But you can feel it sometimes suddenly. You are driving a car and suddenly you feel there is going to be an accident. Breathing will stop. If it is out, it will remain out. If it is in, it will remain in.\nYou cannot breathe in such an emergency; you cannot afford it. Everything stops, departs.\nOR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN (DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF\nVANISHES: Your small self is only a daily utility. In emergencies you cannot remember it. Who you are -- the name, the bank balance, the prestige, everything -- just evaporates. Your car is just heading toward another car; another moment and there will be death. In this moment there will be a pause. Even for the impure there will be a pause. Suddenly breathing stops. If you can be aware in that moment, you can reach the goal.\nZen monks have tried this method very much in Japan. That is why their methods seem very weird, absurd, strange. They have done many inconceivable things.\nA master will throw someone out of the house. Suddenly the master will begin slapping the disciple without any rhyme or reason, without any cause.\nYou were sitting with your master and everything was okay. You were just chit-chatting, and he will begin to beat you in order to create the pause. If there is any cause the pause cannot be created. If you had abused the master and he starts beating you there is a causality, your mind understands: \"I abused him, and he is beating me.\"\nReally, your mind was expecting it already, so there is no gap. But remember, a Zen master will not beat you if you abuse him, he will laugh, because then laughter can create the pause. You were abusing him and you were saying nonsense things to him, and you expected anger. But he starts laughing or dancing. That is sudden; that will create the pause. You cannot understand it. If you cannot understand the mind stops, and when the mind stops, breathing stops. Either way -- if breathing stops, mind stops; if mind stops, breathing stops.\nYou were appreciating the master and you were feeling good, and you were thinking, \"Now the master must be pleased.\" And suddenly he takes his staff and begins to beat you -- and mercilessly, because Zen masters are merciless. He begins to beat you; you cannot understand what is happening. The mind stops, there is a pause. If you know the technique, you can attain to your self.\nThere are many stories that someone attained buddhahood because the teacher suddenly started beating him. You cannot understand it -- what nonsense! How can one attain buddhahood by being beaten by someone, or by being thrown out of the window by someone? Even if someone kills you, you cannot attain buddhahood. But if you understand this technique, then it becomes easy to understand.\nIn the West particularly, in the last thirty or forty years Zen has become very much prevalent -- a fashion. But unless they know this technique, they cannot understand Zen. They can imitate it, but imitation is of no use. Rather, it is dangerous. These are not things to be imitated.\nThe whole Zen technique is based on the fourth technique of Shiva. But this is unfortunate. Now we will have to import Zen from Japan because we have lost the whole tradition; we do not know it. Shiva was the expert par excellence of this method. When he came to marry Devi with his BARAT, his procession, the whole city must have felt the pause... the whole city!\nDevi's father was not willing to marry his girl to this \"hippie\" -- Shiva was the original hippie. Devi's father was totally against him, and no father would permit this marriage. So we cannot say anything against Devi's father. No father would permit his daughter's marriage to Shiva. But Devi insisted so he had to agree -- unwillingly, unhappily, but he agreed.\nThen came the marriage procession. It is said that people began to run, seeing Shiva and his procession. The whole barat must have taken LSD, marijuana. They were \"high.\" And really, LSD and marijuana are just the beginning. Shiva knew and his friends and disciples knew the ultimate psychedelic -- SOMA RASA. Aldous Huxley has named the ultimate psychedelic \"soma\" only because of Shiva. They were high, just dancing, screaming, laughing. The whole city fled. It must have felt the pause.\nAny sudden, unexpected, unbelievable thing can create the pause for the impure. But for the pure there is no need of such things. For the pure, the pause is always there. Many\ntimes, for pure minds, breathing stops. If your mind is pure -- pure means you are not desiring, hankering, seeking anything -- silently pure, innocently pure, you can be sitting and suddenly your breath will stop.\nRemember this: mind movement needs breath movement. Mind moving fast needs fast movement in breath. That is why when you are in anger, breath will move fast. In the sex act, the breath will move very fast. That is why in Ayurveda- a system of herbal medicine in India- it is said that your life will be shortened if too much sex is allowed. Your life will he shortened, according to Ayurveda, because Ayurveda measures your life in breaths. If your breathing is too fast, your life will be shortened.\nModern medicine says that sex helps blood circulation, sex helps relaxation. And those who suppress their sex may get into trouble -- particularly heart trouble. They are right and Ayurveda is also right, but they seem contradictory. But Ayurveda was invented five thousand years before. Every man was doing much labor: life was labor, so there was no need to relax, there was no need to create artificial devices for blood circulation.\nBut now, for those who are not doing much physical labor, sex is their only labor. That is why modern medicine is also right for modern man. He is not doing any physical exertion, so sex gives the exertion: the heart beats more, the blood circulates faster, the breathing becomes deep and goes to the center. So after the sex act you feel relaxed and you can fall into sleep easily. Freud says that sex is the best tranquillizer, and it is -- at least for modern man.\nIn sex breathing will become fast; in anger breathing will become fast. In sex the mind is filled with desire, lust, impurity. When the mind is pure -- no desire in the mind, no seeking, no motivation; you are not going anywhere, but just remaining here and now as an innocent pool... not even a ripple -- then breathing stops automatically. There is no need for it.\nOn this path, the small self vanishes and you attain to the higher self, the supreme self. I think this will do for today.\nTHE END.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8605","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_secrets/>Chapter 1.rtf</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 3- Breath-a bridge to the universe</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8605 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Book_of_Secrets/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
<a href=part4>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark2>‌</span>Chapter 3: Breath-- a bridge to the
universe</p><p><br></p><p>SUTRAS:</p><p>SHIVA REPLIES:</p><p>1. RADIANT ONE, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY DAWN BETWEEN TWO BREATHS. AFTER
BREATH COMES IN (DOWN) AND JUST BEFORE TURNING UP (OUT) -- THE
BENEFICENCE.</p><p>2. AS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP, AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM
UP TO DOWN -- THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE.</p><p>3. OR, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT TOUCH
THE ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER.</p><p>4. OR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN
(DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF
VANISHES. THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE IMPURE.</p><p>Truth is always here. It is already the case. It is not something to
be achieved in the future. YOU are the truth just here and now, so it is
not something which is to be created or something which is to be devised
or something which is to be sought. Understand this very clearly; then
these techniques will be easy to understand and also to do.</p><p>Mind is a mechanism of desiring. Mind is always in desire, always
seeking something, asking for something. Always the object is in the
future; mind is not concerned with the present at all. In this very
moment the mind cannot move -- there is no space. The mind needs the
future in order to move. It can move either in the past or in the
future. It cannot move in the present; there is no space. The truth is
in the present, and mind is always in the future or in the past, so
there is no meeting between mind and truth.</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind is seeking worldly objects it is not so difficult, the
problem is not absurd; it can be solved. But when the mind starts
seeking the truth the very effort becomes nonsense, because the truth is
here and now and the mind is always then and there. There is no meeting.
So understand the first thing: you cannot seek truth. You can find it,
but you cannot seek it. The very seeking is the hindrance.</p><p>The moment you start seeking you have moved away from the present,
away from yourself, because YOU are always in the present. The seeker is
always in the present and the seeking is in the future, you are not
going to meet whatsoever you are seeking. Lao Tzu says, "Seek not;
otherwise you will miss. Seek not and find. Don't seek and find." All
these techniques of Shiva's are simply turning the mind from the future
or the past to the present. That which you are seeking is already there,
it is the case already. The mind has to be turned from seeking to
non-seeking. It is difficult. If you think about it intellectually it is
very difficult. How to turn the mind from seeking to non-seeking? --
because then the mind makes non-seeking itself the object! Then the mind
says, "Don't seek." Then the mind says, "I should not seek." Then the
mind says, "Now non-seeking is my object. Now I desire the state of
desirelessness." The seeking has entered again, the desire has come
again through the back door.</p><p>That is why there are people who are seeking worldly objects, and
there are people who think they are seeking non-worldly objects. All
objects are worldly because "seeking" is</p><p>the world.</p><p>So you cannot seek anything non-worldly. The moment you seek, it
becomes the world. If you are seeking God, your God is part of the
world. If you are seeking MOKSHA -- liberation -- NIRVANA, your
liberation is part of the world, your liberation is not something that
transcends the world, because seeking is the world, desiring is the
world. So you cannot desire nirvana, you cannot desire non-desire. If
you try to understand intellectually, it will become a puzzle.</p><p>Shiva says nothing about it, he immediately proceeds to give
techniques. They are non- intellectual. He doesn't say to Devi, "The
truth is here. Don't seek it and you will find it." He immediately gives
techniques. Those techniques are non-intellectual. Do them, and the mind
turns. The turning is just a consequence, just a by-product -- not an
object. The turning is just a by-product.</p><p>If you do a technique, your mind will turn from its journey into the
future or the past. Suddenly you will find yourself in the present. That
is why Buddha has given techniques, Lao Tzu has given techniques,
Krishna has given techniques. But they always introduce their techniques
with intellectual concepts. Only Shiva is different.</p><p>He immediately gives techniques, and no intellectual understanding,
no intellectual introduction, because he knows that the mind is tricky,
the most cunning thing possible. It can turn anything into a problem.
Non-seeking will become the problem.</p><p>There are people who come to me who ask how not to desire. They are
desiring non- desire. Somebody has told them, or they have read
somewhere, or they have heard spiritual gossip, that if you do not
desire you will reach bliss, if you do not desire you will be free, if
you do not desire there will be no suffering. Now their minds hanker to
attain that state where there is no suffering, so they ask how not to
desire. Their minds are playing tricks. They are still desiring, it is
only that now the object has changed. They were desiring money, they
were desiring fame, they were desiring prestige, they were desiring
power. Now they are desiring non-desire. Only the object has changed,
and they remain the same and their desiring remains the same. But now
the desire has become more deceptive.</p><p>Because of this, Shiva proceeds immediately with no introduction
whatsoever. He immediately starts talking about techniques. Those
techniques, if followed, suddenly turn your mind: it comes to the
present. And when the mind comes to the present it stops, it is no more.
You cannot be a mind in the present, that is impossible. Just now, if
you are here and now, how can you be a mind? Thoughts cease because they
cannot move.</p><p>The present has no space in which to move; you cannot think. If you
are in this very moment, how can you move? Mind stops, you attain to
no-mind.</p><p>So the real thing is how to be here and now. You can try, but effort
may prove futile -- because if you make it a point to be in the present,
then this point has moved into the future. When you ask how to be in the
present, again you are asking about the future. This moment is passing
in the inquiry, "How to be present? How to be here and now?" This
present moment is passing in the inquiry, and your mind will begin to
weave and create dreams in the future: some day you will be in a state
of mind where there is no movement, no motive, no seeking, and then
there will be bliss -- so how to be in the present?</p><p>Shiva doesn't say anything about it, he simply gives a technique. You
do it, and suddenly you find you are here and now. And your being here
and now is the truth, and your being</p><p>here and now is the freedom, and your being here and now is the
nirvana.</p><p>The first nine techniques are concerned with breathing. So let us
understand something about breathing, and then we will proceed to the
techniques. We are breathing continuously from the moment of birth to
the moment of death. Everything changes between these two points.
Everything changes, nothing remains the same, only breathing is a
constant thing between birth and death.</p><p><br></p><p>The child will become a youth; the youth will become old. He will be
diseased, his body will become ugly, ill, everything will change. He
will be happy, unhappy, in suffering; everything will go on changing.
But whatsoever happens between these two points, one must breathe.
Whether happy or unhappy, young or old, successful or unsuccessful --
whatsoever you are, it is irrelevant -- one thing is certain: between
these two points of birth and death you must breathe.</p><p>Breathing will be a continuous flow; no gap is possible. If even for
a single moment you forget to breathe, you will be no more. That is why
YOU are not required to breathe, because then it would be difficult.
Someone might forget to breathe for a single moment, and then nothing
could be done. So, really, YOU are not breathing, because YOU are not
needed. You are fast asleep, and breathing goes on; you are unconscious,
and breathing goes on; you are in a deep coma, and breathing goes on.
YOU are not required; breathing is something which goes on in spite of
you.</p><p>It is one of the constant factors in your personality -- that is the
first thing. It is something which is very essential and basic to life
-- that is the second thing. You cannot be alive without breath. So
breath and life have become synonymous. Breathing is the mechanism of
life, and life is deeply related with breathing. That is why in India we
call it PRANA.</p><p>We have given one word for both -- PRANA means the vitality, the
aliveness. Your life is your breath.</p><p>Thirdly, your breath is a bridge between you and your body.
Constantly, breath is bridging you to your body, connecting you,
relating you to your body. Not only is the breath a bridge to your body,
it is also a bridge between you and the universe. The body is just the
universe which has come to you, which is nearer to you.</p><p>Your body is part of the universe. Everything in the body is part of
the universe -- every particle, every cell. It is the nearest approach
to the universe. Breath is the bridge. If the bridge is broken, you are
no more in the body. If the bridge is broken, you are no more in the
universe. You move into some unknown dimension; then you cannot be found
in space and time. So, thirdly, breath is also the bridge between you,
and space and time.</p><p>Breath, therefore, becomes very significant -- the most significant
thing. So the first nine techniques are concerned with breath. If you
can do something with the breath, you will suddenly turn to the present.
If you can do something with breath, you will attain to the source of
life. If you can do something with breath, you can transcend time and
space. If you can do something with breath, you will be in the world and
also beyond it.</p><p>Breath has two points. One is where it touches the body and the
universe, and another is where it touches you and that which transcends
the universe.</p><p>We know only one part of the breath. When it moves into the universe,
into the body, we know it. But it is always moving from the body to the
"no-body," from the "no-body" to the body. We do not know the other
point. If you become aware of the other point, the</p><p>other part of the bridge, the other pole of the bridge, suddenly you
will be transformed, transplanted into a different dimension.</p><p>But remember, what Shiva is going to say is not yoga, it is tantra.
Yoga also works on breath, but the work of yoga and tantra is basically
different. Yoga tries to systematize breathing. If you systematize your
breathing your health will improve. If you systematize your breathing,
if you know the secrets of breathing, your life will become longer; you
will be more healthy and you will live longer. You will be more strong,
more filled with energy, more vital, alive, young, fresh.</p><p>But tantra is not concerned with that. Tantra is concerned not with
any systematization of breath, but with using breath just as a technique
to turn inward. One has not to practice a particular style of breathing,
a particular system of breathing or a particular rhythm of breathing --
no! One has to take breathing as it is. One has just to become aware of
certain points in the breathing.</p><p>There are certain points, but we are not aware of them. We have been
breathing and we will go on breathing -- we are born breathing and we
will die breathing -- but we are not aware of certain points.</p><p>And this is strange. Man is searching, probing deep into space. Man
is going to the moon; man is trying to reach farther, from earth into
space, and man has not yet learned the nearest part of his life. There
are certain points in breathing which you have never observed, and those
points are the doors -- the nearest doors to you from where you can
enter into a different world, into a different being, into a different
consciousness. But they are very subtle.</p><p>To observe a moon is not very difficult. Even to reach the moon is
not very difficult; it is a gross journey. You need mechanization, you
need technology, you need accumulated information, and then you can
reach it. Breathing is the nearest thing to you, and the nearer a thing
is, the more difficult it is to perceive it. The nearer it is, the more
difficult; the more obvious it is, the more difficult. It is so near to
you that again there is no space between you and your breathing. Or,
there is such a small space that you will need a very minute
observation, only then will you become aware of certain points. These
points are the basis of these techniques.</p><p>So now I will take each technique. SHIVA REPLIES:</p><p>RADIANT ONE, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY DAWN BETWEEN TWO BREATHS. AFTER
BREATH COMES IN (DOWN) AND JUST BEFORE TURNING UP (OUT) -- THE
BENEFICENCE.</p><p>That is the technique:</p><p>RADIANT ONE, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY DAWN BETWEEN TWO BREATHS.</p><p><br></p><p>After breath comes in -- that is, down -- and just before turning out
-- that is, going up -- THE BENEFICENCE. Be aware between these two
points, and the happening. When your breath comes in, observe. For a
single moment, or a thousandth part of a moment, there is no breathing
-- before it turns up, before it turns outward. One breath comes in;
then there is a certain point and breathing stops. Then the breathing
goes out. When the breath goes out, then again for a single moment, or a
part of a moment, breathing stops. Then breathing comes in.</p><p>Before the breath is turning in or turning out, there is a moment
when you are not</p><p>breathing. In that moment the happening is possible, because when you
are not breathing you are not in the world. Understand this: when you
are not breathing you are dead; you ARE still, but dead. But the moment
is of such a short duration that you never observe it. For tantra, each
outgoing breath is a death and each new breath is a rebirth. Breath
coming in is rebirth; breath going out is death. The outgoing breath is
synonymous with death; the incoming breath is synonymous with life. So
with each breath you are dying and being reborn. The gap between the two
is of a very short duration, but keen, sincere observation and attention
will make you feel the gap. If you can feel the gap, Shiva says, THE
BENEFICENCE. Then nothing else is needed.</p><p>You are blessed, you have known; the thing has happened.</p><p>You are not to train the breath. Leave it just as it is. Why such a
simple technique? It looks so simple. Such a simple technique to know
the truth? To know the truth means to know that which is neither born
nor dies, to know that eternal element which is always. You can know the
breath going out, you can know the breath coming in, but you never know
the gap between the two.</p><p>Try it. Suddenly you will get the point -- and you can get it; it is
already there. Nothing is to be added to you or to your structure, it is
already there. Everything is already there except a certain awareness.
So how to do this? First, become aware of the breath coming in. Watch
it. Forget everything, just watch breath coming in -- the very
passage.</p><p>When the breath touches your nostrils, feel it there. Then let the
breath move in. Move with the breath fully consciously. When you are
going down, down, down with the breath, do not miss the breath. Do not
go ahead and do not follow behind, just go with it. Remember this: do
not go ahead, do not follow it like a shadow; be simultaneous with it.
Breath and consciousness should become one. The breath goes in -- you go
in. Only then will it be possible to get the point which is between two
breaths. It will not be easy. Move in with the breath, then move out
with the breath: in-out, in-out.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha tried particularly to use this method, so this method has
become a Buddhist method. In Buddhist terminology it is known as
Anapanasati Yoga. And Buddha's enlightenment was based on this technique
-- only this.</p><p>All the religions of the world, all the seers of the world, have
reached through some technique or other, and all those techniques will
be in these one hundred and twelve techniques. This first one is a
Buddhist technique. It has become known in the world as a Buddhist
technique because Buddha attained his enlightenment through this
technique. Buddha said, "Be aware of your breath as it is coming in,
going out -- coming in, going out." He never mentions the gap because
there is no need. Buddha thought and felt that if you become concerned
with the gap, the gap between two breaths, that concern may disturb your
awareness. So he simply said, "Be aware. When the breath is going in
move with it, and when the breath is going out move with it. Do simply
this: going in, going out, with the breath." He never says anything
about the latter part of the technique.</p><p>The reason is that Buddha was talking with very ordinary men, and
even that might create a desire to attain the interval. That desire to
attain the interval will become a barrier to awareness, because if you
are desiring to get to the interval you will move ahead. Breath will be
coming in, and you will move ahead because you are interested in the gap
which is going to be in the future.</p><p>Buddha never mentions it, so Buddha's technique is just half.</p><p>But the other half follows automatically. If you go on practicing
breath consciousness, breath awareness, suddenly, one day, without
knowing, you will come to the interval. Because as your awareness will
become keen and deep and intense, as your awareness will become
bracketed -- the whole world is bracketed out; only your breath coming
in or going out is your world, the whole arena for your consciousness --
suddenly you are bound to feel the gap in which there is no breath.</p><p>When you are moving with breath minutely, when there is no breath,
how can you remain unaware? You will suddenly become aware that there is
no breath, and the moment will come when you will feel that the breath
is neither going out nor coming in. The breath has stopped completely.
In that stopping, THE BENEFICENCE.</p><p>This one technique is enough for millions. The whole of Asia tried
and lived with this technique for centuries. Tibet, China, Japan, Burma,
Thailand, Ceylon -- the whole of Asia except India has tried this
technique. Only one technique and thousands and thousands have attained
enlightenment through it. And this is only the first technique. But
unfortunately, because the technique became associated with Buddha's
name, Hindus have been trying to avoid it. Because it became more and
more known as a Buddhist method, Hindus have completely forgotten
it.</p><p>And not only that, they have also tried to avoid it for another
reason. Because this technique is the first technique mentioned by
Shiva, many Buddhists have claimed that this book, VIGYANA BHAIRAVA
TANTRA, is a Buddhist book, not a Hindu book. It is neither Hindu nor
Buddhist -- a technique is just a technique. Buddha used it, but it was
there already to be used. Buddha became a buddha, an enlightened one,
because of</p><p>the technique. The technique preceded Buddha; the technique was
already there. Try it. It is one of the most simple techniques -- simple
compared to other techniques; I am not saying simple for you. Other
techniques will be more difficult. That is why it is mentioned as the
first technique.</p><p>The second technique -- all these nine techniques are concerned with
breath.</p><p>AS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP, AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP
TO DOWN -- THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE.</p><p>It is the same, but with a slight difference. The emphasis is now not
on the gap, but on the turning. The outgoing and ingoing breath make a
circle. Remember, these are not two parallel lines. We always think of
them as two parallel lines -- breath going in and breath going out. Do
you think that these are two parallel lines? They are not. Breath going
in is half the circle; breath going out is the other half of the
circle.</p><p>So understand this: first, breathing in and out creates a circle.</p><p>They are not parallel lines, because parallel lines never meet
anywhere. Secondly, the breath coming in and the breath going out are
not two breaths, they are one breath. The same breath which comes in,
goes out, so it must have a turn inside. It must turn somewhere. There
must be a point where the incoming breath becomes outgoing.</p><p>Why put such emphasis upon turning? Because, Shiva says, AS BREATH
TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP TO DOWN,</p><p>THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE. Very simple, but he says: realize
the turns and you will realize the self.</p><p>Why the turn? If you know driving you know about gears. Each time you
change the</p><p>gear, you have to pass through the neutral gear, which is not a gear
at all. From the first gear you move to the second or from the second to
the third, but always you have to move through the neutral gear. That
neutral gear is a turning point. In that turning point the first gear
becomes the second and the second becomes the third. When your breath
goes in and turns out, it passes through the neutral gear; otherwise it
cannot turn out. It passes through the neutral territory.</p><p>In that neutral territory you are neither a body nor a soul, neither
physical nor mental, because the physical is a gear of your being and
the mental is another gear of your being. You go on moving from gear to
gear, but you must have a neutral gear where you are neither body nor
mind.</p><p>In that neutral gear you simply are: you are simply an existence --
pure, simple, unembodied, with no mind.</p><p>That is why there is the emphasis on the turn. Man is a machine -- a
large, very complicated machine. You have many gears in your body, many
gears in your mind. You are not aware of your great mechanism, but you
are a great machine. And it is good that you are not aware; otherwise
you could go mad. The body is such a great machine that scientists say
if we had to create a factory parallel to the human body, it would
require four square miles of land, and the noise would be such that one
hundred square miles of land would be disturbed by it.</p><p>The body is a great mechanical device -- the greatest. You have
millions and millions of cells and each cell is alive. So you are a big
city of seventy million cells; there are seventy million citizens inside
you, and the whole city is running very silently, smoothly. Every moment
the mechanism is working. It is very complicated. These techniques will
be related at many points with the mechanism of your body and the
mechanism of your mind. But always the emphasis will be on those points
where suddenly you are not part of the mechanism -- remember this.
Suddenly you are not part of the mechanism. There are moments when you
change gears.</p><p>For example, in the night when you drop into sleep you change gears,
because during the day you need a different mechanism for a waking
consciousness -- a different part of the mind functions.</p><p>Then you drop into sleep, and that part becomes non-functioning.
Another part of the mind begins to function, and there is a gap, an
interval, a turning. A gear is changed. In the morning when you are
again getting up, the gear is changed. You are silently sitting, and
suddenly someone says something and you get angry -- you move into a
different gear. That is why everything changes.</p><p>If you get angry, your breathing will suddenly change. Your breathing
will become irritated, chaotic. A trembling will get into your
breathing; you will feel suffocated. Your whole body would like to do
something, shatter something, only then can the suffocation disappear.
Your breathing will change; your blood will take a different rhythm, a
different movement. Different chemicals will have to be released in the
body, the whole glandular system will have to change. You become a
different man when you are angry. A car is standing... you start it. Do
not put it in any gear, let it be in neutral. It will go on pulling,
vibrating, trembling, but it cannot move; it will get hot. That is why,
when you are angry and you cannot do something, you will get hot. The
mechanism is ready to run and do something and you are not doing -- you
will get hot. You are a mechanism, but, of course, not only a mechanism.
You are more, but the "more" has to be found. When you</p><p>get into a gear, everything changes inside.</p><p>When you change the gear, there is a turning. Shiva says,</p><p>AS BREATH TURNS FROM DOWN TO UP, AND AGAIN AS BREATH CURVES FROM UP
TO DOWN -- THROUGH BOTH THESE TURNS, REALIZE.</p><p>Be aware at the turn. But it is a very short turn; very minute
observation will be needed. And we are just without any observing
capacity; we cannot observe anything. If I say to you, "Observe this
flower; observe this flower which I give to you," you cannot observe it.
For a single moment you will see it, and then you will begin to think of
something else. It may be about the flower, but it will not be THE
FLOWER. You may think about the flower, about how beautiful it is --
then you have moved. Now the flower is no more in your observation, your
field has changed. You may say that it is red, it is blue, it is
white... then you have moved. Observation means remaining with no word,
with no verbalization, with no bubbling inside -- just remaining WITH.
If you can remain with a flower for three minutes, completely, with no
movement of the mind, the thing will happen -- the beneficence. You will
realize.</p><p>But we are not at all observers. We are not aware, we are not alert;
we cannot pay attention to anything. We just go on jumping. This is part
of our heritage, our monkey heritage. Our mind is just the growth of the
monkey mind, so the monkey moves on. He goes on jumping from here to
there.</p><p>The monkey cannot sit still. That is why Buddha insisted so much on
just sitting without any movement, because then the monkey mind is not
allowed to go on its way.</p><p>In Japan they have a particular type of meditation which they call
Zazen. The word 'zazen' in Japan means just sitting, doing nothing. No
movement is allowed. One is just sitting like a statue -- dead, not
moving at all. But there is no need to sit like a statue for years
together. If you can observe the turn of your breath without any
movement of the mind, you will enter. You will enter into yourself or
into the beyond within.</p><p>Why are these turnings so important? They are important because on
turning, the breath leaves you to move in a different direction. It was
with you when it was coming in; it will be with you again when it goes
out. But at the turning point it is not with you and you are not with
it. In that moment the breath is different from you, and you are
different from it: if breathing is life, then you are dead; if breathing
is your body, then you are no-body; if breathing is your mind, then you
are no-mind... in that moment.</p><p>I wonder whether you have observed it or not: if you stop your
breath, the mind stops suddenly. If you stop your breath just now, your
mind will stop suddenly; the mind cannot function. A sudden stoppage of
breath and the mind stops. Why? Because they are disjoined.</p><p>Only a moving breath is joined with the mind, with the body; a
non-moving breath is disjoined. Then you are in the neutral gear. The
car is running, the power is on, the car is making a noise -- it is
ready to go forward -- but it is not in gear, so the body of the car and
the mechanism of the car are not joined. The car is divided into two. It
is ready to move, but the moving mechanism is not joined with it.</p><p>The same happens when breath takes a turn. You are not joined with
it. In that moment you can easily become aware of who you are. What is
this being? What is it to be? Who is inside this house of the body? Who
is the master? Am I just the house or is there some</p><p>master also? Am I just the mechanism or does something else also
penetrate this mechanism? In that turning gap, Shiva says, REALIZE. He
says just be aware of the turning, and you become a realized soul.</p><p>The third technique:</p><p>OR, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT TOUCH THE
ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER.</p><p>We are divided into the center and the periphery. The body is the
periphery; we know the body, we know the periphery. We know the
circumference, but we do not know where the center is. When the
out-breath fuses with the in-breath, when they become one, when you
cannot say whether it is the out-breath or the in-breath... when it is
difficult to demarcate and define whether the breath is going out or
coming in, when the breath has penetrated in and starts moving out,
there is a moment of fusion.</p><p>It is neither going out nor moving in. The breath is static. When it
is moving out it is dynamic; when it is coming in it is dynamic. When it
is neither, when it is silent, non- moving, you are near to the center.
The fusion point of the in and outgoing breath is your center.</p><p>Look at it in this way: when the breath goes in, where does it go? It
goes to your center, it touches your center. When it goes out, from
where does it go out? It moves from your center. Your center has to be
touched. That is why Taoist mystics and Zen mystics say that the head is
not the center, the navel is your center. The breath goes to the navel,
then it moves out. It goes to the center.</p><p>As I said, it is a bridge between you and your body. You know the
body, but you do not know where your center is. The breath is constantly
going to the center and moving out, but we are not taking enough breath.
Thus, ordinarily it does not really go to the center -- now, at least,
it is not going to the center. That is why everyone feels "off-center."
In the whole modern world, those who can think at all feel they are
missing their center.</p><p>Look at a child sleeping, observe his breath. The breath goes in; the
abdomen comes up. The chest remains unaffected. That is why children
have no chests, only abdomens -- very dynamic abdomens. The breath goes
in and the abdomen comes up; the breath goes out and the abdomen goes
down.</p><p>.. the abdomen moves. Children are in their center, at their center.
That is why they are so happy, so bliss-filled, so energy-filled, never
tired -- overflowing, and always in the present moment with no past, no
future.</p><p>A child can be angry. When he is angry, he is totally angry; he
becomes the anger. Then his anger is also a beautiful thing. When one is
totally angry, anger has a beauty of its own, because totality always
has beauty.</p><p>You cannot be angry and beautiful, you will become ugly, because
partiality is always ugly. And not only with anger. When you love you
are ugly because you are again partial, fragmentary; you are not total.
Look at your face when you are loving someone, making love. Make love
before a mirror and look at your face -- it will be ugly, animal- like.
In love also your face becomes ugly. Why? Love is also a conflict, you
are withholding something. You are giving very miserly. Even in your
love you are not total; you do not give completely, wholly.</p><p>A child even in anger and violence is total. His face becomes radiant
and beautiful; he is here and now. His anger is not something concerned
with the past or something</p><p>concerned with the future, he is not calculating, he is just angry.
The child is at his center. When you are at your center you are always
total. Whatsoever you do will be a total act; good or bad, it will be
total. When you are fragmentary, when you are off-center, your every act
is bound to be a fragment of yourself.</p><p>Your totality is not responding, just a part, and the part is going
against the whole -- -that creates ugliness.</p><p>We all were children. Why is it that as we grow our breathing becomes
shallow? It never goes to the abdomen; it never touches the navel. If it
could go down more and more it would become less and less shallow, but
it just touches the chest and goes out. It never goes to the center. You
are afraid of the center, because if you go to the center you will
become total. If you want to be fragmentary, this is the mechanism to be
fragmentary.</p><p>You love -- if you breathe from the center, you will flow in it
totally. You are afraid. You are afraid to be so vulnerable, so open to
someone, to anyone. You may call him your lover, you may call her your
beloved, but you are afraid. The other is there. If you are totally
vulnerable, open, you do not know what is going to happen. Then YOU ARE
completely, in another sense. You are afraid to be so completely given
to someone. You cannot breathe; you cannot take a deep breath. You
cannot relax your breathing so that it goes to the center -- because the
moment breathing goes to the center your act becomes total.</p><p>Because you are afraid of being total, you breathe shallowly. You
breathe just at the minimum, not at the maximum. That is why life seems
so lifeless. If you are breathing at the minimum, life will become
lifeless; you are living at the minimum, not at the maximum.</p><p>You can live at the maximum -- then life is an overflowing. But then
there will be difficulty. You cannot be a husband, you cannot be a wife,
if life is overflowing. Everything will become difficult.</p><p>If life is overflowing, love will be overflowing. Then you cannot
stick to one. Then you will be flowing all over; all dimensions will be
filled by you. And then the mind feels danger, so it is better not to be
alive. The more you are dead, the more you are secure. The more you are
dead, the more everything is in control. You can control; then you
remain the master. You feel that you are the master because you can
control. You can control your anger, you can control your love, you can
control everything. But this controlling is possible only at the minimum
level of your energy.</p><p>Everyone must have felt at some time or other that there are moments
when he suddenly changes from the minimum level to the maximum. You go
out to a hill station. Suddenly you are out of the city and the prison
of it. You feel free. The sky is vast, and the forest is green, and the
height touches the clouds. Suddenly you take a deep breath. You may not
have observed it.</p><p>Now if you go to a hill station, observe. It is not really the hill
station that makes the change. It is your breathing. You take a deep
breath. You say, "Ah! Ah!" You touch the center, you become total for a
moment, and everything is bliss.</p><p>That bliss is not coming from the hill station, that bliss is coming
from your center -- you have touched it suddenly.</p><p>You were afraid in the city. Everywhere there were others present and
you were controlling. You could not scream, you could not laugh. What a
misfortune! You could</p><p>not sing on the street and dance. You were afraid -- a policeman was
somewhere around the corner, or the priest or the judge or the
politician or the moralist. Someone was just around the corner, so you
could not just dance in the street.</p><p>Bertrand Russell has said somewhere, "I love civilization, but we
have achieved civilization at a very great cost." You cannot dance in
the streets, but you go to a hill station and suddenly you can dance.
You are alone with the sky, and the sky is not an imprisonment. It is
just opening, opening and opening -- vast, infinite. Suddenly you take a
breath deeply, it touches the center and the bliss. But it is not so for
long. Within an hour or two, the hill station will disappear. You may be
there, but the hill station will disappear.</p><p>Your worries will come back. You will begin to think to make a call
to the city, to write a letter to your wife, or you will begin to think
that since after three days you are going back you should make
arrangements. You have just reached and you are making arrangements to
leave. You are back.</p><p>That breath was not from you really; it suddenly happened.</p><p>Because of the change of situation the gear changed. You were in a
new situation, you could not breathe in the old way, so for a moment a
new breath came in. It touched the center, and you felt the bliss.</p><p>Shiva says you are every moment touching the center, or if you are
not touching you CAN touch it. Take deep, slow breaths. Touch the
center; do not breathe from the chest -- that is a trick. Civilization,
education, morality, they have created shallow breathing. It will be
good to go deep into the center, because otherwise you cannot take deep
breaths. Unless humanity becomes non-suppressive toward sex, man cannot
breathe really. If the breath goes deep down to the abdomen, it gives
energy to the sex center. It touches the sex center; it massages the sex
center from within. The sex center becomes more active, more alive.
Civilization is afraid of sex. We do not allow our children to touch
their sex centers, their sex organs. We say, "Stop! Don't touch!"</p><p>Look at a child when he first touches his sex center, and then say
"Stop!" and then observe his breathing. When you say "Stop! Don't touch
your sex center!" the breath will become shallow immediately -- because
it is not only his hand which is touching the sex center, deep down the
breath is touching it. And if the breath goes on touching at, it is
difficult to stop the hand. If the hand stops, then basically it is
necessary, required, that the breath should not touch, should not go
deep.</p><p>It must remain shallow.</p><p>We are afraid of sex. The lower part of the body is not only lower
physically, it has become lower as a value. It is condemned as "lower."
So do not go deep, just remain shallow. It is unfortunate that we can
only breathe downwards. If some preachers were allowed, they would
change the whole mechanism. They would only allow you to breathe upward
into the head. Then you would absolutely not feel sex.</p><p>If we are to create a sexless humanity, then we will have to change
the breathing system. The breath must go into the head, to the SAHASRAR
-- the seventh center in the head -- then come back to the mouth. This
should be the passage: from the mouth to the sahasrar. It must not go
deep down because down is dangerous. The deeper you go, the nearer you
reach to the deeper layers of biology. You reach to the center, and that
center is just near the sex center -- just near. It has to be, because
sex is life.</p><p>Look at it in this way: breath is life from above downwards; sex is
life from just the other</p><p>corner -- from down upwards. Sex energy is flowing and breath energy
is flowing. The breath passage is in the upper body and the sex passage
is in the lower body. When they meet they create life; when they meet
they create biology, bio-energy. So if you are afraid of sex, create a
distance between the two, do not allow them to meet. So really,
civilized man is a castrated man; that is why we do not know about
breath, and this sutra will be difficult to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Shiva says, WHENEVER IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH FUSE, AT THIS INSTANT
TOUCH THE ENERGY-LESS, ENERGY-FILLED CENTER. He uses very</p><p>contradictory terms: "energy-less, energy-filled." It is energy-less
because your bodies, your minds, cannot give any energy to it. Your body
energy is not there, your mind energy is not there, so it is energy-less
as far as you know your identity. But it is energy- filled because it
has the cosmic source of energy, not because of your body energy.</p><p>Your body energy is just fuel energy. It is nothing but petrol. You
eat something, you drink something -- it creates energy. It is just
giving fuel to the body. Stop eating and drinking and your body will
fall dead. Not just now, it will take three months at least, because you
have reservoirs of petrol. You have accumulated much energy; it can run
for at least three months without going to any petrol station. It can
run; it has a reservoir. For an emergency, any emergency, you may need
it.</p><p>This is "fuel" energy. The center is not getting any fuel energy.
That is why Shiva says it is energy-less. It is not dependent on your
eating and drinking. It is connected with the cosmic source; it is
cosmic energy. That is why he says ENERGY- LESS, ENERGY- FILLED CENTER.
The moment you can feel the center from where breath goes out or comes
in, the very point where the breaths fuse -- that center -- if you
become aware of it, then enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth technique:</p><p>OR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN
(DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF</p><p>VANISHES. THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE IMPURE. But then it is
difficult for everyone because, he says, THIS IS DIFFICULT ONLY FOR THE
IMPURE. But who is the pure one? It is difficult for you; you cannot
practice it. But you can feel it sometimes suddenly. You are driving a
car and suddenly you feel there is going to be an accident. Breathing
will stop. If it is out, it will remain out. If it is in, it will remain
in.</p><p>You cannot breathe in such an emergency; you cannot afford it.
Everything stops, departs.</p><p>OR, WHEN BREATH IS ALL OUT (UP) AND STOPPED OF ITSELF, OR ALL IN
(DOWN) AND STOPPED -- IN SUCH UNIVERSAL PAUSE, ONE'S SMALL SELF</p><p>VANISHES: Your small self is only a daily utility. In emergencies you
cannot remember it. Who you are -- the name, the bank balance, the
prestige, everything -- just evaporates. Your car is just heading toward
another car; another moment and there will be death. In this moment
there will be a pause. Even for the impure there will be a pause.
Suddenly breathing stops. If you can be aware in that moment, you can
reach the goal.</p><p>Zen monks have tried this method very much in Japan. That is why
their methods seem very weird, absurd, strange. They have done many
inconceivable things.</p><p>A master will throw someone out of the house. Suddenly the master
will begin slapping the disciple without any rhyme or reason, without
any cause.</p><p>You were sitting with your master and everything was okay. You were
just chit-chatting, and he will begin to beat you in order to create the
pause. If there is any cause the pause cannot be created. If you had
abused the master and he starts beating you there is a causality, your
mind understands: "I abused him, and he is beating me."</p><p>Really, your mind was expecting it already, so there is no gap. But
remember, a Zen master will not beat you if you abuse him, he will
laugh, because then laughter can create the pause. You were abusing him
and you were saying nonsense things to him, and you expected anger. But
he starts laughing or dancing. That is sudden; that will create the
pause. You cannot understand it. If you cannot understand the mind
stops, and when the mind stops, breathing stops. Either way -- if
breathing stops, mind stops; if mind stops, breathing stops.</p><p>You were appreciating the master and you were feeling good, and you
were thinking, "Now the master must be pleased." And suddenly he takes
his staff and begins to beat you -- and mercilessly, because Zen masters
are merciless. He begins to beat you; you cannot understand what is
happening. The mind stops, there is a pause. If you know the technique,
you can attain to your self.</p><p>There are many stories that someone attained buddhahood because the
teacher suddenly started beating him. You cannot understand it -- what
nonsense! How can one attain buddhahood by being beaten by someone, or
by being thrown out of the window by someone? Even if someone kills you,
you cannot attain buddhahood. But if you understand this technique, then
it becomes easy to understand.</p><p>In the West particularly, in the last thirty or forty years Zen has
become very much prevalent -- a fashion. But unless they know this
technique, they cannot understand Zen. They can imitate it, but
imitation is of no use. Rather, it is dangerous. These are not things to
be imitated.</p><p>The whole Zen technique is based on the fourth technique of Shiva.
But this is unfortunate. Now we will have to import Zen from Japan
because we have lost the whole tradition; we do not know it. Shiva was
the expert par excellence of this method. When he came to marry Devi
with his BARAT, his procession, the whole city must have felt the
pause... the whole city!</p><p>Devi's father was not willing to marry his girl to this "hippie" --
Shiva was the original hippie. Devi's father was totally against him,
and no father would permit this marriage. So we cannot say anything
against Devi's father. No father would permit his daughter's marriage to
Shiva. But Devi insisted so he had to agree -- unwillingly, unhappily,
but he agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the marriage procession. It is said that people began to
run, seeing Shiva and his procession. The whole barat must have taken
LSD, marijuana. They were "high." And really, LSD and marijuana are just
the beginning. Shiva knew and his friends and disciples knew the
ultimate psychedelic -- SOMA RASA. Aldous Huxley has named the ultimate
psychedelic "soma" only because of Shiva. They were high, just dancing,
screaming, laughing. The whole city fled. It must have felt the
pause.</p><p>Any sudden, unexpected, unbelievable thing can create the pause for
the impure. But for the pure there is no need of such things. For the
pure, the pause is always there. Many</p><p>times, for pure minds, breathing stops. If your mind is pure -- pure
means you are not desiring, hankering, seeking anything -- silently
pure, innocently pure, you can be sitting and suddenly your breath will
stop.</p><p>Remember this: mind movement needs breath movement. Mind moving fast
needs fast movement in breath. That is why when you are in anger, breath
will move fast. In the sex act, the breath will move very fast. That is
why in Ayurveda- a system of herbal medicine in India- it is said that
your life will be shortened if too much sex is allowed. Your life will
he shortened, according to Ayurveda, because Ayurveda measures your life
in breaths. If your breathing is too fast, your life will be
shortened.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern medicine says that sex helps blood circulation, sex helps
relaxation. And those who suppress their sex may get into trouble --
particularly heart trouble. They are right and Ayurveda is also right,
but they seem contradictory. But Ayurveda was invented five thousand
years before. Every man was doing much labor: life was labor, so there
was no need to relax, there was no need to create artificial devices for
blood circulation.</p><p>But now, for those who are not doing much physical labor, sex is
their only labor. That is why modern medicine is also right for modern
man. He is not doing any physical exertion, so sex gives the exertion:
the heart beats more, the blood circulates faster, the breathing becomes
deep and goes to the center. So after the sex act you feel relaxed and
you can fall into sleep easily. Freud says that sex is the best
tranquillizer, and it is -- at least for modern man.</p><p>In sex breathing will become fast; in anger breathing will become
fast. In sex the mind is filled with desire, lust, impurity. When the
mind is pure -- no desire in the mind, no seeking, no motivation; you
are not going anywhere, but just remaining here and now as an innocent
pool... not even a ripple -- then breathing stops automatically. There
is no need for it.</p><p>On this path, the small self vanishes and you attain to the higher
self, the supreme self. I think this will do for today.</p><p><br></p><p>THE END.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

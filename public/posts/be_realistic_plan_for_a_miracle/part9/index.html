Once you believe in logic, you believe in regimentation. Once you become too rational you become mechanical. Reason is a mechanism. Then your whole life is turned into a mechanical routine, and society needs, wants, efficient people – not alive people. Mechanically perfect – existentially dead.\nSo remember that. And whenever you feel that you are shifting towards thinking, always bring yourself back towards feeling. Even if everything is lost and feeling is saved, everything is saved. And if you lose feeling and everything is saved, nothing is saved, mm? So – good that you came by feeling!\n[A sannyasin asked if something could be done to help the discomfort he felt lately as his energy seemed to be moving very quickly and powerfully upwards through his throat ‘like a ball of fire’. He said that sometimes the energy moved higher – up to his shoulders – and produced a sensation of much heat.\nOsho gave him an ‘energy darshan’. The sannyasin let out a series of screams which sounded as if they were just coming from the throat and were not being fully expressed. For a moment he sat silent, then gave out a bloodcurdling scream.…\nHe said: I feel it is not finished.]\nNo, it will not finish so soon... it will take a little time. You just have to do a few things. Everything is good – the energy just needs to be a little more flowing.\nDo one thing. Each night before you go to bed, stand with both hands raised, legs spread apart. Loose, relaxed; not tight, mm? Then start feeling the energy coming up, and feel that you are joined with the earth. Imagine that you are a tree and your arms are the branches, and your legs, the roots. Branches in the sky spreading you towards the sun, and legs rooted in the earth. This is heaven/earth meeting. Forget yourself completely... just become a tree. Let the sky pull you up and the earth pull you down. Let them create a tension, and that will fix everything within a week. These things will disappear, and many beautiful things will happen. You will feel completely calm and quiet and centred.\nSo for seven days, do this, and then tell me. Do it for not more than twenty minutes. Even if it is beautiful, don’t do it more than that, because then it will be difficult for you to get out of it. It becomes so beautiful that you forget time, so tell somebody that if you don’t break it after twenty minutes, they should come and break it for you. The sky and the earth are so powerful that if you Continue, you can go completely mad.\nBut it is good; there is nothing to worry about. One should be happy about it. Good !\n[Another sannyasin also said his energy flow was upsetting him. He said he felt it was unbalanced, and that while he felt comfortable when it moved in a downward direction, when it moved upwards, he felt uncomfortable.\nOsho checked his energy.]\nMm mm. . .the energy is not coming in a continuous flow – that’s why you feel uncomfortable. It is coming in spurts. It is as if petrol in a car is not coming continuously, so the whole car jogs.\n... Good. You start a small method tonight. Have you done any Hatha Yoga – the headstand?...\nBefore you go to sleep, stand for three minutes on your head, and feel as if the whole of your energy is falling down into the head. Do it just for three minutes, no longer. Otherwise, though it may feel very very good, you will not be able to go to sleep. So do it at least an hour before you go to sleep.\nAfter that, lie down for three minutes and feel that the energy is going back into the body, and then stand for three minutes and have a little dance.\nSo it will mean about ten minutes – three three minutes. Three minutes standing on the head, three minutes Lying down so that the energy becomes equalised, and then three minutes standing and dancing. Do this for not more than two weeks – and then tell me.\n[The Tathata group was present. The group leader said: It was a very low energy group – I think because the weather was hot.\nFor me every group is like a reflection of life. I don’t notice much of a difference between organised groups and day to day living.]\nMm mm.… There is no difference, and there should not be any. Life is a continuous encounter, a continuous growth process. And groups are nothing but intense moments in the same process, more focussed, so that things can be brought within a limited compass, seen more clearly. Ordinary life is like a lamp – the light is diffuse. A group is like a torch. The same light, but focussed so it pinpoints something.\nSo that’s good – one should feel that way. Life and meditation should not be separate things... one ongoing process.\nAnd it is possible that heat can bring people to a low energy level. But sometimes many things happen when people are on a low energy level, so there is nothing to be depressed about. Use all opportunities.\nFor example if a person is on a high energy level, then he will have more tendency towards anger. The same mood on a low energy level will have a tendency to become more sad; not anger, but sadness. This too is good to know – that sadness is low energy anger, and anger is high energy sadness.\nSo never lose any opportunity. All opportunities reveal things. As seasons change, people change – because people are part of the seasons. It is not only the earth that goes on changing; and the climates; it is people also. Summer is not just something outside you. It is part of you... it penetrates you. When it is winter, it penetrates into you. When it is spring, it penetrates you. It is not only that in the spring the whole of nature becomes decorated with flowers and fragrance, there is aliveness... birds starting to coo and seduce. The whole of nature, man included, becomes more seductive.\nSo the climate pervades and permeates everything. Man has to come to know himself in all the seasons all around the year. On a cool morning, you can feel very cool – (a chuckle) that is not something to feel very happy about. It is just the coolness of the morning. But when on a hot summer’s afternoon you feel hot, it is not only that you perspire; deep down inside you, something else is disturbed.\nBy and by you will become aware that the climate continuously affects you. Then you have to find a centre in your being which is beyond climate. That is the point which is beyond earth. Then whether it is summer or winter or rain outside, it makes no difference. There is a point somewhere in you which remains completely untouched. It remains completely as it is; unscratched, aloof, far far away. It never changes with the climate. That is the witness. That is what the Hindus call atman.\nThat which is affected is the body. That which reacts is the mind. That which is neither affected nor reacts is your soul. But that is the very deepest layer of your being, the very substratum. By and by one comes to it.\nSo go on working. All the year around you have to work in different situations, different moods, different climates, to help people to come to themselves, through different avenues. Many things will be revealed to them which cannot be revealed when they are feeling high. Many people have their glimpses when they are very ill.\nYou will be surprised to know that all the great artists, painters, poets, were a little pathological, ill; they were not very healthy people.\nIn fact healthy and robust people have not been creative. Health was too much. They had so much energy that they wasted it in the restaurants and with the prostitutes. They couldn’t write a poem, they couldn’t paint; they were boiling too much. And these things looked a little feminine – sitting and painting, or writing a poem. It is okay for someone who is ill and lying in bed, but not for a healthy person. Healthy people should go and fight and compete in the world.\nHealthy people have been very destructive. Health has not always proved a blessing. They became generals, but they were never great painters or musicians or poets – not creators. If you look at the creators you will find that many of them were ill; their illness became a blessing.\nBut the point I would like to emphasize is that when you are ill, your energy is low, and a few things come up only when your energy is low. Otherwise it works like a weight; it doesn’t allow things to come up. Have you watched? – if you have been ill for many days, ill, feverish, and suddenly the fever is not there, you are perfectly cool, collected. The storm has gone and there is a silence that you had not known before. You may not like it because it has an association with fever and illness, but if you look directly at it, it has a different quality. It is beautiful. It has its own space that no health can give you.\nI am not against health (a chuckle). I am saying that even illness, if you are alert, can give you some spaces which are beautiful. And if you can use illness, of course you can use health. Then health can become a blessing. Always remember that everything can be used, has to be used.\n[The groupleader asks: There’s another question – of how far to let things go in the group – like anger and sex and things like that.]\nNothing can be decided beforehand. Each situation will decide, so I cannot give you a rigid rule. It will depend on the person, on the situation, the mood, on the energy that is flowing around the group. It will depend on a thousand and one things. Sometimes small things will be going too much over the limit, and sometimes nothing will be beyond the limit. So no rigid rule is possible; one has to remain flexible.\nRemain flexible and spontaneous, and never be afraid of committing a mistake. If you are too much afraid of committing a mistake, nothing can be done. One has to commit mistakes – that’s the way one learns. By and by one becomes perceptive.\nSo always be ready. Whenever you are wondering whether to do or not, always do (laughter). Not- doing is not going to help – do it. If later on you feel that you have erred, tell people and say that it had to be done because you were not in any way experienced about it; that it had to be done for the experience. You can ask their forgiveness. If you become afraid of committing mistakes, that will become limiting, and growth will be hindered. Remain ready to commit a mistake, and ready to admit that you have committed a mistake.\nThere is no problem – the group will understand. We are working as a family, and the group is an accumulated consciousness, so they will understand. And the leader is not infallible, so there is no\nneed to pretend infallibility. just say that you are as fallible as they; maybe a step further ahead than them, but on the same path. In many things they may be a step further ahead than you, so you have to learn from them.\nIt is not a teacher-taught relationship. Rather it is a situation in which everybody is learning. The leader is just a facilitator, a coordinator; nothing more. Remember that learning is the point, and learning is possible only if you experiment. Trial and error is the only way.\nSo don’t make rules, mm? Just float.\n[The groupleader asks: It comes up in the group that people say I am ego-tripping. Should I just accept that?]\nAccept it. To accept the ego is to go beyond it, because the ego is never willing to accept. That’s its defence. The ego is always protective and defensive. It goes on always saying that you are not on an ego-trip.\nOnce you say ‘Yes, maybe I am on an ego-trip’, it is finished. Then what is the point of the ego? Then you become defenceless; you accept it. And if you feel that yes, you are on an ego-trip, there is no need to even say ‘maybe’. Say ‘Certainly I am on an ego-trip – and I am enjoying it!’ In that moment there is no ego, because when you accept, the whole game is gone.\nThe game consists of not accepting. People are saying that you are on an ego-trip, and you say that you are a humble man, the most humble man in the world (laughter). You say that you are not on an ego-trip. You may be. That i the ego – accept it. If you feel certain, accept it with certainty. If you are not certain say ‘maybe’, ‘perhaps’. If you think that you are not on ar, ego-trip, but the other is feeling very happy saying that you are, then let him enjoy it! That is his ego-trip so why be worried about it! Good.\n[A group member says: I felt was a lot of fear and disgust for my parents. I feel that I’m still attached to my mother by the cord, and so I can’t be myself.…\nI think it may be the centre of a lot of fears that I have. Osho checks her energy.]\nVery good. I can feel what it ;sIt will go. This group has been very good, and has brought up\nmany things. Primal (therapy) will be very good.\nIt is going to help. That is the group that people don’t want to do!\nIt is something to do with the primal pain, some birth trauma, so it has to be relived. Once you relive it you will be relieved of it; otherwise it will persist. There is nothing you can do about it right now. You will have to move back, move back to the past and relive the moment again – only then it can be released.\nWhen a child is born many things happen.A child has very instinctive ways of knowing if he is not\naccepted or not welcomed, of knowing if he was just an accident and could have been avoided. All\nthese things the child feels immediately and instinctively. It is not that he thinks about them; he simply feels them. They become a constant impact, an impression that continues in the unconscious.\nThen you go on growing and thirty years pass. Now thirty years of experiences are covering that experience, so you cannot do anything immediately because it is almost completely unavailable. You have to penetrate those thirty years’ experience and go backwards. You have to reach that point where you can be reborn – and this time you accept the fact.\nIt is not a question of your parents. It is a question of you now – how to accept the fact. Once the acceptance is there, the problem disappears, and you will start flowing. Otherwise this will become a continuous blocking of energy. And the navel is such an important centre that if it is blocked, many things will be blocked, because every energy has to pass through the navel. It is the life source.\nSo you book for Primal, mm? Once you have gone through it you will be completely rejuvenated, fresh, and you will be able to forgive your parents. And tell (the therapist) before the group. The cord may have to be cut again – it is still there.\n[A sannyasin says: When I first came here, I felt an incredible anxiety building up in my solar plexus, and it seems somehow connected with Tai Chi. When I started Tai Chi, it was like an explosion. I’ve seen that meditation seems to be of two types and that I can experience my body through here (indicating hara) or here (indicating third eye) and I wonder which I should do.]\nConcentrate on the third eye. The japanese and chinese methods concentrate chi energy in the hara and sometimes it can become too heavy. You can become powerful through it. Those methods are meant really for Samurais, warriors; the whole concept of chi is for a warrior. The effort is how to conserve your energy inside a citadel in your being that is not available to anybody else. It is available only to you when you need it, and it makes you tremendously powerful.\nMy methods are totally different. I am not trying to make you powerful. I am trying to make you peaceful. The energy is not to be concentrated; rather, it is to be dispersed, it has to be flowing. You are not going to fight – you are going to surrender. It is a let-go.\nSo I can use Tai Chi and other methods, first to concentrate the energy, then to explode it. But explosion remains the aim. First you collect it and then you let it go – but let-go remains the aim.\nMy effort is not to make you a warrior. Life should not be looked upon as a conflict. that’s where the Japanese missed the whole thing, and that’s how they became participants with Hitler... the power-instinct. I am against any power-oriented methods. Use them just so that you can collect energy and then have the feel of explosion, of let-go. Have it, but only so you can lose it, because if you don’t have it you can’t lose it beautifully. A man who has no concentrated energy finds it very difficult to surrender – from where to surrender?\nHe has no centre, he does not know where he is. If you ask him, sometimes he says in the head, sometimes he says in the heart, and by the time he has said in the heart, he is in the stomach. He is confused. Unless you know who you are, where you are, it is difficult to surrender.\nSo Tai Chi is good. I am going to use it. Aikido, Karate is good – but not as ends; they are means. Once you have the energy, then let it flower, let it move to the winds, released, shared, mm?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3234","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/be_realistic_plan_for_a_miracle/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/be_realistic_plan_for_a_miracle/>Be Realistic.

you feel uncomfortable. It is coming in spurts. It is as if petrol in a
car is not coming continuously, so the whole car jogs.</p><p><br></p><p>... Good. You start a small method tonight. Have you done any Hatha
Yoga – the headstand?...</p><p><br></p><p>Before you go to sleep, stand for three minutes on your head, and
feel as if the whole of your energy is falling down into the head. Do it
just for three minutes, no longer. Otherwise, though it may feel very
very good, you will not be able to go to sleep. So do it at least an
hour before you go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>After that, lie down for three minutes and feel that the energy is
going back into the body, and then stand for three minutes and have a
little dance.</p><p><br></p><p>So it will mean about ten minutes – three three minutes. Three
minutes standing on the head, three minutes Lying down so that the
energy becomes equalised, and then three minutes standing and dancing.
Do this for not more than two weeks – and then tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>[The Tathata group was present. The group leader said: It was a very
low energy group – I think because the weather was hot.</p><p>For me every group is like a reflection of life. I don’t notice much
of a difference between organised groups and day to day living.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm.… There is no difference, and there should not be any. Life is
a continuous encounter, a continuous growth process. And groups are
nothing but intense moments in the same process, more focussed, so that
things can be brought within a limited compass, seen more clearly.
Ordinary life is like a lamp – the light is diffuse. A group is like a
torch. The same light, but focussed so it pinpoints something.</p><p><br></p><p>So that’s good – one should feel that way. Life and meditation should
not be separate things... one ongoing process.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is possible that heat can bring people to a low energy level.
But sometimes many things happen when people are on a low energy level,
so there is nothing to be depressed about. Use all opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>For example if a person is on a high energy level, then he will have
more tendency towards anger. The same mood on a low energy level will
have a tendency to become more sad; not anger, but sadness. This too is
good to know – that sadness is low energy anger, and anger is high
energy sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>So never lose any opportunity. All opportunities reveal things. As
seasons change, people change – because people are part of the seasons.
It is not only the earth that goes on changing; and the climates; it is
people also. Summer is not just something outside you. It is part of
you... it penetrates you. When it is winter, it penetrates into you.
When it is spring, it penetrates you. It is not only that in the spring
the whole of nature becomes decorated with flowers and fragrance, there
is aliveness... birds starting to coo and seduce. The whole of nature,
man included, becomes more seductive.</p><p><br></p><p>So the climate pervades and permeates everything. Man has to come to
know himself in all the seasons all around the year. On a cool morning,
you can feel very cool – (a chuckle) that is not something to feel very
happy about. It is just the coolness of the morning. But when on a hot
summer’s afternoon you feel hot, it is not only that you perspire; deep
down inside you, something else is disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by you will become aware that the climate continuously affects
you. Then you have to find a centre in your being which is beyond
climate. That is the point which is beyond earth. Then whether it is
summer or winter or rain outside, it makes no difference. There is a
point somewhere in you which remains completely untouched. It remains
completely as it is; unscratched, aloof, far far away. It never changes
with the climate. That is the witness. That is what the Hindus call
atman.</p><p><br></p><p>That which is affected is the body. That which reacts is the mind.
That which is neither affected nor reacts is your soul. But that is the
very deepest layer of your being, the very substratum. By and by one
comes to it.</p><p><br></p><p>So go on working. All the year around you have to work in different
situations, different moods, different climates, to help people to come
to themselves, through different avenues. Many things will be revealed
to them which cannot be revealed when they are feeling high. Many people
have their glimpses when they are very ill.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that all the great artists, painters,
poets, were a little pathological, ill; they were not very healthy
people.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact healthy and robust people have not been creative. Health was
too much. They had so much energy that they wasted it in the restaurants
and with the prostitutes. They couldn’t write a poem, they couldn’t
paint; they were boiling too much. And these things looked a little
feminine – sitting and painting, or writing a poem. It is okay for
someone who is ill and lying in bed, but not for a healthy person.
Healthy people should go and fight and compete in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Healthy people have been very destructive. Health has not always
proved a blessing. They became generals, but they were never great
painters or musicians or poets – not creators. If you look at the
creators you will find that many of them were ill; their illness became
a blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>But the point I would like to emphasize is that when you are ill,
your energy is low, and a few things come up only when your energy is
low. Otherwise it works like a weight; it doesn’t allow things to come
up. Have you watched? – if you have been ill for many days, ill,
feverish, and suddenly the fever is not there, you are perfectly cool,
collected. The storm has gone and there is a silence that you had not
known before. You may not like it because it has an association with
fever and illness, but if you look directly at it, it has a different
quality. It is beautiful. It has its own space that no health can give
you.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not against health (a chuckle). I am saying that even illness,
if you are alert, can give you some spaces which are beautiful. And if
you can use illness, of course you can use health. Then health can
become a blessing. Always remember that everything can be used, has to
be used.</p><p><br></p><p>[The groupleader asks: There’s another question – of how far to let
things go in the group – like anger and sex and things like that.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing can be decided beforehand. Each situation will decide, so I
cannot give you a rigid rule. It will depend on the person, on the
situation, the mood, on the energy that is flowing around the group. It
will depend on a thousand and one things. Sometimes small things will be
going too much over the limit, and sometimes nothing will be beyond the
limit. So no rigid rule is possible; one has to remain flexible.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain flexible and spontaneous, and never be afraid of committing a
mistake. If you are too much afraid of committing a mistake, nothing can
be done. One has to commit mistakes – that’s the way one learns. By and
by one becomes perceptive.</p><p><br></p><p>So always be ready. Whenever you are wondering whether to do or not,
always do (laughter). Not- doing is not going to help – do it. If later
on you feel that you have erred, tell people and say that it had to be
done because you were not in any way experienced about it; that it had
to be done for the experience. You can ask their forgiveness. If you
become afraid of committing mistakes, that will become limiting, and
growth will be hindered. Remain ready to commit a mistake, and ready to
admit that you have committed a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no problem – the group will understand. We are working as a
family, and the group is an accumulated consciousness, so they will
understand. And the leader is not infallible, so there is no</p><p>need to pretend infallibility. just say that you are as fallible as
they; maybe a step further ahead than them, but on the same path. In
many things they may be a step further ahead than you, so you have to
learn from them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a teacher-taught relationship. Rather it is a situation in
which everybody is learning. The leader is just a facilitator, a
coordinator; nothing more. Remember that learning is the point, and
learning is possible only if you experiment. Trial and error is the only
way.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t make rules, mm? Just float.</p><p><br></p><p>[The groupleader asks: It comes up in the group that people say I am
ego-tripping. Should I just accept that?]</p><p><br></p><p>Accept it. To accept the ego is to go beyond it, because the ego is
never willing to accept. That’s its defence. The ego is always
protective and defensive. It goes on always saying that you are not on
an ego-trip.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you say ‘Yes, maybe I am on an ego-trip’, it is finished. Then
what is the point of the ego? Then you become defenceless; you accept
it. And if you feel that yes, you are on an ego-trip, there is no need
to even say ‘maybe’. Say ‘Certainly I am on an ego-trip – and I am
enjoying it!’ In that moment there is no ego, because when you accept,
the whole game is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The game consists of not accepting. People are saying that you are on
an ego-trip, and you say that you are a humble man, the most humble man
in the world (laughter). You say that you are not on an ego-trip. You
may be. That i the ego – accept it. If you feel certain, accept it with
certainty. If you are not certain say ‘maybe’, ‘perhaps’. If you think
that you are not on ar, ego-trip, but the other is feeling very happy
saying that you are, then let him enjoy it! That is his ego-trip so why
be worried about it! Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A group member says: I felt was a lot of fear and disgust for my
parents. I feel that I’m still attached to my mother by the cord, and so
I can’t be myself.…</p><p><br></p><p>I think it may be the centre of a lot of fears that I have. Osho
checks her energy.]</p><p>Very good. I can feel what it ;s<span class=s4></span>It will go.
This group has been very good, and has brought up</p><p>many things. Primal (therapy) will be very good.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to help. That is the group that people don’t want to
do!</p><p><br></p><p>It is something to do with the primal pain, some birth trauma, so it
has to be relived. Once you relive it you will be relieved of it;
otherwise it will persist. There is nothing you can do about it right
now. You will have to move back, move back to the past and relive the
moment again – only then it can be released.</p><p><br></p><p>When a child is born many things happen.<span class=s4></span>A
child has very instinctive ways of knowing if he is not</p><p>accepted or not welcomed, of knowing if he was just an accident and
could have been avoided. All</p><p>these things the child feels immediately and instinctively. It is not
that he thinks about them; he simply feels them. They become a constant
impact, an impression that continues in the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you go on growing and thirty years pass. Now thirty years of
experiences are covering that experience, so you cannot do anything
immediately because it is almost completely unavailable. You have to
penetrate those thirty years’ experience and go backwards. You have to
reach that point where you can be reborn – and this time you accept the
fact.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of your parents. It is a question of you now –
how to accept the fact. Once the acceptance is there, the problem
disappears, and you will start flowing. Otherwise this will become a
continuous blocking of energy. And the navel is such an important centre
that if it is blocked, many things will be blocked, because every energy
has to pass through the navel. It is the life source.</p><p><br></p><p>So you book for Primal, mm? Once you have gone through it you will be
completely rejuvenated, fresh, and you will be able to forgive your
parents. And tell (the therapist) before the group. The cord may have to
be cut again – it is still there.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: When I first came here, I felt an incredible
anxiety building up in my solar plexus, and it seems somehow connected
with Tai Chi. When I started Tai Chi, it was like an explosion. I’ve
seen that meditation seems to be of two types and that I can experience
my body through here (indicating hara) or here (indicating third eye)
and I wonder which I should do.]</p><p><br></p><p>Concentrate on the third eye. The japanese and chinese methods
concentrate chi energy in the hara and sometimes it can become too
heavy. You can become powerful through it. Those methods are meant
really for Samurais, warriors; the whole concept of chi is for a
warrior. The effort is how to conserve your energy inside a citadel in
your being that is not available to anybody else. It is available only
to you when you need it, and it makes you tremendously powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>My methods are totally different. I am not trying to make you
powerful. I am trying to make you peaceful. The energy is not to be
concentrated; rather, it is to be dispersed, it has to be flowing. You
are not going to fight – you are going to surrender. It is a let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>So I can use Tai Chi and other methods, first to concentrate the
energy, then to explode it. But explosion remains the aim. First you
collect it and then you let it go – but let-go remains the aim.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is not to make you a warrior. Life should not be looked
upon as a conflict. that’s where the Japanese missed the whole thing,
and that’s how they became participants with Hitler... the
power-instinct. I am against any power-oriented methods. Use them just
so that you can collect energy and then have the feel of explosion, of
let-go. Have it, but only so you can lose it, because if you don’t have
it you can’t lose it beautifully. A man who has no concentrated energy
finds it very difficult to surrender – from where to surrender?</p><p><br></p><p>He has no centre, he does not know where he is. If you ask him,
sometimes he says in the head, sometimes he says in the heart, and by
the time he has said in the heart, he is in the stomach. He is confused.
Unless you know who you are, where you are, it is difficult to
surrender.</p><p><br></p><p>So Tai Chi is good. I am going to use it. Aikido, Karate is good –
but not as ends; they are means. Once you have the energy, then let it
flower, let it move to the winds, released, shared, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

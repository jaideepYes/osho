Just go on making all efforts to search deep. If you can find something higher, then leave it; then it is left automatically. Whether you leave it or not is not the question. You grow out of it rather than leaving it. You follow me?\nAnd I am giving you something which can grow anywhere – in whatsoever religion you are, in whatsoever church you belong. I am against nobody. You can remain in your church and still grow.\n[The visitor takes sannyas.]\nThis will be your name: Swami Anand Mansoor.\nAnand means blissful, happy, and Mansoor is the name of sufi mystic. Have you heard the name – Mansoor Al Hillaj?\nRead something about him... you can find many books in English. You have been connected with him in your past life that’s why I give you the name.\nHe was crucified – just like Jesus. Mohammedans killed him because he uttered something which Mohammedans think is dangerous. He said ‘I am God’ – and that created trouble for him, mm?\nThe whole name is Mansoor Al Hillaj; yours will be simply Mansoor. Have you something to say?\n[Mansoor asked: YesHow to love my mother?\nThe translator went on to say that Mansoor loved his mother and felt that she was the one he was looking for as a lover or wife – but that he felt this was not good.]\nA mother has to be loved in a totally different way. She is not your beloved – and cannot be. If you become too much attached to your mother, you will not be able to find a beloved. And then deep down you will be angry with your mother – because it is because of her that you couldn’t move to another woman.\nSo it is part of growth that one has to move away from the parents. It is just as your being in the womb and then having to come out of it. That was leaving your mother, in a way. . . in a way, betraying her. But if inside the womb the child thinks that this will be a betrayal – ‘How can I leave my mother who has given birth to me?’ – then he will kill himself and the mother also. He has to come out of the womb.\nFirst he is joined with the mother completely. . .then the cord has to be cut. He starts breathing on his own; that is the beginning of growth. He becomes an individual; he starts functioning separately. But for many years he will still remain dependent. For milk, food, shelter, love, he will depend on the mother; he is helpless.\nBut as he becomes stronger, he will start moving further and further away. Then milk will stop, and then he will have to depend on some other food. Now he is going even further away.\nThen one day he has to go to school, has to make friends. And when he becomes a young man, he falls in love with a woman and completely forgets the mother in a way, because this new woman overwhelms him, overpowers him.\nIf it doesn’t happen, then something has gone wrong. If the mother tries to cling to you she is not fulfilling her duty as a mother. It is a very delicate duty. A mother has to help you go away – that’s the delicacy of it. A mother has to make you strong so that you can go away from her. That’s her love. Then she is fulfilling her duty. If you cling to the mother, then too you are doing wrong. Then it is going against nature.\nIt is as if a river starts flowing upstream.then everything will be topsy-turvy.\nThe mother is your source. If you start floating towards the mother, you are going upstream. You have to move away. The river has to go away from the source to the ocean. But that doesn’t mean that you are not in love with your mother.\nSo remember that love for the mother has to be more like respect, less like love. Love towards yoUr mother has to be more of the quality of gratefulness, respect – deep respect. She has given you birth, she has brought you into the world. Your love has to be very very prayerful towards her.\nSo do whatsoever you can do to serve her. But don’t make your love like the love for a beloved, otherwise you are confusing your mother with the beloved. And when goals are confused, you will become confused. So remember well that your destiny is to find a lover – another woman, not your\nmother. Then only for the first time you will become perfectly mature. Because finding another woman means that now you are completely cut away from the mother... the final cord has been cut now.\nThat’s why there is a subtle antagonism between the mother and the wife of her son; a very subtle antagonism – all over the world. It has to be so, because the mother feels somehow that this woman has taken her son away from her. And that’s natural in a way. Natural, but ignorant. The mother should be happy that some other woman has been found. Now her child is no more a child... he has become a mature, grown-up person. She should be happy, mm?\nSo you can be mature only in one way – if you go away from the mother. And this is so on many levels of being. A son has someday to revolt against the father – not without respect... with deep respect. But one has to revolt. This is the delicacy: revolution is there, rebellion is there, but with deep respect. If there is no respect then that is ugly. Then the rebellion is not beautiful. Then you are missing something. Rebel... be free... but be respectful, because the father, the mother, is the source.\nSo one has to go away from the parents. Not only away, but sometimes in many ways, against them. But that should not become anger. It should not be ugly. It should remain beautiful, respectful. If you go away, go, but touch the feet of your mother and father. Tell them that you have to go away... cry. But tell them that you are helpless – you have to go. The challenge has called you, and you have to go. One cries on leaving the home. One goes on looking back again and again, with wistful eyes, nostalgia. The days that have passed were beautiful. But what to do?\nIf you cling to the home you will remain crippled. You will remain juvenile. You will never become a man in your own right. So what I say to you is to go away with respect. Whenever they need, serve them, be available. But never misunderstand that your mother is your beloved; she is your mother.\nNibbana is Buddha’s word for nirvana. It means enlightenment.\nBuddha never used Sanskrit. He used a local language that was used in his part of the country. All the words become soft in it – nirvana is called nibbana. And prem means love.\nDhamma means the ultimate law, and prem means love – love, the ultimate law. Dhamma is also Buddha’s word like nibbana. The sanskrit word is dharma. This form, Buddha’s, is more soft and loving.\n[A sannyasin says: Everything is in trouble, Osho.\nI’m going back and forth in wanting to be here and in wanting to leave. In the meditations especially the ones into which I have to put effort, there is a constant struggle in the mind. The mind’s always going on and on. It’s like: Go on... I want to stop... Go on ! ... ]\nI think a few groups will be tremendously helpful.\nNothing to worry about... it comes to everybody. This moment comes to everybody. In fact when something is going to happen, the mind will create all sorts of trouble. If nothing is going to happen,\nthe mind will not create any trouble. So it is an indication that the mind is becoming alert that something is going to happen, and you are never going to be the same again. So the mind feels apprehensive.\nBut each mind functions in the same way... it has a very mechanical way of functioning. Whenever it becomes a little alert that something is going to happen – that you are on the brink and if you go a little closer towards the precipice you will never be able to come back, and that the same mind will not be able to control you – it becomes afraid, naturally. It is going to be its death.\nThe mind’s death is your life, and the mind’s life is your death. So the mind protects itself. It has its own vested interests; it has many investments. Of course, up to now it has been living in the world and it has done much business, so it is an established thing. Now you are trying to rebel against it. All meditations are a rebellion against the mind.\nAs no established order will allow rebellion easily, neither will the mind. It is just as if in a society there is some trouble and somebody tries to go against the rules and the game. The police and the judge, and the law and the courts, and imprisonment, are all there to prevent it. The status quo becomes afraid... this cannot be allowed.\nThe mind is the establishment, the status quo. And once you start thinking in terms of meditation, you are becoming rebellious. So the mind will create all sorts of trouble – it is natural .\nJust do a few things. One: do a few groups – which I think will be immediately helpful. You are giving in, and if you miss this opportunity, the mind will overpower you and you will be again back in the prison. You have tried to come out of it just a little... you are just on the threshold.\nAnd you have to continue the meditations that you feel are difficult. The mind has not to be allowed anything. For a few days become an ascetic. Be a warrior, a fighter. Then I will tell you to relax. Once the mind knows that you are not going to listen to it, it flops. It just has to come to the understanding that this man is not going to listen, so what is the point?\n[A sannyasin says: I feel that so much is coming in in the meditations... my whole life is coming through me.\n... I feel it’s getting tighter and tighter (holding onto her belly), but I can’t let go, because there’s nothing to let go of.]\nI understand. There is not much to come out, but there is something very basic there which has to come out . it is not much. Once it comes out you will feel totally relaxed. Then let-go will become possible.\nSo when there are many things it seems easier for a person to bring them out – because there are so many things, so much rubbish. And howsoever much you bring out, you still have so much that you are not worried.\nBut you have only one thing... so you will cling to it. You will be miserly about bringing it out. So this is a problem for people who have not many things.\nFor example, a person has millions of rupees. He can go on throwing a few rupees here and there – he has nothing much to worry about. But if there is only one – once gone, it is gone.\nSo in the beginning it is going to be a very very tough struggle. But in a way it is good, because once dropped, it is dropped. And it will be difficult for you to formulate what it is, because the very formulation is the beginning of throwing it away.\nSo the mind goes on hiding it. It doesn’t even allow you to have a look at what you have got. Because if you have a look, the very awareness that you are keeping it, hiding it, holding it, starts the opposite process – of throw it away. Nobody can hold anything consciously; unconsciousness is needed.\nAnd it is not that the tightness is coming in the stomach because you are taking so many things in – no. The tightness is because you are holding something there. It never comes by taking things in.…\nI will do something... don’t be worried. Continue meditating, and I would like you to do a few groups also.…\n[Osho passed her a small wooden box, which is charged with his energy telling her to put it on her head a allow her body to move as it wanted.]\nBring all tightness to the top of your head – as if the whole tightness from the stomach is being transferred. Force the tightness up to your head as if there is a magnetism and it is sticking to your head. And then allow your body energy any movement.\nCooperate with it, mm? If the hand starts shaking, not only allow it to shake, help it to shakea\ndeep cooperation with it. Then I can feel what is going on.\nIf something happens in the body, allow it – whatsoever it is. At least in front of me don’t hide, don’t hold anything.\nNothing is a problem.it will go, mm? Keep this with you, and every night you have to do this.\nJust remember methat I am sitting in front of you. You were able to leave your grip a little. So just\nput this on your head for three minutes and allow whatsoever happens. Then put it under the pillow and go to sleep so I can work on you the whole night. Good!\n[Another sannyasin says: I find when I’m meditating that I have a lot of energy coming in here (indicating the third eye) but not going anywhere]\nDo one thing. Find some sandalwood – you will be able to find it in the market – and rub it on stone with some water. Put a tikka just here (Osho touches his third eye); just a spot of sandalwood paste. Do it for at least two weeks, and then tell me. There is no problem.\nWhenever energy comes there, in the beginning it is such a change that the eyes feel it and the whole space changes, so something which goes deep inside and is cooling is helpful. Sandalwood is perfect. In hindi temples they always use it.\nIt is good that the energy is coming there... it is the third eye centre. Only after energy comes to that point does growth really start. So just do it... and there is nothing to worry about. Everything is going well.\n[The therapist who co-led the Primal group which was present tonight, said that he felt he was absorbing too much energy from other people, and was there anything one could do to prevent this?]\nJust do one thing. During the day, in the group, look at least ten or fifteen times to see whether your stomach is relaxed or tense. If it is tense, relax it – just the stomach.\nIf it is tense you collect any energy that is around, and it is dangerous, because these groups release so much negative energy. They are meant to do that, and people who are releasing it will not be affected, but leaders will be if they are not relaxed. So if you see that the stomach is tense, relax the belly and breathe by it. Make it a habit by and by that you don’t breathe by the chest but by the belly.\nThere are very many false notions about breathing, and almost all over the world, people have started breathing by the chest. Breathing by the belly relaxes your whole being – your psyche and soma, both – and society does not allow a relaxed being. He will be spontaneous, and he will move moment to moment. You cannot enforce rules on him. He cannot be regulated, regimented, manipulated. He will be like a child – and you cannot regiment a child. The moment you succeed in regimenting a child, he is dead.\nNear the age of four, all children are massacred. Then they just live for the namesake. Just a dead thing continues, but the real has left. The day they leave spontaneity, they have died. The average limit of human beings is four years old, and after that we pull on, drag on But life disappears so of course no blooming ever happens, no fulfillment, no benediction .\nSo do it in the group, and also when you are not taking a group. Only when it has become a natural thing can it help you in the group. And by and by it comes naturally, easily. Then there is no need to remember it – you simply breathe by the stomach.\nThen you will never absorb any negative energy. Just the opposite starts happening – you start absorbing positive energy.\nA tense being is hankering for some negativity, is trying to find some excuse to go sour and bitter. When you are relaxed, you become sensitive to a different level of energy the positive. It is as if a negative energy person comes near a rosebush. He will count the thorns; he will not look at the flowers. The flowers are also there, but he will somehow miss them; he will overlook them.\nWhen a man with positive energy, relaxed, comes near a rosebush, the same rosebush, he doesn’t start counting the thorns. They are there, but somehow they don’t matter. He looks at the roses – and the roses become so overpowering, so overwhelming, that who bothers about the thorns? If you count the thorns, you will become depleted, angry, dissipated. You will be in a very bad mood... you will become a thorn, because whatsoever you absorb, you become.\nThat is the meaning of the old adage: Whatsoever you eat, you become. It doesn’t mean simply the food. Whatsoever you eat – and that includes all the vibrations that you take in – you become. If\nyou go on absorbing negativities, you become a wound, and anybody who comes near you will be offended by your being; will be hurt by you in certain ways. You cannot help it; you are a wound. Your pus is overflowing to other people in your relationship. The wound is going to stink.\nSo it becomes a vicious circle: when you have a wound, you absorb more negativity. Then the wound becomes bigger and bigger and bigger.\nSo start relaxing the stomach and breathing by the belly. Make a practice of it. Lying down on the bed before you go to sleep, for three or four minutes breathe by the belly. In the morning when you awake, breathe by the belly. Just do it whenever you remember. Have more feeling for the belly.\nIn Japan they say: Think by the belly. Even thinking can be done by the belly – then a man becomes perfectly relaxed. For centuries in Japan they had been thinking that the real thinking process was in the belly, not in the head – and they are right. There is a different quality of thinking which goes on in the belly... it is intuitive; what you call a hunch.\nWomen think more from the belly than men. Man goes on groping in the dark with logic. Women simply jump to conclusions without any process in between. That’s the problem – man cannot understand how women come to their conclusions. And almost always they are right – illogical, but right. They live on hunches. And of course they have a more empty belly than man. They have a womb inside, and they have more space inside.\nSo try breathing by the belly, and then tell me, mm?\n[The other primal leader says it was: Difficult at first, but eventually I just allowed myself to show my fears and expose my motives and let go of the veneer that I carry of being the professional therapist. I still feel it’s there inside me but, for the first time, in this group I was able to let go of that for periods.]\nThat has been a good experience.\nOne day or other, one has to forget all that includes what you call the professional attitude. The technical part of it is needed, but one should not be controlled by it. Use it, but never be just the professional, otherwise you become inhuman. And then difficulties arise.\nDifficulties arise because you lose contact. You are an expert – you know the technique, you know the know-how – and others are just human beings. A distance arises.\nIt is good to express your fears – you become more human. It is good to say that you are also a human being; that you are not perfect, but a human being.\nOf course you are leading the group, but you are as much a participant as the others. You are as prone to commit errors as others. You have your own problems – it is not that your problems are solved, and you can play around with the attitude of ‘holier than you’. Otherwise a distance arises, and that distance will make you tense. It is not going to help you, and it is not going to help others.\nThese groups are not part of what is called expertise. No knowing is needed. But remain human, relaxed, and be always ready to accept that you have made a mistake. That will make a bridge\nbetween you and the participants. They will have much more feeling for you. And once they see that you are also human just like them, they will feel more relaxed with you.\nAnd that is my whole purpose here. In these groups, by and by I would like that the difference between the leader and the led disappears. In fact the totality becomes the leader. The group mind becomes the leader... the collective consciousness becomes the leader. And the leader is, at the most, just to give directions so that time is not wasted. Otherwise, even without a leader it can come to a conclusion. It will take a little longer, that’s all. I am thinking about that too.…\nAfter a few months, I am going to start a group without any leaders; just the participants. But those will be the people who have passed through all the groups. Even leaders can participate in it – but they will be just participants, not leaders. Just the total mind, mm? Just the group consciousness leads wherever.\nIt will take a little longer time, but it will come to better conclusions than any leader-led group. Because the very effort to lead brings a resistance into the led. It is so automatic that nobody is aware of it. The leader is not aware that behind the curtain of leadership he may have started manipulating; that the ego may have entered in a subtle garb. And the led are not conscious of any resistance – but underground, an undercurrent of conflict, of resistance, arises .\nSo by and by, within two, three groups, you will he able to float completely. Forget all that you know. If it is needed, it will come to you. Whenever it is needed, it will surface in your consciousness. Just go into the group as if you don’t know anything, and on the spur of the moment start working. Then things take their own shape. You are there just so that time is not wasted and so people are not moving in circles. You simply help them go towards some conclusion, towards some growth. The effort becomes a process – a process and a progress – but not a running in circles.\nAnd the more your leader will disappear, the better leader you will become, and the better you will feel the results are coming. One day, when the leader is completely gone, you simply become a channel for tremendous energies to enter and take possession.\nIn fact the leader has to become a vehicle for the unconscious of the led. The led also know the clues, but the clues are deep down in the unconscious. They also know what to do but are not certain. You have to become just vehicles for their own unconscious, so that they come to know something that they know already. Then they will see that you have been vocalising their own hidden understandings; that you are becoming their articulations; that whatsoever they could not say, you have said. But they will feel it is theirs – and then there is no resistance.\nThat is the difference between the modern psychoanalyst and the old witch doctor. The witch doctor was more in tune with the unconscious. Even now in primitive societies.… In India there are many tribes which are very primitive. Their shaman is totally different. The first thing is that he should become possessed. If somebody comes to ask something, he cannot answer them because consciously, who hears to answer?\nSo drums are beaten, music is played, incense is burned, and he starts moving. He starts dancing, starts shouting gibberish. And then he is possessed, perspiring... radiant with some other energy.\nYou ask... now the question is yours – and the answer is also yours. He is just a vehicle. He is no more the person he was there, just a minute before, or a few minutes before. And after he has answered, he comes back. Again he is the same old man... but he will not even accept your thanks. No money is to be taken, no thanks are to be accepted, because he has not done anything. He simply helps you to do something to yourself, mm? He was just a medium. He played a role – just a bridge between you and you.\nThat is the meaning really, for me, of a leader. A leader has to be so group-possessed.So relax\nmore and more.\nIt has been good.the next group is going to be better, and after three groups you will be totally\ndifferent. Good.\n[A group member says: I went very very deep this time. The second day my body wanted to run awayit was crying. I didn’t want to take the pain of the group.\nAnd I felt so much like a motherlike mother earth. And I could feel everything that everybody was\nfeeling. I realised that I had that quality all the time, but I am still afraid to exercise it, to use my intuition, because I feel that I am interfering with other people.]\nMm.it has been a good experience, tremendously good.\nWoman is basically the earth, the earth element. Woman is naturally the mother. But the modern woman has lost that dimension. She no more understands herself as the mother or as the earth. She has become more imitative of man, and is missing much in that imitation.missing her own\nnatural self, her own authentic being.\nIf a woman goes deeper, immediately she becomes a mother. Hence I call my sannyasins ‘ma’. There is a spontaneous and natural quality. Motherhood is a function of woman.\nMan is tremendously poor in that way, and he goes on trying to find something by which he can complement the inherent poverty. Because man is not a mother, he becomes a poet. He gives birth to poetry because he cannot give birth to a man. He becomes a painter, a sculptor; he becomes a scientist. He becomes a thousand and one things just to find something comparably satisfying. That’s why man is more creative... he creates everything. But he is creative because naturally he lacks the dimension of creation – so he tries to substitute it.\nIt is good that you felt that. Now remain in that consciousness, and don’t disturb it. When you feel that you are part of the earth, you are moving into very deep forces. You will have many intuitions which only happen when you are one with your natural being. Then it will also arise that many times you would like to say something, but then you will feel that it will be an interference. Remain alert, mm? Because it can become an interference.\nOnly when you feel that it is going to help, only when you feel that it is going to be naturally beneficial, use it. Otherwise keep quiet, keep mum about it. Sometimes your insights can become an interference to somebody. It may be true, the insight may be true.…\nIt happened once that a man came to me. He had been passing a street when he met a jaina monk. The jaina monk looked at him and said ‘You will die within three months’. The man became afraid, naturally. He went home and he became ill. He felt nausea; he vomited. He tried to throw it out, but it wouldn’t go... it haunted him. He told his wife and she started crying. Then the children came to know, and the whole neighbourhood.\nSomebody brought that man to me. The moment I saw him, I knew the jaina monk was right. But still, this was an interference. At least he was going to live three months more... you have killed him right now! Not that the monk was wrong. It was right – the man was going to die within three months; it was so, perfectly true. But I told the man that that monk seems to be mad, and that I would go with him to the monk, and that he should report the monk to the police – because he is a murderer! I told him that he was not going to die, and not to be worried.\nThe man became very happy. He reported it to the police, and I went with him to see the jaina monk. The jaina monk became afraid when he saw me. He said ‘But I felt...’ But that is not the point. I said to him that it was not his business, and that this man was not going to die, and was he certain about it? The man might die just because he had told him; then who would be the murderer?\nThe monk became very afraid when he heard that it had been reported to the police and that it could become a criminal case. He apologised and said that he was wrong, and that he had been reading some astrological books, and that he had felt that he was right. And the man survived... he has not died. He is still alive.\nThe jaina monk was right, the insight was right, but insight is not absolute certainty. Life is a hazard. It is not mathematical. Sometimes two plus two are four, sometimes not. Sometimes two plus two make five. Sometimes two plus two don’t make four, they are three. Life is not very mathematical; no mathematician can explain it.\nWhen you are saying something about life and death, you should hesitate. Be more respectful... it is none of your business. If you feel, write it down in your diary, but don’t say anything to anybody. When the person has died, then you can show people your diary, show them that this has been your feeling, mm? But never interfere.\nAnd with this earth feeling, this will come. You will have more and more hunches. You will become authentic woman, and then more hunches will be there... irrational insights; suddenly you will see something. But wait. Seeing is good, but one has to think before saying it – at least three times you should think about it. Mm? Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5412","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/be_realistic_plan_for_a_miracle/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/be_realistic_plan_for_a_miracle/>Be Realistic.

as he was already involved with a movement in Japan, called Tenrikyo,
which he said started just one hundred and fifty years ago in Japan, and
was something akin to Buddhism, yet not Buddhism.]</p><p><br></p><p>No need to leave it right now. Just go on making all efforts to
search deep. If you can find something higher, then leave it; then it is
left automatically. Whether you leave it or not is not the question. You
grow out of it rather than leaving it. You follow me?</p><p><br></p><p>And I am giving you something which can grow anywhere – in whatsoever
religion you are, in whatsoever church you belong. I am against nobody.
You can remain in your church and still grow.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor takes sannyas.]</p><p><br></p><p>This will be your name: Swami Anand Mansoor.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means blissful, happy, and Mansoor is the name of sufi mystic.
Have you heard the name – Mansoor Al Hillaj?</p><p><br></p><p>Read something about him... you can find many books in English. You
have been connected with him in your past life that’s why I give you the
name.</p><p><br></p><p>He was crucified – just like Jesus. Mohammedans killed him because he
uttered something which Mohammedans think is dangerous. He said ‘I am
God’ – and that created trouble for him, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole name is Mansoor Al Hillaj; yours will be simply Mansoor.
Have you something to say?</p><p>[Mansoor asked: Yes<span class=s4></span>How to love my mother?</p><p><br></p><p>The translator went on to say that Mansoor loved his mother and felt
that she was the one he was looking for as a lover or wife – but that he
felt this was not good.]</p><p><br></p><p>A mother has to be loved in a totally different way. She is not your
beloved – and cannot be. If you become too much attached to your mother,
you will not be able to find a beloved. And then deep down you will be
angry with your mother – because it is because of her that you couldn’t
move to another woman.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is part of growth that one has to move away from the parents.
It is just as your being in the womb and then having to come out of it.
That was leaving your mother, in a way. . . in a way, betraying her. But
if inside the womb the child thinks that this will be a betrayal – ‘How
can I leave my mother who has given birth to me?’ – then he will kill
himself and the mother also. He has to come out of the womb.</p><p><br></p><p>First he is joined with the mother completely. . .then the cord has
to be cut. He starts breathing on his own; that is the beginning of
growth. He becomes an individual; he starts functioning separately. But
for many years he will still remain dependent. For milk, food, shelter,
love, he will depend on the mother; he is helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>But as he becomes stronger, he will start moving further and further
away. Then milk will stop, and then he will have to depend on some other
food. Now he is going even further away.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day he has to go to school, has to make friends. And when he
becomes a young man, he falls in love with a woman and completely
forgets the mother in a way, because this new woman overwhelms him,
overpowers him.</p><p><br></p><p>If it doesn’t happen, then something has gone wrong. If the mother
tries to cling to you she is not fulfilling her duty as a mother. It is
a very delicate duty. A mother has to help you go away – that’s the
delicacy of it. A mother has to make you strong so that you can go away
from her. That’s her love. Then she is fulfilling her duty. If you cling
to the mother, then too you are doing wrong. Then it is going against
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if a river starts flowing upstream.<span class=s4></span>then everything will be topsy-turvy.</p><p><br></p><p>The mother is your source. If you start floating towards the mother,
you are going upstream. You have to move away. The river has to go away
from the source to the ocean. But that doesn’t mean that you are not in
love with your mother.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember that love for the mother has to be more like respect,
less like love. Love towards yoUr mother has to be more of the quality
of gratefulness, respect – deep respect. She has given you birth, she
has brought you into the world. Your love has to be very very prayerful
towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>So do whatsoever you can do to serve her. But don’t make your love
like the love for a beloved, otherwise you are confusing your mother
with the beloved. And when goals are confused, you will become confused.
So remember well that your destiny is to find a lover – another woman,
not your</p><p>mother. Then only for the first time you will become perfectly
mature. Because finding another woman means that now you are completely
cut away from the mother... the final cord has been cut now.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why there is a subtle antagonism between the mother and the
wife of her son; a very subtle antagonism – all over the world. It has
to be so, because the mother feels somehow that this woman has taken her
son away from her. And that’s natural in a way. Natural, but ignorant.
The mother should be happy that some other woman has been found. Now her
child is no more a child... he has become a mature, grown-up person. She
should be happy, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>So you can be mature only in one way – if you go away from the
mother. And this is so on many levels of being. A son has someday to
revolt against the father – not without respect... with deep respect.
But one has to revolt. This is the delicacy: revolution is there,
rebellion is there, but with deep respect. If there is no respect then
that is ugly. Then the rebellion is not beautiful. Then you are missing
something. Rebel... be free... but be respectful, because the father,
the mother, is the source.</p><p><br></p><p>So one has to go away from the parents. Not only away, but sometimes
in many ways, against them. But that should not become anger. It should
not be ugly. It should remain beautiful, respectful. If you go away, go,
but touch the feet of your mother and father. Tell them that you have to
go away... cry. But tell them that you are helpless – you have to go.
The challenge has called you, and you have to go. One cries on leaving
the home. One goes on looking back again and again, with wistful eyes,
nostalgia. The days that have passed were beautiful. But what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>If you cling to the home you will remain crippled. You will remain
juvenile. You will never become a man in your own right. So what I say
to you is to go away with respect. Whenever they need, serve them, be
available. But never misunderstand that your mother is your beloved; she
is your mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Nibbana is Buddha’s word for nirvana. It means enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha never used Sanskrit. He used a local language that was used in
his part of the country. All the words become soft in it – nirvana is
called nibbana. And prem means love.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhamma means the ultimate law, and prem means love – love, the
ultimate law. Dhamma is also Buddha’s word like nibbana. The sanskrit
word is dharma. This form, Buddha’s, is more soft and loving.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Everything is in trouble, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m going back and forth in wanting to be here and in wanting to
leave. In the meditations especially the ones into which I have to put
effort, there is a constant struggle in the mind. The mind’s always
going on and on. It’s like: Go on... I want to stop... Go on ! ... ]</p><p><br></p><p>I think a few groups will be tremendously helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to worry about... it comes to everybody. This moment comes to
everybody. In fact when something is going to happen, the mind will
create all sorts of trouble. If nothing is going to happen,</p><p>the mind will not create any trouble. So it is an indication that the
mind is becoming alert that something is going to happen, and you are
never going to be the same again. So the mind feels apprehensive.</p><p><br></p><p>But each mind functions in the same way... it has a very mechanical
way of functioning. Whenever it becomes a little alert that something is
going to happen – that you are on the brink and if you go a little
closer towards the precipice you will never be able to come back, and
that the same mind will not be able to control you – it becomes afraid,
naturally. It is going to be its death.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind’s death is your life, and the mind’s life is your death. So
the mind protects itself. It has its own vested interests; it has many
investments. Of course, up to now it has been living in the world and it
has done much business, so it is an established thing. Now you are
trying to rebel against it. All meditations are a rebellion against the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>As no established order will allow rebellion easily, neither will the
mind. It is just as if in a society there is some trouble and somebody
tries to go against the rules and the game. The police and the judge,
and the law and the courts, and imprisonment, are all there to prevent
it. The status quo becomes afraid... this cannot be allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is the establishment, the status quo. And once you start
thinking in terms of meditation, you are becoming rebellious. So the
mind will create all sorts of trouble – it is natural .</p><p><br></p><p>Just do a few things. One: do a few groups – which I think will be
immediately helpful. You are giving in, and if you miss this
opportunity, the mind will overpower you and you will be again back in
the prison. You have tried to come out of it just a little... you are
just on the threshold.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have to continue the meditations that you feel are difficult.
The mind has not to be allowed anything. For a few days become an
ascetic. Be a warrior, a fighter. Then I will tell you to relax. Once
the mind knows that you are not going to listen to it, it flops. It just
has to come to the understanding that this man is not going to listen,
so what is the point?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I feel that so much is coming in in the
meditations... my whole life is coming through me.</p><p><br></p><p>... I feel it’s getting tighter and tighter (holding onto her belly),
but I can’t let go, because there’s nothing to let go of.]</p><p><br></p><p>I understand. There is not much to come out, but there is something
very basic there which has to come out . it is not much. Once it comes
out you will feel totally relaxed. Then let-go will become possible.</p><p><br></p><p>So when there are many things it seems easier for a person to bring
them out – because there are so many things, so much rubbish. And
howsoever much you bring out, you still have so much that you are not
worried.</p><p><br></p><p>But you have only one thing... so you will cling to it. You will be
miserly about bringing it out. So this is a problem for people who have
not many things.</p><p>For example, a person has millions of rupees. He can go on throwing a
few rupees here and there – he has nothing much to worry about. But if
there is only one – once gone, it is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>So in the beginning it is going to be a very very tough struggle. But
in a way it is good, because once dropped, it is dropped. And it will be
difficult for you to formulate what it is, because the very formulation
is the beginning of throwing it away.</p><p><br></p><p>So the mind goes on hiding it. It doesn’t even allow you to have a
look at what you have got. Because if you have a look, the very
awareness that you are keeping it, hiding it, holding it, starts the
opposite process – of throw it away. Nobody can hold anything
consciously; unconsciousness is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not that the tightness is coming in the stomach because you
are taking so many things in – no. The tightness is because you are
holding something there. It never comes by taking things in.…</p><p><br></p><p>I will do something... don’t be worried. Continue meditating, and I
would like you to do a few groups also.…</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho passed her a small wooden box, which is charged with his energy
telling her to put it on her head a allow her body to move as it
wanted.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Bring all tightness to the top of your head – as if the whole
tightness from the stomach is being transferred. Force the tightness up
to your head as if there is a magnetism and it is sticking to your head.
And then allow your body energy any movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Cooperate with it, mm? If the hand starts shaking, not only allow it
to shake, help it to shake<span class=s4></span>a</p><p>deep cooperation with it. Then I can feel what is going on.</p><p><br></p><p>If something happens in the body, allow it – whatsoever it is. At
least in front of me don’t hide, don’t hold anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is a problem.<span class=s4></span>it will go, mm? Keep
this with you, and every night you have to do this.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remember me<span class=s4></span>that I am sitting in front of
you. You were able to leave your grip a little. So just</p><p>put this on your head for three minutes and allow whatsoever happens.
Then put it under the pillow and go to sleep so I can work on you the
whole night. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>[Another sannyasin says: I find when I’m meditating that I have a lot
of energy coming in here (indicating the third eye) but not going
anywhere<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Do one thing. Find some sandalwood – you will be able to find it in
the market – and rub it on stone with some water. Put a tikka just here
(Osho touches his third eye); just a spot of sandalwood paste. Do it for
at least two weeks, and then tell me. There is no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever energy comes there, in the beginning it is such a change
that the eyes feel it and the whole space changes, so something which
goes deep inside and is cooling is helpful. Sandalwood is perfect. In
hindi temples they always use it.</p><p>It is good that the energy is coming there... it is the third eye
centre. Only after energy comes to that point does growth really start.
So just do it... and there is nothing to worry about. Everything is
going well.</p><p><br></p><p>[The therapist who co-led the Primal group which was present tonight,
said that he felt he was absorbing too much energy from other people,
and was there anything one could do to prevent this?]</p><p><br></p><p>Just do one thing. During the day, in the group, look at least ten or
fifteen times to see whether your stomach is relaxed or tense. If it is
tense, relax it – just the stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is tense you collect any energy that is around, and it is
dangerous, because these groups release so much negative energy. They
are meant to do that, and people who are releasing it will not be
affected, but leaders will be if they are not relaxed. So if you see
that the stomach is tense, relax the belly and breathe by it. Make it a
habit by and by that you don’t breathe by the chest but by the
belly.</p><p><br></p><p>There are very many false notions about breathing, and almost all
over the world, people have started breathing by the chest. Breathing by
the belly relaxes your whole being – your psyche and soma, both – and
society does not allow a relaxed being. He will be spontaneous, and he
will move moment to moment. You cannot enforce rules on him. He cannot
be regulated, regimented, manipulated. He will be like a child – and you
cannot regiment a child. The moment you succeed in regimenting a child,
he is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Near the age of four, all children are massacred. Then they just live
for the namesake. Just a dead thing continues, but the real has left.
The day they leave spontaneity, they have died. The average limit of
human beings is four years old, and after that we pull on, drag on But
life disappears so of course no blooming ever happens, no fulfillment,
no benediction .</p><p><br></p><p>So do it in the group, and also when you are not taking a group. Only
when it has become a natural thing can it help you in the group. And by
and by it comes naturally, easily. Then there is no need to remember it
– you simply breathe by the stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will never absorb any negative energy. Just the opposite
starts happening – you start absorbing positive energy.</p><p><br></p><p>A tense being is hankering for some negativity, is trying to find
some excuse to go sour and bitter. When you are relaxed, you become
sensitive to a different level of energy the positive. It is as if a
negative energy person comes near a rosebush. He will count the thorns;
he will not look at the flowers. The flowers are also there, but he will
somehow miss them; he will overlook them.</p><p><br></p><p>When a man with positive energy, relaxed, comes near a rosebush, the
same rosebush, he doesn’t start counting the thorns. They are there, but
somehow they don’t matter. He looks at the roses – and the roses become
so overpowering, so overwhelming, that who bothers about the thorns? If
you count the thorns, you will become depleted, angry, dissipated. You
will be in a very bad mood... you will become a thorn, because
whatsoever you absorb, you become.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of the old adage: Whatsoever you eat, you become.
It doesn’t mean simply the food. Whatsoever you eat – and that includes
all the vibrations that you take in – you become. If</p><p>you go on absorbing negativities, you become a wound, and anybody who
comes near you will be offended by your being; will be hurt by you in
certain ways. You cannot help it; you are a wound. Your pus is
overflowing to other people in your relationship. The wound is going to
stink.</p><p><br></p><p>So it becomes a vicious circle: when you have a wound, you absorb
more negativity. Then the wound becomes bigger and bigger and
bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>So start relaxing the stomach and breathing by the belly. Make a
practice of it. Lying down on the bed before you go to sleep, for three
or four minutes breathe by the belly. In the morning when you awake,
breathe by the belly. Just do it whenever you remember. Have more
feeling for the belly.</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan they say: Think by the belly. Even thinking can be done by
the belly – then a man becomes perfectly relaxed. For centuries in Japan
they had been thinking that the real thinking process was in the belly,
not in the head – and they are right. There is a different quality of
thinking which goes on in the belly... it is intuitive; what you call a
hunch.</p><p><br></p><p>Women think more from the belly than men. Man goes on groping in the
dark with logic. Women simply jump to conclusions without any process in
between. That’s the problem – man cannot understand how women come to
their conclusions. And almost always they are right – illogical, but
right. They live on hunches. And of course they have a more empty belly
than man. They have a womb inside, and they have more space inside.</p><p><br></p><p>So try breathing by the belly, and then tell me, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[The other primal leader says it was: Difficult at first, but
eventually I just allowed myself to show my fears and expose my motives
and let go of the veneer that I carry of being the professional
therapist. I still feel it’s there inside me but, for the first time, in
this group I was able to let go of that for periods.]</p><p><br></p><p>That has been a good experience.</p><p><br></p><p>One day or other, one has to forget all that includes what you call
the professional attitude. The technical part of it is needed, but one
should not be controlled by it. Use it, but never be just the
professional, otherwise you become inhuman. And then difficulties
arise.</p><p><br></p><p>Difficulties arise because you lose contact. You are an expert – you
know the technique, you know the know-how – and others are just human
beings. A distance arises.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to express your fears – you become more human. It is good
to say that you are also a human being; that you are not perfect, but a
human being.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course you are leading the group, but you are as much a
participant as the others. You are as prone to commit errors as others.
You have your own problems – it is not that your problems are solved,
and you can play around with the attitude of ‘holier than you’.
Otherwise a distance arises, and that distance will make you tense. It
is not going to help you, and it is not going to help others.</p><p><br></p><p>These groups are not part of what is called expertise. No knowing is
needed. But remain human, relaxed, and be always ready to accept that
you have made a mistake. That will make a bridge</p><p>between you and the participants. They will have much more feeling
for you. And once they see that you are also human just like them, they
will feel more relaxed with you.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is my whole purpose here. In these groups, by and by I would
like that the difference between the leader and the led disappears. In
fact the totality becomes the leader. The group mind becomes the
leader... the collective consciousness becomes the leader. And the
leader is, at the most, just to give directions so that time is not
wasted. Otherwise, even without a leader it can come to a conclusion. It
will take a little longer, that’s all. I am thinking about that
too.…</p><p><br></p><p>After a few months, I am going to start a group without any leaders;
just the participants. But those will be the people who have passed
through all the groups. Even leaders can participate in it – but they
will be just participants, not leaders. Just the total mind, mm? Just
the group consciousness leads wherever.</p><p><br></p><p>It will take a little longer time, but it will come to better
conclusions than any leader-led group. Because the very effort to lead
brings a resistance into the led. It is so automatic that nobody is
aware of it. The leader is not aware that behind the curtain of
leadership he may have started manipulating; that the ego may have
entered in a subtle garb. And the led are not conscious of any
resistance – but underground, an undercurrent of conflict, of
resistance, arises .</p><p><br></p><p>So by and by, within two, three groups, you will he able to float
completely. Forget all that you know. If it is needed, it will come to
you. Whenever it is needed, it will surface in your consciousness. Just
go into the group as if you don’t know anything, and on the spur of the
moment start working. Then things take their own shape. You are there
just so that time is not wasted and so people are not moving in circles.
You simply help them go towards some conclusion, towards some growth.
The effort becomes a process – a process and a progress – but not a
running in circles.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more your leader will disappear, the better leader you will
become, and the better you will feel the results are coming. One day,
when the leader is completely gone, you simply become a channel for
tremendous energies to enter and take possession.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact the leader has to become a vehicle for the unconscious of the
led. The led also know the clues, but the clues are deep down in the
unconscious. They also know what to do but are not certain. You have to
become just vehicles for their own unconscious, so that they come to
know something that they know already. Then they will see that you have
been vocalising their own hidden understandings; that you are becoming
their articulations; that whatsoever they could not say, you have said.
But they will feel it is theirs – and then there is no resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the difference between the modern psychoanalyst and the old
witch doctor. The witch doctor was more in tune with the unconscious.
Even now in primitive societies.… In India there are many tribes which
are very primitive. Their shaman is totally different. The first thing
is that he should become possessed. If somebody comes to ask something,
he cannot answer them because consciously, who hears to answer?</p><p><br></p><p>So drums are beaten, music is played, incense is burned, and he
starts moving. He starts dancing, starts shouting gibberish. And then he
is possessed, perspiring... radiant with some other energy.</p><p>You ask... now the question is yours – and the answer is also yours.
He is just a vehicle. He is no more the person he was there, just a
minute before, or a few minutes before. And after he has answered, he
comes back. Again he is the same old man... but he will not even accept
your thanks. No money is to be taken, no thanks are to be accepted,
because he has not done anything. He simply helps you to do something to
yourself, mm? He was just a medium. He played a role – just a bridge
between you and you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning really, for me, of a leader. A leader has to be
so group-possessed.<span class=s4></span>So relax</p><p>more and more.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been good.<span class=s4></span>the next group is going to
be better, and after three groups you will be totally</p><p>different. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A group member says: I went very very deep this time. The second day
my body wanted to run away<span class=s4></span>it was crying. I
didn’t want to take the pain of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>And I felt so much like a mother<span class=s4></span>like mother
earth. And I could feel everything that everybody was</p><p>feeling. I realised that I had that quality all the time, but I am
still afraid to exercise it, to use my intuition, because I feel that I
am interfering with other people.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm.<span class=s4></span>it has been a good experience,
tremendously good.</p><p><br></p><p>Woman is basically the earth, the earth element. Woman is naturally
the mother. But the modern woman has lost that dimension. She no more
understands herself as the mother or as the earth. She has become more
imitative of man, and is missing much in that imitation.<span class=s4></span>missing her own</p><p>natural self, her own authentic being.</p><p><br></p><p>If a woman goes deeper, immediately she becomes a mother. Hence I
call my sannyasins ‘ma’. There is a spontaneous and natural quality.
Motherhood is a function of woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is tremendously poor in that way, and he goes on trying to find
something by which he can complement the inherent poverty. Because man
is not a mother, he becomes a poet. He gives birth to poetry because he
cannot give birth to a man. He becomes a painter, a sculptor; he becomes
a scientist. He becomes a thousand and one things just to find something
comparably satisfying. That’s why man is more creative... he creates
everything. But he is creative because naturally he lacks the dimension
of creation – so he tries to substitute it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you felt that. Now remain in that consciousness, and
don’t disturb it. When you feel that you are part of the earth, you are
moving into very deep forces. You will have many intuitions which only
happen when you are one with your natural being. Then it will also arise
that many times you would like to say something, but then you will feel
that it will be an interference. Remain alert, mm? Because it can become
an interference.</p><p><br></p><p>Only when you feel that it is going to help, only when you feel that
it is going to be naturally beneficial, use it. Otherwise keep quiet,
keep mum about it. Sometimes your insights can become an interference to
somebody. It may be true, the insight may be true.…</p><p>It happened once that a man came to me. He had been passing a street
when he met a jaina monk. The jaina monk looked at him and said ‘You
will die within three months’. The man became afraid, naturally. He went
home and he became ill. He felt nausea; he vomited. He tried to throw it
out, but it wouldn’t go... it haunted him. He told his wife and she
started crying. Then the children came to know, and the whole
neighbourhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody brought that man to me. The moment I saw him, I knew the
jaina monk was right. But still, this was an interference. At least he
was going to live three months more... you have killed him right now!
Not that the monk was wrong. It was right – the man was going to die
within three months; it was so, perfectly true. But I told the man that
that monk seems to be mad, and that I would go with him to the monk, and
that he should report the monk to the police – because he is a murderer!
I told him that he was not going to die, and not to be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>The man became very happy. He reported it to the police, and I went
with him to see the jaina monk. The jaina monk became afraid when he saw
me. He said ‘But I felt...’ But that is not the point. I said to him
that it was not his business, and that this man was not going to die,
and was he certain about it? The man might die just because he had told
him; then who would be the murderer?</p><p><br></p><p>The monk became very afraid when he heard that it had been reported
to the police and that it could become a criminal case. He apologised
and said that he was wrong, and that he had been reading some
astrological books, and that he had felt that he was right. And the man
survived... he has not died. He is still alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The jaina monk was right, the insight was right, but insight is not
absolute certainty. Life is a hazard. It is not mathematical. Sometimes
two plus two are four, sometimes not. Sometimes two plus two make five.
Sometimes two plus two don’t make four, they are three. Life is not very
mathematical; no mathematician can explain it.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are saying something about life and death, you should
hesitate. Be more respectful... it is none of your business. If you
feel, write it down in your diary, but don’t say anything to anybody.
When the person has died, then you can show people your diary, show them
that this has been your feeling, mm? But never interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>And with this earth feeling, this will come. You will have more and
more hunches. You will become authentic woman, and then more hunches
will be there... irrational insights; suddenly you will see something.
But wait. Seeing is good, but one has to think before saying it – at
least three times you should think about it. Mm? Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

This new space is your reality. Whatsoever you have known up to now was not really you. It was the identity given by others – the parents, the society, the world. Now you are coming to encounter yourself.\nSometimes it will be very scary – so remember it. Sometimes you will feel that you are losing your identity... getting lost. So remember, that is how it has to be – and go into it. Lose all track of yourself, and then for the first time you will be back home. You have to dissolve into this new space.\nThere is going to be a great struggle between the old and the new. Ahead there is going to be almost a war within you, because the new will try to spread all over you, and the old will try to resist, to fight it back, not to allow it to happen. There is going to be a conflict, a wrestling, between you and you, your past and your future, that which you have been up to now and that which you are going to be from now on.\nSo always remember that the past has to be dropped and the future has to be chosen. It is risky... the past is very secure, comfortable, convenient – but it is dead. It is like a grave. If you choose it, you choose death.\nThe future is very scary, frightening, but it is open. It is alive. It is adventure. Risk is there, insecurity is there, but that’s how life flowers – in insecurity. That’s how life comes to be integrated – in risk. The more risk you take, the more grounded you are. Each moment will be a thrill – sometimes very frightening, sometimes very blissful. I can promise only one thing – that it will be a constant thrill, frightening or blissful, but it .will be a thrill. Each moment you will be coming upon something new. It will be a constant wonder. It will be both a wandering and a wondering.\n2\nFrom now onwards it will be very difficult for you to know who you are. This new space will destroy all old identities, past formulations of your being, boundaries, demarcations, definitions. This new space is very dangerous. It is like death. It can spread all over you. It is going to kill you utterly, completely. But in that very destruction is creation. In that very destruction you will start having a new life which is eternal... which knows no beginning and no end... which is not of this world, and which is not of time and which is not of mind.\nSo if you can dare, the benediction is very close by. If you are ready to be crucified, the resurrection is waiting for you. So help this new spirit to grow. Help this new spirit to overpower you, to overwhelm you, to efface you completely and to erase you completely. That’s what meditation is all about.\n... whenever out of nothingness you feel an urgency to come. come, mm?\n... I am this new space. So cooperate with it and you will be cooperating with me. Surrender to it and you will be surrendering to me.…\n[A sannyasin says: I even stopped meditation. I don’t do it, and I was feeling disturbed about that. Everything seems to be routine, dull. I don’t know what to do with it. I want to know what it’s all about.]\nJust accept this state. Don’t condemn it. Don’t say that there is no enthusiasm, don’t say that it is dull – because these very words are antagonistic. They show a dislike – that you would like to be enthusiastic but there is no enthusiasm. You would like to be interested in many things and there is no interest. You would like to be very sharp and everything is dull.\nAccept it so totally that there is no judgement. This is the way you are. And in fact what is there to be interested in life? The truth is that there is nothing much. What is there? It is a dull routine.\nJust accept it and it will be a tremendous help. I’m not saying that by accepting it the enthusiasm will come back – no. I’m simply saying that by accepting it, you will not feel it as a lack of enthusiasm. You will feel it as a sort of relaxation – the whole attitude changes. Then you will not call it dullness, you will call it a non-ambitiousness. And it makes a lot of difference what you call it.\nThere is a saying of Lao Tzu that the whole world seems to be very sharp and intelligent – only he is dull. But he was joking. He was saying that the whole world seems to be foolishly interested – running and rushing here and there – for nothing!\nSomething has started to happen to you through meditation. That’s why you are feeling no interest. A sort of renunciation is arising. So just go on working and remain uninterested – there is nothing to be interested in. By and by a great benediction will arise in you. Right now you are feeling restless because you feel that something is wrong. Once you accept it, the restlessness disappears and nothing is wrong. Then this is the way you are, and this is the way you have to grow.\nAs I can see, your energy is better than ever. As I can see, it is more settled, but this very settlement is giving you trouble. Even if interest in meditation has disappeared, let it go. There is no need to force meditation. This is the way meditation will happen to you.\nJust sit silently. When you have nothing to do, just sit silently. Thoughts move in the mind – let them. Just be a watcher, and that too, not with a stress, with no tension. What else to do? Thoughts are moving and you are there, so you see them, but there is no need to concentrate. Just a very soft look... an unfocused look.\nFor three months be in this dullness. This dullness is going to function as a meditation. This is the way renunciation is coming to you. You will feel indifferent to many things – they are worthless. In fact the problem was that before you were feeling so interested and now you are not, so you think that something is missing. The problem was before, not now.\nWhen a person becomes a little quiet, many things disappear and look foolish. Why go to the hotel and to the club and talk nonsense to people and wear masks and show faces and smile? For what? What is the point of it all?\nThis is good. So put your energy into your work, and the remaining time simply sit and rest, close your eyes. If you welcome this state, this state will give you great benefit. Great is going to be the pay-off, so don’t reject it. And read more and more Lao Tzu in these three months; that will be the right background. Just read a few lines from anywhere.\nHis whole tape is that whatsoever is, is good – his renunciation is tremendous. Even Buddha and Mahavir, their renunciation is not so total because they are still interested in achieving something – maybe not in the world; they are interested in enlightenment.\nLao Tzu says, ‘All nonsense! The world is nonsense – enlightenment too!’ He simply sits there doing nothing.\nJust see the beauty of it. No interest means no desire. No enthusiasm means no passion, no fever, no madness. You are becoming saner, but you have been insane for so long that the sanity will look a little weird. You will have to get accustomed to it.\nBut I am happy. You may be dull – I bless you. Be really dull! And I don’t see restlessness. I see a certain tranquillity coming, a certain stillness descending on you. I can almost feel it and touch it; it is there. But you have a wrong attitude about it, so that is creating a barrier.\nDrop that barrier and let it drown you completely, utterly.\n[A sannyasin says:... the last conversation that I had with my father before he killed himself. It was about being a Jew and my feeling that I was on the outside.\nI asked him what it meant to be a Jew, because he said to me that my feeling of being on the outside of things had to do with being a Jew. He said to be a Jew was to live in discontinuity.]\nMm mm.… In fact everybody on this earth is a Jew, because this whole world is something that doesn’t belong to us, and we don’t belong to it. We are wanderers, strangers, outsiders – man as such is an outsider. Do whatsoever, but you can never become an insider in this world because this world is unreal. You cannot become part of it because you come from reality. Man is a spirit and the world is material. We can go on playing the game, but we remain outsiders. We can try to forget\nourselves, we can create a sort of oblivion, but it is just a trick; it doesn’t help. We are strangers. This fact has to be realised. And that is the meaning of us being a discontinuity.\nWhen we are in God, we are a continuity. When we are in the world, we are a discontinuity. We are uprooted from our soil... we are no more that which we could be. We are no more in the space that is ours – we are somewhere else. Hence everybody is seeking and searching – and every search is in vain, because if we search outside, we search in the world. And if we want to search inside, all search has to stop.\nI have been watching you while you have been here, and this you have to remember – that your problem arises from your being a very serious seeker. Seeking means separation. Seeking means suffering. You can go on seeking, and it is all in vain. It is doomed from the very beginning, because deep inside you is the one you are seeking. The sought has become the seeker – that is the discontinuity.And when all seeking drops, withers away, and you have no more hopes, then suddenly you are there where you always wanted to be. Then suddenly you are centred.\nSeeking leads you astray. And the more you seek, the more frustrated you feel. The more frustrated you feel, the more you seek. It becomes a vicious circle, self-supporting... goes on and on. There is no end to it – it can continue for eternity. One has to understand the very fallacy of search.\nSeek and you will never find. Do not seek and it is there.\nBut it is very difficult to stop searching and seeking. It is very difficult to drop hope, because then it seems as if the whole thing is futile. If there is no hope, why should one live? For what? Where is the meaning? The meaning is herenow – it is not in the seeking. But the mind goes on saying that if you don’t seek, if you don’t make effort, if you don’t go for it, it is not going to happen.\nThe mind is nothing but hope and desire and passion for the future. The mind is a disease, a fever, a feverish state. You will have to understand it: the problem is the mind. And once you understand how it functions, how it projects a desire into the future and then starts rushing towards it.And it\ngoes on projecting like an horizon. It goes on rushing. It gives activity to you but no happiness; it keeps you occupied. But it is a slow suicide and nothing else.\nSo I would like you to ponder over the very mechanism of seeking, the mind, the process of the mind. Once you start looking at the mind and how it functions, then the whole game becomes clear. Then one day in that very clarity, the mind disappears as if it had never existed. It disappears like a dream – and suddenly you are continuous again.\nIt is just like a dream. Tonight you will sleep. When you are asleep and you start dreaming, you are discontinuous with the world in which you have been living while awake. In sleep you are no more the same person. You are no more the mother, the wife, the beloved. You lose all the identity that you had before. A discontinuity happens. You start dreaming of something else – unfulfilled desires. repressed desires.\nIn the morning you are awake again. Now you are discontinuous with the dream-world, but continuous with the waking world. Exactly the same is the case. We are dreaming in God. We are in God, but in a dream. That dream is the mind, and because of this mind we have become\ndiscontinuous with our own nature, with our own reality. Any day that you are awake, you are continuous again. In fact you have always been continuous. Even while asleep and dreaming, underneath the continuity remains, but on the surface one becomes discontinuous.\nWith God we are continuous, but we are not aware of it. As far as our conscious mind is concerned, we are discontinuous, and that creates suffering, because there is a deep urge to be united, to be one, to be in unison with existence. This mind creates a barrier: it always divides, separates – so seeking is separation. The more you seek, the more separated you become. Even if you are seeking unity, that seeking will separate you. And seeking is suffering because the more you seek, the more frustrated you feel.\nThe real religion starts the day one comes to understand that this mind is the root cause of separation. God is herenow. It is already the case. You are not to achieve it and you are not to produce it; it has not to be manufactured. It is already the case... it has already happened. He is and He has always been, and He will always be.\nSomehow we have got involved in dreams. That dream I call the world. And in that world we are all strangers and outsiders because our real home is somewhere else. But if you try it, in the beginning you will have to pass through a transitory period of tremendous hopelessness. You will miss your mind very much because that has been your whole life. For many lives that has been your whole occupation. You will miss it terribly. Those are the days of austerity. Those are the days of real sadhana – to accept it, to remain empty.\nEven if it feels as if one is dropping into nothingness, one goes on dropping into that abyss. One makes no effort to come out of it, because that effort will mean bringing in the mind again. One simply goes on drowning in that emptiness. And one day when you are completely drowned, you will find that emptiness is not emptiness. It was just a wrong interpretation of the old mind. That nothingness was not nothingness.\nThat’s what Buddha calls nirvana – the great nothing. Tremendous is its beauty and immense is its grandeur... infinite is its benediction. But one has to prepare to go into that nothingness.\nThat’s my message for you. Drop seeking. Drop searching. Drop mentation. Dropping mentation is meditation.And accept nothingness. Be nobody. And in that very nobodiness, something will sprout. Be nothing and in that very nothingness, God flowers.\nAll that we can do is to be nothing. Then the continuity happens on its own accord. What we are doing is just the opposite. We are trying to become somebody. And that becoming somebody is the cause of discontinuity. Only God is, so we cannot become somebody. If we are trying to become somebody, we are fighting with God. All ego is a fight against God, because only He can have the authentic ‘I’. He is the centre of existence. All small ‘i’s’ are just competitive – competing with the ultimate ‘I’.\nSo the moment you become nobody, the moment you are ready to become a nothing, suddenly God erupts in you; your continuity is there again. And then you laugh, a great humour arises, because then you see the whole ridiculousness. This is what you were searching for – and it was because of the search that you were not getting it! The whole drama seems to be a great joke.\nSo don’t be serious. Bring a little sense of humour into your life. Let the ridiculous have a space within you. And by and by, rather than planning what to become, just be. Whatsoever is the case, enjoy it. Be joyous in it, celebrate it.\nAnd this is a box for you.…\n[Osho hands hera small wooden box, one of which he gives to sannyasins on leaving Poona. Each box usually contains several hairs from Osho’s beard.]\nThis is an empty box. There is nothing in it – or there is only nothing in it... the great nothing I have talked about to you. I have given many boxes to people, but this is the first empty box that I am giving to you. So whenever you forget, just open it and look at the emptiness of it, the nothingness of it. Let that be your meditation.\nSo whenever you forget and start dreaming and desiring, just open the box and look at it. It is empty. You also be empty looking at it. Let the great nothing happen to you, and through it everything happens on its own accord.\nMan has just to become a non-being – then being arises. Man has to cease for God to be.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3050","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/>The Great Nothing</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3050 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Nothing/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

and rushing here and there – for nothing!</p><p><br></p><p>Something has started to happen to you through meditation. That’s why
you are feeling no interest. A sort of renunciation is arising. So just
go on working and remain uninterested – there is nothing to be
interested in. By and by a great benediction will arise in you. Right
now you are feeling restless because you feel that something is wrong.
Once you accept it, the restlessness disappears and nothing is wrong.
Then this is the way you are, and this is the way you have to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>As I can see, your energy is better than ever. As I can see, it is
more settled, but this very settlement is giving you trouble. Even if
interest in meditation has disappeared, let it go. There is no need to
force meditation. This is the way meditation will happen to you.</p><p>Just sit silently. When you have nothing to do, just sit silently.
Thoughts move in the mind – let them. Just be a watcher, and that too,
not with a stress, with no tension. What else to do? Thoughts are moving
and you are there, so you see them, but there is no need to concentrate.
Just a very soft look... an unfocused look.</p><p><br></p><p>For three months be in this dullness. This dullness is going to
function as a meditation. This is the way renunciation is coming to you.
You will feel indifferent to many things – they are worthless. In fact
the problem was that before you were feeling so interested and now you
are not, so you think that something is missing. The problem was before,
not now.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person becomes a little quiet, many things disappear and look
foolish. Why go to the hotel and to the club and talk nonsense to people
and wear masks and show faces and smile? For what? What is the point of
it all?</p><p><br></p><p>This is good. So put your energy into your work, and the remaining
time simply sit and rest, close your eyes. If you welcome this state,
this state will give you great benefit. Great is going to be the
pay-off, so don’t reject it. And read more and more Lao Tzu in these
three months; that will be the right background. Just read a few lines
from anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>His whole tape is that whatsoever is, is good – his renunciation is
tremendous. Even Buddha and Mahavir, their renunciation is not so total
because they are still interested in achieving something – maybe not in
the world; they are interested in enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, ‘All nonsense! The world is nonsense – enlightenment
too!’ He simply sits there doing nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see the beauty of it. No interest means no desire. No enthusiasm
means no passion, no fever, no madness. You are becoming saner, but you
have been insane for so long that the sanity will look a little weird.
You will have to get accustomed to it.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am happy. You may be dull – I bless you. Be really dull! And I
don’t see restlessness. I see a certain tranquillity coming, a certain
stillness descending on you. I can almost feel it and touch it; it is
there. But you have a wrong attitude about it, so that is creating a
barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop that barrier and let it drown you completely, utterly.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says:... the last conversation that I had with my father
before he killed himself. It was about being a Jew and my feeling that I
was on the outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him what it meant to be a Jew, because he said to me that my
feeling of being on the outside of things had to do with being a Jew. He
said to be a Jew was to live in discontinuity.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm.… In fact everybody on this earth is a Jew, because this whole
world is something that doesn’t belong to us, and we don’t belong to it.
We are wanderers, strangers, outsiders – man as such is an outsider. Do
whatsoever, but you can never become an insider in this world because
this world is unreal. You cannot become part of it because you come from
reality. Man is a spirit and the world is material. We can go on playing
the game, but we remain outsiders. We can try to forget</p><p>ourselves, we can create a sort of oblivion, but it is just a trick;
it doesn’t help. We are strangers. This fact has to be realised. And
that is the meaning of us being a discontinuity.</p><p><br></p><p>When we are in God, we are a continuity. When we are in the world, we
are a discontinuity. We are uprooted from our soil... we are no more
that which we could be. We are no more in the space that is ours – we
are somewhere else. Hence everybody is seeking and searching – and every
search is in vain, because if we search outside, we search in the world.
And if we want to search inside, all search has to stop.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been watching you while you have been here, and this you have
to remember – that your problem arises from your being a very serious
seeker. Seeking means separation. Seeking means suffering. You can go on
seeking, and it is all in vain. It is doomed from the very beginning,
because deep inside you is the one you are seeking. The sought has
become the seeker – that is the discontinuity.And when all seeking
drops, withers away, and you have no more hopes, then suddenly you are
there where you always wanted to be. Then suddenly you are centred.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeking leads you astray. And the more you seek, the more frustrated
you feel. The more frustrated you feel, the more you seek. It becomes a
vicious circle, self-supporting... goes on and on. There is no end to it
– it can continue for eternity. One has to understand the very fallacy
of search.</p><p><br></p><p>Seek and you will never find. Do not seek and it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is very difficult to stop searching and seeking. It is very
difficult to drop hope, because then it seems as if the whole thing is
futile. If there is no hope, why should one live? For what? Where is the
meaning? The meaning is herenow – it is not in the seeking. But the mind
goes on saying that if you don’t seek, if you don’t make effort, if you
don’t go for it, it is not going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is nothing but hope and desire and passion for the future.
The mind is a disease, a fever, a feverish state. You will have to
understand it: the problem is the mind. And once you understand how it
functions, how it projects a desire into the future and then starts
rushing towards it.<span class=s4></span>And it</p><p>goes on projecting like an horizon. It goes on rushing. It gives
activity to you but no happiness; it keeps you occupied. But it is a
slow suicide and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>So I would like you to ponder over the very mechanism of seeking, the
mind, the process of the mind. Once you start looking at the mind and
how it functions, then the whole game becomes clear. Then one day in
that very clarity, the mind disappears as if it had never existed. It
disappears like a dream – and suddenly you are continuous again.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like a dream. Tonight you will sleep. When you are asleep
and you start dreaming, you are discontinuous with the world in which
you have been living while awake. In sleep you are no more the same
person. You are no more the mother, the wife, the beloved. You lose all
the identity that you had before. A discontinuity happens. You start
dreaming of something else – unfulfilled desires. repressed desires.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning you are awake again. Now you are discontinuous with
the dream-world, but continuous with the waking world. Exactly the same
is the case. We are dreaming in God. We are in God, but in a dream. That
dream is the mind, and because of this mind we have become</p><p>discontinuous with our own nature, with our own reality. Any day that
you are awake, you are continuous again. In fact you have always been
continuous. Even while asleep and dreaming, underneath the continuity
remains, but on the surface one becomes discontinuous.</p><p><br></p><p>With God we are continuous, but we are not aware of it. As far as our
conscious mind is concerned, we are discontinuous, and that creates
suffering, because there is a deep urge to be united, to be one, to be
in unison with existence. This mind creates a barrier: it always
divides, separates – so seeking is separation. The more you seek, the
more separated you become. Even if you are seeking unity, that seeking
will separate you. And seeking is suffering because the more you seek,
the more frustrated you feel.</p><p><br></p><p>The real religion starts the day one comes to understand that this
mind is the root cause of separation. God is herenow. It is already the
case. You are not to achieve it and you are not to produce it; it has
not to be manufactured. It is already the case... it has already
happened. He is and He has always been, and He will always be.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow we have got involved in dreams. That dream I call the world.
And in that world we are all strangers and outsiders because our real
home is somewhere else. But if you try it, in the beginning you will
have to pass through a transitory period of tremendous hopelessness. You
will miss your mind very much because that has been your whole life. For
many lives that has been your whole occupation. You will miss it
terribly. Those are the days of austerity. Those are the days of real
sadhana – to accept it, to remain empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if it feels as if one is dropping into nothingness, one goes on
dropping into that abyss. One makes no effort to come out of it, because
that effort will mean bringing in the mind again. One simply goes on
drowning in that emptiness. And one day when you are completely drowned,
you will find that emptiness is not emptiness. It was just a wrong
interpretation of the old mind. That nothingness was not
nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Buddha calls nirvana – the great nothing. Tremendous is
its beauty and immense is its grandeur... infinite is its benediction.
But one has to prepare to go into that nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s my message for you. Drop seeking. Drop searching. Drop
mentation. Dropping mentation is meditation.And accept nothingness. Be
nobody. And in that very nobodiness, something will sprout. Be nothing
and in that very nothingness, God flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>All that we can do is to be nothing. Then the continuity happens on
its own accord. What we are doing is just the opposite. We are trying to
become somebody. And that becoming somebody is the cause of
discontinuity. Only God is, so we cannot become somebody. If we are
trying to become somebody, we are fighting with God. All ego is a fight
against God, because only He can have the authentic ‘I’. He is the
centre of existence. All small ‘i’s’ are just competitive – competing
with the ultimate ‘I’.</p><p><br></p><p>So the moment you become nobody, the moment you are ready to become a
nothing, suddenly God erupts in you; your continuity is there again. And
then you laugh, a great humour arises, because then you see the whole
ridiculousness. This is what you were searching for – and it was because
of the search that you were not getting it! The whole drama seems to be
a great joke.</p><p>So don’t be serious. Bring a little sense of humour into your life.
Let the ridiculous have a space within you. And by and by, rather than
planning what to become, just be. Whatsoever is the case, enjoy it. Be
joyous in it, celebrate it.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is a box for you.…</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho hands hera small wooden box, one of which he gives to
sannyasins on leaving Poona. Each box usually contains several hairs
from Osho’s beard.]</p><p><br></p><p>This is an empty box. There is nothing in it – or there is only
nothing in it... the great nothing I have talked about to you. I have
given many boxes to people, but this is the first empty box that I am
giving to you. So whenever you forget, just open it and look at the
emptiness of it, the nothingness of it. Let that be your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you forget and start dreaming and desiring, just open the
box and look at it. It is empty. You also be empty looking at it. Let
the great nothing happen to you, and through it everything happens on
its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has just to become a non-being – then being arises. Man has to
cease for God to be.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

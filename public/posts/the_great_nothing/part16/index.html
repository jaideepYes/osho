(See ‘Get Out of Your Own Way’ April 22nd, 1976, where Osho talks about healing, and a description of healing during the meditation camps.) I found out that it was not only giving to others, but that it also helped my need too. It’s difficult to say.]\nI understand. Healing is a double-edged sword. It helps both the healer and the healee, because it is really moving into a different space which is therapeutic. When you start healing a person, what you are doing exactly is loving the person, feeling for the person, caring for the person, blessing the person. And in the blessing, the other is blessed. In feeling for the other person your energy starts flowing. In that total concern for the other, the ego disappears. The moment the ego disappears, you become a healer, not before that. Even if it disappears for a single moment, healing will happen.\nWhen the ego is not there, when you are not self-conscious at all – when there is no self to be conscious about; you are simply concerned with the other, totally concentrated in the other – the ego disappears. In that disappearing, God is. That is the therapeutic space. Certainly it is not only for the healee. When God is there you also are healed. The healee is healed, you are healed. Sometimes the healee may not be healed but the healer is always healed, because for the healee to be healed, the same situation is needed – that his ego should disappear – which is more difficult. It is very difficult when you are ill not to be concerned about your illness.\nHe remains concerned, he remains confined, he remains contracted. His whole tension is how to get out of this illness. Because of that ego, that self-concern, that self-consciousness, the healing may be prevented. He may not be able to move into the space into which the healer has moved. So when many times the healing fails, it has nothing to do with the healer. If the healee is not also in that non-ego state, the healing will fail. If both are in that non-ego state, both will be enriched. Nobody is going to be a loser; both will be winning.\n98\nJust close your eyes and go into that healing space. Just feel that you are a healer and let your energy move.\n[Osho checks her energy.]\nVery good. You will be able to become a really good healer. You have that talent, that inborn talent. It is almost like a person who is a born poet. All persons are not poets and all persons are not painters. Healing is also an inborn phenomenon. You have an inborn capacity. If you can just develop it, it will be a tremendous energy – much benefit can happen to people through you and certainly you will be benefited by it. There is nothing to lose; it is a bargain.\nSo continue to heal. As you heal, more and more things will start happening to you; more energy will be coming. But whenever you are healing a person, remember a few things.\n[Osho went on to describe the attitude a healer should take towards the phenomenon of healing – as not being something that he was doing but as something that was happening through him.\nHe suggested the Nadabrahma meditation would be helpful as it created a pacifying atmosphere. He said that if the healing happened, both healee and healer should thank God, and if it did not happen, then too thanks should be offered – because the whole knows better; some illnesses are basic requirements for spiritual growth.\nLastly Osho said that after healing, she should take a shower or at least wash her hands and feet so that she did not retain any of the healer’s energy.]\nBut you have to be a healer. I appoint you to be a healer! And keep this box always. Whenever you are healing somebody. keep this – this will be your contact with me so nothing will go wrong. You can even put this box on the patient’s heart and then nothing wrong will happen to you; you will be protected. Good.\n[Osho asks a sannyasin: What about you? The sannyasin replies: I don’t know.]\nThen tell me and don’t try to hide it. Just by saying, ‘I don’t know,’ it is not going to disappear. Mm? Try to say something. Saying is very miraculous. Half of it disappears just by talking about it.\n[The sannyasin: I don’t know who I am any more.]\n(chuckling) Mm! do you think that anybody else knows? Have you ever come across anybody who knows? And there is no need. What is the point of knowing who you are? Whatsoever is – X Y Z – be, and enjoy it! What are you going to do even if you come to know who you are? What will you do then? Whatsoever you would do, start doing now. Forget about who you are.\n[The sannyasin: I can’t! I can’t forget about it because I watch myself and I hear my voice change. I feel expressions changing and they’re not me.]\nNo, you have a wrong notion about yourself. A man is many men and a woman is many women. We are not one-faceted – we are many-faceted. We have many facets and all are real. A person is like a diamond – the more facets to it, the more precious it is. And it is good that we have many facets.\nHave you seen the indian images of Trimurti? – God has three faces. You must see it. That is the indian concept of God – He has three faces. And when God has three faces, at least three are allowed to everybody!\nThe greater the person, the more faces he has because he is richer. A single face will be monotonous; you will be tired of it. You will be bored to death. I am not here to make your life monotonous. If you want to make your life monotonous, go to a monastery. That is the meaning of the word ‘monastery’ – where people become monotonous. I am here to help you to become richer. Have as many faces as you can afford, and enjoy them all.\nDrop this wrong concept. Start enjoying. All voices are yours, and all faces are yours. When you are angry, that too you are. When you are loving, that too you are. When you are full of hate, that too you are. It is an egoistic trick which says, ‘Not this anger – I’m not this. I am only love. I am just sweetness.’ But then who is going to be the bitterness?\nAccept all! That is more humble and true, so accept everything that is there. It all belongs to you. You are not a single note – you are a full orchestra. So don’t get identified with one thing. This is the ego trip. The ego says, ‘I am good; bad I am not. When I am loving, this is [me]. And when I am full of hatred, that is some devil trying to destroy my life.’ That too is you.\nOnce you accept all these possibilities in yourself, you accept your total being. If you reject any face, you are rejecting a part of yourself, and that part, that rejected part, will take revenge. Sooner or later it will try to dominate you. So never reject anything. Be a multiplicity, and find out that still in that multiplicity there is a unity. You are still one and yet have all the faces. That is the meaning of the symbol of trinity. In Christianity also you have a trinity, three faces. In India we call it Trimurti – the three faces of God – and those three faces are beautiful.\nHave you seen the image of mother Kali, the black mother? See that too. She is black like the devil and she is also the mother. She is tremendously beautiful and tremendously ugly. Very beautiful and yet she has a garland of skulls. In one hand she is carrying the head of a freshly killed person; the blood is dripping out of it. And not only that – she is dancing on her husband’s chest. But this is beauty... this is totality. She is both mother and death.\nSo accept all. For one month be in total acceptance – whatsoever is, is [you]. And after one month, tell me. This is your meditation for one month. Good.\n[The Tathata group present tonight.\nA group member with a black eye said she had never been hit before and she was shocked: I was glad that it happened... that I’m still alive. When I looked in the mirror I felt very sad.]\nMm, nothing to be worried about. Your eye will be okay. It is a good experience sometimes to be hit. It is really a good experience.\nLife is not all roses, and we have been brought up with that idea. so whenever we come against thorns, we cannot cope with them. We are all like green plants, very tender, protected, brought up in a hothouse. So when we come into the world and it is very hot and there is much struggle and it is not so protective as your family or people who have always been with you, then two things are possible. Either one starts withdrawing from the world – lives in the world but in a withdrawal, closed, so that one becomes a cocoon, closed into oneself.…\nThat’s what has happened to many people. They move with their walls around them so that nobody can hit them, nobody can shock them. They avoid all situations where any shock may be possible, but then a person starts dying. because the whole of life is shocking.\nIf you love somebody there is a possibility of fight, struggle, conflict, but if you are too afraid of conflict, you will never love, and you will miss a great benediction. If you want to relate to people, there is always a possibility that there will be some conflict; you can be hit at. So don’t relate – just move politely, formally; never relate deeply with anybody. But then you’ve missed the whole life and the whole purpose of it. Then you live in your grave. One should be vulnerable – that is one of the points to be taught in these groups. One should be vulnerable, and one should be able to face everything that life makes available. Death is also part of it.\nI know it brings sadness, but that’s how it is. If you want to be happy, you have to accept sadness too. The only way not to be sad is not to ask for happiness. Then you are neither sad nor happy – but you are dead.\nAs I feel it, it has been a very good experience for you. Something has shattered, you are shaken, but it is good. It will give you a new upsurge of energy. You will come out of it stronger. It has been a good experience.\n[Another group member said: I experienced a lot of anger coming up. I felt guilty after hitting my partner.]\nAnger can be a very purifying thing. Anger can be almost a fire that can purify you. It is a beautiful experience if one can go totally into it. But then it is difficult to go into anger totally with a person for many reasons: to go to the very end can mean murder, or the other person may not be participating at all – then guilt arises that you are taking advantage. the other may not be participating only to create guilt in you, because these are the tricks of the mind.\nPeople can become martyrs just to create guilt around everybody. Then they become superior. You were angry and they were not, so they become saintly, and you are put down. One can feel guilt, one can feel that it was not right.\nFor you a pillow will be better than a person, because I can see that there is still anger. With a person you will never be in total freedom. A pillow will be perfect. (Osho described the pillow meditation in ‘Hammer On The Rock’, Sunday, December 21st, 1975.)\nFor seven days every night for at least twenty, thirty minutes, go into this anger – it is still there. If it were not there, if you had thrown it completely. you would not have felt guilty – that’s an indication that there is still something. That remaining anger has become guilt now. If anger is completely\npoured out, it leaves you so clean – there can be no guilt. It simply leaves you so fresh, as if you have just come out of your shower. There is nothing negative about it. It is a very positive experience. So just try this, mm?\nBut it has been good... really good. They really got the right button and pushed it properly! [A group member says: I’ve been fighting. It’s started coming out.\nAt Osho’s request the group leader and assistant comment on his energy, then Osho checks his energy.]\nVery good. Everything is going perfectly well, that’s why you are confused. Ordinarily nothing goes well. The confusion is coming, but the energy is moving very smoothly and people are not accustomed to that smoothness. When it is rough and hard, everything is okay. When things become really smooth and soft. one starts feeling confused about what is happening.\nYou are becoming more feminine – that’s confusing. But every grown up person becomes feminine. The male is the child. A grown up person becomes feminine. A Buddha is really a woman, and Nietzsche is right when he says that Jesus is feminine. He says it in a critical, negative way, but some truth is there. You are becoming feminine, the energy is moving really smoothly, and your male mind is apprehensive, afraid.\nAnd [the assistant] is right. You have lived a full life without the heart. Now the whole energy will pass through the heart and you will start almost a new life, which is very confusing and puzzling. One gets settled into a certain pattern, and when one is succeeding in that pattern, it is more confusing to change it. It is very easy when you are a failure to change yoUr pattern because you are not clinging to it. But you have been full, you have been, in a way, happy, contented, but your contentment was negative; it had no ecstasy in it. Your contentment was more like a stillness, but not like silence. It was more like an absence of noise rather than a presence of silence.\nNow the heart has started functioning you will feel many changes in your energy. You have simply to accept it and just float with it. This change is not going to stay for long. Once you float with it, it will disappear. And once it settles you will have a higher attitude of being.\nYou have always lived with the idea that to succeed or to be loved one has to do something. Now you have to learn another secret, which is a higher secret, more esoteric – that to be loved one has just to be. And the ultimate success happens to those who simply pray and wait and don’t do anything.\nIn these moments I will suggest that you read Lao Tzu. Meditate on Tao Te Ching. Just read a few lines, just savour them – there is no need to think about them... just have a taste of it – the taste of Tao. Your energy is at a point where Lao Tzu can be very helpful. So just get hold of Tao Te Ching and open it anywhere, because it is not a book – one dimensional. Anywhere it opens, that’s right. Just read a few lines, taste it, and close the book. Just try to see the point of it; don’t analyse it.\nAt this point you simply need rest, patience. Nothing is needed to be done on your part. If you do anything you will undo the whole process. Simply accept and float with the energy, mm?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2771","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/>The Great Nothing</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2771 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Nothing/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

during the camp. (See ‘Get Out of Your Own Way’ April 22nd, 1976, where
Osho talks about healing, and a description of healing during the

everybody!</p><p><br></p><p>The greater the person, the more faces he has because he is richer. A
single face will be monotonous; you will be tired of it. You will be
bored to death. I am not here to make your life monotonous. If you want
to make your life monotonous, go to a monastery. That is the meaning of
the word ‘monastery’ – where people become monotonous. I am here to help
you to become richer. Have as many faces as you can afford, and enjoy
them all.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this wrong concept. Start enjoying. All voices are yours, and
all faces are yours. When you are angry, that too you are. When you are
loving, that too you are. When you are full of hate, that too you are.
It is an egoistic trick which says, ‘Not this anger – I’m not this. I am
only love. I am just sweetness.’ But then who is going to be the
bitterness?</p><p><br></p><p>Accept all! That is more humble and true, so accept everything that
is there. It all belongs to you. You are not a single note – you are a
full orchestra. So don’t get identified with one thing. This is the ego
trip. The ego says, ‘I am good; bad I am not. When I am loving, this is
[me]. And when I am full of hatred, that is some devil trying to destroy
my life.’ That too is you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you accept all these possibilities in yourself, you accept your
total being. If you reject any face, you are rejecting a part of
yourself, and that part, that rejected part, will take revenge. Sooner
or later it will try to dominate you. So never reject anything. Be a
multiplicity, and find out that still in that multiplicity there is a
unity. You are still one and yet have all the faces. That is the meaning
of the symbol of trinity. In Christianity also you have a trinity, three
faces. In India we call it Trimurti – the three faces of God – and those
three faces are beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen the image of mother Kali, the black mother? See that
too. She is black like the devil and she is also the mother. She is
tremendously beautiful and tremendously ugly. Very beautiful and yet she
has a garland of skulls. In one hand she is carrying the head of a
freshly killed person; the blood is dripping out of it. And not only
that – she is dancing on her husband’s chest. But this is beauty... this
is totality. She is both mother and death.</p><p><br></p><p>So accept all. For one month be in total acceptance – whatsoever is,
is [you]. And after one month, tell me. This is your meditation for one
month. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[The Tathata group present tonight.</p><p><br></p><p>A group member with a black eye said she had never been hit before
and she was shocked: I was glad that it happened... that I’m still
alive. When I looked in the mirror I felt very sad.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, nothing to be worried about. Your eye will be okay. It is a good
experience sometimes to be hit. It is really a good experience.</p><p>Life is not all roses, and we have been brought up with that idea. so
whenever we come against thorns, we cannot cope with them. We are all
like green plants, very tender, protected, brought up in a hothouse. So
when we come into the world and it is very hot and there is much
struggle and it is not so protective as your family or people who have
always been with you, then two things are possible. Either one starts
withdrawing from the world – lives in the world but in a withdrawal,
closed, so that one becomes a cocoon, closed into oneself.…</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened to many people. They move with their walls
around them so that nobody can hit them, nobody can shock them. They
avoid all situations where any shock may be possible, but then a person
starts dying. because the whole of life is shocking.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love somebody there is a possibility of fight, struggle,
conflict, but if you are too afraid of conflict, you will never love,
and you will miss a great benediction. If you want to relate to people,
there is always a possibility that there will be some conflict; you can
be hit at. So don’t relate – just move politely, formally; never relate
deeply with anybody. But then you’ve missed the whole life and the whole
purpose of it. Then you live in your grave. One should be vulnerable –
that is one of the points to be taught in these groups. One should be
vulnerable, and one should be able to face everything that life makes
available. Death is also part of it.</p><p><br></p><p>I know it brings sadness, but that’s how it is. If you want to be
happy, you have to accept sadness too. The only way not to be sad is not
to ask for happiness. Then you are neither sad nor happy – but you are
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>As I feel it, it has been a very good experience for you. Something
has shattered, you are shaken, but it is good. It will give you a new
upsurge of energy. You will come out of it stronger. It has been a good
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>[Another group member said: I experienced a lot of anger coming up. I
felt guilty after hitting my partner.]</p><p><br></p><p>Anger can be a very purifying thing. Anger can be almost a fire that
can purify you. It is a beautiful experience if one can go totally into
it. But then it is difficult to go into anger totally with a person for
many reasons: to go to the very end can mean murder, or the other person
may not be participating at all – then guilt arises that you are taking
advantage. the other may not be participating only to create guilt in
you, because these are the tricks of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>People can become martyrs just to create guilt around everybody. Then
they become superior. You were angry and they were not, so they become
saintly, and you are put down. One can feel guilt, one can feel that it
was not right.</p><p><br></p><p>For you a pillow will be better than a person, because I can see that
there is still anger. With a person you will never be in total freedom.
A pillow will be perfect. (Osho described the pillow meditation in
‘Hammer On The Rock’, Sunday, December 21st, 1975.)</p><p><br></p><p>For seven days every night for at least twenty, thirty minutes, go
into this anger – it is still there. If it were not there, if you had
thrown it completely. you would not have felt guilty – that’s an
indication that there is still something. That remaining anger has
become guilt now. If anger is completely</p><p>poured out, it leaves you so clean – there can be no guilt. It simply
leaves you so fresh, as if you have just come out of your shower. There
is nothing negative about it. It is a very positive experience. So just
try this, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>But it has been good... really good. They really got the right button
and pushed it properly! [A group member says: I’ve been fighting. It’s
started coming out.</p><p>At Osho’s request the group leader and assistant comment on his
energy, then Osho checks his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good. Everything is going perfectly well, that’s why you are
confused. Ordinarily nothing goes well. The confusion is coming, but the
energy is moving very smoothly and people are not accustomed to that
smoothness. When it is rough and hard, everything is okay. When things
become really smooth and soft. one starts feeling confused about what is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>You are becoming more feminine – that’s confusing. But every grown up
person becomes feminine. The male is the child. A grown up person
becomes feminine. A Buddha is really a woman, and Nietzsche is right
when he says that Jesus is feminine. He says it in a critical, negative
way, but some truth is there. You are becoming feminine, the energy is
moving really smoothly, and your male mind is apprehensive, afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>And [the assistant] is right. You have lived a full life without the
heart. Now the whole energy will pass through the heart and you will
start almost a new life, which is very confusing and puzzling. One gets
settled into a certain pattern, and when one is succeeding in that
pattern, it is more confusing to change it. It is very easy when you are
a failure to change yoUr pattern because you are not clinging to it. But
you have been full, you have been, in a way, happy, contented, but your
contentment was negative; it had no ecstasy in it. Your contentment was
more like a stillness, but not like silence. It was more like an absence
of noise rather than a presence of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the heart has started functioning you will feel many changes in
your energy. You have simply to accept it and just float with it. This
change is not going to stay for long. Once you float with it, it will
disappear. And once it settles you will have a higher attitude of
being.</p><p><br></p><p>You have always lived with the idea that to succeed or to be loved
one has to do something. Now you have to learn another secret, which is
a higher secret, more esoteric – that to be loved one has just to be.
And the ultimate success happens to those who simply pray and wait and
don’t do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In these moments I will suggest that you read Lao Tzu. Meditate on
Tao Te Ching. Just read a few lines, just savour them – there is no need
to think about them... just have a taste of it – the taste of Tao. Your
energy is at a point where Lao Tzu can be very helpful. So just get hold
of Tao Te Ching and open it anywhere, because it is not a book – one
dimensional. Anywhere it opens, that’s right. Just read a few lines,
taste it, and close the book. Just try to see the point of it; don’t
analyse it.</p><p><br></p><p>At this point you simply need rest, patience. Nothing is needed to be
done on your part. If you do anything you will undo the whole process.
Simply accept and float with the energy, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

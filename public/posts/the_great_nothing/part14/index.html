It is of immense value and one should not waste it. Because it has been given free we should not waste it. It has been given free because it is beyond value – but ordinarily people think it is valueless, as if there is no value to it. It is beyond value. It transcends value.\nSo each moment has to be transformed into a great offering to God. As He has given life to you, you have to respond. That response is prayer. When you start understanding that this life is so valuable, and that God has shown so much love by giving life to you, by breathing life into you, you start responding towards His love. That response is prayer. It always comes when one feels that one is a gift... that God has been a great benediction.\nSo just feel that you are immensely valuable. When I say immensely valuable, I don’t mean that you have to be comparative. You are not more valuable than others. Everyone is immensely valuable; there is no comparison. When I say immensely valuable, I don’t use the word in a relative way, I don’t say that you are more valuable than others. Nobody is more or less. All are valuable, and all are uniquely valuable. So just try to understand your intrinsic value and start responding towards God. It is already late, and it should not be delayed any more. So feel grateful, feel prayerful.\n[A sannyasin says: I feel that I’m softening up now after the West. It was hard there.]\nThe West is difficult because there you are as if a fish is out of the sea. Here you are in the sea and there you are out of the sea, so it is hard, but that too is a good experience. The fish becomes strong; if it can survive, it becomes very strong. Here meditation comes easier, love comes easier. You are living in a community where communication is very simple. You can say things which you can say nowhere else. You can do things which you can do nowhere else. You can be. That’s what we are trying to do here – to give space to everybody to be.\nSannyas is a space, a freedom – it has no discipline. It is just a space so that everybody can be whatsoever he wants to be. It will not be so easy in the world because the world does not allow you to be yourself: it has its own criterion of how one should be. We have no ‘should’ here. And I accept you totally, unconditionally, as you are.\nIt is difficult in the West, but sometimes it is good to go and face the difficulty. It gives you a backbone.\n[The sannyasin answers: I was teaching there, and I felt that I was brainwashed. I couldn’t teach because I felt at the same level or lower than the children.]\nThat’s right... that’s exactly how it is. People who are thought to be adults are lower than the children. That’s the misery of the world: they should be higher but they are not. After childhood people go on falling down, not growing up – they grow down, they become more aged. They become more experienced, but they become less innocent, and that is a fall from grace. Once you understand it, children will be just the purest possibilities on the earth... closer to God than anything – than any priest, than any bishop, than any pope. They are closer to God because they are still innocent, uncorrupted.\nTo be with children is very meditative, it makes you humble – that’s what has happened to you. It makes you humble, and if you are really understanding, you can learn more from them than you can teach. And what you learn from them is more valuable than you can teach to them.\nWhat can a teacher teach? Algebra, geometry, arithmetic, the three r’s – which are really not of much value. They are utilitarian but have nothing of the eternal in them. But a child can teach you the way to go to God, the child can put you God-ward – he can help you to become a child again. You can be reborn – and the second childhood is the real growth.\nWhen you are reborn, you are higher than the child, because the child is innocent but unaware. The second childhood makes you aware and innocent; there you go higher. And that should be the hope for every human being – to become again like children and yet to retain awareness, because that which is unaware has to be lost one day.\nEvery child is bound to be corrupted, every Adam and Eve is bound to be expelled from the garden of Eden. It is natural, the fall is natural, because the child is unconscious. He does not know what precious innocence he has – and when you don’t know your own treasures, you are going to be robbed. Any snake, any devil, will rob and corrupt you. Innocence is corruptible, vulnerable, unless it is protected by awareness.\nNow these are the two ways: either you become cunning – then nobody can rob you – or you become aware; then too, nobody can rob you. Out of one hundred people, ninety-nine have chosen the path of cunningness. They have been robbed – their childhood innocence is gone. Now they have become afraid that this world is very cunning so one should be cunning with it. They become cunning, but by being cunning they go on falling more and more and more.\nChildhood is lost but there is no need to be cunning – one has just to be aware. That is the path of religion. To be cunning is the way of the world, and to be aware is the path of religion.\nRemain innocent and just be aware, then nobody can corrupt you. Then innocence is incorruptible. For the first time it is really there and it cannot be lost, it cannot be destroyed. It has become a crystallisation in you.\nDeva means divine and swabhava means nature, divine nature. Always try one thing whenever you have time: just close your eyes and look into your own nature, into who you are. Just make this question your mantra, ‘Who am I?’ Don’t try to answer it... don’t make any intellectual answer – that I am this or that. Simply ask, ‘Who am I?’ and wait in silence. Again ask, ‘Who am I?’ and wait in silence. Just the question – no need for the answer – and by and by the question will dissolve.\nThe answer will be there, but with no verbalisation. The answer will be there – not in your mind but in your being. You will feel pregnant with the answer. It will be throbbing there in the deepest core of your being. So the questioning is just to dig deep inside. It has to function as an arrow. So whenever you have time, sitting on your bed doing nothing, just close your eyes and ask the question, and look into your own being. That’s what swabhava is – that’s your nature – and once you start coming in contact with it, it will transform you. It will not only change you – it will transform you.\nChange is mediocre – you remain the same, a little change here and there. Transformation is needed – nothing less is going to help. Total transformation is needed: a one hundred and eighty degree turn. So now this is your meditation... your name is your meditation.\n[A sannyasin says: Sometimes when I look at your picture, or sometimes when I close my eyes and sit there and meditate, there is that feeling of being pulled, and there’s a lot of fear at the same time.\nHe says the pull is from his eyes and chest.]\nCome here and just look at my hands. (Osho was leaning forward in his chair, and had clenched up the fist of his right hand.) Feel as if you are a fist, completely closed. Really become closed.\nWhen I start opening my fist, you start opening like a flower. First just feel that you are a fist and everything is closed.\n[The sannyasin staring intensely at Osho’s fist, began to become more and more tense, his body beginning to shake and beads of perspiration to gather on his face. As Osho slowly and gracefully unfolded his fist, he began to relax until he slumped prostrate on the floor before Osho.]\nGood... good. This you have to do. Whenever you feel this energy, first close yourself – that will put pressure on the energy. Close from everywhere, close up the energy. The energy is in the navel, so let the navel be the centre and close up so that the energy cannot escape and there is no outlet.\nThen remain in that closedness just for one, two, three minutes at the most, and then start opening. There will be a burst of energy because the pressure will be released. The energy will rush towards your third eye, and once it reaches there, all fear will disappear.\nSo the energy has to be made like a fountain. First it has to be pressed, so that when the pressure is removed, it simply rushes forth. You can do this twice, thrice a day, and you will start enjoying it. When it starts reaching to the third eye, you will start having a sort of inner orgasm. And it is so pleasant... it is such a blessing.\nEverything is good. There is nothing to be worried about. [A sannyasin says: : I feel better every day now.]\nThat’s very good. That’s going to happen more and more – and there is no end to it. Very good. Just go on enjoying it. The fear is that of happiness, so when it really comes... First you seek and you think too much about it, you dream about it, but when it really starts coming, one becomes apprehensive.\nFor the whole of your life you have been going only so far in everything. If you were angry, you went so far. If you were sad, you went so far. If you were happy, you went so far. There is a subtle line beyond which you have never gone. Everything goes there and stops. It has become almost automatic, so that the moment you reach that line, you are immediately put off. Everybody has been taught that way – that you are allowed a certain anger but not more than that, because more than that can be dangerous. You are allowed a certain happiness, but not more than that because happiness can be maddening. You are allowed sadness only up to a point, but not more than that, because more than that can be suicidal.\nYou have been trained and there is a china wall around you and everybody else. You never go beyond it. That is your only space, your only freedom, so when you start becoming happy, joyous, that china wall comes in the way. So you have to be aware of that.\nStart doing one experiment that will help tremendously. It is called the method of exaggeration. It is one of the most ancient tibetan methods of meditation. If you are feeling sad, close your eyes and exaggerate sadness. Go into it as much as possible, go beyond the limit. If you want to moan and sob and weep, do. If you feel like rolling on the floor, do, but go beyond the ordinary limit, where you have never gone.\nExaggerate it, because that limit, that constant boundary that you have lived in, has become so much of a routine that unless you go beyond it, you will never be aware – it is part of your habitual mind. So you can become angry but you will not become aware of it unless you go beyond the boundary. Then suddenly it comes into your awareness because something is happening that has never happened before.\nSo do this with sadness, with anger, with jealousy, with whatsoever you are feeling at the moment – with happiness particularly. When you are feeling happy, don’t believe in limits. Just go and rush out of the limits: dance, sing, jog – don’t be a miser. Once you have learned how to trespass the limit, how to transcend the limit, you will be in a totally different world. Then you will know how much you have been missing your whole life.\nTry it. Close your eyes and be happy.\n[The sannyasin closed his eyes and began to laugh, after a few moments falling backwards into the lap of a sannyasin. Slowly sitting upright again, he began to raise his arms slowly, a beatific smile on his face. Osho called him back... ]\nGood... very good! Things are really going well. You were just knocked down by the china wall.\nYou will come against that china wall many times but by and by you will start knowing how to get out of it – because it is really not there; it is just a belief.\n[Osho described the phenomenon of the magic circle of the gipsies and primitive tribes of the Middle East, whereby once a child has been told that he cannot leave a certain space, he finds he simply cannot do so, so strongly is the belief imbedded.]\nGurdjieff learned his first hypnotic method from the Kurds – these people. They are really tremendously hypnotic and they have worked for centuries in hypnosis. This is an hypnotic method. And the china wall is the same kind of thing.\nIn fact it is not there, but you have believed it for so long, so whenever you go, you will be knocked down, back inside – you cannot go beyond it; it has become an automatic mechanism. You simply go so far and you are put off. Your energy simply disappears; you become impotent.\nThis china wall has to be broken. Once this is broken you have infinite space available. Then one has freedom. That’s what moksha is – that you have no boundaries.\nAll boundaries are of belief and mind; they don’t really exist. You believe – that’s why they exist. If you start disbelieving them, doubting them, if you try getting out of them, by and by they wither away; because they are only in your mind, they are not part of reality.\nSo first do this method and then do the camp, mm? And after the camp, do a few groups. Good.\n[A sannyasin who had recently left hospital after an attack of typhoid fever, said that she was feeling paranoid and that her partner did not love her.\nOsho said it was natural to feel negative after illness, unless one was aware, and that illness was a great catharsis. He then asked her partner how he was feeling.\nHe replied that he didn’t hate her, he loved her, but that his initial response to her paranoia was one of anger.]\nIt is natural. There is a little misunderstanding that you have to understand, and which is a good thing to understand.\nWhen you love somebody, and when you are happy with somebody, of course health is part of that happiness. You share the energy with somebody because the person is healthy, flowing. Then suddenly the partner is ill, health disappears; you are left alone. The very reason to be with the person is no more there. You were with the person because you were feeling happy and healthy, because the other person was healthy and happy. So everything was good. Now the other person is ill. He or she is no more flowing, and the whole point of being with them is lost – you feel angry.\nUnless you understand that this is a part of love, that sometimes the other will be ill and that it is natural.… Sometimes you will be ill. You have to be aware and responsible and see that when the other was healthy and happy, you enjoyed her health and happiness. Now the other person is ill. You have to serve, you have to care so that the person becomes healthy and loving and flowing again.\nIn the West this is happening too much because something very basic is being misunderstood. People think that relationships are for when they are happy, good. When something goes wrong – even a physical illness – then why bother? Find another woman, another man – this seems very inhuman. If this attitude remains, love cannot grow. Then whatsoever you call love is nothing but sex, because love means that you care for the person in health, in illness. You care for the person. When the person is loving – and sometimes the person is not loving – then too you care. You care for the person and you accept all summers and winters. You accept everything that is in the person. Health is there, illness is there, old age is going to be there, youth is there, anger is there, hatred is there – everything is possible.\nWhen you choose a person, you commit yourself to the person’s totality. I’m not saying that you should celebrate her illness. I’m not saying that you should want her to remain ill, because that is a part of life. Try in every way to bring her back to health but don’t be angry with her. If you want to be angry, be angry with the illness. Don’t create any trouble for her in any way, and then she will come out of the illness sooner.\nThe illness is frustrating you, but don’t direct it towards her. Of course Geeta is ill, but she is not ill on her own accord – she has not chosen to be ill. One day you will be ill. And this is part of the game of being together – that we care about each other. In fact love is known only when the other partner is in tremendous need of you. When everything is going well, it is nothing much. When things are going wrong and you still stick to the person, still stand by the person, then only you show that you belong, that the person belongs to you; that you are really together.\nA togetherness is a sacred commitment. It is a great involvement – for better, for worse, for life, for death. If you really love a person even death can not destroy that love. Death may come and your beloved may die, but your love and your commitment remain. When love reaches to that depth and height, it has a fragrance of the divine – otherwise it is very low, animal-like.\nSo nothing is wrong. These are the situations one has to grow through. Put your anger against her illness. Because you are feeling angry, she is feeling that you don’t love her, that you hate her or something. So a misunderstanding has been created. Make it clear to her that you don’t want her to be ill and that you are angry because you don’t want her to be ill. You are angry with the illness but not with her. In fact you are angry because you love her. Do you follow me?\nPut your anger in the right direction and help her to come out of this, mm? She loves you very much. Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3311","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_nothing/>The Great Nothing</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3311 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Great_Nothing/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

any priest, than any bishop, than any pope. They are closer to God
because they are still innocent, uncorrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>To be with children is very meditative, it makes you humble – that’s
what has happened to you. It makes you humble, and if you are really
understanding, you can learn more from them than you can teach. And what
you learn from them is more valuable than you can teach to them.</p><p><br></p><p>What can a teacher teach? Algebra, geometry, arithmetic, the three
r’s – which are really not of much value. They are utilitarian but have
nothing of the eternal in them. But a child can teach you the way to go
to God, the child can put you God-ward – he can help you to become a
child again. You can be reborn – and the second childhood is the real
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are reborn, you are higher than the child, because the child
is innocent but unaware. The second childhood makes you aware and
innocent; there you go higher. And that should be the hope for every
human being – to become again like children and yet to retain awareness,
because that which is unaware has to be lost one day.</p><p><br></p><p>Every child is bound to be corrupted, every Adam and Eve is bound to
be expelled from the garden of Eden. It is natural, the fall is natural,
because the child is unconscious. He does not know what precious
innocence he has – and when you don’t know your own treasures, you are
going to be robbed. Any snake, any devil, will rob and corrupt you.
Innocence is corruptible, vulnerable, unless it is protected by
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these are the two ways: either you become cunning – then nobody
can rob you – or you become aware; then too, nobody can rob you. Out of
one hundred people, ninety-nine have chosen the path of cunningness.
They have been robbed – their childhood innocence is gone. Now they have
become afraid that this world is very cunning so one should be cunning
with it. They become cunning, but by being cunning they go on falling
more and more and more.</p><p><br></p><p>Childhood is lost but there is no need to be cunning – one has just
to be aware. That is the path of religion. To be cunning is the way of
the world, and to be aware is the path of religion.</p><p>Remain innocent and just be aware, then nobody can corrupt you. Then
innocence is incorruptible. For the first time it is really there and it
cannot be lost, it cannot be destroyed. It has become a crystallisation
in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and swabhava means nature, divine nature. Always
try one thing whenever you have time: just close your eyes and look into
your own nature, into who you are. Just make this question your mantra,
‘Who am I?’ Don’t try to answer it... don’t make any intellectual answer
– that I am this or that. Simply ask, ‘Who am I?’ and wait in silence.
Again ask, ‘Who am I?’ and wait in silence. Just the question – no need
for the answer – and by and by the question will dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer will be there, but with no verbalisation. The answer will
be there – not in your mind but in your being. You will feel pregnant
with the answer. It will be throbbing there in the deepest core of your
being. So the questioning is just to dig deep inside. It has to function
as an arrow. So whenever you have time, sitting on your bed doing
nothing, just close your eyes and ask the question, and look into your
own being. That’s what swabhava is – that’s your nature – and once you
start coming in contact with it, it will transform you. It will not only
change you – it will transform you.</p><p><br></p><p>Change is mediocre – you remain the same, a little change here and
there. Transformation is needed – nothing less is going to help. Total
transformation is needed: a one hundred and eighty degree turn. So now
this is your meditation... your name is your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Sometimes when I look at your picture, or
sometimes when I close my eyes and sit there and meditate, there is that
feeling of being pulled, and there’s a lot of fear at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>He says the pull is from his eyes and chest.]</p><p><br></p><p>Come here and just look at my hands. (Osho was leaning forward in his
chair, and had clenched up the fist of his right hand.) Feel as if you
are a fist, completely closed. Really become closed.</p><p><br></p><p>When I start opening my fist, you start opening like a flower. First
just feel that you are a fist and everything is closed.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin staring intensely at Osho’s fist, began to become more
and more tense, his body beginning to shake and beads of perspiration to
gather on his face. As Osho slowly and gracefully unfolded his fist, he
began to relax until he slumped prostrate on the floor before Osho.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good... good. This you have to do. Whenever you feel this energy,
first close yourself – that will put pressure on the energy. Close from
everywhere, close up the energy. The energy is in the navel, so let the
navel be the centre and close up so that the energy cannot escape and
there is no outlet.</p><p><br></p><p>Then remain in that closedness just for one, two, three minutes at
the most, and then start opening. There will be a burst of energy
because the pressure will be released. The energy will rush towards your
third eye, and once it reaches there, all fear will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>So the energy has to be made like a fountain. First it has to be
pressed, so that when the pressure is removed, it simply rushes forth.
You can do this twice, thrice a day, and you will start enjoying it.
When it starts reaching to the third eye, you will start having a sort
of inner orgasm. And it is so pleasant... it is such a blessing.</p><p>Everything is good. There is nothing to be worried about. [A
sannyasin says: : I feel better every day now.]</p><p>That’s very good. That’s going to happen more and more – and there is
no end to it. Very good. Just go on enjoying it. The fear is that of
happiness, so when it really comes... First you seek and you think too
much about it, you dream about it, but when it really starts coming, one
becomes apprehensive.</p><p><br></p><p>For the whole of your life you have been going only so far in
everything. If you were angry, you went so far. If you were sad, you
went so far. If you were happy, you went so far. There is a subtle line
beyond which you have never gone. Everything goes there and stops. It
has become almost automatic, so that the moment you reach that line, you
are immediately put off. Everybody has been taught that way – that you
are allowed a certain anger but not more than that, because more than
that can be dangerous. You are allowed a certain happiness, but not more
than that because happiness can be maddening. You are allowed sadness
only up to a point, but not more than that, because more than that can
be suicidal.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been trained and there is a china wall around you and
everybody else. You never go beyond it. That is your only space, your
only freedom, so when you start becoming happy, joyous, that china wall
comes in the way. So you have to be aware of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Start doing one experiment that will help tremendously. It is called
the method of exaggeration. It is one of the most ancient tibetan
methods of meditation. If you are feeling sad, close your eyes and
exaggerate sadness. Go into it as much as possible, go beyond the limit.
If you want to moan and sob and weep, do. If you feel like rolling on
the floor, do, but go beyond the ordinary limit, where you have never
gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Exaggerate it, because that limit, that constant boundary that you
have lived in, has become so much of a routine that unless you go beyond
it, you will never be aware – it is part of your habitual mind. So you
can become angry but you will not become aware of it unless you go
beyond the boundary. Then suddenly it comes into your awareness because
something is happening that has never happened before.</p><p><br></p><p>So do this with sadness, with anger, with jealousy, with whatsoever
you are feeling at the moment – with happiness particularly. When you
are feeling happy, don’t believe in limits. Just go and rush out of the
limits: dance, sing, jog – don’t be a miser. Once you have learned how
to trespass the limit, how to transcend the limit, you will be in a
totally different world. Then you will know how much you have been
missing your whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Try it. Close your eyes and be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin closed his eyes and began to laugh, after a few
moments falling backwards into the lap of a sannyasin. Slowly sitting
upright again, he began to raise his arms slowly, a beatific smile on
his face. Osho called him back... ]</p><p><br></p><p>Good... very good! Things are really going well. You were just
knocked down by the china wall.</p><p>You will come against that china wall many times but by and by you
will start knowing how to get out of it – because it is really not
there; it is just a belief.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho described the phenomenon of the magic circle of the gipsies and
primitive tribes of the Middle East, whereby once a child has been told
that he cannot leave a certain space, he finds he simply cannot do so,
so strongly is the belief imbedded.]</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff learned his first hypnotic method from the Kurds – these
people. They are really tremendously hypnotic and they have worked for
centuries in hypnosis. This is an hypnotic method. And the china wall is
the same kind of thing.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it is not there, but you have believed it for so long, so
whenever you go, you will be knocked down, back inside – you cannot go
beyond it; it has become an automatic mechanism. You simply go so far
and you are put off. Your energy simply disappears; you become
impotent.</p><p><br></p><p>This china wall has to be broken. Once this is broken you have
infinite space available. Then one has freedom. That’s what moksha is –
that you have no boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>All boundaries are of belief and mind; they don’t really exist. You
believe – that’s why they exist. If you start disbelieving them,
doubting them, if you try getting out of them, by and by they wither
away; because they are only in your mind, they are not part of
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>So first do this method and then do the camp, mm? And after the camp,
do a few groups. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who had recently left hospital after an attack of
typhoid fever, said that she was feeling paranoid and that her partner
did not love her.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho said it was natural to feel negative after illness, unless one
was aware, and that illness was a great catharsis. He then asked her
partner how he was feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>He replied that he didn’t hate her, he loved her, but that his
initial response to her paranoia was one of anger.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural. There is a little misunderstanding that you have to
understand, and which is a good thing to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love somebody, and when you are happy with somebody, of
course health is part of that happiness. You share the energy with
somebody because the person is healthy, flowing. Then suddenly the
partner is ill, health disappears; you are left alone. The very reason
to be with the person is no more there. You were with the person because
you were feeling happy and healthy, because the other person was healthy
and happy. So everything was good. Now the other person is ill. He or
she is no more flowing, and the whole point of being with them is lost –
you feel angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you understand that this is a part of love, that sometimes the
other will be ill and that it is natural.… Sometimes you will be ill.
You have to be aware and responsible and see that when the other was
healthy and happy, you enjoyed her health and happiness. Now the other
person is ill. You have to serve, you have to care so that the person
becomes healthy and loving and flowing again.</p><p>In the West this is happening too much because something very basic
is being misunderstood. People think that relationships are for when
they are happy, good. When something goes wrong – even a physical
illness – then why bother? Find another woman, another man – this seems
very inhuman. If this attitude remains, love cannot grow. Then
whatsoever you call love is nothing but sex, because love means that you
care for the person in health, in illness. You care for the person. When
the person is loving – and sometimes the person is not loving – then too
you care. You care for the person and you accept all summers and
winters. You accept everything that is in the person. Health is there,
illness is there, old age is going to be there, youth is there, anger is
there, hatred is there – everything is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>When you choose a person, you commit yourself to the person’s
totality. I’m not saying that you should celebrate her illness. I’m not
saying that you should want her to remain ill, because that is a part of
life. Try in every way to bring her back to health but don’t be angry
with her. If you want to be angry, be angry with the illness. Don’t
create any trouble for her in any way, and then she will come out of the
illness sooner.</p><p><br></p><p>The illness is frustrating you, but don’t direct it towards her. Of
course Geeta is ill, but she is not ill on her own accord – she has not
chosen to be ill. One day you will be ill. And this is part of the game
of being together – that we care about each other. In fact love is known
only when the other partner is in tremendous need of you. When
everything is going well, it is nothing much. When things are going
wrong and you still stick to the person, still stand by the person, then
only you show that you belong, that the person belongs to you; that you
are really together.</p><p><br></p><p>A togetherness is a sacred commitment. It is a great involvement –
for better, for worse, for life, for death. If you really love a person
even death can not destroy that love. Death may come and your beloved
may die, but your love and your commitment remain. When love reaches to
that depth and height, it has a fragrance of the divine – otherwise it
is very low, animal-like.</p><p><br></p><p>So nothing is wrong. These are the situations one has to grow
through. Put your anger against her illness. Because you are feeling
angry, she is feeling that you don’t love her, that you hate her or
something. So a misunderstanding has been created. Make it clear to her
that you don’t want her to be ill and that you are angry because you
don’t want her to be ill. You are angry with the illness but not with
her. In fact you are angry because you love her. Do you follow me?</p><p><br></p><p>Put your anger in the right direction and help her to come out of
this, mm? She loves you very much. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’\nMARUF ANSWERED:\n‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD. WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’\n‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID:\n‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’\nA RELIGIOUS man is always misunderstood. If he is not misunderstood, he will not be a religious man.\nHumanity lives in a non-religious attitude towards life – sectarian, but not religious. So a religious man is a stranger. And whatsoever you say about him will be wrong, because you are wrong.\nAnd remember: whatsoever you say about him – I am not saying that if you say something in his favour, that will be right, no; whether you are in favour of him, or against him, it makes no difference – whatsoever you say will be wrong about him until you yourself have become a religious consciousness.\nBefore that, your reverence is false, your condemnation is false. You may think of him as a sage, and you have misunderstood. You may think of him as a sinner, and again you have misunderstood.\nSo the first thing to remember is: unless you are right, whatsoever you do, say, be, is going to be wrong. And a religious man is such a tremendous phenomenon, such a strange phenomenon, that you have no language to talk about him. All your words are futile in concern with him. Your whole language is useless, meaningless, because a religious man is religious because he has gone beyond the dualities, and the whole of language exists within dualities.\nIf you say he is good you are wrong, because he is bad also. If you say he is bad you are wrong again, because he is good also. And now the trouble arises, because you cannot conceive how a good man can be bad also. You can comprehend only a part of the whole, because the other part is by necessity the opposite. It has to be so.\nA religious man is a miniature God. Just like God, he is paradoxical and contradictory. Just like God, he is summer and winter, day and night, life and death. Just like God, he is divine and devil both. Then the mind staggers.\nThe mind is very efficient if you are working in polarities. If you say yes, the mind can understand. If you say no, the mind can understand. But if you say yes and no both, then it goes beyond mind. Unless you have gone beyond mind, you cannot have the feeling of what a religious consciousness is.\nI was born a Jain. Now religion has nothing to do with your birth. You cannot be born in a religion. Just on the contrary: religion has to be born in you. I was born a Jain – just a coincidence. I could as well have been born a Christian or a Jew. An irrelevant fact – because by your birth religion cannot be given to you. It is not a gift. It is not a heritage. My father is a Jain, my mother is a Jain – they cannot give Jainism to me. I can inherit their wealth, I can inherit their prestige, I can inherit the family name – but I cannot inherit religion. Religion cannot be a gift, a heritage. It is not a thing. It is something one has to seek for himself. Nobody else can give it to you.\nSo whatsoever is given by the birth is a sect, not a religion. Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Jainism, Buddhism, are sects, not religions. Religion is one. Sects are many, because sects are the forms, dead fossilized forms. Sects are like footprints: somebody one day walked there, but he is no more there – just footprints left on the sand, on the sand of time. A Buddha walks, footprints are left, and you go on worshipping those footprints for centuries. There is nobody there now. Just a form in the sand. Nothing else.\nSects are forms in the mind, just like footprints. Yes, somebody was there one day, but he is no more there. And you go on worshipping those forms. You are born into those forms. You are conditioned into those forms, indoctrinated. You become a sectarian.\nAnd don’t think that you have become religious, otherwise you will miss. For religion to be there, you have to seek it on your own. It is a personal growth, a personal encounter with reality – face to face, immediate and direct. It has nothing to do with tradition, nothing to do with the past. You have to grow into it. You have to allow it to grow into you.\nReligion is a revolution, not a conformity. It is not a conviction intellectually attained. It is a conversion of your total being. How can you be born in a religion? Of course, you can be born in an ideology. You can learn a theology, words about God, theories about God, dogmas and doctrines, but to know about God is not to know God. The word ‘God’ is not God. And all the theologies together are nothing compared to a single moment of encounter with the Divine – because then for the first time, the spark, your inner light starts. You start rising in a different dimension.\nReligion is a personal search. It is not part of society.\nI was born a Jain. Of course, they tried to force me to be a Jain. Fortunately, they failed. It is one of the misfortunes that they succeed in many cases. They failed and they have been angry against me. So if you ask the Jains, only rarely will you find a Jain here and there who will say that I am a Jain; otherwise they will say that I am the enemy of Jainism, and I am destroying their ideology, and I am corrupting their sources. And both are right in a way.\nThose who say that I am against Jainism, they are right in a way – because I am against Jainism as they understand it. I am against, because that is not religion at all. A dead fossil – of course, one of the most ancient. Jainism seems to be the most ancient religion in the world, even older than Hinduism. Because even in the Vedas, in the Rig-Veda, Jain Teerthankaras are mentioned, and mentioned with deep reverence. That shows Jain Teerthankaras are older than the Rig Veda, the first Hindu scripture, the oldest in the world. And when a scripture talks about a master like the first Teerthankara of the Jains, Rishabh, the Vedas talk with so much reverence that it is almost certain that he was not a contemporary. He must have been dead for at least one thousand years; only then can you talk with such reverence. About contemporaries nobody talks with such reverence. Followers can talk, but Hindus are not followers of Jains – antagonistic religions. At least one thousand years must have passed, and the man must have become a legend.\nJains are very old. Now historians are working on the ruins and findings in Harappa and Mohenjodaro. And they say that there is every possibility that Harappa and Mohenjodaro were Jain civilizations. Before Aryans came to India, India was a Jain country – there is every possibility. A very ancient religion, and of course, very much dead. The older a religion, the more dead. Everything fossilized. You cannot find a more dead person than a Jain monk. He goes on cutting his life; it is a slow suicide. And the more dead he is, the more he is worshipped – because death itself seems to be like a renunciation. If he is a little alive, then Jains become afraid of him. Older religions crucify their followers, they murder them.\nThe older the religion, the greater the weight. Like a Himalaya on the heart of a small man – burdened, crushing, you cannot move. And traditions go on gathering. They are like snowballs: they go on gathering weight, they become fatter and fatter. Dead, but still they go on gaining weight. They become monstrous, and then they kill the spirit. They always remain true to the word – and the more true to the word, the more poisonous to the spirit.\nIf you ask the Jains only a few will say, ‘Yes, this man is a real Jain.’ Many will say, ‘This man is against us, the greatest enemy.’ And both are right in a way – and both are wrong in a deeper way. I am a Jain. If you look at Mahavir, I am a Jain. Mahavir is a religious man, not because he is born in a religion. He searched. He enquired. He encountered reality. He threw all dogmas. He threw all civilization. Even clothes he threw away, because they, too, are a part of the civilization and the culture; and they, too, carry the society with you. He remained naked. For twelve years he completely stopped talking, because if you go on talking, you use the language of the society, and that language carries the germs of the society.\nWhenever you talk, immediately you become a part of a society. A silent man is not part of any society. He may be part of nature, but he’s not part of society. In fact, language is the only thing that makes you human and part of human society and the human world. When you drop language, suddenly you drop out of human society and civilization. You become part of the trees, rocks, the sky.\nFor twelve years Mahavir would not use any language, remained completely silent. This man I love, because this is a religious man. And he started speaking only when silence was total within him. And he spoke not out of scriptures, he spoke out of himself. He spoke out of his silence. And whenever a word is born out of deep silence, it is alive, throbbing with life. And those who hear it directly, they are most fortunate – because soon it will die. Everything born dies.\nA word is born. It is alive for a few moments. It throbs around you. If you can listen to it, it will enter into your being, it will become part of your being. If you don’t listen to it, if you take notes, and you think that you will try to understand it back home, it will be already dead. Then you will understand something which was not said at all. You have already made a private scripture.\nMahavir spoke out of his inner silence. His words are the most wonderful ever spoken. I love that man. He is the most anti-social man you can find, and anti-traditional. The other twenty-three Teerthankaras, twenty-three masters of the Jains, they were all clothed. This man became nude. Tradition has it that Jains in those days tried to deny this man. They said, ‘What is he doing? Our other Teerthankaras have never been nude, and why is he moving nude?’ They did everything to deny this man, and because of that denial Jainism has been divided into two parts from that very day. They have two sects: those who followed Mahavir in his nudity, very few people, they are called Digambaras – people who believe in nudity. The other older sect, who tried to avoid this Mahavir, who tried to deny this Mahavir, they are the Swetambaras. They believe in white clothes; their monks are white-robed. And the conflict has continued.\nIf some Jain says, ‘Yes, this man Rajneesh is a Jain,’ he is right. I love Mahavir – a rare flowering, a rare fragrance, very rare and unique. But the others are also right when they say, ‘This man is not a Jain but against them, the enemy.’ They are also right – because I am against tradition, against all rituals and forms, against scriptures, against the past. I am all for religion, and all against sects. They are also right.\nIf you ask Hindus, Hindus will say, ‘This man is Jain, and trying to sabotage Hinduism from within; because no Jain has ever talked about the Gita, and no Jain has ever commented on the Upanishads. This man is trying to sabotage Hinduism from within.’ This is what the Shankaracharya of Puri says about me: ‘Beware of this man! He is not a Hindu.’ And he is right in a sense. In the sense that he is Hindu, I am not. But in the sense he is Hindu, Hinduism is worthless.\nI am Hindu in the sense Patanjali is Hindu, Badrayan is Hindu, Kapil and Kanad are Hindu. The really religious people, they never belong to the establishment. They cannot. It is possible that the establishment may follow them; and some day around them an establishment. may be created. That is possible. But they are never part of any establishment – either of others or their own. They cannot exist in the establishment. They are free! Freedom can never be a part of any establishment. And whenever the establishment becomes too much, the freedom dies. Then the bird cannot be on the wing; the wings are cut. The bird has been encaged then, in a golden cage – beautifully decorated, very costly, precious, but now the cage is more important, not the bird. And, by and by, people will forget the bird completely, because the bird will die and they will go on worshipping the cage, and they will go on making it more and more decorative, and temples will arise around it, and a great tradition, establishment, and nobody will bother: ‘Where is the bird?’ A dead corpse in a golden cage.\nI am Hindu, if you believe in Hinduism as a bird on the wing, as the Upanishads are Hindu; but I am not a Hindu in the sense the Shankaracharya of Puri is Hindu – a dead bird in a golden cage.\nIf you ask Mohammedans, they will say I have no right to talk on Sufis or on the Koran. Once in a town I was talking about Sufis, and the maulvi of the town approached me and he said, ‘You have no right. You are not a Mohammedan, you don’t know Arabic. How can you talk on the Sufis and on the Koran?’\nI said, ‘The Koran has nothing to do with Arabic. It has something to do with the heart, not with the language.’\nThe Koran has nothing to do with the language. It has something to do with silence, not language. The Koran has something to do with the reality, not with the symbols. And I am not a Mohammedan if you think that I am a follower of Mohammed – no, I am not. I am nobody’s follower. But I am a Mohammedan, just like Mohammed is a Mohammedan; just as Jesus is a Christian, I am a Christian – but like Mohammed and Jesus. Was Mohammed a Mohammedan? How can he bet Because Mohammedanism never existed before. Was Jesus a Christian? Christianity never existed before. How can he be a Christian? If Jesus is a Christian, I am a Christian. If Mohammed is a Mohammedan, then I am a Mohammedan. But otherwise, I am not a Mohammedan and not a Christian.\nA religious man does not belong to any sect. In fact, all sects belong to the religious man. But this is how the formal mind goes. He thinks in terms of ideology, language, ritual, and he misses the whole point: that religion has nothing to do with these things.\nThen what is religion?\nReligion is an oceanic feeling where you are lost and only the existence remains. It is a death and a resurrection. You die as you are, and you are resurrected totally new. Something absolutely new arises out of the death of the old. On the grave of the old something sprouts and becomes a new flower.\nReligion is an inner revolution, an inner mutation. It is not in the temples, not in the mosques, not in the churches. Don’t look for religion there! If you look there you will waste your time. Look for\nreligion inwards. And the further inwards you move, the deeper you will find the ego there – which is the barrier. Drop that barrier and suddenly you are religious. There is only one thing which is not religious and that is the ego. And that can never be religious. And sects never kill it; on the contrary, they strengthen it.\nThrough rituals, temples, ideologies, the ego is strengthened. You go to the church and you feel that you have become religious. A subtle pride arises in you. You don’t become humble; on the contrary, you become more egoistic. You do a certain ritual and you feel gratified – and you start condemning those who are not doing the ritual. You think those are the sinners and they are going to be thrown into the fire of hell; and your heaven is secured just by doing certain rituals? Whom do you think that you are deceiving?\nA man sits for one hour turning the beads, and he is thinking his heaven is secured, and others who are not doing this stupid thing, they are going to hell. And you go to the mosque, and you kneel down, and you say foolish things to the Divine: ‘You are great’ – is there any doubt about it? Why are you saying it?. – ‘I’m a sinner, and you are compassion.’ What are you doing? buttressing? Do you think God has an ego-like thing?. – so that you can say who you are, ‘You are very great and we are very small. And you are compassion and we are sinners. Forgive us!’ Whom do you think you are deceiving?\nThe ego is playing the game. You think God is also an ego which can be buttressed? God is not a person at all, so you are talking to yourself. There is nobody else to listen to it; only the walls, the dead walls of the mosque or the temple, or a stone statue. Nobody is listening.\nIn fact, you are doing something mad. Just go into the madhouses and see people talking to somebody who is not there. Even those mad people are not so mad, because that somebody may be somewhere. They may not be here; a madman may be talking to his wife who is not here in the madhouse, but somewhere maybe – but your God is nowhere. Your madness is deeper, greater – dangerous.\nHow can you talk with existence? With existence you have to be silent. All talking should stop. You are not to say something. On the contrary, a prayer is a listening. You have to listen to existence, not to say something. If you speak, who will listen? If you talk and you are too much involved in the words, then who will listen? And every moment there is a message.\nEvery moment, from everywhere, there is a message for you. It is written all over. The whole existence is the scripture of the Divine. The message is everywhere. On every leaf is the signature. But who will see? Your eyes and your mind are filled with yourself. Rubbish you have, but you go on rotating that rubbish in the mind. Drop it all!\nThis is something to understand, because a prayer can be Christian, a prayer can be Hindu, a prayer can be Jewish – then they are sectarian prayers and not prayers at all. A real prayer cannot be Christian, Hindu, or Buddha. A real prayer is just a silence, a waiting. How can you say silence is Hindu? How can you say silence is Christian? Can silence be Christian or Hindu? Silence is simply silence! – neither Hindu nor Mohammedan. When two persons are absolutely silent, can you say who is Hindu and who is Mohammedan? In silence sects disappear. In silence societies disappear. In silence civilizations disappear. In silence, you disappear. Only silence is – you are not\nthere. If you are there, then silence cannot be because you will do something or other, you will think something or other, you will go on chattering inside.\nWhen you are not, society is not, sects are not; no words, no prayer; you are not reciting the Koran, not reciting the Veda; not doing a TM meditation, ‘Ram, Ram, Ram’ – all foolish. When you are simply silent, a meeting happens, a merger happens – you dissolve! Just as ice melts, and the boundaries dissolve, and then you cannot find where the ice has gone... it has become one with the sea.\nThe sun rises, ice melts, becomes water. Silence arises, the mind, the ice-like, frozen mind, starts melting, the ego dissolves. Suddenly there is ocean and you are not.\nThis is the moment of religion. Religion is born in you.\nNobody is born in religion. Religion ‘borns’ in you. You have to become a mother, a womb, for religion to become impregnated in you, to grow in you. You have to give the birth. You cannot be born in religion. You have to give birth to religion. And then it is beautiful. Then it is something from the unknown. Then it is not concerned with man.\nThat is the meaning of Jesus’ virgin birth. The whole meaning is simply this: that a man like Jesus is not born out of man. Religious consciousness is not born out of man. It is born out of the unknown. Mary, Jesus’ mother, is virgin; no man has corrupted her. This is a symbolic thing. It is not that Jesus is born out of a virgin biologically. Then you miss the metaphor; the beautiful story becomes an ugly doctrine. Then you miss the poetry. And then for centuries Christians have been arguing, and trying to prove somehow that Jesus is born, really, from a virgin mother. How can theologicians be so stupid? It is a wonder! And they go on trying and proving, and very intellectual people, argumentative – but blind.\nAnd whenever you miss the poetry and try to create an argument out of it, you destroy religion. You are not a help. You put people off religion. Then the whole of Christianity becomes absurd – because of some absurdity in the foundation. And these are poetic truths. And poetic truths are not logical truths. Logical truths are nothing, they are ordinary facts. Poetic truths are extraordinary facts, so extraordinary in their quality that you cannot make an argument out of them. Argument is too narrow. They need much space. Only a poetic symbology can give that space.\nThis is beautiful poetry. I also say Jesus is born out of a virgin mother – because there is no other way. Because religious consciousness is uncorrupted by man, untouched.\nReligious consciousness means you have dropped all that is man-made: doctrines, dogmas, churches, words, language, prayers, forms, rituals – all that is man-made you have dropped. Then in that silence, God Himself becomes part of you. You become pregnant with the God. You carry the pregnancy. It grows every day. And the more it grows, the more alive it becomes, the more you start feeling that now you have something more valuable than your life.\nA mother is always ready to die for the child. If there is a crisis and only one can be saved, either the child or the mother, the mother is always ready – the child should survive. She is ready to die.\nThere is another parable I would like to tell you. It is said that whenever a Buddha is born, the mother dies immediately. That, too, has created problems for Buddhists, because they say if Mary is alive and has not died and Jesus is born, Jesus cannot be a Buddha – because whenever an enlightened man is born, the mother dies! Buddha’s mother died. Then Mahavir cannot be a Buddha and Krishna cannot be a Buddha, because the first thing is missing. This is how beautiful symbols become ugly. It is beautiful! I don’t know whether Buddha’s mother died or not. That is irrelevant. Whether she lived or died, that is not the point. But the point is: whenever religious consciousness is born in you, when you are pregnant with Buddhahood, when you are pregnant with enlightenment, and you carry enlightenment as a child within you, you will die, because both cannot live.\nAnd this is the whole message of this series of talks: Until you die, nothing is possible. The mother must die for the child to be born, because both cannot exist – because you are the mother and you are the child. You are not two. When you become enlightened, the old must die immediately. If you cling to the old, then you will cripple your enlightenment. If you cling to the old, you will suffocate the child. If you cling too much, the child will be dead before the child is born.\nAlways remember: Religion is poetry, not logic. It is not even philosophy – it is art. And art is not an argument. Art doesn’t bother about argument. Art can seduce you without argument, then why bother about argument? Art is so powerful, it can seduce you without any argument. Argument is needed on the lower realms where the thing itself is not so powerful to convince you – then argument is needed. When the thing in itself is so powerful, so hypnotic, so transforming, that you are suddenly absorbed into it, there is no need to convince you.\nI never try to convince you. If you are convinced, good. If you are not convinced, good. But I am not trying to convince you of anything, because conviction is a very ordinary thing. If through argument you are convinced, you will never become religious. You may become philosophical, you may carry a dogma in your head, but you will never become religious.\nReligion is like love. You fall in it – for no reason at all. You cannot prove; proof is not needed. Proof is needed only when you are thinking of a marriage. Argument is needed only when you are thinking of an arranged marriage – then you think about the family, and the parents of the girl, and the money, and the dowry, and the future possibilities, political relationships, and everything you think about. But when you fall in love, you fall in love – it happens so suddenly, there is no time gap.\nAnd it is the same with religion. You fall in love with a man who is religious. You cannot prove it. And if somebody argues with you against it, it is very easy to prove something against it; it is almost impossible to prove anything for it. That’s why it is a trust, a faith, a deep blindness. But in that deep blindness, for the first time your inner eye starts functioning. The deep blindness from the outside becomes a deep insight from within.\nNow try to understand this story.\nA DISCIPLE CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID:\n‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’\nMARUF ANSWERED:\n‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD. WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’\n‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID:\n‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’\nNow: A DISCIPLE CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID... Maruf Karkhi is one of the Sufi masters, and it is said that hundreds of people became enlightened through him. He developed many new devices; and he was really a religious man, not belonging to any orthodoxy, not belonging to any convention, not belonging to any tradition; homeless, without any roots; floating like a white cloud – absolute freedom in his being.\nA DISCIPLE CAME... The disciple cannot be really a disciple; he must have been a student. In English translations there is trouble, because in English you don’t make much distinction between a disciple and a student; you don’t make much distinction between a master and a teacher. But in the East, a vast distinction, difference, exists between these two terminologies.\nA teacher can have students, cannot have disciples. A teacher teaches. Of course, a teacher can teach only that which can be taught. Religion cannot be taught. Things about religion can be taught. Mm? – that is what theology is: things about God. But God Himself cannot be taught. Concepts about God, theories – whether this is right or that. And there are millions of theories.\nMan has been inventing so many theories about God that God is completely lost in theories. He has almost become nonsubstantial. When you utter the word ‘God’ no substance is felt in it. It looks like an air bubble, carrying nothing but hot air within. When you say ‘God’, no bells ring in the heart. When you say ‘God’, it falls flat. It does not carry much significance. The so-called religious thinkers have killed the word completely. They have destroyed the beauty of it. The moment you utter the word ‘God’, you put many off. The word carries much violence, ugliness, strife, narrowness – of so-called religious people. It has no poetry now.\nA teacher can teach you everything about God. You can become a doctor living with a teacher, a doctor of divinity – a D.D. It is simply unbelievable that things like this exist on earth – people who carry a degree of doctorate about Divinity. God is not a theory. It is an experience. You cannot be taught about It.\nSays Lao Tzu, The Old Boy... the word ‘Lao Tzu’ means The Old Boy. Another parable: It is said Lao Tzu was born old – when he was eighty-four years of age. For eighty-four years he lived in the womb of the mother. When he was born, he was already absolutely ancient – all his hair white, wrinkled. What is the meaning? The meaning is that whenever religious consciousness is born, it is always ancient: new and ancient, both. Hence, Lao Tzu’s name: The Old Boy. Lao Tzu means The Old Boy – old, yet young.\nSays Lao Tzu: ‘Truth cannot be said. And all that can be said will not be true.’\nA teacher is one who teaches truth which cannot be taught. He teaches about truth. He goes round and round. He beats around the bush. He never hits the center. And a student is one who is enquiring about God, not desiring God; who has come to know, not to be; whose search is intellectual, not total. A student is trying to gather more knowledge; he wants to become more knowledgeable. He wants to accumulate much information.\nIt is said about one of the students of Maruf... he became very famous, the student; he became so famous that people started coming to him and asking him things, even when Maruf was alive. Even sometimes it would happen that Maruf was sitting there with the student, and people would come not to Maruf but to the student and ask him things. He became so efficient in the scripture, he crammed all the scriptures, and he was perfect like a computer.\nOne day somebody came and he asked a question about some passage in the scripture, and the student recited the whole scripture, then recited all the commentaries that had been made about the scripture – within minutes, all that was there in the scriptures, he brought it down. And he argued this way and that and tried to prove a conclusion. Maruf was sitting and listening. The man was astounded – so much knowledge. He said to Maruf, ‘You are fortunate to have such disciples. This boy is a rare gem! So much knowledge: I have never come across such a brilliant mind, such a genius. What do you say about him?’\nMaruf said, ‘I am always worried. I am worried because he reads too much. And I am worried that he has no time to know; his whole time is going in reading. And I am always worried as to when he will know – he has no time.’\nA student is concerned not about knowing, he is concerned about knowledge. A teacher attracts students. A master attracts disciples. A disciple is not a student. He has not come to know about God. He has come to become God, to be God. He has not come for more information, he has come for MORE BEING. Let me repeat: a disciple asks how to gain more being, and a student asks how to gain more knowledge. He has come to the master to BE. And that is a totally different enquiry. The dimension is altogether different. Not only different, it is diametrically opposite. A student goes to the west, and a disciple goes to the east. It is said that east and west never meet – I don’t know. They must meet somewhere because the earth is round. But one thing I know: a student and a disciple never meet. They cannot. Unless a student drops being a student, he cannot become a disciple.\nIt is said about Maruf that whenever a person would come... and thousands were coming to him from distant corners of the world. Maruf became an institution, a university – of being, of course, not of knowledge. Whenever a student, or a disciple or a seeker would come to him, the first question Maruf used to ask was this: ‘Do you want to learn, or unlearn? Do you want to be a student or a disciple?’ This was always his first question, because that would decide everything.\nThis man who reached Maruf must have been a student. He could not have been a disciple because a disciple is one who has already attained to a trust. A student is seeking. A disciple has come to a conclusion in his being that ‘This is my Master.’ Hence, he is the disciple. ‘This is my Master! I have come to the man I was seeking. This is my shelter, my refuge.’ Suddenly the disciple is born! A\ndisciple is born out of this trust. He does not enquire about such things this man is enquiring about. He has fallen in love. He has attained to faith. He has surrendered. A student is not surrendered. He will learn, watch, observe, see, and if he’s convinced... and remember, if he is convinced; that is, the conclusion will come out of his head.\nJust the other day I was reading a very, very ridiculous thing said by an Indian guru who has become famous in the West, Sri Chinmoy. He teaches in the UN in Geneva. I was always wondering what he is doing there, and just the other day I came to read a statement he has made. Somebody asked him, ‘How to judge and how to find the Master?’\nHe said, ‘Use your brain.’\nNow I know why he is in the UN – because politicians, stupid people, are there. ‘Use your brain!’ And, the thing becomes more and more ridiculous because then he says, ‘Keep one hundred marks in your mind to be given, Then watch whether the Master is honest, sincere, true to his word, his morality, his behaviour – everything you watch, and go on giving the marks inside the mind. If the Master gets thirty marks, he is not for you; you leave. If the Master gets near about eighty to ninety marks, then he is your Master.’\nThis is ridiculous. You will find a teacher, you cannot find a Master – if you use your brain. Then finally you remain the decisive factor; you decide. Do you know what honesty is? First give marks to yourself! Use your brain! Do you know what honesty is? Do you know what morality is? Are you certain of what is good? and what is bad? Do you know what is evil and what is not evil? First give marks to yourself – use your brain. If you get thirty marks, drop yourself completely. You are useless! And if you can get eighty or ninety percent, then you don’t need a master. You are already a master – you go and seek disciples.\nTo use the brain is simply unbelievable! A Master is not a commodity in the market. A Master, by his very being, is an unbelievable thing. You cannot use the brain. A Master, by his very being, is mysterious. Opposites meet in him. Dichotomies merge in him. Dualisms – he comprehends all of them.\nYou can find a teacher if you use the brain; then you will be a student. If you use your heart, you can find a Master – and then only can you become a disciple. A disciple is in love! And love is always total, not eighty percent, ninety percent. Love is total. Either it is or it is not. Always total. If it is not, then, too, total. And there is no compromise in it. Percentage is not possible; percentage is the way of the brain. Totality is the way of the heart.\nThis man must have been a student. So, let me say:\nA student CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID: ‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU.’\nMust have been using the brain. Must have been a student of Sri Chinmoy. ‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU.’ You have to encounter a master directly – face to face, eyes to eyes, heart to heart. What nonsense to talk about the master to other people to know who this man is!\nMany of you do the same here also. They move around. They talk to people about me. Why not come directly to me? Why waste your time with people? And this is the foolishness of the human mind, that you never know the person you are talking to about me – you trust that person, and you cannot trust me. If you are really a brain-oriented person, then talk about that man to other people, and about those other people to other people. Because first you have to decide about that man, whether he is sincere, believable: ‘Whatsoever he says about the master, can we take it to be true?’\nYou ask A about me – why not ask about A to B first? And then about B to C? Then you will be in an infinite regress. And if A says something wrong about me, you take it. Now it will always be a part of you. Or if A says something good about me, you take it and that will be a part of you. And that will decide the whole thing. And you never ask about this A, who this A is!\nWhy go in rounds and circles?. – there is no end to it. There is only one way to come to the master: face to face, eyes to eyes, heart to heart! And don’t ask anybody else because then you will carry a prejudice either for or against. And that prejudice will always be in between the master and you, that will become the barrier. You will always be seeking whether that prejudice is right or wrong. It will colour your mind. And any foolish man can prejudice your mind. You are so unaware that any man – the taxi driver who brings you to the ashram – he can corrupt your mind. You can ask about me... and many of you must have asked taxi drivers – because the mind goes on seeking information, what others are saying: ‘and they must be knowing.’ You must ask the neighbours here: ‘they must be knowing.’ And they are the last people in the world to know about me. Neighbours – they cannot know.\nJesus has two sayings. One saying is: Love your enemies just as you love yourself. And second: Love your neighbours just as you love yourself. It seems enemies and the neighbours are the same people.\nThis man must have been an ordinary enquirer. He said:\n‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’\nHe must have met the disciples, the people who had fallen in love with the Master. Maruf lived near Baghdad. Baghdad became a capital of religious consciousness when Maruf was alive. This man must have met the disciples, those who had already fallen in love.\nIf the disciple is a Jew, he will say, ‘My Master is the most perfect Jew possible.’ I have many Jews here and they know that I am the most perfect Jew. Once you are in love, whatsoever is beautiful, great to you, you project on the Master. I have amongst my disciples almost all sorts of people, belonging to all sorts of religions – Jews, Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, Jains, Buddhists. If a Buddhist comes to me and falls in love with me, he will think that I am the most essential Buddhist. And he will find everything to convince him that this is true.\nMARUF ANSWERED: ‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD.’\nThat means: ‘My disciples, my people, my community people. You should have been in Jerusalem. This is what humanity says in Baghdad – that is, my community people, my people.’\n‘WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’\nEnemies. And for a religious man to find enemies, the best places are Jerusalem, Quaba, Kashi. These are the best places to find enemies, because these are the sectarian strongholds – Kashi for Hindus, Jerusalem for Jews, Quaba for Muslims. These are the sectarian strongholds, fortresses, where the fossilized religion is protected and saved; where the dead body is continuously decorated, painted, for believers – to deceive them that the body is not dead; where religion is continuously modified to suit new situations so that there is no need to drop it; where dead continuity is continued. There is the problem.\nIf you want to find people antagonistic to a religious man, go to these sacred places, holy places. In fact, they are the unholiest in the world; they have to be – because the dead corpse of religion stinks. Can you find a more dirty place in the world than Kashi? Everything stinks of dead religion. But if you are a believer, then you don’t listen to your senses, you don’t listen to your own consciousness. You go on seeing things which are not there. You go on projecting things which are not there.\nSaid Maruf, ‘This is what humanity says in Baghdad. When I was in Jerusalem just the opposite was the case. Everybody was saying that I don’t belong to them, I am the enemy. Jews thought I was a Muslim, the enemy. Muslims thought I was a Jew, the enemy. Christians thought I was a Muslim, the enemy. And in all these three religions, nobody, nobody was ready even to accept me in their fold.’\nReligious persons cannot be accepted in any fold. They can be accepted only in the loving heart, but in no organization. They cannot be accepted because organizations have no hearts. A religious man cannot be absorbed in any establishment; only a personal feeling, a loving heart, can become a shrine for him.\nThe man must have been puzzled now, because he had come to enquire who he was. Perhaps the man was a Muslim and he wanted to be convinced that this Maruf was a Muslim so that he could follow him. The man may have been a Jew and wanted to be convinced that this Maruf was a Jew so that he could follow him.\nYou follow yourself. You never follow any Master.\nIf you are here because I say things which you already know are right, then you are not with me. Then I am only voicing your own mind. If you are here because you see in me a Jain, because you are a Jain... and when I talk about Mahavir I can immediately count how many Jains are there. Their eyes simply change. Their backbones become straight. They look very intense. Now for the first time they are alert, otherwise they were falling asleep. If I talk about Jews, I can count immediately how many Jews are there. And if I cannot decide who you are, then only are you with me.Because if you are a Jew, and you listen to me, and you feel that whatsoever I am saying is what Jewish religion is, then you remain a Jew. I am just a support for your convictions, just an outside support. I have not entered you. You have not allowed me to enter in you.\nMany people come to me and they say, ‘Whatsoever you said was beautiful, because this is what I have believed my whole life. And you said it better than I can say.’ So that’s all. He’s finished with\nme, and I am finished with him. There has been no meeting. He has heard his own voice in my voice. He has interpreted his own mind. And he remains a believer in his own ego. He has not dropped even a bit of his old luggage. Rather, on the contrary, now he is more convinced of the old luggage and he will carry it with more strength and with more conviction.\nNo! Remember this: I am not here to make you a Jew, or a Hindu, or a Christian – no. I am here only to make you a religious man.\nThe man must have been puzzled.\n‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. ‘You have puzzled me. You confuse me.’\nALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE, IN A WAY, CONFUSING. They create a chaos in you – because first you have to be uprooted. First you have to be demolished. No religious person is interested in renovating you, because howsoever renovated, you will remain the old, the dead thing; modified, of course, but not fresh and young. A religious person is interested in demolishing you completely, in pulling you down to the very roots, and then, in helping you to arise again.\nUntil you die, nothing is possible. A Master is a death on the one hand, resurrection on the other. A Master is a crucifixion, a cross. As you are, you die. And as you should be is born.\nThe man was puzzled.\n‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME...’\nListen to these words. Very significant.\n‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME.’\nThey do not understand, hence they revere. People are really foolish. If they don’t understand a thing they start revering it, because they think there must be something very mysterious: ‘When I cannot understand – I, such an intelligent and genius man – when I cannot understand, there must be something very, very deep and mysterious.’ And many people exploit such attitudes. Many people.\nIf you read Hegel’s books, you will find that is what he is doing. He goes on trying to make everything as difficult as possible. It is not difficult! It is a good exercise to study Hegel, a German philosopher, in his own day thought to be the greatest. But as time passes, he comes again and again lower and lower and lower – because as you understand him his mystery is lost. And nothing is there. Just verbiage. If he can say a thing in a single word, he will use a hundred pages. If he can say a thing in one sentence, he will go on and on, round and round, into pages. You will not be able... He writes long sentences, sometimes one sentence in one page – you will not be capable of remembering the beginning of the sentence when you reach to the end. You will have to read it again and again. And he mystifies.\nThere are many people, mystifiers, exploiting the human stupidity of believing that whatsoever you cannot understand must be something superb, of the sublime, of the unknown, of the mysterious. These people are exploiters.\nJust the reverse is the case with people who are really wise. They speak in short sentences. Their sentences are not complicated. They are simple. Whatsoever they say can be understood by anybody who is normally intelligent. They don’t mystify. Whatsoever they teach is very, very simple – simple as life is simple; simple as existence is simple, rivers and mountains are simple, birds and trees are simple.\nWise men are simple. But the more you understand them – and to understand them is simple – but the more you understand them, the deeper you penetrate in their simplicity, the more you find new dimensions of mysteries opening. Their words are simple, but what they want to indicate is mysterious.Their indication is simple, but the indicated is mysterious.\nLook at my finger – a simple thing! – and I indicate with my finger towards the moon. The moon is mysterious, not the finger. The finger is a very simple phenomenon; nothing to say about it. Words are like fingers. And they point, they finger, indicate, towards the mysterious.\n‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME.’\nAnd you have revered many people, and you have revered many doctrines, just because you cannot understand them.\nThere are many followers of Gurdjieff; because they cannot understand him, they follow him. Gurdjieff is not like Hegel, he is not mystifying, but he has something else to do. He does not want unwanted people to come near him, so he writes in such a way that unless you are very patient you will not be able to penetrate into him. He is not difficult. He is simple. But the methodology is such that he puts you off. You cannot read more than a few pages. I have not come across a single person yet who has read his ALL AND EVERYTHING completely. People have gone through it, but.And he knew it, that this is going to be so. He writes in a tedious style. He bores you. And\nthis is a very considered method. He puts you off.\nWhen for the first time the book ALL AND EVERYTHING was published, the pages were not cut. Only the introductory pages, a hundred pages were cut, and the other pages were not cut. And there was a note on the book saying that if you can read the hundred pages, then open the others; otherwise return the book back to the shop and take your money back. First try with the hundred pages, and if you are still interested, then open the other pages, cut them. Otherwise, don’t destroy the book. And many books were returned back. Many were not returned; that doesn’t mean that people read them. They were just curious. They thought, ‘Maybe it is a trick and only in the introductory pages he is boring. Inside he may not be.’ But if you cut, then you cannot return the book.\nBut I have not come across a single person who has read the whole book thoroughly. People skip. Then they miss – because here and there he hides the diamonds, and everything else is just a camouflage. Here and there, in the bushes of words, he hides the diamonds. Those diamonds can be sorted out and can be written on a postcard. And that book is one thousand pages!\nMany people follow Gurdjieff because they cannot under stand. Suddenly, when you cannot understand, you feel there is some mystery. It is not so. Truth is very simple. Everybody has the capacity to understand it. Truth is as simple as anything can be. You have to be just silent, understanding, ready, and it is revealed to you.\nMARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, hence their reverence. And OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME.’\nThen there are the people who if they cannot understand – they cannot believe that there can exist anything which they cannot understand – then they revile. It is against their egos. But remember: both are the egoistic viewpoints.\nOne ego thinks, ‘I am so understanding. If I cannot understand, then there must be something mysterious.’ Another ego says, ‘If I cannot understand, then there cannot be anything at all. This man is simply deceptive. There is nothing. If there were anything, then how come I cannot understand it? A genius like me will understand everything.’ Both are egoistic standpoints. And one has to drop out of them both – only then can you understand a Master.\nOne has to drop out of both. Don’t revere a thing because you don’t understand. Don’t revile it because you don’t understand. In fact, don’t refer the thing to your ego, don’t bring it in the context of your ego. That is useless! Just listen to the thing. If you cannot understand, try to understand – meditate more, contemplate more, become more silent. Come to it again and again from different standpoints. And finally come to it with no standpoint at all. You will understand. And the mystery will be revealed. If you cannot understand, don’t start reviling it – because you are not the last word in understanding. You are not the last capacity of understanding. You are not the omega of understanding. You are just a beginner on the first rung of the ladder. And the ladder is vast and big.\nMillions of things are waiting for you to be. You are just at the door. You have not even entered the shrine. Maybe just on the steps, or maybe just on the path. Not even come up to the steps. Not even at the door.\nDon’t bring your ego in either way. You are not the deciding factor as to whether it is mysterious or nothing. You listen. The more you listen to a man who has attained, the more and more you will understand. And the more you understand, the more it will become mysterious. The mystery of life is not something which can be solved or which is ever solved. It has to be lived! It is not a problem to be solved. It has to be lived.\nThe more you know, the less you feel you know. The more you know, the more you feel the unknown surrounds you from everywhere. And in the final moment of knowing, all knowledge drops. You know nothing. That final moment of knowing is like vast ignorance, a vast dark night. But only out of that dark night is the morning born. Out of this vast ignorance a light arises – which is knowing, which is understanding; which Buddha calls praggya, sambodhi; what Patanjali calls Samadhi, the enlightenment.\nMARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’\nThe man was asking to label Maruf somehow – whether he is a Jew, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian. Once labelled, you think you have understood. Labelling is a trick. You label a certain thing and you feel you have understood.\nI show you a flower, an outlandish flower you have never seen before, and immediately you ask, ‘What is the name?’ Why are you so anxious to know the name? How is the name going to help you? X, Y, Z, whatsoever the name may be, how is it going to help you? If I say X, you think now you know it. You have labelled it. Now you can show to your child that this is X flower. You have become a knower. What have you known about the flower? Just the word X? I could have called it Y, or Z. They would have been as relevant as X. How do you know it?\nI was reading Gertrude Stein’s book. When she said in a poem, ‘A rose is a rose is a rose,’ it became world famous. She goes on that way with many things. She does not define. She does not say anything – ‘A rose is a rose is a rose.’ Nothing is defined; nothing is said really.\nSomebody asked, ‘Why have you said this? We all know a rose is a rose is a rose. It makes no sense. It adds nothing to our knowledge.’\nStein said, ‘Because poets have been talking about roses for millennia – millions of poetries about roses, everybody has read them and sung them, and everybody has repeated – the word “rose” has lost its rosiness. It doesn’t say anything any more. That’s why I had to repeat, “A rose is a rose is a rose” – so that you are awakened out of your sleep, so that you are shaken a little: “What is this woman saying? the absurdity of it! – a rose is a rose is a rose.” You may listen. Otherwise, rose – who listens? Everybody knows.’ And she said, ‘Repeating this I have brought the redness to the rose again.’\nWords can’t say much. And if you think that just knowing the names and labels, you have known, you will miss everything.\nTry to avoid words. Don’t try to label. You immediately label! Labelling is such a great disease. It is an obsession. You see a man, you say ‘beautiful’. You see a woman and you say ‘ugly’. Why in such a hurry? Wait! The woman has many faces. Even the ugliest woman sometimes has a beautiful face no beautiful woman can compete with. Ugliest – I have seen the ugliest woman in a certain posture, in a certain mood, in a certain climate, so beautiful that your Miss Universe will look a little pale before her. And I have seen the most beautiful woman ugly in certain moods. Wait! Don’t label! Otherwise your label will not allow you to see the reality. Even beautiful women, in anger, in jealousy, in possessiveness, become so ugly. And their ugliness is deeper than the ordinary ugliness of a body. Their ugliness is spiritual and inner, and it comes all over their body like a rash. When a woman is jealous and possessive, she may be beautiful on the surface, but something emanates around her – poisonous, snake-like. She’s ugly. You touch her in that moment and you will feel that you have touched a reptile, not a woman. Poisonous. Fumes coming out of her of poison.\nDon’t label. Reality doesn’t believe in labels. Reality goes on moving and changing. It is flux, a river. You cannot step twice in the same river – not even once. It is moving all the time.\nDon’t categorize. And you have pigeon holes in the mind. Immediately something is there, you put it in a pigeon hole, and finished! And you think you know! This man is good, and that man is\nbad. Have you not ever observed bad becoming good, good becoming bad? Have you not seen an honest thief? Have you not seen a very, very sincere criminal? Have you never seen a sinner, but holy? Categories don’t belong to life. They belong to the mind. Categories are your games. Don’t categorize.\nAnd this man had come to ask Maruf, ‘How to categorize you? Where to put you?’ Maruf is an alive man. If he was dead he would have said, ‘I am a Mohammedan, of course, a humble Muslim, a Sufi,’ but he is not a dead man. He won’t allow categorization. He is alive, utterly alive.\nHe says, ’You remember me by only this. Nothing else. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS. Just this much you remember, that those who don’t understand me, they revere me; and those who don’t understand me, they revile me. In Jerusalem, Jews think I am a Christian and Muslims that I am a Jew. And in Baghdad, where people are in love with me, in my community, Jews think I am the most perfect Jew, Christians that I am a reborn Christ, and Muslims that I am the last word in being a Muslim.\n‘More I will not say. This much I say to you. And if you want to know how to remember me, you can only do this: YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’\nHe remains uncategorized, unlabelled. He does not give any clue. Rather, he becomes more mysterious. The man may have come with something, some prejudice, some idea, about this Master, Maruf. He has demolished his mind completely. He has cut through all his prejudices. He has left him in the vacuum. That’s what a Master does – leaves you in emptiness. But that is the most beautiful gift that can be given to you – nothingness, emptiness, vacuum.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"10413","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/until_you_die/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/until_you_die/>Until You Die</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 A Rose Is A Rose Is A Rose\...</h1><div class=post-meta>49 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10413 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Until_You_Die/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark9>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>10</span></p><p><br></p><p>A Rose Is A Rose Is A Rose...</p><p><br></p><p>20 April 1975 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>A DISCIPLE CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A
JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST
THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’</p><p><br></p><p>MARUF ANSWERED:</p><p><br></p><p>‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD. WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS
SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS
THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID:</p><p>‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO
THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME
AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’</p><p><br></p><p>A RELIGIOUS man is always misunderstood. If he is not misunderstood,
he will not be a religious man.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity lives in a non-religious attitude towards life – sectarian,
but not religious. So a religious man is a stranger. And whatsoever you
say about him will be wrong, because you are wrong.</p><p>And remember: whatsoever you say about him – I am not saying that if
you say something in his favour, that will be right, no; whether you are
in favour of him, or against him, it makes no difference – whatsoever
you say will be wrong about him until you yourself have become a
religious consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Before that, your reverence is false, your condemnation is false. You
may think of him as a sage, and you have misunderstood. You may think of
him as a sinner, and again you have misunderstood.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to remember is: unless you are right, whatsoever
you do, say, be, is going to be wrong. And a religious man is such a
tremendous phenomenon, such a strange phenomenon, that you have no
language to talk about him. All your words are futile in concern with
him. Your whole language is useless, meaningless, because a religious
man is religious because he has gone beyond the dualities, and the whole
of language exists within dualities.</p><p><br></p><p>If you say he is good you are wrong, because he is bad also. If you
say he is bad you are wrong again, because he is good also. And now the
trouble arises, because you cannot conceive how a good man can be bad
also. You can comprehend only a part of the whole, because the other
part is by necessity the opposite. It has to be so.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man is a miniature God. Just like God, he is paradoxical
and contradictory. Just like God, he is summer and winter, day and
night, life and death. Just like God, he is divine and devil both. Then
the mind staggers.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is very efficient if you are working in polarities. If you
say yes, the mind can understand. If you say no, the mind can
understand. But if you say yes and no both, then it goes beyond mind.
Unless you have gone beyond mind, you cannot have the feeling of what a
religious consciousness is.</p><p><br></p><p>I was born a Jain. Now religion has nothing to do with your birth.
You cannot be born in a religion. Just on the contrary: religion has to
be born in you. I was born a Jain – just a coincidence. I could as well
have been born a Christian or a Jew. An irrelevant fact – because by
your birth religion cannot be given to you. It is not a gift. It is not
a heritage. My father is a Jain, my mother is a Jain – they cannot give
Jainism to me. I can inherit their wealth, I can inherit their prestige,
I can inherit the family name – but I cannot inherit religion. Religion
cannot be a gift, a heritage. It is not a thing. It is something one has
to seek for himself. Nobody else can give it to you.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever is given by the birth is a sect, not a religion.
Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Jainism, Buddhism, are sects, not
religions. Religion is one. Sects are many, because sects are the forms,
dead fossilized forms. Sects are like footprints: somebody one day
walked there, but he is no more there – just footprints left on the
sand, on the sand of time. A Buddha walks, footprints are left, and you
go on worshipping those footprints for centuries. There is nobody there
now. Just a form in the sand. Nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Sects are forms in the mind, just like footprints. Yes, somebody was
there one day, but he is no more there. And you go on worshipping those
forms. You are born into those forms. You are conditioned into those
forms, indoctrinated. You become a sectarian.</p><p>And don’t think that you have become religious, otherwise you will
miss. For religion to be there, you have to seek it on your own. It is a
personal growth, a personal encounter with reality – face to face,
immediate and direct. It has nothing to do with tradition, nothing to do
with the past. You have to grow into it. You have to allow it to grow
into you.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is a revolution, not a conformity. It is not a conviction
intellectually attained. It is a conversion of your total being. How can
you be born in a religion? Of course, you can be born in an ideology.
You can learn a theology, words about God, theories about God, dogmas
and doctrines, but to know about God is not to know God. The word ‘God’
is not God. And all the theologies together are nothing compared to a
single moment of encounter with the Divine – because then for the first
time, the spark, your inner light starts. You start rising in a
different dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is a personal search. It is not part of society.</p><p><br></p><p>I was born a Jain. Of course, they tried to force me to be a Jain.
Fortunately, they failed. It is one of the misfortunes that they succeed
in many cases. They failed and they have been angry against me. So if
you ask the Jains, only rarely will you find a Jain here and there who
will say that I am a Jain; otherwise they will say that I am the enemy
of Jainism, and I am destroying their ideology, and I am corrupting
their sources. And both are right in a way.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who say that I am against Jainism, they are right in a way –
because I am against Jainism as they understand it. I am against,
because that is not religion at all. A dead fossil – of course, one of
the most ancient. Jainism seems to be the most ancient religion in the
world, even older than Hinduism. Because even in the Vedas, in the
Rig-Veda, Jain Teerthankaras are mentioned, and mentioned with deep
reverence. That shows Jain Teerthankaras are older than the Rig Veda,
the first Hindu scripture, the oldest in the world. And when a scripture
talks about a master like the first Teerthankara of the Jains, Rishabh,
the Vedas talk with so much reverence that it is almost certain that he
was not a contemporary. He must have been dead for at least one thousand
years; only then can you talk with such reverence. About contemporaries
nobody talks with such reverence. Followers can talk, but Hindus are not
followers of Jains – antagonistic religions. At least one thousand years
must have passed, and the man must have become a legend.</p><p><br></p><p>Jains are very old. Now historians are working on the ruins and
findings in Harappa and Mohenjodaro. And they say that there is every
possibility that Harappa and Mohenjodaro were Jain civilizations. Before
Aryans came to India, India was a Jain country – there is every
possibility. A very ancient religion, and of course, very much dead. The
older a religion, the more dead. Everything fossilized. You cannot find
a more dead person than a Jain monk. He goes on cutting his life; it is
a slow suicide. And the more dead he is, the more he is worshipped –
because death itself seems to be like a renunciation. If he is a little
alive, then Jains become afraid of him. Older religions crucify their
followers, they murder them.</p><p><br></p><p>The older the religion, the greater the weight. Like a Himalaya on
the heart of a small man – burdened, crushing, you cannot move. And
traditions go on gathering. They are like snowballs: they go on
gathering weight, they become fatter and fatter. Dead, but still they go
on gaining weight. They become monstrous, and then they kill the spirit.
They always remain true to the word – and the more true to the word, the
more poisonous to the spirit.</p><p>If you ask the Jains only a few will say, ‘Yes, this man is a real
Jain.’ Many will say, ‘This man is against us, the greatest enemy.’ And
both are right in a way – and both are wrong in a deeper way. I am a
Jain. If you look at Mahavir, I am a Jain. Mahavir is a religious man,
not because he is born in a religion. He searched. He enquired. He
encountered reality. He threw all dogmas. He threw all civilization.
Even clothes he threw away, because they, too, are a part of the
civilization and the culture; and they, too, carry the society with you.
He remained naked. For twelve years he completely stopped talking,
because if you go on talking, you use the language of the society, and
that language carries the germs of the society.</p><p>Whenever you talk, immediately you become a part of a society. A
silent man is not part of any society. He may be part of nature, but
he’s not part of society. In fact, language is the only thing that makes
you human and part of human society and the human world. When you drop
language, suddenly you drop out of human society and civilization. You
become part of the trees, rocks, the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>For twelve years Mahavir would not use any language, remained
completely silent. This man I love, because this is a religious man. And
he started speaking only when silence was total within him. And he spoke
not out of scriptures, he spoke out of himself. He spoke out of his
silence. And whenever a word is born out of deep silence, it is alive,
throbbing with life. And those who hear it directly, they are most
fortunate – because soon it will die. Everything born dies.</p><p><br></p><p>A word is born. It is alive for a few moments. It throbs around you.
If you can listen to it, it will enter into your being, it will become
part of your being. If you don’t listen to it, if you take notes, and
you think that you will try to understand it back home, it will be
already dead. Then you will understand something which was not said at
all. You have already made a private scripture.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavir spoke out of his inner silence. His words are the most
wonderful ever spoken. I love that man. He is the most anti-social man
you can find, and anti-traditional. The other twenty-three
Teerthankaras, twenty-three masters of the Jains, they were all clothed.
This man became nude. Tradition has it that Jains in those days tried to
deny this man. They said, ‘What is he doing? Our other Teerthankaras
have never been nude, and why is he moving nude?’ They did everything to
deny this man, and because of that denial Jainism has been divided into
two parts from that very day. They have two sects: those who followed
Mahavir in his nudity, very few people, they are called Digambaras –
people who believe in nudity. The other older sect, who tried to avoid
this Mahavir, who tried to deny this Mahavir, they are the Swetambaras.
They believe in white clothes; their monks are white-robed. And the
conflict has continued.</p><p>If some Jain says, ‘Yes, this man Rajneesh is a Jain,’ he is right. I
love Mahavir – a rare flowering, a rare fragrance, very rare and unique.
But the others are also right when they say, ‘This man is not a Jain but
against them, the enemy.’ They are also right – because I am against
tradition, against all rituals and forms, against scriptures, against
the past. I am all for religion, and all against sects. They are also
right.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask Hindus, Hindus will say, ‘This man is Jain, and trying to
sabotage Hinduism from within; because no Jain has ever talked about the
Gita, and no Jain has ever commented on the Upanishads. This man is
trying to sabotage Hinduism from within.’ This is what the
Shankaracharya of Puri says about me: ‘Beware of this man! He is not a
Hindu.’ And he is right in a sense. In the sense that he is Hindu, I am
not. But in the sense he is Hindu, Hinduism is worthless.</p><p>I am Hindu in the sense Patanjali is Hindu, Badrayan is Hindu, Kapil
and Kanad are Hindu. The really religious people, they never belong to
the establishment. They cannot. It is possible that the establishment
may follow them; and some day around them an establishment. may be
created. That is possible. But they are never part of any establishment
– either of others or their own. They cannot exist in the establishment.
They are free! Freedom can never be a part of any establishment. And
whenever the establishment becomes too much, the freedom dies. Then the
bird cannot be on the wing; the wings are cut. The bird has been encaged
then, in a golden cage – beautifully decorated, very costly, precious,
but now the cage is more important, not the bird. And, by and by, people
will forget the bird completely, because the bird will die and they will
go on worshipping the cage, and they will go on making it more and more
decorative, and temples will arise around it, and a great tradition,
establishment, and nobody will bother: ‘Where is the bird?’ A dead
corpse in a golden cage.</p><p><br></p><p>I am Hindu, if you believe in Hinduism as a bird on the wing, as the
Upanishads are Hindu; but I am not a Hindu in the sense the
Shankaracharya of Puri is Hindu – a dead bird in a golden cage.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask Mohammedans, they will say I have no right to talk on
Sufis or on the Koran. Once in a town I was talking about Sufis, and the
maulvi of the town approached me and he said, ‘You have no right. You
are not a Mohammedan, you don’t know Arabic. How can you talk on the
Sufis and on the Koran?’</p><p><br></p><p>I said, ‘The Koran has nothing to do with Arabic. It has something to
do with the heart, not with the language.’</p><p><br></p><p>The Koran has nothing to do with the language. It has something to do
with silence, not language. The Koran has something to do with the
reality, not with the symbols. And I am not a Mohammedan if you think
that I am a follower of Mohammed – no, I am not. I am nobody’s follower.
But I am a Mohammedan, just like Mohammed is a Mohammedan; just as Jesus
is a Christian, I am a Christian – but like Mohammed and Jesus. Was
Mohammed a Mohammedan? How can he bet Because Mohammedanism never
existed before. Was Jesus a Christian? Christianity never existed
before. How can he be a Christian? If Jesus is a Christian, I am a
Christian. If Mohammed is a Mohammedan, then I am a Mohammedan. But
otherwise, I am not a Mohammedan and not a Christian.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man does not belong to any sect. In fact, all sects
belong to the religious man. But this is how the formal mind goes. He
thinks in terms of ideology, language, ritual, and he misses the whole
point: that religion has nothing to do with these things.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is religion?</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is an oceanic feeling where you are lost and only the
existence remains. It is a death and a resurrection. You die as you are,
and you are resurrected totally new. Something absolutely new arises out
of the death of the old. On the grave of the old something sprouts and
becomes a new flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is an inner revolution, an inner mutation. It is not in the
temples, not in the mosques, not in the churches. Don’t look for
religion there! If you look there you will waste your time. Look for</p><p>religion inwards. And the further inwards you move, the deeper you
will find the ego there – which is the barrier. Drop that barrier and
suddenly you are religious. There is only one thing which is not
religious and that is the ego. And that can never be religious. And
sects never kill it; on the contrary, they strengthen it.</p><p><br></p><p>Through rituals, temples, ideologies, the ego is strengthened. You go
to the church and you feel that you have become religious. A subtle
pride arises in you. You don’t become humble; on the contrary, you
become more egoistic. You do a certain ritual and you feel gratified –
and you start condemning those who are not doing the ritual. You think
those are the sinners and they are going to be thrown into the fire of
hell; and your heaven is secured just by doing certain rituals? Whom do
you think that you are deceiving?</p><p><br></p><p>A man sits for one hour turning the beads, and he is thinking his
heaven is secured, and others who are not doing this stupid thing, they
are going to hell. And you go to the mosque, and you kneel down, and you
say foolish things to the Divine: ‘You are great’ – is there any doubt
about it? Why are you saying it?. – ‘I’m a sinner, and you are
compassion.’ What are you doing? buttressing? Do you think God has an
ego-like thing?. – so that you can say who you are, ‘You are very great
and we are very small. And you are compassion and we are sinners.
Forgive us!’ Whom do you think you are deceiving?</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is playing the game. You think God is also an ego which can
be buttressed? God is not a person at all, so you are talking to
yourself. There is nobody else to listen to it; only the walls, the dead
walls of the mosque or the temple, or a stone statue. Nobody is
listening.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, you are doing something mad. Just go into the madhouses and
see people talking to somebody who is not there. Even those mad people
are not so mad, because that somebody may be somewhere. They may not be
here; a madman may be talking to his wife who is not here in the
madhouse, but somewhere maybe – but your God is nowhere. Your madness is
deeper, greater – dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you talk with existence? With existence you have to be
silent. All talking should stop. You are not to say something. On the
contrary, a prayer is a listening. You have to listen to existence, not
to say something. If you speak, who will listen? If you talk and you are
too much involved in the words, then who will listen? And every moment
there is a message.</p><p><br></p><p>Every moment, from everywhere, there is a message for you. It is
written all over. The whole existence is the scripture of the Divine.
The message is everywhere. On every leaf is the signature. But who will
see? Your eyes and your mind are filled with yourself. Rubbish you have,
but you go on rotating that rubbish in the mind. Drop it all!</p><p><br></p><p>This is something to understand, because a prayer can be Christian, a
prayer can be Hindu, a prayer can be Jewish – then they are sectarian
prayers and not prayers at all. A real prayer cannot be Christian,
Hindu, or Buddha. A real prayer is just a silence, a waiting. How can
you say silence is Hindu? How can you say silence is Christian? Can
silence be Christian or Hindu? Silence is simply silence! – neither
Hindu nor Mohammedan. When two persons are absolutely silent, can you
say who is Hindu and who is Mohammedan? In silence sects disappear. In
silence societies disappear. In silence civilizations disappear. In
silence, you disappear. Only silence is – you are not</p><p>there. If you are there, then silence cannot be because you will do
something or other, you will think something or other, you will go on
chattering inside.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are not, society is not, sects are not; no words, no prayer;
you are not reciting the Koran, not reciting the Veda; not doing a TM
meditation, ‘Ram, Ram, Ram’ – all foolish. When you are simply silent, a
meeting happens, a merger happens – you dissolve! Just as ice melts, and
the boundaries dissolve, and then you cannot find where the ice has
gone... it has become one with the sea.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun rises, ice melts, becomes water. Silence arises, the mind,
the ice-like, frozen mind, starts melting, the ego dissolves. Suddenly
there is ocean and you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the moment of religion. Religion is born in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is born in religion. Religion ‘borns’ in you. You have to
become a mother, a womb, for religion to become impregnated in you, to
grow in you. You have to give the birth. You cannot be born in religion.
You have to give birth to religion. And then it is beautiful. Then it is
something from the unknown. Then it is not concerned with man.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of Jesus’ virgin birth. The whole meaning is
simply this: that a man like Jesus is not born out of man. Religious
consciousness is not born out of man. It is born out of the unknown.
Mary, Jesus’ mother, is virgin; no man has corrupted her. This is a
symbolic thing. It is not that Jesus is born out of a virgin
biologically. Then you miss the metaphor; the beautiful story becomes an
ugly doctrine. Then you miss the poetry. And then for centuries
Christians have been arguing, and trying to prove somehow that Jesus is
born, really, from a virgin mother. How can theologicians be so stupid?
It is a wonder! And they go on trying and proving, and very intellectual
people, argumentative – but blind.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever you miss the poetry and try to create an argument out of
it, you destroy religion. You are not a help. You put people off
religion. Then the whole of Christianity becomes absurd – because of
some absurdity in the foundation. And these are poetic truths. And
poetic truths are not logical truths. Logical truths are nothing, they
are ordinary facts. Poetic truths are extraordinary facts, so
extraordinary in their quality that you cannot make an argument out of
them. Argument is too narrow. They need much space. Only a poetic
symbology can give that space.</p><p><br></p><p>This is beautiful poetry. I also say Jesus is born out of a virgin
mother – because there is no other way. Because religious consciousness
is uncorrupted by man, untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>Religious consciousness means you have dropped all that is man-made:
doctrines, dogmas, churches, words, language, prayers, forms, rituals –
all that is man-made you have dropped. Then in that silence, God Himself
becomes part of you. You become pregnant with the God. You carry the
pregnancy. It grows every day. And the more it grows, the more alive it
becomes, the more you start feeling that now you have something more
valuable than your life.</p><p><br></p><p>A mother is always ready to die for the child. If there is a crisis
and only one can be saved, either the child or the mother, the mother is
always ready – the child should survive. She is ready to die.</p><p>There is another parable I would like to tell you. It is said that
whenever a Buddha is born, the mother dies immediately. That, too, has
created problems for Buddhists, because they say if Mary is alive and
has not died and Jesus is born, Jesus cannot be a Buddha – because
whenever an enlightened man is born, the mother dies! Buddha’s mother
died. Then Mahavir cannot be a Buddha and Krishna cannot be a Buddha,
because the first thing is missing. This is how beautiful symbols become
ugly. It is beautiful! I don’t know whether Buddha’s mother died or not.
That is irrelevant. Whether she lived or died, that is not the point.
But the point is: whenever religious consciousness is born in you, when
you are pregnant with Buddhahood, when you are pregnant with
enlightenment, and you carry enlightenment as a child within you, you
will die, because both cannot live.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the whole message of this series of talks: Until you die,
nothing is possible. The mother must die for the child to be born,
because both cannot exist – because you are the mother and you are the
child. You are not two. When you become enlightened, the old must die
immediately. If you cling to the old, then you will cripple your
enlightenment. If you cling to the old, you will suffocate the child. If
you cling too much, the child will be dead before the child is born.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember: Religion is poetry, not logic. It is not even
philosophy – it is art. And art is not an argument. Art doesn’t bother
about argument. Art can seduce you without argument, then why bother
about argument? Art is so powerful, it can seduce you without any
argument. Argument is needed on the lower realms where the thing itself
is not so powerful to convince you – then argument is needed. When the
thing in itself is so powerful, so hypnotic, so transforming, that you
are suddenly absorbed into it, there is no need to convince you.</p><p><br></p><p>I never try to convince you. If you are convinced, good. If you are
not convinced, good. But I am not trying to convince you of anything,
because conviction is a very ordinary thing. If through argument you are
convinced, you will never become religious. You may become
philosophical, you may carry a dogma in your head, but you will never
become religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is like love. You fall in it – for no reason at all. You
cannot prove; proof is not needed. Proof is needed only when you are
thinking of a marriage. Argument is needed only when you are thinking of
an arranged marriage – then you think about the family, and the parents
of the girl, and the money, and the dowry, and the future possibilities,
political relationships, and everything you think about. But when you
fall in love, you fall in love – it happens so suddenly, there is no
time gap.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is the same with religion. You fall in love with a man who is
religious. You cannot prove it. And if somebody argues with you against
it, it is very easy to prove something against it; it is almost
impossible to prove anything for it. That’s why it is a trust, a faith,
a deep blindness. But in that deep blindness, for the first time your
inner eye starts functioning. The deep blindness from the outside
becomes a deep insight from within.</p><p><br></p><p>Now try to understand this story.</p><p><br></p><p>A DISCIPLE CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A
JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST
THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’</p><p>MARUF ANSWERED:</p><p><br></p><p>‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD. WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS
SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS
THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID:</p><p>‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO
THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME
AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now: A DISCIPLE CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID... Maruf Karkhi is one
of the Sufi masters, and it is said that hundreds of people became
enlightened through him. He developed many new devices; and he was
really a religious man, not belonging to any orthodoxy, not belonging to
any convention, not belonging to any tradition; homeless, without any
roots; floating like a white cloud – absolute freedom in his being.</p><p><br></p><p>A DISCIPLE CAME... The disciple cannot be really a disciple; he must
have been a student. In English translations there is trouble, because
in English you don’t make much distinction between a disciple and a
student; you don’t make much distinction between a master and a teacher.
But in the East, a vast distinction, difference, exists between these
two terminologies.</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher can have students, cannot have disciples. A teacher
teaches. Of course, a teacher can teach only that which can be taught.
Religion cannot be taught. Things about religion can be taught. Mm? –
that is what theology is: things about God. But God Himself cannot be
taught. Concepts about God, theories – whether this is right or that.
And there are millions of theories.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has been inventing so many theories about God that God is
completely lost in theories. He has almost become nonsubstantial. When
you utter the word ‘God’ no substance is felt in it. It looks like an
air bubble, carrying nothing but hot air within. When you say ‘God’, no
bells ring in the heart. When you say ‘God’, it falls flat. It does not
carry much significance. The so-called religious thinkers have killed
the word completely. They have destroyed the beauty of it. The moment
you utter the word ‘God’, you put many off. The word carries much
violence, ugliness, strife, narrowness – of so-called religious people.
It has no poetry now.</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher can teach you everything about God. You can become a doctor
living with a teacher, a doctor of divinity – a D.D. It is simply
unbelievable that things like this exist on earth – people who carry a
degree of doctorate about Divinity. God is not a theory. It is an
experience. You cannot be taught about It.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Lao Tzu, The Old Boy... the word ‘Lao Tzu’ means The Old Boy.
Another parable: It is said Lao Tzu was born old – when he was
eighty-four years of age. For eighty-four years he lived in the womb of
the mother. When he was born, he was already absolutely ancient – all
his hair white, wrinkled. What is the meaning? The meaning is that
whenever religious consciousness is born, it is always ancient: new and
ancient, both. Hence, Lao Tzu’s name: The Old Boy. Lao Tzu means The Old
Boy – old, yet young.</p><p>Says Lao Tzu: ‘Truth cannot be said. And all that can be said will
not be true.’</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher is one who teaches truth which cannot be taught. He teaches
about truth. He goes round and round. He beats around the bush. He never
hits the center. And a student is one who is enquiring about God, not
desiring God; who has come to know, not to be; whose search is
intellectual, not total. A student is trying to gather more knowledge;
he wants to become more knowledgeable. He wants to accumulate much
information.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about one of the students of Maruf... he became very
famous, the student; he became so famous that people started coming to
him and asking him things, even when Maruf was alive. Even sometimes it
would happen that Maruf was sitting there with the student, and people
would come not to Maruf but to the student and ask him things. He became
so efficient in the scripture, he crammed all the scriptures, and he was
perfect like a computer.</p><p><br></p><p>One day somebody came and he asked a question about some passage in
the scripture, and the student recited the whole scripture, then recited
all the commentaries that had been made about the scripture – within
minutes, all that was there in the scriptures, he brought it down. And
he argued this way and that and tried to prove a conclusion. Maruf was
sitting and listening. The man was astounded – so much knowledge. He
said to Maruf, ‘You are fortunate to have such disciples. This boy is a
rare gem! So much knowledge: I have never come across such a brilliant
mind, such a genius. What do you say about him?’</p><p><br></p><p>Maruf said, ‘I am always worried. I am worried because he reads too
much. And I am worried that he has no time to know; his whole time is
going in reading. And I am always worried as to when he will know – he
has no time.’</p><p><br></p><p>A student is concerned not about knowing, he is concerned about
knowledge. A teacher attracts students. A master attracts disciples. A
disciple is not a student. He has not come to know about God. He has
come to become God, to be God. He has not come for more information, he
has come for MORE BEING. Let me repeat: a disciple asks how to gain more
being, and a student asks how to gain more knowledge. He has come to the
master to BE. And that is a totally different enquiry. The dimension is
altogether different. Not only different, it is diametrically opposite.
A student goes to the west, and a disciple goes to the east. It is said
that east and west never meet – I don’t know. They must meet somewhere
because the earth is round. But one thing I know: a student and a
disciple never meet. They cannot. Unless a student drops being a
student, he cannot become a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about Maruf that whenever a person would come... and
thousands were coming to him from distant corners of the world. Maruf
became an institution, a university – of being, of course, not of
knowledge. Whenever a student, or a disciple or a seeker would come to
him, the first question Maruf used to ask was this: ‘Do you want to
learn, or unlearn? Do you want to be a student or a disciple?’ This was
always his first question, because that would decide everything.</p><p><br></p><p>This man who reached Maruf must have been a student. He could not
have been a disciple because a disciple is one who has already attained
to a trust. A student is seeking. A disciple has come to a conclusion in
his being that ‘This is my Master.’ Hence, he is the disciple. ‘This is
my Master! I have come to the man I was seeking. This is my shelter, my
refuge.’ Suddenly the disciple is born! A</p><p>disciple is born out of this trust. He does not enquire about such
things this man is enquiring about. He has fallen in love. He has
attained to faith. He has surrendered. A student is not surrendered. He
will learn, watch, observe, see, and if he’s convinced... and remember,
if he is convinced; that is, the conclusion will come out of his
head.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a very, very ridiculous thing said
by an Indian guru who has become famous in the West, Sri Chinmoy. He
teaches in the UN in Geneva. I was always wondering what he is doing
there, and just the other day I came to read a statement he has made.
Somebody asked him, ‘How to judge and how to find the Master?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said, ‘Use your brain.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now I know why he is in the UN – because politicians, stupid people,
are there. ‘Use your brain!’ And, the thing becomes more and more
ridiculous because then he says, ‘Keep one hundred marks in your mind to
be given, Then watch whether the Master is honest, sincere, true to his
word, his morality, his behaviour – everything you watch, and go on
giving the marks inside the mind. If the Master gets thirty marks, he is
not for you; you leave. If the Master gets near about eighty to ninety
marks, then he is your Master.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is ridiculous. You will find a teacher, you cannot find a Master
– if you use your brain. Then finally you remain the decisive factor;
you decide. Do you know what honesty is? First give marks to yourself!
Use your brain! Do you know what honesty is? Do you know what morality
is? Are you certain of what is good? and what is bad? Do you know what
is evil and what is not evil? First give marks to yourself – use your
brain. If you get thirty marks, drop yourself completely. You are
useless! And if you can get eighty or ninety percent, then you don’t
need a master. You are already a master – you go and seek disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>To use the brain is simply unbelievable! A Master is not a commodity
in the market. A Master, by his very being, is an unbelievable thing.
You cannot use the brain. A Master, by his very being, is mysterious.
Opposites meet in him. Dichotomies merge in him. Dualisms – he
comprehends all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>You can find a teacher if you use the brain; then you will be a
student. If you use your heart, you can find a Master – and then only
can you become a disciple. A disciple is in love! And love is always
total, not eighty percent, ninety percent. Love is total. Either it is
or it is not. Always total. If it is not, then, too, total. And there is
no compromise in it. Percentage is not possible; percentage is the way
of the brain. Totality is the way of the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This man must have been a student. So, let me say:</p><p><br></p><p>A student CAME TO MARUF KARKHI AND SAID: ‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO
PEOPLE ABOUT YOU.’</p><p><br></p><p>Must have been using the brain. Must have been a student of Sri
Chinmoy. ‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU.’ You have to
encounter a master directly – face to face, eyes to eyes, heart to
heart. What nonsense to talk about the master to other people to know
who this man is!</p><p>Many of you do the same here also. They move around. They talk to
people about me. Why not come directly to me? Why waste your time with
people? And this is the foolishness of the human mind, that you never
know the person you are talking to about me – you trust that person, and
you cannot trust me. If you are really a brain-oriented person, then
talk about that man to other people, and about those other people to
other people. Because first you have to decide about that man, whether
he is sincere, believable: ‘Whatsoever he says about the master, can we
take it to be true?’</p><p><br></p><p>You ask A about me – why not ask about A to B first? And then about B
to C? Then you will be in an infinite regress. And if A says something
wrong about me, you take it. Now it will always be a part of you. Or if
A says something good about me, you take it and that will be a part of
you. And that will decide the whole thing. And you never ask about this
A, who this A is!</p><p><br></p><p>Why go in rounds and circles?. – there is no end to it. There is only
one way to come to the master: face to face, eyes to eyes, heart to
heart! And don’t ask anybody else because then you will carry a
prejudice either for or against. And that prejudice will always be in
between the master and you, that will become the barrier. You will
always be seeking whether that prejudice is right or wrong. It will
colour your mind. And any foolish man can prejudice your mind. You are
so unaware that any man – the taxi driver who brings you to the ashram –
he can corrupt your mind. You can ask about me... and many of you must
have asked taxi drivers – because the mind goes on seeking information,
what others are saying: ‘and they must be knowing.’ You must ask the
neighbours here: ‘they must be knowing.’ And they are the last people in
the world to know about me. Neighbours – they cannot know.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has two sayings. One saying is: Love your enemies just as you
love yourself. And second: Love your neighbours just as you love
yourself. It seems enemies and the neighbours are the same people.</p><p><br></p><p>This man must have been an ordinary enquirer. He said:</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU. JEWS CLAIM THAT YOU ARE A
JEW; CHRISTIANS REVERE YOU AS ONE OF THEIR OWN SAINTS; MUSLIMS INSIST
THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL MUSLIMS.’</p><p><br></p><p>He must have met the disciples, the people who had fallen in love
with the Master. Maruf lived near Baghdad. Baghdad became a capital of
religious consciousness when Maruf was alive. This man must have met the
disciples, those who had already fallen in love.</p><p><br></p><p>If the disciple is a Jew, he will say, ‘My Master is the most perfect
Jew possible.’ I have many Jews here and they know that I am the most
perfect Jew. Once you are in love, whatsoever is beautiful, great to
you, you project on the Master. I have amongst my disciples almost all
sorts of people, belonging to all sorts of religions – Jews, Hindus,
Mohammedans, Christians, Jains, Buddhists. If a Buddhist comes to me and
falls in love with me, he will think that I am the most essential
Buddhist. And he will find everything to convince him that this is
true.</p><p><br></p><p>MARUF ANSWERED: ‘THIS IS WHAT HUMANITY SAYS IN BAGHDAD.’</p><p><br></p><p>That means: ‘My disciples, my people, my community people. You should
have been in Jerusalem. This is what humanity says in Baghdad – that is,
my community people, my people.’</p><p>‘WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM, JEWS SAID THAT I WAS A CHRISTIAN, MUSLIMS
THAT I WAS A JEW, AND CHRISTIANS THAT I WAS A MUSLIM.’</p><p><br></p><p>Enemies. And for a religious man to find enemies, the best places are
Jerusalem, Quaba, Kashi. These are the best places to find enemies,
because these are the sectarian strongholds – Kashi for Hindus,
Jerusalem for Jews, Quaba for Muslims. These are the sectarian
strongholds, fortresses, where the fossilized religion is protected and
saved; where the dead body is continuously decorated, painted, for
believers – to deceive them that the body is not dead; where religion is
continuously modified to suit new situations so that there is no need to
drop it; where dead continuity is continued. There is the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to find people antagonistic to a religious man, go to
these sacred places, holy places. In fact, they are the unholiest in the
world; they have to be – because the dead corpse of religion stinks. Can
you find a more dirty place in the world than Kashi? Everything stinks
of dead religion. But if you are a believer, then you don’t listen to
your senses, you don’t listen to your own consciousness. You go on
seeing things which are not there. You go on projecting things which are
not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Said Maruf, ‘This is what humanity says in Baghdad. When I was in
Jerusalem just the opposite was the case. Everybody was saying that I
don’t belong to them, I am the enemy. Jews thought I was a Muslim, the
enemy. Muslims thought I was a Jew, the enemy. Christians thought I was
a Muslim, the enemy. And in all these three religions, nobody, nobody
was ready even to accept me in their fold.’</p><p><br></p><p>Religious persons cannot be accepted in any fold. They can be
accepted only in the loving heart, but in no organization. They cannot
be accepted because organizations have no hearts. A religious man cannot
be absorbed in any establishment; only a personal feeling, a loving
heart, can become a shrine for him.</p><p><br></p><p>The man must have been puzzled now, because he had come to enquire
who he was. Perhaps the man was a Muslim and he wanted to be convinced
that this Maruf was a Muslim so that he could follow him. The man may
have been a Jew and wanted to be convinced that this Maruf was a Jew so
that he could follow him.</p><p><br></p><p>You follow yourself. You never follow any Master.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are here because I say things which you already know are
right, then you are not with me. Then I am only voicing your own mind.
If you are here because you see in me a Jain, because you are a Jain...
and when I talk about Mahavir I can immediately count how many Jains are
there. Their eyes simply change. Their backbones become straight. They
look very intense. Now for the first time they are alert, otherwise they
were falling asleep. If I talk about Jews, I can count immediately how
many Jews are there. And if I cannot decide who you are, then only are
you with me.Because if you are a Jew, and you listen to me, and you feel
that whatsoever I am saying is what Jewish religion is, then you remain
a Jew. I am just a support for your convictions, just an outside
support. I have not entered you. You have not allowed me to enter in
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me and they say, ‘Whatsoever you said was
beautiful, because this is what I have believed my whole life. And you
said it better than I can say.’ So that’s all. He’s finished with</p><p>me, and I am finished with him. There has been no meeting. He has
heard his own voice in my voice. He has interpreted his own mind. And he
remains a believer in his own ego. He has not dropped even a bit of his
old luggage. Rather, on the contrary, now he is more convinced of the
old luggage and he will carry it with more strength and with more
conviction.</p><p><br></p><p>No! Remember this: I am not here to make you a Jew, or a Hindu, or a
Christian – no. I am here only to make you a religious man.</p><p><br></p><p>The man must have been puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. ‘You have puzzled me.
You confuse me.’</p><p><br></p><p>ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE, IN A WAY, CONFUSING. They create a chaos in
you – because first you have to be uprooted. First you have to be
demolished. No religious person is interested in renovating you, because
howsoever renovated, you will remain the old, the dead thing; modified,
of course, but not fresh and young. A religious person is interested in
demolishing you completely, in pulling you down to the very roots, and
then, in helping you to arise again.</p><p><br></p><p>Until you die, nothing is possible. A Master is a death on the one
hand, resurrection on the other. A Master is a crucifixion, a cross. As
you are, you die. And as you should be is born.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>‘WHAT MUST WE THINK OF YOU THEN?’ SAID THE MAN. MARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO
NOT UNDERSTAND ME...’</p><p>Listen to these words. Very significant.</p><p><br></p><p>‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME.’</p><p><br></p><p>They do not understand, hence they revere. People are really foolish.
If they don’t understand a thing they start revering it, because they
think there must be something very mysterious: ‘When I cannot understand
– I, such an intelligent and genius man – when I cannot understand,
there must be something very, very deep and mysterious.’ And many people
exploit such attitudes. Many people.</p><p><br></p><p>If you read Hegel’s books, you will find that is what he is doing. He
goes on trying to make everything as difficult as possible. It is not
difficult! It is a good exercise to study Hegel, a German philosopher,
in his own day thought to be the greatest. But as time passes, he comes
again and again lower and lower and lower – because as you understand
him his mystery is lost. And nothing is there. Just verbiage. If he can
say a thing in a single word, he will use a hundred pages. If he can say
a thing in one sentence, he will go on and on, round and round, into
pages. You will not be able... He writes long sentences, sometimes one
sentence in one page – you will not be capable of remembering the
beginning of the sentence when you reach to the end. You will have to
read it again and again. And he mystifies.</p><p>There are many people, mystifiers, exploiting the human stupidity of
believing that whatsoever you cannot understand must be something
superb, of the sublime, of the unknown, of the mysterious. These people
are exploiters.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the reverse is the case with people who are really wise. They
speak in short sentences. Their sentences are not complicated. They are
simple. Whatsoever they say can be understood by anybody who is normally
intelligent. They don’t mystify. Whatsoever they teach is very, very
simple – simple as life is simple; simple as existence is simple, rivers
and mountains are simple, birds and trees are simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Wise men are simple. But the more you understand them – and to
understand them is simple – but the more you understand them, the deeper
you penetrate in their simplicity, the more you find new dimensions of
mysteries opening. Their words are simple, but what they want to
indicate is mysterious.Their indication is simple, but the indicated is
mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at my finger – a simple thing! – and I indicate with my finger
towards the moon. The moon is mysterious, not the finger. The finger is
a very simple phenomenon; nothing to say about it. Words are like
fingers. And they point, they finger, indicate, towards the
mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME.’</p><p><br></p><p>And you have revered many people, and you have revered many
doctrines, just because you cannot understand them.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many followers of Gurdjieff; because they cannot understand
him, they follow him. Gurdjieff is not like Hegel, he is not mystifying,
but he has something else to do. He does not want unwanted people to
come near him, so he writes in such a way that unless you are very
patient you will not be able to penetrate into him. He is not difficult.
He is simple. But the methodology is such that he puts you off. You
cannot read more than a few pages. I have not come across a single
person yet who has read his ALL AND EVERYTHING completely. People have
gone through it, but.<span class=s4></span>And he knew it, that this
is going to be so. He writes in a tedious style. He bores you. And</p><p>this is a very considered method. He puts you off.</p><p><br></p><p>When for the first time the book ALL AND EVERYTHING was published,
the pages were not cut. Only the introductory pages, a hundred pages
were cut, and the other pages were not cut. And there was a note on the
book saying that if you can read the hundred pages, then open the
others; otherwise return the book back to the shop and take your money
back. First try with the hundred pages, and if you are still interested,
then open the other pages, cut them. Otherwise, don’t destroy the book.
And many books were returned back. Many were not returned; that doesn’t
mean that people read them. They were just curious. They thought, ‘Maybe
it is a trick and only in the introductory pages he is boring. Inside he
may not be.’ But if you cut, then you cannot return the book.</p><p><br></p><p>But I have not come across a single person who has read the whole
book thoroughly. People skip. Then they miss – because here and there he
hides the diamonds, and everything else is just a camouflage. Here and
there, in the bushes of words, he hides the diamonds. Those diamonds can
be sorted out and can be written on a postcard. And that book is one
thousand pages!</p><p>Many people follow Gurdjieff because they cannot under stand.
Suddenly, when you cannot understand, you feel there is some mystery. It
is not so. Truth is very simple. Everybody has the capacity to
understand it. Truth is as simple as anything can be. You have to be
just silent, understanding, ready, and it is revealed to you.</p><p><br></p><p>MARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, hence their reverence. And
OTHERS DO NOT EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME.’</p><p><br></p><p>Then there are the people who if they cannot understand – they cannot
believe that there can exist anything which they cannot understand –
then they revile. It is against their egos. But remember: both are the
egoistic viewpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>One ego thinks, ‘I am so understanding. If I cannot understand, then
there must be something mysterious.’ Another ego says, ‘If I cannot
understand, then there cannot be anything at all. This man is simply
deceptive. There is nothing. If there were anything, then how come I
cannot understand it? A genius like me will understand everything.’ Both
are egoistic standpoints. And one has to drop out of them both – only
then can you understand a Master.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to drop out of both. Don’t revere a thing because you don’t
understand. Don’t revile it because you don’t understand. In fact, don’t
refer the thing to your ego, don’t bring it in the context of your ego.
That is useless! Just listen to the thing. If you cannot understand, try
to understand – meditate more, contemplate more, become more silent.
Come to it again and again from different standpoints. And finally come
to it with no standpoint at all. You will understand. And the mystery
will be revealed. If you cannot understand, don’t start reviling it –
because you are not the last word in understanding. You are not the last
capacity of understanding. You are not the omega of understanding. You
are just a beginner on the first rung of the ladder. And the ladder is
vast and big.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of things are waiting for you to be. You are just at the
door. You have not even entered the shrine. Maybe just on the steps, or
maybe just on the path. Not even come up to the steps. Not even at the
door.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t bring your ego in either way. You are not the deciding factor
as to whether it is mysterious or nothing. You listen. The more you
listen to a man who has attained, the more and more you will understand.
And the more you understand, the more it will become mysterious. The
mystery of life is not something which can be solved or which is ever
solved. It has to be lived! It is not a problem to be solved. It has to
be lived.</p><p><br></p><p>The more you know, the less you feel you know. The more you know, the
more you feel the unknown surrounds you from everywhere. And in the
final moment of knowing, all knowledge drops. You know nothing. That
final moment of knowing is like vast ignorance, a vast dark night. But
only out of that dark night is the morning born. Out of this vast
ignorance a light arises – which is knowing, which is understanding;
which Buddha calls praggya, sambodhi; what Patanjali calls Samadhi, the
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>MARUF SAID: ‘SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND REVERE ME. OTHERS DO NOT
EITHER, SO THEY REVILE ME. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD
THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS.’</p><p>The man was asking to label Maruf somehow – whether he is a Jew, or a
Mohammedan, or a Christian. Once labelled, you think you have
understood. Labelling is a trick. You label a certain thing and you feel
you have understood.</p><p><br></p><p>I show you a flower, an outlandish flower you have never seen before,
and immediately you ask, ‘What is the name?’ Why are you so anxious to
know the name? How is the name going to help you? X, Y, Z, whatsoever
the name may be, how is it going to help you? If I say X, you think now
you know it. You have labelled it. Now you can show to your child that
this is X flower. You have become a knower. What have you known about
the flower? Just the word X? I could have called it Y, or Z. They would
have been as relevant as X. How do you know it?</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading Gertrude Stein’s book. When she said in a poem, ‘A rose
is a rose is a rose,’ it became world famous. She goes on that way with
many things. She does not define. She does not say anything – ‘A rose is
a rose is a rose.’ Nothing is defined; nothing is said really.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked, ‘Why have you said this? We all know a rose is a rose
is a rose. It makes no sense. It adds nothing to our knowledge.’</p><p><br></p><p>Stein said, ‘Because poets have been talking about roses for
millennia – millions of poetries about roses, everybody has read them
and sung them, and everybody has repeated – the word “rose” has lost its
rosiness. It doesn’t say anything any more. That’s why I had to repeat,
“A rose is a rose is a rose” – so that you are awakened out of your
sleep, so that you are shaken a little: “What is this woman saying? the
absurdity of it! – a rose is a rose is a rose.” You may listen.
Otherwise, rose – who listens? Everybody knows.’ And she said,
‘Repeating this I have brought the redness to the rose again.’</p><p><br></p><p>Words can’t say much. And if you think that just knowing the names
and labels, you have known, you will miss everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to avoid words. Don’t try to label. You immediately label!
Labelling is such a great disease. It is an obsession. You see a man,
you say ‘beautiful’. You see a woman and you say ‘ugly’. Why in such a
hurry? Wait! The woman has many faces. Even the ugliest woman sometimes
has a beautiful face no beautiful woman can compete with. Ugliest – I
have seen the ugliest woman in a certain posture, in a certain mood, in
a certain climate, so beautiful that your Miss Universe will look a
little pale before her. And I have seen the most beautiful woman ugly in
certain moods. Wait! Don’t label! Otherwise your label will not allow
you to see the reality. Even beautiful women, in anger, in jealousy, in
possessiveness, become so ugly. And their ugliness is deeper than the
ordinary ugliness of a body. Their ugliness is spiritual and inner, and
it comes all over their body like a rash. When a woman is jealous and
possessive, she may be beautiful on the surface, but something emanates
around her – poisonous, snake-like. She’s ugly. You touch her in that
moment and you will feel that you have touched a reptile, not a woman.
Poisonous. Fumes coming out of her of poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t label. Reality doesn’t believe in labels. Reality goes on
moving and changing. It is flux, a river. You cannot step twice in the
same river – not even once. It is moving all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t categorize. And you have pigeon holes in the mind. Immediately
something is there, you put it in a pigeon hole, and finished! And you
think you know! This man is good, and that man is</p><p>bad. Have you not ever observed bad becoming good, good becoming bad?
Have you not seen an honest thief? Have you not seen a very, very
sincere criminal? Have you never seen a sinner, but holy? Categories
don’t belong to life. They belong to the mind. Categories are your
games. Don’t categorize.</p><p><br></p><p>And this man had come to ask Maruf, ‘How to categorize you? Where to
put you?’ Maruf is an alive man. If he was dead he would have said, ‘I
am a Mohammedan, of course, a humble Muslim, a Sufi,’ but he is not a
dead man. He won’t allow categorization. He is alive, utterly alive.</p><p><br></p><p>He says, ’You remember me by only this. Nothing else. THAT IS WHAT I
HAVE COME TO SAY. YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS. Just
this much you remember, that those who don’t understand me, they revere
me; and those who don’t understand me, they revile me. In Jerusalem,
Jews think I am a Christian and Muslims that I am a Jew. And in Baghdad,
where people are in love with me, in my community, Jews think I am the
most perfect Jew, Christians that I am a reborn Christ, and Muslims that
I am the last word in being a Muslim.</p><p><br></p><p>‘More I will not say. This much I say to you. And if you want to know
how to remember me, you can only do this: YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME AS ONE
WHO HAS SAID THIS.’</p><p><br></p><p>He remains uncategorized, unlabelled. He does not give any clue.
Rather, he becomes more mysterious. The man may have come with
something, some prejudice, some idea, about this Master, Maruf. He has
demolished his mind completely. He has cut through all his prejudices.
He has left him in the vacuum. That’s what a Master does – leaves you in
emptiness. But that is the most beautiful gift that can be given to you
– nothingness, emptiness, vacuum.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_white_lotus/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 A Love Affair With the Universe</span>

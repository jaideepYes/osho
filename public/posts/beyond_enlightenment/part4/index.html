I FEEL FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOWERED\nYOUR LOVE AND COMPASSION ON ME FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU HAVE\nHELPED ME AT EACH STEP, AT EACH TURNING POINT OF MY LIFE. YOU\nCHANGED MY LIFE, YOU FILLED MY LIFE WITH LOVE AND JOY, YOU GAVE\nME IMMENSE CLARITY, YOU MADE ME FREE.\nI BOW DOWN TO YOU. BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, BUDDHAM\nSHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI.\nNarendra, you are almost right. But remember my emphasis on the word almost.\nAnd this is true not only about me, this is true about everybody else too: Everybody is by nature a divine being, an awakened soul, a Gautam Buddha, who has just fallen asleep for a while, has just forgotten himself for a moment and is lost in dreams, beautiful dreams of ambition, desire, success... to be someone special in the world, to leave footprints behind.\nThe moment your dream is broken, your sleep is gone, suddenly you are in for a great surprise, perhaps the greatest surprise: that the treasure you have been looking for is within you, that the paradise you have been searching for is within\nyou, that there is no God who can drive you out of the Garden of Eden because the Garden of Eden is your very being. At the most you can forget it but you cannot lose it. And once you recognize it, then life becomes really hilarious; you can laugh at your own efforts and endeavors, at your whole past that you have spent in searching for it.\nAnd the goal of your search was not away from you, not even close to you. You were the goal, the seeker was the sought.\nAnd everything that you have done before you became enlightened, everything that you have been before you became aware of your tremendous beauty, of your eternal life, will take a different meaning after your enlightenment. To you and to those who are close to you, the enlightenment will make such a great difference.\nNarendra has known me since he was a child. But if I had not become enlightened he would not have asked me this question or raised this question to himself. Even the very idea of buddhahood might not have happened to him; he would have known me as a friend, he would have known me as a loving companion.\nIt is the enlightenment that changes the meaning of all his experiences, gives them a new color, a new light, a new luminosity. The same incidents start having a totally new meaning.\nI can understand your question, Narendra. Now you look backwards, but because now you know my enlightenment you can easily conclude that I was always enlightened, that I was born enlightened; otherwise those incidents of love, care, understanding would not have taken such a colorful and meaningful significance. That's why I say you are almost right.\nI myself can look retrospectively... then everything starts taking on a new meaning. It would not have had the same meaning. It is the alchemy of enlightenment that everything has become pure gold, that small and meaningless things have taken wings and have become great.\nI will give you a few examples which could not have been understood in the same way they have been understood; there was no possibility, no hope.\nOne of my teachers was very perfectionistic, a great disciplinarian, a very beautiful man.\nEvery year he started his class with the same introduction, because the students were new; he introduced himself by saying that, \"It is better that I should make clear to you what kind of man I am, so you are not in the dark and you don't do anything without understanding the nature of the teacher. First: I don't believe in headaches, stomachaches, no. Anything that you cannot prove and anything that I cannot check by myself will not be an excuse to take a holiday or to go home. You can have a fever, I can feel your fever.\nSo remember it -- I simply don't believe in headaches and stomachaches because there is no proof. Even a physician has to rely upon the patient, that he has a headache -- he may be lying, or he may be in illusion. What is the guarantee? How do you know that you are right?\"\nI said, \"This is strange; this is going to be difficult\" -- because those were simple excuses to escape from any class, to say that \"I have a strong headache and I want to go home.\"\nHe used to go every evening for a walk. Just by the side of the school there was a beautiful road, covered from both sides with big trees, mango trees.\nI said, \"Things have to be settled from the very beginning.\"\nSo I climbed up into a tree, high up, and waited for this teacher -- he was a Mohammedan, his name was Rahimuddin. He came exactly on time... He was very precise in everything; at exactly the same time each day he used to pass by that tree.\nI dropped a big mango on his head. He said, \"Ahhhh!\" and looked up. And he saw me there.\nI said, \"What is the matter? What has happened?\"\nFor a moment there was silence. He said, \"Come down.\" I came down.\nHe said, \"You have proved that there is something like a headache, but don't tell anybody. If you have a headache, you just raise one finger and I will give you a holiday.\nIf you have a stomachache, you need not prove it to me -- you just raise two fingers, because you seem to be dangerous!\"\nHe was a bachelor, an old man; he had never married. He lived a very beautiful life, had a small cottage, a garden.\nAnd he was very famous for one strange thing -- because he had enough money, unmarried, no children, no wife.… He had three hundred and sixty-five suits of clothes, one for each day; then for the whole year that suit of clothes would not be used again.\nNaturally every husband was jealous.\nHe said, \"I live alone. I sleep outside in the garden, and I don't want any proof for stomachache! -- so one is enough. You have given me the proof that you are capable, so when you have a stomachache raise two fingers and I will understand. But this is an agreement between us: that you will not tell anybody else that headaches or stomachaches exist.\"\nI said, \"I am not worried about anybody else. My problem is solved because I want things from the very beginning to be clear, just like you do.\"\nHe said, \"You have made it very clear -- it is still hurting! I have been a teacher thirty years and nobody ever thought of this idea. I will remember you for my whole life.\"\nIt was a small incident, and would have been forgotten -- but when people started coming to me many years after this incident he started telling people, \"I knew beforehand that this boy was going to be someone extraordinary.\"\nPeople asked, \"How did you come to know? -- and you never mentioned it before.\"\nHe said, \"I had almost forgotten it; just now, as his name is becoming known around the world and people are coming to him from all over the world, I remembered. And now that incident has a totally different meaning. Because for my whole life I was introducing every class in the same way and nobody ever tried anything. And this was the only one --\na singular instance -- who proved to me that a headache had to be accepted. I\nknew it that very day.\"\nIn 1970 I went to that village for the last time. He had become very old. Hearing that I was there, he came to see me. I said, \"I was going to come to you. You are too old, you should not have bothered to walk almost two miles.\"\nHe said, \"I am feeling so happy. Seeing you it still hurts, but now I feel a certain pride that you were my student.\"\nNow the whole thing takes a different color, it becomes a pride. Otherwise, if I had turned out to be a thief or a criminal, then the same incident would have been a proof: \"I knew from the very beginning that this boy was going to be a criminal, that sooner or later he would murder somebody.\"\nRetrospectively you always look at things in a way you would not have looked at them if life had moved in a different direction -- the same things. The same things would not have given you the same indications.\nBy the way, I would like to remind you that all autobiographies are false because they are all written retrospectively. A man becomes a Mahatma Gandhi and then he writes his autobiography in the light what he has become. He starts looking at things in the past when he was not Mahatma Gandhi, and everything now has to fit with Mahatma Gandhi.\nThere has to be a logical connection, a coherence. So it is as if you are reading a novel backwards -- things will be totally different.\nAll autobiographies are fictions. They should not be categorized separately in any library.\nThe science of librarianship should understand a simple fact: that every autobiography is a fiction.\nFor example the day Mahatma Gandhi's father died he was with his father massaging his feet, and the doctors had said that this was going to be the last night; there was no hope that this man would ever see the sunrise, before sunrise he would be gone. In the middle of the night, Mahatma Gandhi was massaging his father's feet, but he was thinking of his wife.\nThe father was dying. It was an absolute certainty that this was his last night, and\nhe had fallen asleep. Seeing that he was asleep, Mahatma Gandhi slipped silently into his wife's room, and while he was making love to his wife, his father died. And suddenly the whole house was awake. He heard the noise -- \"What is the matter?\" And he could not forgive himself, that even for one night he could not remain away from his wife when the death of his father was absolutely certain.\nIf he had not become a famous man, a world-famous man, this incident would not have carried any importance; perhaps he himself would have forgiven it, forgotten it -- just an ordinary incident.\nBut writing his autobiography, he connects it with the great mahatma that he became.\nAnd this is all fiction -- he says that he became concerned about celibacy because of this incident. He started thinking of brahmacharya, celibacy, because of this incident. This is not true, but he has to fit the incident into the life of a mahatma. And it fits perfectly well; anybody reading it will feel that there seems to be a certain connection. But it is not true, because all his four sons were born after this incident. So he cannot deceive me. He is deceiving himself, he is deceiving his followers, he is deceiving the historians. But if this was the cause of his becoming a celibate, then he would have remained without any children. All four sons were born after this incident, so this incident has nothing to do with celibacy.\nBut in his mind -- and in anybody's mind who is reading Mahatma Gandhi -- it seems relevant, that perhaps the shock was too much, as if \"I am guilty of the death of my father. I could have stayed a few more minutes, but my lust, my sexuality proved to be more powerful than my love and respect for my father. And my wife was going to remain with me for my whole life, but my father was going to disappear that very night into darkness and into the unknown and there would not be another meeting again.\"\nI have read many autobiographies, and I have seen how people when they look backwards look with the eyes that they have now, and with all the experience they have accumulated meanwhile. With all this experience, with these new eyes, the meaning of the incidents starts changing.\nNarendra, you have been with me from your very childhood.\nIf I had not become what I have become, you would have remembered me as\nloving, as friendly, but you would have never thought I was born as a buddha -- that idea arises now. It is my enlightenment that gives you the feeling that, \"My God, he was always loving.\" But it was not the same love.\nIn a sense, the dewdrop and the ocean are both water. But a dewdrop is a dewdrop, and an ocean is an ocean.\nWhat you had seen in me was only a dewdrop. Now that dewdrop looks like an ocean because now you are seeing the ocean. It is exactly as if you see the Ganges in the Himalayas at Gangotri -- it is just a small stream. You could not even hope that it would ever reach the ocean, it is so small. Hindus have placed a marble face of a cow there, and the Ganges falls from the mouth of the cow, it is such a small stream. You will find millions of streams in the Himalayas which are far bigger.\nBut if you see the same Ganges near Calcutta, in Gangasagar -- Gangasagar means the òcean of Ganges' -- it has become so big, so vast, so immense that it is difficult to think of it as a river; it looks oceanic. To connect the two is very difficult. The Ganges in Gangotri could have been one of those millions of streams which disappear in the forest, in the desert, and nobody would have remembered it. But because this stream became Gangasagar... retrospectively, looking backwards, even standing at the source where the stream is so small, you have the feeling of vastness, of potentiality, of all the possibilities that it is going to become. You cannot see it just like a small stream; it is the stream that is going to become Gangasagar.\nEach autobiography is fictitious; small incidents with no meaning in themselves suddenly start having meaning in the context of the person that has come to be.\nEssentially it is true: everybody is a buddha, and naturally I am not an exception. Please don't exclude me out. But this buddhahood is only a seed, and out of millions of seeds perhaps one seed comes to blossom. It indicates that every seed can come to blossom. It is a tremendous encouragement to every human being.\nIn this sense your seeing me as a born buddha is right, but don't forget your responsibility. It means you have to prove it too -- that you are also a born buddha.\nMaybe you started growing a little late.\nAnd in the eternity of time, what is \"late\"?\nThere are only seven days. Choose any day, but start.\nI am not interested at all to convert anybody to my ideology -- I don't have any. Secondly, I believe that the very effort to convert anybody is violence, it is interfering in his individuality, in his uniqueness, into his freedom.\nSo my function is not that of a teacher, not that of a prophet, not that of a savior, not that of a messenger. My function simply is that of a reminder. I want just to be a mirror to you so that you can see your original face.\nAnd if you can see a buddha in me, there is no difficulty in seeing the buddha in you too -\n- maybe a little lazy, a little sleepy, a little gone off the track.\nBut a buddha is a buddha. It does not matter whether his nuts and bolts are a little loose, we will fix them.\nOne's buddhahood is one's essential nature.\nI don't want you to worship buddhas, I want you to become buddhas. That is the only right worship.\nIf you love, become it. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nGAUTAM BUDDHA, MAHAVIRA, J. KRISHNAMURTI WERE TRAVELING\nFROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. IT WAS\nREPORTED ABOUT J. KRISHNAMURTI THAT BEFORE HE LEFT INDIA FOR\nCALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST TIME HE TOLD SOMEONE THAT IF THE\nDOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA SAID, \"NO MORE TRAVEL, NO MORE TALK,\" THEN\nALL WOULD BE FINISHED; HE WOULD BE GONE IN FOUR WEEKS -- AND\nTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\nOSHO, WHAT IS THE INSIGHT OF ALL THE MASTERS WHO WERE\nTRAVELING ALL THE TIME AND DIDN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE LIKE RAMAN\nMAHARSHI?\nRaman Maharshi is a mystic, but not a master.\nThe mystics have never traveled because the mystics are not making any effort of any kind to transfer their experience to others. They have decided that what they have experienced is untransferable, that it cannot be communicated.\nSo the mystics all through the ages have remained in one place. What is the point of moving around, going from village to village or country to country -- for what?\nThe mystic's experience is expressed in the ancient saying that \"The well remains in its own place; it is the thirsty who should go to the well, the well cannot go to the thirsty.\"\nBuddha, Mahavira, Bodhidharma, Shankara, Nagarjuna, Mohammed, Jesus, J. Krishnamurti, they were all traveling, going continuously.…\nMohammed has countered the proverb about the well and the thirsty, and countered it in such a beautiful way. He says, \"If the mountain cannot come to Mohammed, then Mohammed will go to the mountain.\"\nThese are masters.…\nNot that they are against the mystics; basically they agree that it is difficult,\nalmost impossible to communicate, to say anything about the truth, about self- realization. It is beyond words, beyond language; they agree on that point.\nBut still the masters say that some indirect ways can be always tried, and there is no harm.\nThere is no direct way of translating the inner experience into the outer languages, but ways can be found, devices can be created in which something may be said, may not be said, but may be heard.\nThe emphasis is not that the truth can be said. On that, the mystics and the masters agree: it cannot be said.\nBut the masters disagree with the mystics on one point: that it may not be said but it can be heard -- through the eyes of the master, through the presence of the master, through his love, through his compassion, through his silence, just being with him. Nothing is said, but somebody's heart may start dancing, a song may arise.\nIn the presence of the master, the disciple may become aware that the ordinary human life is not all there is; there is something more. Even to make them aware that there is something more -- greater peace, deeper silence, overflowing ecstasy -- perhaps they may start searching for it, perhaps they may become seekers. And what is the harm? If nobody listens, then too the effort is worth making.\nThe mystic and the master both have the same experience, but they have different views about its transfer -- and both seem to be right.\nMy own understanding is this: that the mystics are of a more ordinary variety. They come from the categories of human beings who are not articulate, who are not poets, who are not painters, who are not musicians, who are not dancers. They come from the common masses.\nAnd the master is more articulate, more talented. If he cannot say, he will paint; if he cannot say, he will sculpt; if he cannot say, he will dance; if he cannot say, he will sing --\nand singing, dancing, painting or any other creative art may become a vehicle for that which language is not capable of.\nAnd there are people who are articulate with language too; they can speak in such a way that through the words they can send the wordless message to you. The words will be only the packages; the content will be the wordless. The words will be only the containers. But for that, a very articulate person is needed, who can use language in such a way that it becomes music, that it becomes poetry, that it becomes silence... that it becomes not only that which it says but also that which remains unsaid.\nLanguage can become a vehicle -- now the emphasis will be on those who are listening.\nMuch will depend on those who are listening.\nSo the basic function of the master is first, to create disciples who can understand the wordless through the words... who can sit in silence but can become filled with immense serenity. Just in the presence of the master, something can start opening up in them -- as if the sun has risen and the birds start singing; nobody informs the birds that it is sunrise.\nThere are no alarm clocks for poor birds, but just the light... the darkness is gone, the night is over, and there is a celebration all over nature. Flowers suddenly start opening, there is fragrance all over.\nThe mystic has achieved, is fulfilled, has completed his journey. But he is not a very talented genius.\nThe master is doing overtime. His work is finished, but his genius, his talents demand expression.\nJ. Krishnamurti said, \"If I have to follow the doctor's advice and not speak and not travel then I cannot live more than four weeks.\" And within exactly four weeks he died. His work was complete; now he was living only for others. And if even that cannot be done then what is the point of being here unnecessarily? His boat had arrived long ago. He had been delaying his departure -- somebody may listen, somebody may hear, somebody may be touched. But if he cannot speak and cannot travel, then there is no reason at all for him to go on breathing. He is not an idiot.\nWhy did he say four weeks? -- because it is just the old momentum. For breathing and heartbeats to slow down and disappear, it takes nearabout three to\nfour weeks. And the older the man, the longer time it takes. If he had been younger, it may have been just one week.\nIt is a very strange phenomenon -- it is because the younger person's heart runs fast, it can exhaust the momentum quickly. The older man is already slow; his heart has become accustomed to a slow pace so it will take three to four weeks.\nTo be a mystic is rare, but to be a master is very rare.\nAnd to be a successful master... you will have to come to me! Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHENEVER I AM IN A SILENT SPACE I HEAR A SOUND -- SOMETHING LIKE\nÀUM' OR HUMMING. I LOVE THIS RHYTHMIC, SWEET, UNENDING SOUND.\nIN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES TOO, WHEN I AM TOTAL AND SILENT, THIS LISTENING HAPPENS.\nIS IT OKAY TO LISTEN AND ENJOY THIS SOUND, OR IS IT A PROJECTION OR\nDAYDREAMING? PLEASE GUIDE ME.\nFirst thing to remember: you should not repeat any sound as a mantra, as a chanting, because when you repeat you create -- then it is your mental projection.\nIf you are simply silent and you hear a certain humming, then it is the sound of existence.\nThat humming has been heard for centuries by meditators. That humming has been given a special name in the East, OM. It is not exactly OM but it is\nsomething similar.\nIt has to be remembered that in Sanskrit -- which is the oldest language in the world, the mother language of all civilized languages in existence -- they don't write OM in letters.\nThey have made a special symbol for it just to create a distinction, to indicate that it is not something to do with language, it is beyond language, and it is not part of the Sanskrit alphabet.\nThe way it is written is only with a symbol, and that symbol can be used by any language.\nSanskrit has no monopoly over it because it is not part of the alphabet of Sanskrit. It has been heard.…\nJainas, Buddhists, Hindus -- they differ in their theology on every single point, but they all have heard the sound OM. There is no question of differing; it is not a hypothesis and it is not a theory propounded by somebody.\nAnybody who becomes utterly silent... it is the silence itself singing, it is the song of silence.\nHence about OM Hindus, Jainas and Buddhists all agree. They begin their scriptures with\n\"om,\" they end their scriptures with \"om\" because that is the universal sound.\nThis has created a problem -- and there are many problems of a similar type -- because all the mystics in this country and in the far East have heard the sound OM. The people who read the scriptures start thinking that, \"If OM is the sound of the nature of existence itself, then if we repeat òm' we will be able to hear it soon.\" It is logical, but it is not realistic.\nIf you repeat it, you will never hear the real thing; you will go on repeating, and you may start hearing your own repetition.\nIn Tibet, where the greatest work has been done on this \"soundless sound,\" as they call it, they have made a special instrument. It is a certain kind of metal pot made with special proportions of different metals, and a small rod -- again made\nof different proportions of different metals. You put the rod against the rim of the pot, and you move it fast and it creates a certain humming. That is something closer to the existential sound than OM.\nIn every lamasery in Tibet you will hear that sound -- somebody, some lama is continuously making it. When he leaves, then somebody else... twenty-four hours a day that sound is created, but that is a man-made sound. It is similar, but it is not the same.\nHindus in India have fallen into the same fallacy. They have made òm' their most significant mantra; just repeat it continuously inside so your whole being is filled with the sound of \"om, om, om.\" You are deceiving yourself; this is your sound.\nSo if you are not creating it, then there is no need for any anxiety.\nIf the moment you become silent you hear it, then it is a tremendous blessing. It means you have gone very deep into the existential world of serenity.\nBut don't try to deceive existence. You can go on chanting \"om\" your whole life; it is meaningless, it has nothing to do with existence. With existence you have to be a listener, absolutely passive, relaxed, in a let-go. Don't impose yourself. You are the only barrier, your impositions are your only sins. Just remain utterly passive in a non-doing witnessing, listening to whatever is happening, allowing it to happen.\nIt is perfectly good, and of great significance. On the path, if you start hearing OM, you are accepted, you are welcomed. You need not seek anywhere, you have found the door.\nJust relax more, and leave everything in the hands of existence... a total trust and a complete passivity.\nYour absence is the presence of godliness.\nThe moment you are not, the miracle has happened. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER NIGHT YOU POINTED OUT THAT JESUS, MARX AND FREUD\nWERE PERHAPS THE WORLD'S GREATEST BUSINESSMEN.\nON OCCASION I HAVE HEARD YOU CALL YOURSELF AN OLD JEW. OSHO, WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS?\nMilarepa, I am a silent partner. Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSINCE SANNYAS IN 1981 PEOPLE HAVE CONTINUALLY BEEN SEEING JESUS\nCHRIST IN ME! WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THIS GUY?\nSatsanga, it is dangerous. You cut off your beard! Otherwise, they will cut off your head!\nJesus! -- they see Jesus Christ in you? Then crucifixion is not far away. The first thing out of this hall you cut your beard, and if they recognize you even then, keep a small board hanging on your neck that says, \"I am not Jesus Christ.\"\nYou have to make it clear; otherwise your life is in danger. Beyond Enlightenment\nChapter #27\nChapter title: Whatsoever happens in silence is your friend 30 October 1986 pm in\nArchive code: 8610305\nShortTitle:\nENLIGH27\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n105\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHIRTEEN YEARS AGO I LEFT THE WORLD, DEADLY WOUNDED, AND CAME\nTO YOU. YOU HEALED ME AND GAVE ME BACK EVEN MORE THAN LIFE.\nTHEN ONE YEAR AGO I WENT BACK TO THAT SAME WORLD I HAD\nESCAPED FROM, FEELING LIKE A CHILD JUST OUT OF KINDERGARTEN, WHO BARELY KNOWS THE ABC. NATURALLY THERE WERE DARK\nMOMENTS. DURING THOSE MOMENTS AN INNER VOICE -- WAS IT YOUR\nVOICE, OSHO? -- KEPT HAMMERING AT ME, \"DON'T GET LOST IN YOUR\nEMOTIONS -- WATCH!\" FOR MONTHS THIS VOICE BECAME MY\nCONSTANT\nCOMPANION UNTIL SUDDENLY A REALIZATION HAPPENED TO ME: THAT\nTHE DARKNESS AND THE CONFLICT WERE CREATED BY MY OWN FEARS, DESIRES, JUDGEMENTS. THIS GLIMPSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A CALM, RELAXED FEELING OF FREEDOM AND ACCEPTANCE.\nNOW, EXPERIENCING AGAIN THE OVERWHELMING BEAUTY OF SITTING AT\nYOUR FEET, I CAN SEE THAT NO MATTER HOW LONG I WATCH, THIS DESIRE TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE WILL REMAIN WITH ME.\nBELOVED OSHO, IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE NOT TO LONG FOR SOMETHING\nSO UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL?\nLalita, the spiritual path has many crossroads.\nOn each crossroad, one feels as if one has arrived. In a certain way it is true, too. It is a certain blessing which was never known before, a peace that is absolutely new, a silence undreamt of, and a love, the fragrance of which one has desired, longed for for lives and has never found. Naturally one feels the home has come.\nThis is one of the most difficult tasks for the master -- to push you on, to say to you,\n\"This is only the beginning; there is much more waiting for you.\" And although it is inconceivable to you that there can be anything more than this, the trust, the love, the devotion towards the master helps you to move.\nThese moments come again and again. Each time it becomes in a way more difficult, in a way easier. It is difficult in the sense that each new realization, new achievement, new revelation is so vast, so absorbing, that everything you have known before simply fades away -- so it becomes more difficult to move on. But on the other hand, it becomes easier to move on because each time the master\nhas said to you, \"Move on\" you have always gained more; it has never been a loss, it has always been a new door to a new mystery, a new sky beyond the old one.\nSo the trust also has increased. It is easier now to listen to the master and move on.\nAn ancient story... I have always loved it. An old woodcutter, poor, alone, had only one way to earn his everyday bread and that was by cutting wood and selling it. As he came into the forest, just near the entrance under a beautiful bodhi tree -- the same tree under which Gautam Buddha became enlightened; hence the name of the tree has becomèbodhi tree'. Bodhi means enlightenment.\nBy the way, you will be surprised to know, scientists have found that the bodhi tree has a certain chemical which no other tree has, and that chemical is absolutely necessary for the growth of intelligence. Perhaps it is a very intelligent, sensitive tree. It may not have been just a coincidence.…\nThe woodcutter would see this old man sitting silently, always there -- summer, winter, rain. He would touch his feet before entering the forest, and every time he would do that the old man would smile and say, \"You are such an idiot.\"\nThe woodcutter would be shocked: \"Why? -- I touch his feet, but rather than giving me a blessing, he simply smiles and says, `You are such an idiot.'\"\nOne day he gathered courage and asked, \"What do you mean?\"\nThe old man said, \"I mean that you have been cutting trees in this forest for your whole life, and if you go just a little deeper into it you will find a copper mine. Only an idiot could miss it! Your whole life you have been in this forest... you can collect the copper and that will be enough for seven days' comfortable living, no need to cut wood every day in your old age.\"\nThe man could not believe it because he knew the whole forest -- \"He must be joking!\"\nBut perhaps he was right... and there was no harm in going a little further and being alert and watching to see whether there was some copper mine.\nAnd he went in, and he found a copper mine. He said, \"Now I know why he was\ncontinually saying, `You are such an idiot, working every day in your old age.'\"\nNow he was going only once every week. But the old tradition continued: he would touch his feet, and the old man would smile and say, `You are such an idiot!'\"\n\"But,\" he said, \"now this is not right! Because I have found the copper mine.\"\nThe old man said, \"You don't know. If you go a little further, you will find a silver mine.\"\nHe said, \"My God, why didn't you tell me before?\"\nThe old man said, \"You didn't believe me even about the copper mine -- how could you have believed about the silver mine? Just go a little further.\"\nThis time there was suspicion but not so much; there was a certain trust arising. And he found the silver mine.\nHe came back and he said, \"Now I have found silver enough that I will be coming only once in a month. I will miss you very much. I will miss your blessing very much. I have started loving to hear from you, `What an idiot you are.'\"\nBut the old man said, \"You are still an idiot, it makes no difference.\" The woodcutter said, \"Even though I have found the silver mine?\"\nHe said, \"Yes, even then. You are just an idiot and nothing more -- because if you go just a little deeper there is gold. So don't wait for a month, come tomorrow.\"\nNow he thought he must be joking. If there is gold, why should he be sitting here under this tree in old rags, with no shelter from the rain, no shelter from the sun, depending on people who bring food to him... sometimes they bring it, sometimes they don't...\" And if he knows where the gold is, I don't think... this time he is certainly joking! But there is no harm. He has always been right. Who knows? This old guy is a little mysterious.\"\nHe went further and found a big gold mine. He could not believe his own eyes --\nthis is the forest he has been working in for his whole life, and this is the forest where that old man is sitting.…\nHe brought much gold, and he said, \"I think you will not say anymore that I am an idiot.\"\nHe said, \"I will continue. Come tomorrow because this is not the end; this is only the beginning.\"\nHe said, \"What? Gold is just a beginning?\"\nHe said, \"Come tomorrow. Just a little deeper in the forest you will find diamonds -- but that too is not the end. But I will not tell you too much; otherwise you will not be able to sleep tonight. Just go home. Tomorrow morning, first you find the diamonds, and then come to me.\"\nHe really could not sleep the whole night. A poor woodcutter... he could not imagine that he was going to become the owner of all these mines -- gold and silver and copper, and now diamonds! And the old man was saying this was only the beginning. He thought and thought... what can be more than diamonds?\nIn the morning he went very early -- the old man was asleep. He touched his feet. The old man opened his eyes and said, \"Have you come? I knew you would come, you couldn't sleep. First go and see the diamonds.\"\nThe woodcutter said, \"Can you tell me what can be more?\"\nHe said, \"First find the diamonds -- step by step; otherwise, you will go crazy.\"\nHe found the diamonds and he came dancing to the old man. He said, \"Now you cannot say that Ì am an idiot. I have found the diamonds!\"\nBut the old man said, \"Still, you are an idiot.\"\nHe said, \"Now I will not leave you unless you explain it to me.\"\nThe old man said, \"You can see that I know all about these mines -- silver, gold, diamonds -- and I don't care about them. Because there is something more which is not in the forest but within you, just a little deeper -- not outside but inside. And because I have found that, I don't care about all these diamonds. Now it is\nup to you: you can stop your journey at the diamonds but remember, you will remain an idiot. And I am a proof --\nbecause I know about all these mines and I have not bothered with them. This can make you understand that there is something more which is never found outside however far you go; it is found inside you.\"\nThe man dropped the diamonds. He said, \"I am going to sit by your side. Unless you drop this idea that I am an idiot, I am not going to move from here!\"\nHe was a simple, innocent woodcutter.\nIt is difficult for knowledgeable people to go in.\nIt was not difficult for the woodcutter. Soon he was entering into a deep silence -\n- a joy, a blissfulness, a benediction.\nAnd the old man shook him and said, \"This is the place. Now you need not go into the forest. And I withdraw my word ìdiotàbout you, you have become a wise man. You can open your eyes. You will see the same world but not in the same light; the same colors, but now they have become psychedelic; the same people, but they are no longer just skeletons covered with skin, they are luminous spiritual beings... the same cosmos, but for the first time it is an ocean of consciousness.\"\nThe woodcutter opened his eyes.\nHe said, \"You are a strange fellow. Why did you wait so long? I have been coming here almost my whole life and I have seen you sitting under this tree. You could have said this any day.\"\nThe old man said, \"I was waiting for the right moment... for the ripe moment, for the time when you would be able not only to hear but to understand it. The journey is short, but you should not stop at every achievement. Because every achievement is so fulfilling that your imagination cannot think there can be more than this.\"\nLalita, you are asking me what can be more beautiful than to be in the presence of the master. Why not dissolve in the presence? To be in the presence of the master, there is still separation. Why be in the presence? Why not become the\npresence itself? And only then you will know that to be in the presence was only the beginning of a journey that ends in becoming the presence.\nI know you, and I know your heart. I have not told the story of the woodcutter without remembering the fact that you have such an innocent heart yourself.\nJust don't stop anywhere.\nIt is possible... make it your realization. Become the light yourself, and then whatever is experienced is inexpressible.\nIn your dark moments, while you have been away for one year, you have heard the word\n`watch'. With your innocent mind, it is very simple for me to speak to you from any distance, a heart-to-heart communion. Those words were mine, and you have recognized them. Because there are things you need not bother about, you simply have to watch and they pass on -- anger, greed, jealousy. All the components of darkness have one quality in common: that if you can watch them they start dispersing. Watching is enough; you are not supposed to do anything with them.\nIn the life of one of the great mystics, Baal Shem, there is an incident. He used to go towards the river in the middle of the night just to be in absolute silence, alone, to enjoy the peace and the beauty of the night. Just on the bank of the river was a rich man's mansion, and a watchman was there who was puzzled about this man, Baal Shem. Every night, exactly as the tower bell was tolling twelve, Baal Shem would appear out of the darkness.\nThe poor watchman could not contain the temptation to inquire, \"Why do you come here every night and sit next to the river in the darkness? What is the purpose of it?\"\nRather than answering him, Baal Shem asked, \"What is your work?\" He said, \"I am a watchman.\"\nBaal Shem said, \"Exactly -- that is my work. I am a watchman.\"\nThe watchman said, \"That is strange. If you are a watchman, then what are you\ndoing here? You should be watching the house where you are the watchman.\"\nBaal Shem said, \"There is something to be explained to you: You watch somebody else's house; I watch my own house. This is my house. Wherever I go, I go with my house --\nbut I am continuously the watchman.\" I love the story.\nBe continuously a watchman of all dark moments. They will pass away. In fact, that is the definition: anything you watch, if it disappears by watching that means it was something wrong. If by watching it becomes more clear, closer, that means it was something to be absorbed.\nThere is no other definition of good and bad.\nIt is watching that decides -- the only criterion. What is sin and what is virtue? That which disappears is sin, and that which comes closer, becomes clearer, wants to become part of you, is virtue.\nWatching is certainly the golden key of spiritual life. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY YOU TALKED SO BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THE SADNESS\nWHICH FOLLOWS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF OUR INNERMOST SILENCE.\nIS IT NECESSARILY SO, THAT WHEN I FIRST EXPERIENCE THIS SILENCE, I ALSO FEEL WITH MY WHOLE BEING THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY ALONE ON\nMY JOURNEY?\nAloneness is also one of the fundamental experiences as you enter silence.\nIn silence there is nobody else, you are simply alone.\nThe deeper your silence will be, thoughts will be gone, emotions will be gone, sentiments will be gone -- just pure being, a flame of light, burning alone.\nOne can get scared because we are so much accustomed to living with people -- in the crowd, in the marketplace, in all kinds of relationships.\nYou may not be aware that in all these relationships -- with friends, with your husbands, with your wives, with your children, with your parents -- you are basically trying to avoid the experience of aloneness. These are strategies so that you are always with somebody.\nIt is a well-known fact, psychologically established, that if a person is left alone in isolation, after seven days he starts talking... a little like whispering. For seven days he keeps talking inside, keeps himself engaged in the mind, but then it becomes too much --\nthings start coming out of his mind through his mouth and he starts whispering.\nAfter fourteen days you can hear him clearly, what he is saying. After twenty- one days he does not bother about anybody, he has gone insane; now he is talking to walls, to pillars,\n\"Hello friend, how are you?\" -- to a pillar, hugging a pillar! And this is true not about somebody special, it is true about everybody. He is trying to find some relationship. If he cannot find it in reality, he will create a hallucination.\nYou will see: just stand by the side of the road and watch people going from the office to the house, and you will be surprised. They are alone -- although there is a crowd all around -- but they are talking to themselves. They are making gestures, they are telling somebody something... because the crowd around them is not related to them. They are alone in the crowd, so they are trying to create their own illusion. Maybe they are talking to their wife, to their boss -- there are many things which cannot be said but right now they can say them. In front of the wife they cannot say it, but in this crowd, where everybody is engaged in his own thing, everybody is doing his own thing, they can say things to the wife. Nobody is listening, and at least one thing is certain -- the wife is not there! But they need the wife, they need someone to talk to.\nAnd after thirty days of isolation, a dramatic change happens: it is not only one- sided; it is not only that they are talking to the pillar, the pillar also starts talking to them! They do both things: first, \"Hello, how are you?\" and then, \"I am good. I am fine, doing well.\"\nThey answer from the side of the pillar too -- in a different voice. Now they have created a world of their own, they are no longer alone. No madman is alone.\nEither you are mad or not. If you don't know aloneness, there is something of madness in you.\nOnly pure aloneness gives you a clean sanity. You don't need the other; the dependence on the other is no more there, you are enough unto yourself. Language is meaningless because language is a medium to relate with the other. The moment you are no longer dependent on the other, language is meaningless, words are meaningless.\nIn your silence -- when there are no words, no language, nobody else is present -\n- you are getting in tune with existence. This serenity, this silence, this aloneness will bring you immense rewards.\nIt will allow you to grow to your full potential. For the first time you will be an individual, for the first time you will have the touch and the taste of freedom, and for the first time the immensity, the unboundedness of existence will be yours with all its blissfulness.\nSo whatever happens in silence -- either sadness or aloneness -- remember, in silence nothing wrong can ever happen. Whatever happens is going to enhance the beauty of it, deepen the charm of it; anything that happens will bring more and more flowers, more and more fragrance to it.\nRejoice! Whatever happens in silence is your friend, it is really your bosom friend. It is going to take you to the ultimate peak of ecstasies.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU -- EVERYTHING IS VERY\nGOOD. ONLY ONE THING IS CONFUSING ME A LITTLE. YOU HAVE OFTEN\nSPOKEN ABOUT THE \"CHOSEN FEW.\" PLEASE, WHO IS DOING THE CHOOSING?\nIt is a very difficult question.\nIn the beginning, God used to do it! But there are many hypotheses about what happened to God: some say he died a natural death, some say he committed suicide, some say he got into an accident. Some say he was murdered by man -- because without murdering him, man could not really be free.\nI will not go into what happened to God. One thing is certain: he is missing.\nIn the beginning, he had chosen the Jews to be the chosen few -- \"God's own people.\" But since then, he has had no opportunity. Although Jews have been praying continuously in every synagogue all over the world, \"Now it is time for you to choose somebody else; we have suffered enough!\"\nAnd it is true. If God had not chosen them they would have lived just like everybody else.\nBut because he chose them, he made everybody else their enemies -- great jealousy and competition.\nI remember that once, India's first prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was asked,\n\"Who are you going to choose as your successor?\"\nHe said, \"I am not going to choose anyone, because whoever I choose would have to face immense difficulties. Everybody else who is ambitious and wants to become the prime minister would all be together against one single person, and there would be no possibility for that person I have chosen to succeed me. So I will keep my mouth shut.\"\nAnd you are asking who is choosing here?\nHere, it is a very different process. Here, the moment you become a sannyasin you have chosen yourself.\nEvery sannyasin belongs to the chosen few, and nobody is doing the choosing -- it is you who are doing it; hence there is a freedom. If you feel difficulties, you can drop out of it.\nNobody prevents you from becoming a sannyasin, nobody prevents you from dropping sannyas. Your freedom is intact.\nSo remember: here, nobody is choosing. Everybody is choosing by becoming a sannyasin. So no need to kill me; I have learned from the lesson of God -- I will never choose anybody, because it is dangerous! And to choose anybody is to put him in difficulty.\nNow Jews have suffered so much in four thousand years for the single reason that they were the chosen few. All over the earth, nobody else has suffered so much. It gave them a superiority complex, a feeling that they are holier than thou\n-- and naturally nobody likes people who think themselves holier than thou.\nSo in every country, in every place, they have been put down and given evidence that they are not holier or higher.\nJust in Germany alone Adolf Hitler killed six million Jews. The responsibility lies with God, because the reason these Jews were coming into conflict with Adolf Hitler was that he was saying that the nordic Germans were the highest race. Jews have to be completely eradicated from the earth because as long as the Jews remain, you cannot proclaim that nordic Germans are the highest. Jews are an old race, with a four-thousand-year history, and they have proved in every way that they are more intelligent. No Jew is a beggar; they are all rich, they know how to produce wealth. They are all cultured and well educated. Forty percent of Nobel prizes go to Jews, and the other sixty percent to the rest of the world -- it is simply unimaginable.\nIt was difficult for Adolf Hitler in the presence of Jews, because they had all the intelligence, all the riches, everything that proved that they were somehow more intelligent than others.\nTo make the nordic Germans a superior race, Jews had to be completely eradicated from the earth.\nThe fault lies with God; he should not have chosen the poor Jews. And even if he had chosen them, he should have whispered in the ear of Moses and told him, \"Please don't tell anybody. Just keep it in your mind that you are the chosen few\n-- but it should not leak out, it is a secret.\"\nBut there is no joy if it is a secret. The joy is when you proclaim it.\nHere I am not proclaiming anybody as chosen, but I am giving you an opportunity. If you want to be chosen, there will be difficulties. My sannyasins everywhere are going through all the difficulties.\nOne has to pay for everything. You want to be the chosen few for free? -- it is not possible. You will have to pay for it.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nOFTEN, IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE SPOKEN ON DOUBT AND THE VALUE OF\nDOUBTING EVERYTHING.\nON THE LEVEL WHERE YOU ARE MY MASTER AND I, THROUGH YOUR\nGRACE, HAVE BECOME YOUR DISCIPLE, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY\nDOUBT. FORGETFULNESS ON MY PART, YES; UNAWARENESS ON MY PART, YES -- BUT NEVER THE TORMENT OF DOUBT.\nBELOVED MASTER, COULD YOU SPEAK ON DOUBT IN THE RELATIONSHIP\nOF THE DISCIPLE WITH THE MASTER?\nThere is no possibility.\nA disciple becomes a disciple only when he drops all doubts. So in the very nature of things, a disciple cannot doubt.\nIf he doubts, he is not a disciple.\nAs a student he can doubt as much as he wants. When all his doubts are finished and a trust beyond doubt has arisen, he enters into the world of disciplehood; now there is no possibility of doubt arising. If it arises, the disciple immediately falls back into the category of student.\nSo as far as the master and discipleship is concerned, doubt is an impossibility. Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHY DO YOU ALWAYS LOOK IN YOUR HAND BEFORE YOU START\nANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION? DO I SEE IT WRONGLY, OR DO YOU\nFIND THE ANSWER THERE?\nMy hands are empty.\nI don't have any answer.\nYou have questions; I don't answer you, I simply destroy your questions. And before destroying your questions I have to look at my hand because it is not only with my language that I destroy your questions, it is also with my hands.\nSo I have to prepare them, to ask \"Are you ready?\" When they say, \"Yes, master, go ahead\" I start!\nWithout my hands, I cannot answer you. They do almost most of the work. My words keep you engaged, and they go on doing the real work.\nSo you are not seeing wrongly; you are seeing absolutely right.\nI look at them -- not for answers, but just to see whether they are ready or not. Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE TO YOU. WHEN I AM\nSITTING HERE WITH YOU I FEEL MY HEART IN TUNE WITH YOUR HEART, I FEEL A DEEP LOVE FOR YOU. BUT I ALSO FEEL MY OUTER SERIOUSNESS.\nWHY IS LAUGHTER SO DIFFICULT FOR ME?\nLaughter is one of the things most repressed by society all over the world, in all the ages.\nSociety wants you to be serious. Parents want their children to be serious, teachers want their students to be serious, the bosses want their servants to be serious, the commanders want their armies to be serious. Seriousness is required of everybody.\nLaughter is dangerous and rebellious.\nWhen the teacher is teaching you and you start laughing, it will be taken as an insult.\nYour parents are saying something to you and you start laughing -- it will be taken as an insult.\nSeriousness is thought to be honor, respect.\nNaturally laughter has been repressed so much that even though life all around is hilarious, nobody is laughing. If your laughter is freed from its chains, from its bondage, you will be surprised -- on each step there is something hilarious happening.\nLife is not serious.\nOnly graveyards are serious, death is serious. Life is love, life is laughter, life is dance, song.\nBut we will have to give life a new orientation. The past has crippled life very badly, it has made you almost laughter blind, just like there are people who are colorblind.\nThere are ten percent of people who are colorblind -- it is a big percentage, but they are not aware that they are colorblind.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was colorblind, and he came to know it when he was sixty years old. On his birthday somebody sent a present, a beautiful suit, a coat, but the person forgot to send a tie. So Bernard Shaw went with his secretary to find a matching tie. He liked the suit very much. He looked at ties and he chose one, and the secretary was surprised; she could not believe it -- because the suit was yellow and the tie was green.\nShe said, \"What are you doing? This will look very strange.\" He said, \"Why will it look strange? It is the same color.\"\nThe manager, the salesman... they all gathered, and they tried in many ways to find out.…\nHe could not distinguish between yellow and green; they both appeared the same to him.\nHe was colorblind.\nBut for sixty years he was not aware of it.\nAnd there are ten percent of people in the world who are colorblind. Some color they are missing, or maybe they are mixing it up with some other color.\nThe constant repression of laughter has made you laughter blind.\nSituations are happening everywhere, but you cannot see that there is any reason to laugh.\nIf your laughter is freed from its bondage, the whole world will be full of laughter. It needs to be full of laughter; it will change almost everything in human life.\nYou will not be as miserable as you are. In fact, you are not as miserable as you look -- it is misery plus seriousness that makes you look so miserable. Just misery plus laughter, and you will not look so miserable!\nIn one apartment house... And modern apartments have such thin walls that whether you want to or not, you have to hear what is going on on the other side of the wall. In a way, it is very human.\nThe whole apartment house was puzzled about one thing.… Every couple was fighting, throwing pillows, throwing things, breaking cups and saucers, shouting at each other, husbands beating wives, wives screaming -- and they don't need any loudspeaker systems or anything, and the whole apartment house enjoyed.\nThe only problem was with one sardarji. From his flat they never heard any fight; on the contrary, they always heard laughter. The whole crowd was puzzled: \"What is the matter?\nThese people never fight. There is always laughter -- and both are laughing so loudly that the whole building can hear it!\"\nOne day they decided that it had to be looked into: \"We are missing so much, and they are enjoying so much. What is their secret?\"\nSo they caught hold of the sardarji as he was coming from the market, carrying vegetables and other things. They all caught hold of him and they said, \"First you have to tell us that what the secret is -- why do you laugh when everybody fights?\"\nThe sardar said, \"Don't force me, because the secret is very embarrassing.\"\nThey said, \"Embarrassing? But we thought you are doing great. We always hear laughter\n-- either you laugh or your wife laughs... no fight.\"\nThe sardar said, \"What happens is, she throws things at me. If she misses, then I\nlaugh; if she hits me then she laughs. The same things are going on, but it is just that we have made a different arrangement -- what is the point? So I have learned how to dodge her, and she is learning how to \"\nAfter twenty years the same sardar wanted to divorce his wife. The magistrate had heard about them, that this was the only couple in the whole city who had never been known to fight. They simply laugh -- the whole city knows them as the laughing couple.\nThe magistrate said, \"What has gone wrong? You are so famous.\"\nThe sardar said, \"Forget all about that -- just give us permission to divorce.\" But the magistrate said, \"I have to know the reason.\"\nHe said, \"The reason is very clear -- she hits me. And it is too much; I have been getting those hits for years.\"\nThe magistrate asked, \"How long have you been married?\" He said, \"Almost thirty years.\"\nThe magistrate said, \"If you have been able to cope with the woman for thirty years, then just ten, twenty years more \"\nHe said, \"That is not the point. At first I used to dodge, but now she has become such a good... there is no way that I can dodge! So only she laughs, I have not laughed for ten years. This is unbearable. In the beginning it was perfect; it was almost fifty-fifty, there was no problem. I was laughing, she was also laughing. But now a hundred percent of the time she laughs, and a hundred percent I am just standing there, looking like a fool. No, I cannot tolerate it any more.\"\nJust look around at life and try to see the humorous side of things.\nEvery event that is happening has its own humorous side, you just need a sense of humor.\nNo religion has accepted the sense of humor as a quality.\nI want a sense of humor to be a fundamental quality of a good man, of a moral\nman, of a religious man. And it does not need much looking; you just try to see it, and everywhere.…\nOnce I was traveling in a bus when I was a student. The bus conductor was in trouble because there were thirty-one passengers and he had money only for thirty tickets. So he was asking, \"Who is the fellow who has not given his money?\"\nNobody would speak.\nHe said, \"This is strange; now how am I going to find out?\"\nI said to him, \"Do one thing: tell the driver to stop the bus, and tell the people that unless the person who has not given the money confesses, the bus will not move.\"\nHe said, \"That's right.\"\nThe bus was stopped. Everybody looked at each other, now what to do? Nobody knew who the person was.…\nFinally one man stood up and said, \"Forgive me, I am the person who has not given the money. Here it is.\"\nThe bus conductor asked, \"What is your name?\"\nHe said, \"My name is Achchelal.\" Achchelal means \"a good man.\"\nAnd I was surprised that out of thirty people, nobody laughed! When he said \"Achchelal\"\nI could not believe it -- a \"good man\" doing such a thing... and nobody seemed to see the humor in it.\nSeriousness has become almost part of our bones and blood. You will have to make some effort to get rid of seriousness, and you will have to be on the lookout -- wherever you can find something humorous happening, don't miss the opportunity.\nEverywhere there are people who are slipping on banana peels -- just nobody is\nlooking at them. In fact, it is thought to be ungentlemanly. It is not, because only bananas slip on banana peels.\nLaughter needs a great learning, and laughter is a great medicine. It can cure many of your tensions, anxieties, worries; the whole energy can flow into laughter. And there is no need that there should be some occasion, some cause.\nIn my meditation camps I used to have a laughing meditation: for no reason, people would sit and just start laughing. At first they would feel a little awkward that there was no reason -- but when everybody is doing it... they would also start. Soon, everybody was in such a great laughter, people were rolling on the ground. They were laughing at the very fact that so many people were laughing for no reason at all; there was nothing, not even a joke had been told. And it went on like waves.\nSo there is no harm... even just sitting in your room, close the doors and have one hour of simple laughter. Laugh at yourself.\nBut learn to laugh.\nSeriousness is a sin, and it is a disease.\nLaughter has tremendous beauty, a lightness. It will bring lightness to you, and it will give you wings to fly.\nAnd life is so full of opportunities. You just need the sensitivity. And create chances for other people to laugh. Laughter should be one of the most valued, cherished qualities of human beings -- because only man can laugh, no animals are capable of it.\nBecause it is human, it must be of the highest order. To repress it is to destroy a human quality.\nBeyond Enlightenment Chapter #28\nChapter title: Unless the whole existence... 31 October 1986 pm in\nArchive code:\n8610315\nShortTitle:\nENLIGH28\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n119\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU HAVE RECENTLY SAID THAT MOST OF HUMANITY IS VEGETATING, NOT LIVING. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US THE ART OF LIVING SO THAT DEATH\nMAY BECOME ALSO A CELEBRATION.\nSuraj Prakash, man is born to achieve life, but it all depends on him.\nHe can miss it. He can go on breathing, he can go on eating, he can go on growing old, he can go on moving towards the grave -- but this is not life. This is gradual death from the cradle to the grave, a seventy-year-long gradual death.\nAnd because millions of people around you are dying in this gradual, slow death,\nyou also start imitating them. Children learn everything from those who are around them, and we are surrounded by the dead.\nSo first we have to understand what I mean by `life'. It must not be simply growing old.\nIt must be growing up.\nAnd these are two different things.\nGrowing old, any animal is capable of. Growing up is the prerogative of human beings.\nOnly a few claim the right.\nGrowing up means moving every moment deeper into the principle of life; it means going farther away from death -- not towards death. The deeper you go into life, the more you understand the immortality within you. You are going away from death; a moment comes when you can see that death is nothing but changing clothes, or changing houses, changing forms -- nothing dies, nothing can die.\nDeath is the greatest illusion there is.\nFor growing up, just watch a tree. As the tree grows up, its roots are growing down, deeper. There is a balance: the higher the tree goes, the deeper the roots will go. You cannot have a tree one hundred and fifty feet high with small roots; they could not support such a huge tree.\nIn life, growing up means growing deep within yourself -- that's where your roots are.\nTo me, the first principle of life is meditation. Everything else comes second. And childhood is the best time. As you grow older, it means you are coming closer to death, and it becomes more and more difficult to go into meditation.\nMeditation means going into your immortality, going into your eternity, going into your godliness.\nAnd the child is the most qualified person because he is still unburdened by knowledge, unburdened by religion, unburdened by education, unburdened by all kinds of rubbish.\nHe is innocent.\nBut unfortunately his innocence is being condemned as ignorance. Ignorance and innocence have a similarity, but they are not the same. Ignorance is also a state of not knowing, just as innocence is. But there is a great difference too, which has been overlooked by the whole of humanity up to now. Innocence is not knowledgeable -- but it is not desirous of being knowledgeable either. It is utterly content, fulfilled.\nA small child has no ambitions, he has no desires. He is so absorbed in the moment -- a bird on the wing catches his eye so totally; just a butterfly, its beautiful colors, and he is enchanted; the rainbow in the sky... and he cannot conceive that there can be anything more significant, richer than this rainbow. And the night full of stars, stars beyond stars.…\nInnocence is rich, it is full, it is pure.\nIgnorance is poor, it is a beggar -- it wants this, it wants that, it wants to be knowledgeable, it wants to be respectable, it wants to be wealthy, it wants to be powerful.\nIgnorance moves on the path of desire. Innocence is a state of desirelessness.\nBut because they both are without knowledge, we have remained confused about their natures. We have taken it for granted that they are both the same.\nThe first step in the art of living will be to create a demarcation line between ignorance and innocence. Innocence has to be supported, protected -- because the child has brought with him the greatest treasure, the treasure that sages find after arduous effort. Sages have said that they become children again, that they are reborn.\nIn India the real brahmin, the real knower, has called himself dwij, twice born. Why twice born? What happened to the first birth? What is the need of the\nsecond birth? And what is he going to gain in the second birth? In the second birth he is going to gain what was available in the first birth but the society, the parents, the people surrounding him crushed it, destroyed it.\nEvery child is being stuffed with knowledge. His simplicity has to be somehow removed, because simplicity is not going to help him in this competitive world. His simplicity will look to the world as if he is a simpleton; his innocence will be exploited in every possible way. Afraid of the society, afraid of the world we have created ourselves, we try to make every child be clever, cunning, knowledgeable -- to be in the category of the powerful, not in the category of the oppressed and the powerless.\nAnd once the child starts growing in the wrong direction, he goes on moving that way --\nhis whole life moves in that direction.\nWhenever you understand that you have missed life, the first principle to be brought back is innocence. Drop your knowledge, forget your scriptures, forget your religions, your theologies, your philosophies. Be born again, become innocent -- and it is in your hands.\nClean your mind of all that is not known by you, of all that is borrowed, all that has come from tradition, convention, all that has been given to you by others -- parents, teachers, universities. Just get rid of it.\nOnce again be simple, once again be a child. And this miracle is possible by meditation.\nMeditation is simply a strange surgical method which cuts you away from all that is not yours and saves only that which is your authentic being. It burns everything else and leaves you standing naked, alone under the sun, in the wind. It is as if you are the first man who has descended onto earth -- who knows nothing, who has to discover everything, who has to be a seeker, who has to go on a pilgrimage.\nThe second principle is the pilgrimage.\nLife must be a seeking -- not a desire, but a search; not an ambition to become\nthis, to become that, a president of a country or a prime minister of a country, but a search to find out \"Who am I?\"\nIt is very strange that people who don't know who they are, are trying to become somebody. They don't even know who they are right now! They are unacquainted with their being -- but they have a goal of becoming.\nBecoming is the disease of the soul. Being is you.\nAnd to discover your being is the beginning of life. Then each moment is a new discovery, each moment brings a new joy; a new mystery opens its doors, a new love starts growing in you, a new compassion that you have never felt before, a new sensitivity about beauty, about goodness.\nYou become so sensitive that even the smallest blade of grass takes on an immense importance for you. Your sensitivity makes it clear to you that this small blade of grass is as important to existence as the biggest star; without this blade of grass, existence would be less than it is. And this small blade of grass is unique, it is irreplaceable, it has its own individuality.\nAnd this sensitivity will create new friendships for you -- friendships with trees, with birds, with animals, with mountains, with rivers, with oceans, with stars. Life becomes richer as love grows, as friendliness grows.\nIn the life of St. Francis, there is a beautiful incident. He is dying, and he has always traveled on a donkey from place to place sharing his experiences. All his disciples are gathered to listen to his last words.\nThe last words of a man are always the most significant that he has ever uttered because they contain the whole experience of his life.\nBut what the disciples heard, they could not believe.…\nSt. Francis did not address the disciples; he addressed the donkey. He said, \"Brother, I am immensely indebted to you. You have been carrying me from one place to another place with never a complaint, never grumbling. Before I leave this world, all that I want is forgiveness from you; I have not been humane to you.\"\nThese were the last words of St. Francis. A tremendous sensitivity to say to the donkey,\n\"Brother donkey\" and ask to be forgiven.\nAs you become more sensitive, life becomes bigger. It is not a small pond, it becomes oceanic. It is not confined to you and your wife and your children -- it is not confined at all. This whole existence becomes your family, and unless the whole existence is your family you have not known what life is -- because no man is an island, we are all connected.\nWe are a vast continent, joined in millions of ways.\nAnd if our hearts are not full of love for the whole, in the same proportion our life is cut short.\nMeditation will bring you sensitivity, a great sense of belonging to the world. It is our world -- the stars are ours, and we are not foreigners here. We belong intrinsically to existence. We are part of it, we are heart of it.\nSecondly, meditation will bring you a great silence -- because all rubbish knowledge is gone. Thoughts that are part of the knowledge are gone too... an immense silence, and you are surprised:\nThis silence is the only music there is.\nAll music is an effort to bring this silence somehow into manifestation.\nThe seers of the ancient East have been very emphatic about the point that all the great arts -- music, poetry, dance, painting, sculpture -- are all born out of meditation. They are an effort to in some way bring the unknowable into the world of the known for those who are not ready for the pilgrimage -- just gifts for those who are not ready to go on the pilgrimage. Perhaps a song may trigger a desire to go in search of the source, perhaps a statue.\nThe next time you enter a temple of Gautam Buddha or Mahavira just sit silently, watch the statue. Because the statue has been made in such a way, in such proportions that if you watch it you will fall silent. It is a statue of meditation; it is not concerned with Gautam Buddha or Mahavira.\nThat's why all those statues look alike -- Mahavira, Gautam Buddha, Neminatha, Adinatha.… Twenty-four tirthankaras of Jainas... in the same temple you will find twenty-four statues all alike, exactly alike.\nIn my childhood I used to ask my father, \"Can you explain to me how it is possible that twenty-four persons are exactly alike? -- the same size, the same nose, the same face, the same body \"\nAnd he used to say, \"I don't know. I am always puzzled myself that there is not a bit of difference. And it is almost unheard of -- there are not even two persons in the whole world who are alike, what to say about twenty-four?\"\nBut as my meditation blossomed I found the answer -- not from anybody else, I found the answer: that these statues have nothing to do with the people. These statues have something to do with what was happening inside those twenty-four people, and that was exactly the same.\nAnd we have not bothered about the outside; we have insisted that only the inner should be paid attention to. The outer is unimportant. Somebody is young, somebody is old, somebody is black, somebody is white, somebody is man, somebody is woman -- it does not matter; what matters is that inside there is an ocean of silence. In that oceanic state, the body takes a certain posture.\nYou have observed it yourself, but you have not been alert. When you are angry, have you observed? -- your body takes a certain posture. In anger you cannot keep your hands open; in anger -- the fist. In anger you cannot smile -- or can you?\nWith a certain emotion, the body has to follow a certain posture. Just small things are deeply related inside.\nSo those statues are made in such a way that if you simply sit silently and watch, and then close your eyes, a negative shadow image enters into your body and you start feeling something you have not felt before.\nThose statues and temples were not built for worshipping; they were built for experiencing. They are scientific laboratories. They have nothing to do with religion. A certain secret science has been used for centuries so the coming generations could come in contact with the experiences of the older generations -\n- not through books, not through words, but through something which goes deeper -- through silence, through meditation, through peace.\nAs your silence grows; your friendliness, your love grows; your life becomes a moment-to-moment dance, a joy, a celebration.\nDo you hear the firecrackers outside? Have you ever thought about why, all over the world, in every culture, in every society, there are a few days in the year for celebration?\nThese few days for celebration are just a compensation -- because these societies have taken away all celebration of your life, and if nothing is given to you in compensation your life can become a danger to the culture.\nEvery culture has to give some compensation to you so that you don't feel completely lost in misery, in sadness. But these compensations are false.\nThese firecrackers outside and these lights outside cannot make you rejoice. They are only for children; for you they are just a nuisance. But in your inner world there can be a continuity of lights, songs, joys.\nAlways remember that society compensates you when it feels that the repressed may explode into a dangerous situation if it is not compensated. The society finds some way of allowing you to let out the repressed. But this is not true celebration, and it cannot be true.\nTrue celebration should come from your life, in your life.\nAnd true celebration cannot be according to the calendar, that on the first of November you will celebrate. Strange, the whole year you are miserable and on the first of November suddenly you come out of misery, dancing. Either the misery was false or the first of November is false; both cannot be true. And once the first of November is gone, you are back in your dark hole, everybody in his misery, everybody in his anxiety.\nLife should be a continuous celebration, a festival of lights the whole year round. Only then you can grow up, you can blossom.\nTransform small things into celebration.\nFor example, in Japan they have the tea ceremony. In every Zen monastery and in every person's house who can afford it, they have a small temple for drinking tea. Now, tea is no longer an ordinary, profane thing; they have transformed it into a celebration. The temple for drinking tea is made in a certain way -- in a beautiful garden, with a beautiful pond; swans in the pond, flowers all around... guests come and they have to leave their shoes outside. It is a temple.\nAnd as you enter the temple, you cannot speak; you have to leave your thinking and thoughts and speech outside with your shoes. You sit down in a meditative posture. And the host, the lady who prepares tea for you -- her movements are so graceful, as if she is dancing, moving around preparing tea, putting cups and saucers before you as if you are gods. With such respect... she will bow down, and you will receive it with the same respect.\nThe tea is prepared in a special samovar which makes beautiful sounds, a music of its own. And it is part of the tea ceremony that everybody should listen first to the music of the tea. So everybody is silent, listening... birds chirping outside in the garden, and the samovar... the tea is creating its own song. A peace surrounds.…\nWhen the tea is ready and it is poured into everybody's cup, you are not just to drink it the way people are doing everywhere. First you will smell the aroma of the tea. You will sip the tea as if it has come from the beyond, you will take time\n-- there is no hurry.\nSomebody may start playing on the flute or on the sitar.\nAn ordinary thing -- just tea -- and they have made it a beautiful religious festival, and everybody comes out of it nourished, fresh, feeling younger, feeling juicier.\nAnd what can be done with tea can be done with everything -- with your clothes, with your food.\nPeople are living almost in sleep; otherwise, every fabric, every cloth has its own beauty, its own feel. If you are sensitive, then the clothing is not just to cover your body; then it is something expressing your individuality, something expressing your taste, your culture, your being.\nEverything that you do should be expressive of you; it should have your\nsignature on it.\nThen life becomes a continuous celebration.\nEven if you fall sick and you are lying in bed, you will make those moments of lying in bed moments of beauty and joy, moments of relaxation and rest, moments of meditation, moments of listening to music or to poetry. There is no need to be sad that you are sick.\nYou should be happy that everybody is in the office and you are in your bed like a king, relaxing -- somebody is preparing tea for you, the samovar is singing a song, a friend has offered to come and play flute for you.… These things are more important than any medicine. When you are sick, call a doctor. But more important, call those who love you because there is no medicine more important than love. Call those who can create beauty, music, poetry around you because there is nothing that heals like a mood of celebration.\nMedicine is the lowest kind of treatment.\nBut it seems we have forgotten everything, so we have to depend on medicine and be grumpy and sad -- as if you are missing some great joy that you were having in the office! In the office you were miserable -- just one day off, and you cling to misery too; you won't let it go.\nMake everything creative, make the best out of the worst -- that's what I call `the art'. And if a man has lived his whole life making every moment and every phase of it a beauty, a love, a joy, naturally his death is going to be the ultimate peak of his whole life's endeavor. The last touches... his death is not going to be ugly as it ordinarily happens every day to everyone.\nIf death is ugly, that means your whole life has been a wastage.\nDeath should be a peaceful acceptance, a loving entry into the unknown, a joyful goodbye to old friends, to the old world. There should not be any tragedy in it.\nOne Zen master, Lin Chi, was dying. Thousands of his disciples had gathered to listen to the last sermon, but Lin Chi was simply lying down -- joyous, smiling, but not saying a single word.\nSeeing that he was going to die and he was not saying a single word, somebody\nreminded Lin Chi -- an old friend, a master in his own right.… He was not a disciple of Lin Chi.\nThat's why he could say to him, \"Lin Chi, have you forgotten that you have to say your last words? I have always said your memory isn't right. You are dying... have you forgotten?\"\nLin Chi said, \"Just listen.\" And on the roof two squirrels were running, screeching. And he said, \"How beautiful\" and he died.\nFor a moment, when he said \"Just listen,\" there was absolute silence. Everybody thought he is going to say something great, but only two squirrels fighting, screeching, running on the roof And he smiled and he died.\nBut he has given his last message: don't make things small and big, trivial and important.\nEverything is important. At this moment, Lin Chi's death is as important as the two squirrels running on the roof, there is no difference. In existence it is all the same. That was his whole philosophy, his whole life's teaching -- that there is nothing which is great and there is nothing which is small; it all depends on you, what you make out of it.\nStart with meditation, and things will go on growing in you -- silence, serenity, blissfulness, sensitivity. And whatever comes out of meditation, try to bring it out in life.\nShare it, because everything shared grows fast. And when you have reached the point of death, you will know there is no death. You can say goodbye, there is no need for any tears of sadness -- maybe tears of joy, but not of sadness.\nBut you have to begin from being innocent.\nSo first, throw out all crap that you are carrying. And everybody is carrying so much crap\n-- and one wonders, for what? Just because people have been telling you that these are great ideas, principles...\nYou have not been intelligent with yourself. Be intelligent with yourself.\nLife is very simple; it is a joyful dance. And the whole earth can be full of joy and dance, but there are people who are seriously vested in their interest that nobody should enjoy life, that nobody should smile, that nobody should laugh, that life is a sin, that it is a punishment. How can you enjoy when the climate is such that you have been told continuously that it is a punishment? -- that you are suffering because you have done wrong things and it is a kind of jail where you have been thrown to suffer?\nI say to you life is not a jail, it is not a punishment. It is a reward, and it is given only to those who have earned it, who deserve it. Now it is your right to enjoy; it will be a sin if you DON'T enjoy.\nIt will be against existence if you don't beautify it, if you leave it just as you have found it. No, leave it a little happier, a little more beautiful, a little more fragrant.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nAS A DISCIPLE OF YOUR MYSTERY SCHOOL, I WANT TO ASK YOU THE\nFOLLOWING QUESTION: WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE\nBEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT NOW, IT FELT LIKE A RELAXATION IN MY\nHEART. THAT VERY MOMENT A PICTURE AROSE IN ME SHOWING ME THAT\nYOU ARE EVEN CLOSER TO US NOW, AND IT FEELS TO ME AS IF I CAN\nSOMEHOW UNDERSTAND \"BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT\" BETTER THAN\nENLIGHTENMENT ITSELF.\nCAN YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?\nAdima, it raises a few fundamental questions.\nFirst, if you cannot understand enlightenment, how can you understand that which is beyond it?\nYou are MISunderstanding.\nYour misunderstanding is that perhaps beyond enlightenment means below enlightenment.\nAnd you are feeling happy, but I cannot feel happy with your happiness. I feel sorry for it. You are feeling happy that I have come close to you. You should feel happy when you come close to me.\nJust think: if I say that I have dropped even \"beyond enlightenment,\" that it was all fiction -- enlightenment, beyond enlightenment... I am just one of you who had a few imaginative, fictitious ideas -- you will feel even happier. Now there is nothing for you to worry about, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve, you are perfectly okay.\nYour question makes me understand why Gautam Buddha remained with enlightenment -\n- although he was seeing it, the stars beyond were calling him. He was the first man to see beyond enlightenment, but he didn't go beyond; he remained at the stage of enlightenment.\nPerhaps it was for people like you. Because you will not be able to understand the person who goes beyond enlightenment; in a way he will become almost ordinary -- and there is the danger. Your ordinariness and his ordinariness are poles apart -- but both are ordinariness, and the danger is that you will misunderstand. He has come back home.\nYou have not even started the journey.\nIt is almost like meeting someone on a staircase -- you are both standing on the same step; one is going, one is coming. Both are on the same step -- in a way equal -- but one is going up, one is going down. Hence, they are not equal, their equality is illusory.\nI thought perhaps that in the twenty-five centuries after Gautam Buddha man might have become a little more intelligent -- and someone some day has to try going beyond and see what happens, how people take it.\nThe way you have understood it is absolutely wrong.\nI have not come closer to you, I have gone farther away.\nAnd you cannot avoid enlightenment; if you avoid it, you cannot reach beyond it. It is simple arithmetic. That's what is making you happy, that perhaps enlightenment can be avoided -- when one has to go beyond it, what is the need to first go to enlightenment and then go beyond it? We are already beyond it!\nYou are not beyond it. You are behind it.\nAnd in any case enlightenment cannot be avoided. One has to pass through that fire, through that great experience.\nSo drop that idea that I have come closer to you.\nMy being closer to you is not significant. What is significant is your being closer to me.\nYou say, \"Now you are a friend to us.\"\nI have always been a friend to you. The question is from your side: are you a friend to me? And my friendship will enhance and enrich my life, not your life. It is your friendship that is going to enhance and enrich your life. And if you can be a friend to one who is enlightened you have taken a long jump, you have extended your hands for a faraway star, you have stretched your being to its fullest. This will give you an evolution.\nAnd only after you have reached the point of enlightenment can you see that there are skies beyond skies, that enlightenment is not the end. Existence is not exhausted yet; there is still much more ahead, the journey continues.\nQuestion 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nNOW THAT I AM SLOWLY, SLOWLY TURNING INWARD, I FIND THIS\nLONGING MIXED WITH SADNESS WELLING UP FREQUENTLY. IT SEEMS\nCONNECTED WITH THE FEELINGS THAT ARISE WHEN I SEE YOU OR DREAM\nABOUT YOU.\nIS IT THE REALIZATION THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH LOVE AND\nBLISS IN MY LIFE, OR IS IT THE LONGING FOR HOME? WOULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THIS?\nIt is good and fortunate that nothing satisfies you completely and entirely. That means you don't become stagnant, that means you have to keep moving.\nSlowly slowly, you will understand that there is no home, that movement itself is the home; that there is no end to the pilgrimage but the pilgrimage itself is the end.\nIt is very difficult to understand because we are accustomed to a certain logic: if we want to go somewhere, going is always just a means, reaching somewhere is the end.\nBut as far as the universal life is concerned, there cannot be a place where you can say \"I have come and now there is nothing further.\"\nIt is inconceivable that you will find a place which will be the end and there will be a fence and a board saying, \"Here ends the world.\" And even if you can find such a place, I would like you to jump the fence -- because there must be something beyond the fence. If the fence cannot just stand by itself, there must be something beyond it. Somebody is playing a joke by putting up a board -- \"Here ends the world\" -- and fixing a fence there.\nDon't be deceived.\nYou will come to many places where you would like to make your home -- because it is so blissful, so peaceful, you feel so fulfilled; you don't see the point... why should you continue?\nBut I say unless you continue, you will never know that there is much more. But if you stop, nobody is going to prevent you.\nYou need a master to go on goading you, to go on destroying every home you make, so finally you decide not to make any home -- it is better to be homeless under the sky and continue the journey.\nIn the life of al-Hillaj Mansoor, a beautiful incident is related. He was a poor man. He collected money from people because he wanted to go to Kaaba, the sacred place of pilgrimage for the Mohammedans. And everybody contributed because he was going to Kaaba, and whoever contributes also gets a share in the virtue that he will get by reaching there. It is according to how much you give. So people gave him money -- those who could give more, gave more. People even gave beyond their capacity; they borrowed and gave him money.\nThe next day he was back. And they said, \"So soon?\" -- because in those days the journey from his place to Kaaba and back used to take three to six months. \"What happened? And where is the money?\"\nHe said, \"A strange man met me on the way just as I was going out of town. He said,\n`Listen, where are you going?' I said, Ì am going to Kaaba.' He said, `There is no need.' I said, `But every scripture says there is a need.' He said, Ì am a living master, and I am saying there is no need. You just go around me seven times and put all the money in front of me. I am Junnaid, the great master. Give the money first.' So I said, Ìf you are Junnaid, then...'\"\nJunnaid's name was known all over the country. So al-Hillaj said, \"If Junnaid says something he cannot be wrong. I gave given the money to Junnaid, went around him seven times, and he told me to go back home.\"\nThose people said, \"You idiot. First, have you inquired whether he is Junnaid or not? It seems some cheat has deceived you. Let us go and find out. If he was\nreally Junnaid, he will be sitting there.\"\nThey reached, and Junnaid was sitting there. Junnaid said, \"So you all have come. Put your money here, whatever money you have. Take seven rounds -- I am a living Kaaba --\nand then go home. And whenever you have money you can come again.\"\nSo the poor fellows had to put their money there and took seven rounds, sadly. \"This is strange, we never thought that Kaaba would come just outside our village.\"\nBut the news spread. People started coming from other villages. They said, \"If Junnaid says so, it must be right. That is a dead stone in Kaaba, and this is a living master.\"\nSomebody asked him, \"We have come. We heard that you were here, so we have come for the pilgrimage.\"\nHe said, \"Just give the money and do the pilgrimage.\"\nBut the man said, \"I have a question: After taking seven rounds around you, is the journey finished? Is the pilgrimage over?\"\nHe said, \"No, whenever you have money again, you can come. This pilgrimage is never going to end. And if you don't find me here, you will find somebody else. You can do this pilgrimage around anybody -- you just have to be sensitive to see the real, the living god within. It is not only within me, it is within you also. If you are alert, you can take seven rounds around yourself -- no need to waste the money and no need to go anywhere.\nRemember, there is no home. Or, the home is everywhere -- both are true.\" I will not say to you that the home is everywhere -- although it is true.\nI will say there is no home.\nIf you can continue your pilgrimage with this sincerity -- that there is no home and there is no place you are going to, that just the going is in itself the beauty, the joy, the blissfulness, everything... the going itself -- then the second will also\nbe true: that wherever you are, it is home. But the second can be deceptive -- because people are very cunning, even cunning with themselves. They have misused all truths, they have managed to give them meanings which support their own ideas. If I say \"Everywhere is home\" then they will relax wherever they are, then there is no need.\nSo I say: There is no home, and the journey has to be continued. It has to be a dance.\nTake your guitars and go on, and never stop anywhere.\nThat does not mean that you cannot rest for a while. There are caravanserais but no homes -- stay over for the night, but in the morning we have to go.\nThis ongoing process is what life is.\nThe moment it stops, it is death -- and there is no death.\nAnd why do people hanker for the home? -- security, safety. But in the name of security and safety, they don't make homes, they make prisons -- and they are the jailed and they are the jailers, but because they have the keys in their own hands, they think they are free.\nThey are not free. Only a constantly moving river... sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes falling from the mountains, sometimes moving very slowly on the plains... but moving all the time.…\nMovement is life, change is life.\nStay for a while if you feel tired, but stay only to regain enough energy so that tomorrow morning you can move again.\nThe home is everywhere -- but that home is just a caravanserai.\nNever make anything in life stable. That's how things die, that's how things start stinking.\nAllow movement -- it keeps things fresh, it keeps things alive. It keeps the adventure alive, the excitement, the ecstasy of the discovery of the unknown and finally the unknowable.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nEVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU LISTENING, LISTENING, I WAS NEVER\nABLE TO REMEMBER ANYTHING YOU SAID. AS SO OFTEN BEFORE, YOU\nARE SPEAKING FROM MY OWN HEART, BUT THE MOMENT THE WORDS\nARE HEARD, THEY ARE FORGOTTEN TOO.\nCAN YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING? AM I NOT REALLY LISTENING?\nIt is perfectly good. It is as it should be, because this is not a kindergarten school where you have to remember every word spoken by me.\nHere the emphasis is not on remembering; the emphasis is on listening. If you have listened in silence, then whatever is significant will be absorbed by the heart. You may forget the words.…\nWords are only containers, not the content. The content will be absorbed in the heart, and the containers have to be thrown away. You cannot carry all the containers always.\nListen perfectly. Never bother about remembering -- because that is a disturbance. Doing the two things together, then one starts taking notes -- if not visibly, then inside in the mind. No, don't create disturbance; just listen. If something is true, your heart will simply absorb it.\nAnd the heart has no memory system. The memory system is in the head.\nBut whatever the heart absorbs will be changing your actions, will be changing your behavior, will be changing you. It will bring a transformation.\nIt will not bring you knowledge, it will bring you transformation. It will make you a new man.\nSo don't be worried about memory at all. Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIS THERE ANY WAY TO TRANSCEND BEING A GERMAN?\nLatifa, there is only one way. And you have done it -- you have become a sannyasin.\nA sannyasin is neither German nor Indian, neither Chinese nor Japanese. A sannyasin declares that he is simply a human being. He drops all boundaries, all limitations of nations, of religions, of ideologies. And that you have done; now don't be worried.\nNow the whole of Germany is afraid of sannyasins.\nYou need not be worried about being a German. You just be a sannyasin and make more and more sannyasins, and Germany will disappear!\nWe are going to make Germany the first sannyas land. Beyond Enlightenment\nChapter #29\nChapter title: I am crazy but you are crazier! 1 November 1986 pm in\nArchive code: 8611015\nShortTitle:\nENLIGH29\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n122\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nRESEARCH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS SUGGESTED THAT CERTAIN\nSTATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS BROUGHT ABOUT BY MEDITATION\nTECHNIQUES APPEAR TO EVOKE SPECIFIC BRAINWAVE PATTERNS. THESE\nSTATES ARE NOW BEING CREATED BY ELECTRONIC AND AUDITORY\nSTIMULATION OF THE BRAIN, AND THEY CAN BE LEARNED THROUGH\nBIOFEEDBACK.\nTHE TRADITIONAL `MEDITATIVE STATE' -- SITTING SILENTLY (OR AT\nLEAST QUIETLY ALERT) IS COMPOSED OF BILATERAL, SYNCHRONOUS\nALPHA WAVES. DEEPER MEDITATION ALSO HAS BILATERAL THETA\nWAVES. A STATE CALLED `LUCID AWARENESS' HAS THE BILATERAL\nSYNCHRONOUS ALPHA AND THETA WAVES OF DEEP MEDITATION, PLUS\nTHE BETA WAVES OF NORMAL THOUGHT PROCESSES. `LUCID AWARENESS'\nCAN BE LEARNED THROUGH BIOFEEDBACK, USING THE MOST MODERN\nEQUIPMENT.\nARE THESE KINDS OF STIMULATION AND BIOFEEDBACK USEFUL TOOLS\nFOR THE MEDITATOR? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES TO THE MEDITATION BEYOND\nTECHNIQUE? IS THIS AN EXAMPLE OF BRINGING SCIENCE TOGETHER WITH\nMEDITATION?\nI WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES -- BOTH\nPERSONALLY IN MY OWN MEDITATION, AND PROFESSIONALLY IN MY\nWORK AS A PHYSICIAN. DO I HAVE YOUR BLESSINGS?\nIt is a very complex question.\nYou will have to understand one of the most fundamental things about meditation -- that no technique leads to meditation.\nThe old so-called techniques and the new scientific biofeedback techniques are the same as far as meditation is concerned.\nMeditation is not a byproduct of any technique.\nMeditation happens beyond mind. No technique can go beyond mind.\nBut there is going to be a great misunderstanding in scientific circles, and it has a certain basis. The basis of all misunderstanding is: When the being of a person is in a state of meditation, it creates certain waves in the mind. These waves can be created from the outside by technical means. But those waves will not create meditation -- this is the misunderstanding.\nMeditation creates those waves; it is the mind reflecting the inner world.\nYou cannot see what is happening inside. But you can see what is happening in the mind.\nNow there are sensitive instruments... we can judge what kind of waves are there when a person is asleep, what kinds of waves are there when a person is dreaming, what kinds of waves are there when a person is in meditation.\nBut by creating the waves, you cannot create the situation -- because those waves are only symptoms, indicators.\nIt is perfectly good, you can study them. But remember that there is no shortcut to meditation, and no mechanical device can be of any help. In fact, meditation needs no technique -- scientific or otherwise.\nMeditation is simply an understanding.\nIt is not a question of sitting silently, it is not a question of chanting a mantra. It is a question of understanding the subtle workings of the mind. As you understand those workings of the mind a great awareness arises in you which is not of the mind. That awareness arises in your being, in your soul, in your consciousness.\nMind is only a mechanism, but when that awareness arises it is bound to create a certain energy pattern around it. That energy pattern is noted by the mind. Mind is a very subtle mechanism.\nAnd you are studying from the outside, so at the most you can study the mind. Seeing that whenever a person is silent, serene, peaceful, a certain wave pattern\nalways, inevitably appears in the mind, the scientific thinking will say: if we can create this wave pattern in the mind, through some biofeedback technology, then the being inside will reach the heights of awareness.\nThis is not going to happen.\nIt is not a question of cause and effect.\nThese waves in the mind are not the cause of meditation; they are, on the contrary, the effect. But from the effect you cannot move towards the cause. It is possible that by biofeedback you can create certain patterns in the mind and they will give a feeling of peace, silence and serenity to the person. Because the person himself does not know what meditation is and has no way of comparing, he may be misled into believing that this is meditation -- but it is not. Because the moment the biofeedback mechanism stops, the waves disappear, and the silence and the peace and the serenity also disappear.\nAnd you may go on practicing with those scientific instruments for years; it will not change your character, it will not change your morality, it will not change your individuality. You will remain the same.\nMeditation transforms. It takes you to higher levels of consciousness and changes your whole lifestyle. It changes your reactions into responses to such an extent that it is unbelievable that the person who would have reacted in the same situation in anger is now acting in deep compassion, with love -- in the same situation.\nMeditation is a state of being, arrived at through understanding. It needs intelligence, it does not need techniques.\nThere is no technique that can give you intelligence. Otherwise, we would have changed all the idiots into geniuses; all the mediocre people would have become Albert Einsteins, Bertrand Russells, Jean-Paul Sartres. There is no way to change your intelligence from the outside, to sharpen it, to make it more penetrating, to give it more insight. It is simply a question of understanding, and nobody else can do it for you -- no machine, no man.\nFor centuries the so-called gurus have been cheating humanity. Now, in the future instead of gurus, these guru machines will cheat humanity.\nThe gurus were cheating people, saying that \"We will give you a mantra. You repeat the mantra.\" Certainly by repeating a mantra continuously, you create the energy field of a certain wave length; but the man remains the same, because it is only on the surface.\nJust as if you have throw a pebble into the silent lake and ripples arise and move all over the lake from one corner to the other corner -- but it does not touch the depths of the lake at all. The depths are completely unaware of what is happening on the surface.\nAnd what you see on the surface is also illusory. You think that ripples are moving --\nthat's not true. Nothing is moving.\nWhen you throw a pebble into the lake, it is not that ripples start moving. You can check it by putting a small flower on the water. You will be surprised: the flower remains in the same place. If the waves were moving and going towards the shore, they would have taken the flower with them. The flower remains there. The waves are not moving, it is just the water going up and down in the same place, creating the illusion of movement.\nThe depths of the lake will not know anything about it. And there is going to be no change in the character, in the beauty of the lake by creating those waves.\nMind is between the world and you.\nWhatever happens in the world, the mind is affected by it; and you can understand through the mind what is happening outside.\nFor example, you are seeing me -- you cannot see me; it is your mind that is affected by certain rays and creates a picture in the mind. You are inside, and from inside you see the picture. You don't see me; you can't see me.\nThe mind is the mediator. Just as when it is affected by the outside, the inner consciousness can read it -- what is happening outside -- what the scientists are trying to do is just the same: they are studying meditators and reading their wave lengths, the energy fields created by meditation. And naturally, the scientific approach is that if these certain patterns appear without any exception when a person is in meditation, then we have got the key; if we can create these patterns\nin the mind, then meditation is bound to appear inside. That's where the fallacy is.\nYou can create the pattern in the mind.…\nAnd if the person does not know about meditation, he may feel a silence, a serenity -- for the moment, as long as those waves remain.\nBut you cannot deceive a meditator because the meditator will see that those patterns are appearing in the mind.…\nMind is a lower reality, and the lower reality cannot change the higher reality. The mind is the servant; it cannot change the master.\nBut you can experiment.\nJust remain aware that whether it is a biofeedback machine or a chanting of OM, it does not matter; it only creates a mental peace, and a mental peace is not meditation.\nMeditation is the flight beyond the mind. It has nothing to do with mental peace.\nOne of America's great thinkers, Joshua Liebman, has written a very famous book, PEACE OF MIND. I wrote him a letter many years ago when I came across the book, saying that \"If you are sincere and honest, you should withdraw the book from the market because there is no such thing as peace of mind. Mind is the problem. When there is no mind then there is peace, so how there can be peace of mind? And any peace of mind is only fallacious; it simply means the noise has slowed down to such a point that you think it is silence. And you don't have anything to compare it with.\"\nA man who knows what meditation is cannot be deceived by any techniques, because no technique can give you understanding of the workings of the mind.\nFor example, you feel anger, you feel jealousy, you feel hatred, you feel lust. Is there any technique that can help you to get rid of anger? of jealousy? of hatred? of sexual lust?\nAnd if these things continue to remain, your lifestyle is going to remain the same as before.\nThere is only one way -- there has never been a second. There is one and only one way to understand that to be angry is to be stupid: watch anger in all its phases, be alert to it so it does not catch you unawares; remain watchful, seeing every step of the anger. And you will be surprised: that as awareness about the ways of anger grows, the anger starts evaporating.\nAnd when the anger disappears, then there is a peace. Peace is not a positive achievement.\nWhen the hatred disappears, there is love. Love is not a positive achievement. When jealousy disappears, there is a deep friendliness towards all.\nTry to understand.…\nBut all the religions have corrupted your minds because they have not taught you how to watch, how to understand; instead they have given you conclusions -- that anger is bad.\nAnd the moment you condemn something, you have already taken a certain position of judgment. You have judged. Now you cannot be aware.\nAwareness needs a state of no-judgment.\nAnd all the religions have been teaching people judgments: this is good, this is bad, this is sin, this is virtue -- this is the whole crap that for centuries man's mind has been loaded with. So, with everything -- the moment you see it -- there is immediately a judgment about it within you. You cannot simply see it, you cannot be just a mirror without saying anything.\nUnderstanding arises by becoming a mirror, a mirror of all that goes on in the mind.\nThere is a beautiful story -- not just a story, but an actual historical fact.\nOne disciple of Gautam Buddha is going on a journey to spread his message. He has come to see Gautam Buddha and to get his blessings, and to ask if there is\nany last message, any last words to be said to him.\nAnd Gautam Buddha said, \"Just remember one thing: While walking, keep your gaze just four feet ahead, looking four feet ahead of you.\"\nSince that day, for twenty-five centuries, Buddhist monks have walked in the same way.\nThat was a strategy to keep you from seeing women in particular. Those disciples were monks. They had taken the vow of celibacy.\nAnanda, another of Gautam Buddha's disciples, could not understand what the matter was, why the monk should keep his eyes always focused four feet ahead. He inquired: \"I want to know, what is the matter?\"\nBuddha said, \"That's how he will avoid looking at a woman, at least a woman's face -- at the most he will see her feet.\"\nBut Ananda said, \"There may be situations when a woman is in a danger. For example, she has fallen into a well and is shouting for help. What is your disciple supposed to do?\nHe will have to see her face, her body.\"\nBuddha said, \"In special situations he is allowed to see her, but it is not the rule, it is only the exception.\"\nAnanda said, \"What about touching? -- because there may be situations when a woman has fallen on the road. What is your disciple supposed to do? Should he help her to get up or not? Or an old woman wants to cross the road -- what is your disciple supposed to do?\"\nBuddha said, \"As an exception -- but remember it is not a rule -- he can touch the woman with one condition, and if he cannot fulfill the condition he is not allowed the exceptions.\nThe condition is that he should remain just a mirror, he should not take any judgment, any attitude. `The woman is beautiful' -- that is a judgment. `The woman is fair' -- that is a judgment. He should remain a mirror, then he is allowed the exceptions. Otherwise, let the woman drown in the well -- somebody\nelse will save her. You save yourself!\"\nWhat he is saying is this: in every situation where mind starts any kind of desire, greed, lust, ambition, possessiveness, the meditator has to be just a mirror. And what is that going to do? To be just a mirror means you are simply aware.\nIn pure awareness the mind cannot drag you down into the mud, into the gutter. In anger, in hatred, in jealousy, the mind is absolutely impotent in the face of awareness. And because the mind is absolutely impotent, your whole being is in a profound silence -- the peace that passeth understanding.\nNaturally that peace, that silence, that joy, that blissfulness will affect the mind. It will create ripples in the mind, it will change the wave lengths in the mind, and the scientist will be reading those waves, those wave patterns and he will be thinking, \"If these wave patterns can be created in someone by mechanical devices, then we will be able to create the profoundness of a Gautam Buddha.\"\nDon't be stupid.\nAll your technical devices can be good, can be helpful. They are not going to do any harm; they will be giving some taste of peace, of silence -- although very superficial, still it is something for those who have never known anything of peace.\nFor the thirsty, even dirty water does not look dirty. For the thirsty, even dirty water is a great blessing.\nSo you can start your experiments with all my blessings, but remember it is not meditation that you are giving to people -- you don't know meditation yourself. You may be giving them a little rest, a little relaxation -- and there is nothing wrong in it.\nBut if you give them the idea that this is meditation then you are certainly being harmful -\n- because these people will stop at the technical things, with the superficial silence, thinking that this is all and they have gained it.\nYou can be helpful to people. Tell them that \"This is just a mechanical way of\nputting your mind at peace, and mind at peace is not the real peace -- real peace is when mind is absent. And that is not possible from the outside, but only from the inside. And inside you have the intelligence, the understanding to do the miracle.\"\nIt is good for people who cannot relax, who cannot find a few moments of peace, whose minds are continuously chattering -- your technical devices are good, your biofeedback mechanisms are good. But make it clear to them that this is not meditation, this is just a mechanical device to help you relax, to give you a superficial feeling of silence. If this silence creates an urge in you to find the real, the inner, the authentic source of peace, then those technical devices have been friends, and the technicians who have been using them have not been barriers but have been bridges. Become a bridge.\nGive people the little taste that is possible through machines, but don't give them the false idea that this is what meditation is. Tell them that this is only a faraway echo of the real; if you want the real, you will have to go through a deep inner search, a profound understanding of your mind, an awareness of all the cunning ways of the mind so that the mind can be put aside. Then the mind is no longer between you and existence, and the doors are open.\nMeditation is the ultimate experience of blissfulness.\nIt cannot be produced by drugs, it cannot be produced by machines, it cannot be produced from the outside.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE COMMUNES OF MAHAVIRA AND BUDDHA SURVIVED EVEN AFTER\nTHEIR LIFETIMES, BUT YOUR COMMUNES ARE NOT SURVIVING IN YOUR\nLIFETIME ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SELF-SUFFICIENT.\nDOES SURVIVAL OF COMMUNES DEPEND ON SOCIAL STRUCTURE,\nAFFLUENCE OF THE SOCIETY, PREVALENT RELIGIONS, OR NATIONAL AND\nINTERNATIONAL POLITICS? PLEASE COMMENT.\nThe first thing to understand: Gautam Buddha and Mahavira had no communes.\nTheir disciples were wandering monks; they were not living a commune life in one place, they were always on the move -- except for the rainy season. And even in the rainy season they used to stay in different places.\nMy commune was an alternative society.\nGautam Buddha and Mahavira did not provide an alternative society; hence they were not in conflict with the society. On the contrary, they were dependent on the society for food, for clothes, for shelter -- their disciples were dependent on the society for everything.\nThey could not be rebellious. How can you be rebellious against a society which gives you food, which gives you clothes, which gives you shelter, which gives you everything that you need? You cannot go against its morality -- it may be rotten, but you have to support it. You cannot go against its traditions.\nMy commune was a totally new experiment. It has never happened before. There is no comparison in the past because my people were not dependent on anybody, and they were against the society, the culture, the civilization, the religion, the politics, the education -- everything that constitutes the world.\nWe were fighting an impossible fight -- a small group trying to live in a totally different way from the whole of humanity.\nMahavira was not against marriage; I am. Mahavira was not respectful towards women; I am.\nBuddha was as much a male chauvinist as anybody else. For twenty years continuously, he refused to initiate any women into Buddhism. He never accepted the idea that they are equal to men. I say they are not only equal but in some respects superior.\nMy commune was a revolt.\nTheir religions -- Gautam Buddha's and Mahavira's religions -- were simply offshoots of the same civilization, the same society, the same morality, the same superstitions.\nYes, they were arguing about invisible things which nobody bothers about -- whether God is seven feet high or six feet high is nobody's business. Whether God has three faces or only one face, it is God's problem, it is nobody else's problem. Maybe if he has three faces then God's tailor might have a problem!\nThey were disagreeing on many points, but all those points were immaterial, not substantial, not concerned with the life that man is living here and now -- about that they were all in absolute agreement.\nHence it was absolutely to be expected that my commune would be destroyed.\nIt was against the church, it was against the state, it was against all that your so- called civilization stands for -- because I don't believe man has yet become civilized.\nIf man has become civilized, then there is no need for wars; if man has become civilized, then there is no need for discrimination between blacks and whites, men and women; if man has become civilized then there is no need for people to die because they have nothing to eat -- and there are people who are dying because they have too much to eat.\nIn America, thirty million people are dying from overeating, and thirty million people are dying because they have nothing to eat.\nAnd you call this world a civilized world? It is not even sane. And it cannot be just coincidence: exactly thirty million people overeating, knowing perfectly well that they are eating themselves to death, knowing perfectly well that thirty million people are on the streets dying without food. Strange... sixty million people can be saved within a second, but these sixty million people will die.\nI have heard.… A man was very much worried because his wife was getting fatter and fatter and fatter.\nAnd women have greater capacity for becoming fat than men -- it is a biological\nprivilege, because the woman has to be able to become pregnant, to become a mother; then for nine months she cannot eat well, she throws up, she is carrying such a load in her belly. And every day the child needs more and more food. It is a very strange situation: the woman cannot eat, and the child wants more food because he is growing. Hence nature has made woman's body capable of collecting more fat for emergency measures.\nSo even if she does not eat, the child can get as much as he needs from the reserve fat the woman has; and the woman can also go on eating her own fat -- and nine months is a long time. So the woman has immense capacity. If she uses her full capacity, then man is no competitor.\nAnd women are thinner while they are not married. Once they are married they start becoming fat -- because now there is no problem. They have got hold of a man who cannot escape so it does not matter what happens to their body proportions; they are no more interested in any beauty competition.\nThe man asked his doctor, \"What has to be done?\"\nThe doctor said, \"You do one thing: take a beautiful picture of a naked woman and paste it inside the fridge, so whenever your wife opens the fridge for more ice cream she will think, `What a beautiful body!' And she may start thinking about herself, that this is not good.\"\nThe man said, \"That idea is very good.\"\nAfter two months the doctor met the man, and he could not believe it. He said, \"What happened? I have not seen you for two months, and you have become so fat!\"\nHe said, \"Everything went wrong because of your suggestion, you idiot! Are you my doctor or my enemy? I pasted a beautiful woman, naked, inside the fridge. Since then my wife does not open the fridge, but I cannot remain more than fifteen minutes away before a desire arises to see the photo. But when one opens the fridge, it is not just the photo one sees -- the ice cream, the cake... You have destroyed my life. So my wife has become slimmer, beautiful, and I have become ugly. And the whole credit goes to you!\"\nThis society, this world is based on insane superstitions.\nMy commune was a revolt. It survived five years -- it was a miracle, because the whole fascist and imperialist government of America tried everything to destroy it. Legally they could not do it because we had four hundred legal experts in the commune -- the commune had the biggest legal firm in the whole world. Four hundred sannyasins, a few of them very well-known legal experts; others, new graduates from the universities --\nfour hundred legal experts continuously fighting the American government on every legal point. Finally the government decided that legally it was impossible to destroy us, and then they started doing illegal things.\nAnd when a world power -- the world's greatest power -- starts being criminal and illegal, what can four hundred people do?\nWe were ready to fight legally, rationally, logically, in every possible way. But illegally it was impossible to fight.\nI was arrested illegally, without any arrest warrant -- because they could not find a reason to arrest me, so how to issue an arrest warrant?\nIn the middle of the night at the point of twelve loaded guns, I was arrested. And I asked them, \"Where is the arrest warrant?\"\nThey said, \"There is no arrest warrant.\"\nI said, \"You can at least tell me verbally what the reason is, why I am being arrested.\"\nThey said, \"We don't know.\"\nI asked them, \"Then give me the opportunity to inform my attorney.\" And they refused.\nThat is every citizen's right everywhere in the world -- to inform his attorney if the government is doing such an illegal act. But they were worried that if the attorney comes, the first thing he is going to ask is, \"Where is the arrest warrant?\"\nThey destroyed the commune in such a way that the world would think nothing\ncriminal had been done, but everything criminal.…\nIn court they produced one hundred and thirty-six crimes against me.\nI was silent for three and a half years, never going out of my room. And if a man remaining silent -- not meeting anybody, not talking to anybody, not going out of his room -- can manage to commit one hundred and thirty-six crimes, then I thought there must be miracles, I must be doing miracles! And they had no proof of anything.\nThey asked for negotiations. The government attorney made it clear to my attorneys that the government could not accept defeat. They themselves had foolishly called the case\n\"The United States of America versus Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,\" they themselves had called the case that; there was no need to give it such a name. Now they were in trouble: if I had won the case that would mean the United States of America would have been defeated in their own courts under their own law, by their own constitution.\nSo they said, \"We cannot -- the government cannot accept defeat. And you know and we know that we don't have any proof. So the best way will be not to go to trial. We are ready for negotiations. And the negotiating agreement is that Bhagwan should accept any two charges, should admit that he has committed two crimes -- just to show the world that we have not done anything wrong by arresting him -- and pay a nominal fine. Then on the surface everything looks legal.\"\nBut my attorney said, \"It will be very difficult to convince him to accept.\"\nThey said, \"We should make you aware of the fact that if he does not accept -- and if the case goes to trial -- then the trial can be prolonged for ten years, twenty years. It is a case against the government, and you should be aware that government is not ready to lose the case. So we will go on postponing it, and bail will be cancelled and Bhagwan will have to remain in jail. His whole movement will be destroyed, and all his sannyasins all over the world will be in immense torture.\"\nAnd he suggested -- whispered into my chief attorney's ear: \"You should be aware that he can be killed too. If we see that the case is going to be lost, he can be killed too.\"\nMy attorneys came to me crying -- and they were the topmost attorneys of America. I asked them, \"Why you are crying? What is the matter? -- because there is nothing in those hundred thirty-six charges. We are going to win.\"\nThey said, \"We are going to win, but your life is at risk and we don't want your life to be at risk.\"\nAnd they were right.\nBecause they had already planted a bomb under my seat, so if something went wrong then they could finish me on that very day. It was just a coincidence that I reached the jail earlier than they expected -- and the bomb was a time bomb, so it did not explode.\nAfter I left America, the attorney general told the press, \"Our first priority was to destroy the commune.\"\nWhy? -- because the commune had done no harm to America in any way. But deep down it has hurt America's ego, its pride -- because we have shown them that a dream can be realized, that five thousand people can live without any law enforcement authority, without any court, without any fight, without any drugs, without any murder, without any suicide, nobody going mad. And people were living so joyously and so beautifully that the whole of America was starting to feel jealous.\nThe very existence of the commune was dangerous to the American politicians because it showed that they don't have any intelligence; otherwise they could have done what we had done very easily -- they had all the power, all the money.\nThis small commune of five thousand people had everything that man needs, and all the freedom, all the love. And everybody was working seven days a week, twelve to fourteen hours a day, and still were not tired -- because it was not something forced, it was something they wanted to do, they wanted to create. It was such a creative act that after working fourteen hours they were still dancing in the streets; late in the night they were playing on their guitars, singing, dancing.\nThe commune was destined to be destroyed. It was too good not to be destroyed. It was the alternative society.\nMahavira and Buddha did not create any alternative society. They were part of this society, they remained dependent on this society.\nTheir revolution was intellectual, verbal. My revolt was actual and existential.\nAnd the destruction of the commune in America does not mean that the idea of the commune will disappear. There are still communes around the world flourishing in many countries. More and more communes will be coming up.\nAmerica is going to repent; it has missed an opportunity. It could have supported the commune and made it clear to the world that it stands for freedom, that it stands for a new man, that it stands for a future humanity.\nIt missed a great opportunity.\nBy destroying the commune, it has destroyed its own credibility, its own democracy. It has proved itself simply nothing but a hypocritical society.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE MOST POWERFUL EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE IS THE LOVE THAT I\nFEEL\nFOR YOU. IT'S LIKE A SHOWER THAT CLEANSES MY SOUL AND FILLS MY\nHEART WITH GRATITUDE.\nBUT STILL I KEEP SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING ELSE, AS IF THERE IS A SECRET YOU HAVEN'T SHARED WITH ME YET. IS THIS CRAZY LOVE AFFAIR\nBETWEEN US REALLY AND TRULY ALL THAT IS NEEDED? WHY AM I NOT\nSATISFIED WITH THIS EXPERIENCE?\nLove can never be satisfied.\nIf it is satisfied, it is not much of a love. The greater and deeper it is, the more dissatisfaction there will be. That is not against love; it simply shows the vastness, that your heart wants to love in a way which is infinite, that it will never be satisfied.\nAnd it is good that it is not satisfied. The moment it is satisfied, it is dead.\nThe love between the master and the disciple can never be satisfied. It will always remain a thrill, a new excitement, a new ecstasy. It will always go on opening doors upon doors -\n- disciplehood will become devotion; one day devotion will become a merger, just as the river merges in the ocean. But that too is not going to satisfy.\nSatisfaction is not a great quality. It belongs to the little minds, to the little hearts which are satisfied with small things.\nThere are people who are satisfied with a little money, there are people who are satisfied with a house, there are people who are satisfied with a little name, a little fame -- these are pygmies.\nGiants are never satisfied. On every new step they find the journey is becoming\ndeeper, more miraculous, more mysterious -- and the longing is growing and the heart is full of a sweet ache.\nTo be in a love affair with a master is to be in a love affair with existence itself; the master is only an arrow pointing towards the unknowable, the miraculous, the mysterious.\nThe master is not the end, the master is only the beginning.\nThe whole function of the master is to push you the same way a mother bird pushes a small bird, a new bird who has never opened his wings into the sky. Naturally he is afraid\n-- a vast sky. He has lived in a small cozy nest, safe and secure, the mother has been taking care -- and now she wants him to take a jump and fly. And one day she pushes him. And the moment he is pushed out of the nest -- for a moment it feels as if he is going to fall down on the earth, but before he falls on the earth his wings open and the whole sky is his.\nAnd there are skies beyond skies.\nThe function of the master is nothing but to push you into a more divine discontentment, into a discontentment that knows no satisfaction.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU ARE REALLY SOMETHING -- TALKING ABOUT \"BEYOND\nENLIGHTENMENT\" WHEN MOST OF US ARE NOT BEYOND PETTINESS, FUTILITY AND POSTPONEMENT!\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES OR SOMETHING? (PERHAPS LOVE?)\nIt is true, I am something!\nI know you are not beyond pettiness, beyond jealousy, beyond greed, beyond anger. But I don't talk about going beyond them for the simple reason that if you start struggling with your pettiness, you will remain petty; if you start struggling against your jealousy, you will remain jealous.\nAn ancient proverb is: \"Always choose the enemy very carefully.\"\nA friend can be chosen without much care, but an enemy has to be chosen very carefully because you will be fighting with him -- and in fighting you will become just like the enemy because you will have to use the same methods, the same means.\nEnemies are very precious.\nI don't want you to fight with small things. Rather than looking down at the earth, and all around is your pettiness and jealousy and anger, my effort is to show you the stars and help you to know that you have wings. And once you start moving towards the stars, those small things will disappear on their own accord.\nIt is better to look at a star and to strive to get to it because the journey is beautiful, the heart is throbbing with excitement.\nRather than fighting with small things...\nYou will remain small, fighting with small things.\nAll your religions teach you to fight with small things, and that's why the whole of humanity has remained small -- fight with small things.\nI insist: Don't fight with small things.\nFight for something great, and as you move towards the great the small ones will disappear.\nI am crazy, but you are crazier!\nAnd that is the only bond between us -- I am crazy, you are crazier. That is the only commitment. We will reach to the stars -- we will not bother about small things. Leave them here for other people, they will fight with them.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS NEEDED TO NOT MISS YOU?\nPrasad, only one thing is needed not to miss me, and that is: You have to remember constantly that in every mind, in every person who comes in search of truth, the ego plays a very cunning game.\nI will tell you one story.\nIt is said that one of the great Zen masters Bokoju used to ask every newcomer: \"Have you realized that the path of disciplehood is very difficult? Before you enter on the path, it is my duty to make you alert to all the difficulties, arduousness, hostilities; it is an uphill task. Are you ready, or you have come here just out of curiosity?\"\nThe man said, \"No, I have come here to find the truth, but if it is too difficult to be a disciple then what about making me a master?\"\nIt is a very strange story.\nBut that is the only thing that can prevent you coming closer to me -- the desire in the ego somewhere to become a master. You have to become something bigger, something greater.\nThe master is just a finger pointing to the moon. Don't be bothered to become a master; while you can become the moon, why become the finger?\nYou are asking what can keep you missing me. Only one thing: the desire to be a master.\nIt is one of the mysteries of life that only those who don't have any desire to be a master become masters, and those who have the desire even fall from the status of being a disciple -- because the desire to be a master is nothing but a subtle ego.\nSo just watch your mind.\nFrom disciple become a devotee; from devotee take a quantum leap, a merger with existence.\nNever think for a moment of becoming a master. Leave it to existence: if existence wants you to become a master -- that means if existence wants to use you as a master, you will be used. If existence thinks you have done enough and wants you to relax, disperse into eternity -- leave it to existence. You should not be desirous of anything.\nThe moment you come to the state of desirelessness, then existence uses you in whatever way is needed: as a mystic, as a master, as a singer, as a dancer, as a flute player -- or just as nobody; but everything is a benediction.\nThat which comes to you from existence without your desiring it is always the greatest ecstasy there is.\nBeyond Enlightenment Chapter #30\nChapter title: You are the watcher not the actor 2 November 1986 pm in\nArchive code: 8611025\nShortTitle: ENLIGH30\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length:\n131\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK FOR THE PAST MONTH ON \"BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT\" -- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS ON ENLIGHTENMENT -- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.\nALL I KNOW IS THE MOMENT WHEN I SIT BEFORE YOU: YOU FEEL LIKE\nBLOOD TO MY BODY; YOUR VOICE, MORE FAMILIAR THAN MY OWN HEARTBEAT.\nOSHO, HAVE I LET YOU DOWN?\nManeesha, there are things which are beyond understanding.\nEnlightenment is beyond understanding, and of course beyond enlightenment is going to be more miraculous, more mysterious.\nUnderstanding itself is not the heart of human beings, it is not their very being. It is useful only as far as the outside world is concerned. The moment you start moving inwards, you have to learn new ways of feeling, of loving, of knowing, and finally of being.\nUnderstanding is perfectly right for the mind, for intelligence, for the objective world; but life does not consist only of those things which you can understand. In fact, the things that you can understand don't make life a celebration, they don't give life a meaning, a significance, they don't allow life to become love.\nUnderstanding is the demarcation line between the mundane and the sacred.\nThe mundane can be understood and should be understood. And the sacred cannot be understood and should not be understood. Its sacredness is basically a secret that you experience, just the way you feel the heartbeat, the way you feel your breathing.\nThe sacred gives color to existence, gives music to that which is mundane. It transforms all prose into poetry and makes everything a mystery unto itself so that the whole existence becomes a constant challenge to discover. You go on discovering, but the discovery is never finished; hence you can never say you have understood. On the contrary, the deeper you enter into the sacred dimension of life the more you feel you don't understand, you don't know.\nSocrates had become very old, and before he was given poison the oracle of the temple of Delphi declared him to be the wisest man in the whole world. A few people who knew Socrates were immensely glad, they rushed to Athens to inform Socrates: \"It has never happened before, it is unprecedented that the oracle of Delphi should declare anybody as the wisest man in the world. You are the first.\"\nSocrates said, \"You will have to go back to the temple of Delphi and tell the oracle that although it has always been right, this time it has missed -- because I know nothing.\"\nThe people who brought the news were shocked.\nThey went back and told to the oracle: \"Socrates refuses. Not only does he refuse to be the wisest man in the world, he says, Ì know NOTHING.'\"\nAnd here is the beauty of the incident: The oracle said, \"That's why he is the wisest man in the world, there is no contradiction.\"\nManeesha, if you had understood what I was saying for twelve years about enlightenment, you would have missed. If you had understood what I have been saying for one month continuously about beyond enlightenment, you would have missed.\nBecause you are aware that you have not been able to understand anything, you have not missed.\nAnd your feeling that sitting close to me you feel as if I have become your\nheartbeat, your breathing, your circulation of blood -- this is true understanding. This is not knowledge; this is the same understanding as when Socrates says, \"I know nothing.\" This is closer to love, this is closer to music, this is closer to feeling beauty.\nYou don't understand beauty, you don't understand music, you don't understand dance --\nyou enjoy, you rejoice, you feel. It enters into your being. It becomes part of you, but you cannot say it is knowledge.\nListening to the music of the winds as they pass through the pine trees, what can you understand? Or listening to the sound of running water, what can you understand? Or looking at a beautiful sunset and all the colors spread over the horizon, what can you understand? What do you understand?\nBut something happens which is far more precious than understanding. You fall in love, you feel it, you become it.\nThis is how it should be -- aes dhammo sanantano. This is how religion has always been, this is the eternal mystery I call `religion' -- not the religion of the mind, but the religion of the heart, of the being; not the religion of knowing, but the religion of innocence.\nWhatever is happening to you is exactly what should happen to everybody.\nThose who go from here understanding things, knowing things, becoming more knowledgeable, it would have been better that they had not come -- because I have not been a help to them, I have burdened them; I have not been able to unburden them. And my whole effort is to take all weight of knowing, knowledge, wisdom from you and to make you innocent children again -- again collecting flowers in the garden, running after butterflies, collecting seashells, making houses of sand on the beach... utterly absorbed in whatsoever you are doing, utterly blissful -- so the whole existence around you is a fairyland because everything is mysterious.\nIf I can take away your knowledge and give you back the sense of mystery, then I have done my job, I have fulfilled my function.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nREADING A SCIENTIFIC REPORT ABOUT BRAIN MANIPULATION, QUESTIONS AROSE IN ME.\nFOR INSTANCE, IF EVERY FEELING -- LIKE HAPPINESS, SADNESS, SEXUALITY, AGGRESSION, AND SO ON -- CAN BE STIMULATED BY\nELECTRODES, OR INDIRECTLY BY CHEMISTRY, CAN BE MANIPULATED\nFROM THE OUTSIDE, THEN THESE FEELINGS ARE NOT MY OWN; THEY ARE\nJUST PUPPETS IN SOMEONE'S HANDS. THEY ARE EITHER MANIPULATED\nFROM THE OUTSIDE OR FROM THE INSIDE AS AUTOMATIC REACTIONS TO\nSITUATIONS -- THEY ARE NOT ME. THIS IS ABOUT FEELINGS.\nMAYBE SOME DAY THOUGHTS CAN BE MANIPULATED EQUALLY EASILY.\nTHEN WHAT IS REALLY MINE? THEN WHAT IS LEFT? THEN WHO AM I?\nQUESTIONING AND THINKING IN THESE DIRECTIONS, I CAME TO\nRECOGNIZE THAT I OFTEN THINK ABOUT MYSELF, ABOUT LIFE, ABOUT\nTRUTH IN THESE WAYS. AND THEN THE QUESTION AROSE: IS THIS WAY OF\nQUESTIONING AND THINKING THE WAY THE MIND TRIES TO KNOW\nSOMETHING? IS IT ABLE TO REACH ANY TRUTH AT ALL? IF NOT, IS THIS\nTHINKING OR QUESTIONING JUST A FUTILE EFFORT, JUST A WASTE OF\nTIME? OR IS IT NOT THE MIND, NOT THE INTELLECT, BUT A DEEPER\nINTELLIGENCE, A DEEPER INSTRUMENT THAT IS ABLE TO COME TO SOME\nTRUTH?\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nIt is absolutely true: your emotions, your sentiments, your thoughts -- the whole paraphernalia of the mind -- is from the outside, is manipulated by the outside.\nScientifically it has become more clear. But even without scientific investigation, the mystics, for thousands of years, have been saying exactly the same thing -- that all these things that your mind is filled with are not yours, you are beyond them. You get identified with them, and that's the only sin.\nFor example, somebody insults you and you become angry. You think you are becoming angry -- but seen scientifically, his insult is only a remote controller. The man who has insulted you is managing your behavior. Your anger is in his hands, you are behaving like a puppet.\nNow scientists are able to put electrodes in the brain at certain centers -- there are seven hundred centers. And it is almost unbelievable: the mystics have been talking about these seven hundred centers in the brain for almost seven, eight thousand years. Science has just now discovered that there are exactly seven hundred centers controlling all your behavior.\nAn electrode can be put at a particular center -- for example, anger -- with a remote control so you cannot see that anybody is doing anything to you. Nobody insults you, nobody humiliates you, nobody says anything to you; you are sitting silently, happily, and somebody pushes the button of the remote control and you become angry. It is a very strange feeling because you cannot see the reason anywhere, why you are becoming angry. Perhaps you will rationalize somehow:\nyou see a man passing down the street and you remember that he insulted you -- you will find some rationalization just to console yourself that you are not going mad. Sitting silently... and suddenly feeling so angry without any provocation?\nAnd the same remote controller can work to make you happy: sitting in your chair you start giggling, and you look all around in case somebody sees you -- he will think you are going crazy! Nobody has said anything, nothing has happened, nobody has slipped on a banana peel, so why are you giggling? But you will rationalize it, you will give some apparently rational grounds for giggling.\nAnd the strangest thing is that when the next time the same button is pushed and you giggle, you will again have the same rationale, the same consolation, the same explanation -- that too is not yours. It is almost like a gramophone record.\nAnd the scientists have come to discover a tremendously meaningful thing: the moment the remote controller releases the center, it rewinds itself immediately. For example, your speech center: the remote control can force you to speak. There is no audience, you will feel awkward -- but you cannot do anything, you have to speak. It is just like a recording.\nWhen the remote controller releases the button, the pressure on the electrode, you become silent. Press the button again... and the strange thing is, you start your speech again from the very beginning!\nWhen I was reading about the scientific investigations into these centers, I was reminded of my student days. I was a competitor in an inter-university debate; all the universities of the country were participating. The Sanskrit University of Varanasi was also participating, but naturally the students from the Sanskrit University were feeling a little inferior compared with competitors from other universities. They knew ancient scriptures, they knew Sanskrit poetry, drama, but they were not familiar with the contemporary world of art, literature, philosophy or logic.\nAnd the inferiority complex works in very strange ways.\nJust after I had spoken, the next person was the representative from the Sanskrit University. And just to impress the audience and to hide his inferiority complex he started his speech with a quotation from Bertrand Russell -- he had crammed it, and Sanskrit students are more capable of cramming things than anybody else. But his stage fright.…\nHe knew nothing about Bertrand Russell, he knew nothing about what he was quoting. It would have been better to have quoted something from Sanskrit because he would have been more at ease.\nIn the middle he stopped -- just in the middle of a sentence. And I was sitting by his side, because I had just finished. There was silence, and he was perspiring. And just to help him, I said, \"Start again\" -- because what else to do? he was simply stuck. \"And if you cannot go ahead, you start again; perhaps it may come back to you.\"\nSo he started again: \"Brothers and sisters...\" and at exactly the same point he got stuck again. Now it became a joke. The whole hall was shouting, \"Again!\" and he was in such a difficult situation. Neither could he go ahead nor could he keep standing there silent -- it looked very idiotic. So he had to start again. But he would start again, \"Brothers and sisters...\"\nFor a whole fifteen minutes we heard only that portion: \"Brothers and sisters...\" up to the point where he got stuck, again and again.\nWhen his time was finished he came and sat next to me. He said, \"You destroyed my whole thing!\"\nI said, \"I was trying to help you.\" He said, \"This is help?\"\nI said, \"You were going to be in difficulty anyway. This way at least everybody enjoyed it except you -- that I can understand, but you should rejoice that you made so many people happy. And why did you choose that quotation? When I was saying to you, `Start again' there was no need to start over -- you could have dropped that quotation, there was no need to begin again from the very beginning.\"\nBut I came to know through reading the scientific research that the speech center is exactly like a gramophone record, but with one thing very strange and special: the moment the needle is taken away from the record you cannot put the needle back where you took it from. Once it is taken away, it will have to begin again exactly at the beginning. The center instantly goes back to the beginning.\nAnd if this happens, can you say you are the master of what you are saying? Are\nyou the master of what you are feeling? Certainly there are no electrodes scientifically put into you, but biologically exactly the same work is going on.\nYou see a certain woman, and immediately your mind reacts: \"How beautiful!\" This is nothing but remote control. That woman functioned like a remote control and your speech center simply went into a recorded speech: \"How beautiful!\"\nMind is a mechanism. It is not you.\nIt records things from outside, and then reacts to outside situations according to the recordings. That's the only difference between a Hindu and a Mohammedan and a Christian and a Jew -- they have just got different gramophone records. Inside it is one humanity. And do you think when you play a gramophone record... it may be in Hebrew, it may be in Sanskrit, it may be in Persian, it may be in Arabic, but it is the same machine that plays the record. To the machine it does not matter whether it plays Hebrew or Sanskrit.\nAll your religions, all your political ideas, all your cultural attitudes are nothing but recordings. And in certain situations certain recordings are provoked.\nThere is a beautiful incident in the life of one of the very wisest kings of India, Raja Dhoj. He was very much interested in wise people. His whole treasury was open only for one purpose -- to collect all the wise people of the country, whatsoever the cost. His capital was Ujjain, and he had thirty of the country's most famous people in his court. It was the most precious court in the whole country.\nOne of the greatest poets of the world, Kalidas, was one of the members of the court of Raja Dhoj.\nOne day a man appeared at the court saying that he spoke thirty languages with the same fluency, the same accuracy and accent as any native person could, and he had come to make a challenge: \"Hearing that you have in your court the wisest people of the country, here are one thousand gold pieces...\"\nThe rupee used to be golden. We should stop calling it the rupee now, because the word\n`rupee' comes from the word rupya. `Rupya' means gold. It went on falling from gold to silver, from silver to something else. Now it is just paper and you go on\ncalling it `rupee'.\nThe very word means gold.\nAnd he said, \"Anybody who can recognize my mother tongue, these one thousand gold pieces are his. And if he cannot recognize it, then he will have to give me one thousand gold pieces.\"\nThere were great scholars there, and everybody knows that whatever you do, you can never speak any language the way you can speak your own mother tongue because every other language has to be learned by effort. Only the mother tongue is spontaneous -- you don't even learn it, just... the very situation and you start speaking it. It has a spontaneity.\nThat's why even Germans who call their country `fatherland'.… That is the only country which calls itself `fatherland'. All other countries call their land\n`motherland'. But even the Germans don't call their languagèfather tongue'. Every language is called a mother tongue because the child starts learning from the mother, and anyway the father never has the chance to speak in the house. It is always the mother who is speaking -- father is listening.\nMany took the challenge. He spoke in thirty languages -- a few pieces in one language, a few pieces in another language -- and it was really hard; he was certainly a master artist.\nHe was speaking each language the way only a native can speak his own mother language. All of the thirty great scholars lost. The competition continued for thirty days, and every day one person took the challenge and lost it. The man would say, \"This is not my mother tongue.\"\nOn the thirty-first day.… King Dhoj had been continually saying to Kalidas, \"Why don't you accept the challenge? -- because a poet knows language in a more delicate way, with all its nuances, more than anybody else.\"\nBut Kalidas remained silent. He had been watching for thirty days, trying to find out which language the man spoke with more ease, with more spontaneity, with more joy.\nBut he could not manage to find any difference, he spoke all the languages in exactly the same way.\nOn the thirty-first day, Kalidas asked King Dhoj and all the wise people to stand outside in front of the court. There was a long row of steps and the man was coming up; as he came up to the last step, Kalidas pushed him down. And as he fell rolling down the steps, anger came up -- he shouted.\nAnd Kalidas said, \"This is your mother tongue!\" Because in anger you cannot remember, and the man had not been expecting this to be a challenge.\nAnd that actually was his mother tongue.\nDeepest in his mind, the recording was of the mother tongue.\nOne of my professors used to say -- he lived all over the world, teaching in different universities -- that \"Only in two situations in life have I been in difficulty in different countries -- fighting or falling in love. In those times one remembers one's mother tongue. However beautifully you express your love, it is not the same, it seems superficial. And when you are angry and fighting in somebody else's language, you cannot have that joy \"\nHe said, \"Those are two very significant situations -- fighting and loving -- and mostly they are together with the same person. With the same person you are in love, with that same person you have to fight.\"\nAnd he was right, that everything remains superficial -- you can neither sing a beautiful song nor can you use real four-letter words of your language. In both cases, it remains lukewarm.\nMind certainly is a mechanism for recording experiences from the outside, and reacting and responding accordingly. It is not you.\nBut unfortunately the psychologists think mind is all, beyond mind there is nothing. That means you are nothing but impressions from the outside. You don't have any soul of your own. The very idea of the soul is also given by the outside.\nThis is where the mystics are different: they will agree absolutely that about the mind, the contemporary scientific research is right. But it is not right about man's total personality.\nBeyond mind, there is an awareness which is not given by the outside and which is not an idea -- and there is no experiment up to now which has found any\ncenter in the brain which corresponds to awareness.\nThe whole work of religion, of meditation is to make you aware of all that is mind and disidentify yourself with it. When the mind is angry, you should think, \"It is simply a gramophone record.\" When the mind is sad, you should simply remember: it is only a gramophone record.\nA certain situation is pressing the remote controller, and you feel sad, you feel angry, you feel frustrated, you feel worried, you feel tense -- all these things are coming from the outside, and the mind is responding to them.\nBut you are the watcher.\nYou are not the actor. It is not your reaction.\nHence the whole art of meditation is to learn awareness, alertness, consciousness.\nWhile you are feeling angry, don't repress it; let it be there. Just become aware. See it as if it is some object outside you.\nSlowly slowly, go on cutting your identifications with the mind. Then you have found your real individuality, your being, your soul.\nFinding this awareness is enlightenment -- you have become luminous.\nYou are no more in darkness, and you are no more just a puppet in the hands of the mind.\nYou are a master, not a servant. Now the mind cannot react automatically, autonomously\n-- the way it used to do before. It needs your permission. Somebody insults you, and you don't want to be angry.…\nGautam Buddha used to say to his disciples that, \"To be angry is so stupid that it is inconceivable that intelligent human beings go on doing it. Somebody else is doing something and you are getting angry. He may be doing something wrong, he may be saying something wrong, he may be making some effort to humiliate\nyou, to insult you --\nbut that is his freedom. If you react, you are a slave.\"\nAnd if you say to the person, \"It is your joy to insult me, it is my joy not to be angry,\"\nyou are behaving like a master.\nAnd unless this master becomes crystal clear in you, crystallized, you don't have any soul. You are just a phonograph record.\nAs you grow older, your recording goes on becoming more and more. You become more knowledgeable. People think you are becoming wiser -- you are simply becoming a donkey loaded with scriptures.\nWisdom consists only of one thing, not of knowing many things but of knowing only one thing: that is your awareness and its separation from the mind.\nJust try watching in small things, and you will be surprised. People go on doing the same things every day. They go on deciding to do something, and they go on repenting because they have not done it; it becomes a routine.\nEverything you do is not new. The things which have been giving you misery, sadness, worries, wounds, and you don't want -- somehow mechanically you go on doing these things again and again as if you are helpless. And you will remain helpless unless you create a separation between mind and awareness.\nThat very separation is the greatest revolution that can happen to man. And from that very moment your life is a life of continuous celebration -- because you need not do anything that harms you, you need not do anything that makes you miserable. Now you can do and act on only that which makes you more joyous, fulfills you, gives you contentment, makes your life a piece of art, a beauty.\nBut this is possible only if the master in you is awake. Right now the master is fast asleep, and the servant is playing the role of master.\nAnd the servant is not your servant; the servant is created by the outside world, it belongs to the outside world, it follows the outside world and its laws.\nThis is the whole tragedy of human life: you are asleep, and the outside world is dominating you, creating your mind according to its own needs -- and the mind is a puppet.\nOnce your awareness becomes a flame, it burns up the whole slavery that the mind has created.\nAnd there is no blissfulness more precious than freedom, than being a master of your own destiny.\nMind is not your friend. Either the mind is pretending to be the master or it has to be put into its right place as a servant -- but mind is not your friend.\nAnd the struggle for freedom, for bliss, for truth is not with the world; it is a fight with this puppet mind. It is very simple.\nKahlil Gibran has a beautiful story.\nThe farmers in the villages, to protect their cultivated farms, create a false man: just a stick, another stick... it looks almost like a cross. And then they put a kurta on it, and a mud pot in place of the head. That's enough to make poor animals afraid that somebody may be standing there. The white kurta and two hands, in the night... somebody is watching. For the animals it is enough, they keep away from the farm.\nGibran says, \"Once I asked such a false man, Ì can understand the farmer who made you, he needs you. I can understand the poor animals, they don't have great intelligence to see that you are bogus. But in rain, in sun, in hot summer, in cold winter you remain standing here -- for what?'\n\"And the false, bogus man said, `You don't know my joy. Just to make those animals afraid is such a joy that it is worth suffering rain, suffering sun, suffering heat, winter --\neverything. I am making thousands of animals afraid! I know I am bogus, there is nothing inside me -- but I don't care about that. My joy is in making others afraid.'\"\nI want to ask you: would you like to be just like this bogus man -- nothing inside, making somebody afraid, making somebody happy, making somebody\nhumiliated, making somebody respectful? Is your life only for others?\nWill you ever look inside?\nIs there anybody in the house or not?\nThe people who are with me, their search is to find the master of the house.\nI say to you the master is there -- perhaps asleep, but he can be awakened. And once the master is awakened within you, your whole life takes new colors, new rainbows, new flowers, new music, new dances.\nFor the first time you become alive. Before, you were only vegetating. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI LOVE BEING HERE. I WANTED AND FELT TO BE WITH YOU EVEN IF IT\nWERE JUST FOR TWO DAYS.\nAT YOUR BIRTHDAY IN 1981 WE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE REASON\nWAS THAT I HAD JUST READ A BOOK ABOUT GURDJIEFF AND THE\nPHENOMENON OF baraka. THIS GAVE ME SUCH A HIT THAT I MADE IT TO\nCOME TO THE RANCH.\nTHESE DAYS I AM WORKING WITH MANAGERS AND TEACHING THEM\nMEDITATION TECHNIQUES. I'M ALSO PREPARING A WORLDWIDE MEDITATION PROJECT. AGAIN I FEEL I NEED `BARAKA'!\nPLEASE CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BARAKA?\nBaraka is a Sufi word meaning grace.\nGeorge Gurdjieff was trained in Sufi schools. He has carried many ideas of the Sufis into the West.\nThe Sufi master -- just like any other master in the world -- is full of grace. If you are receptive, if you are open, just coming close to the master something invisible, some vibe of the divine, some rays of the unknowable start penetrating you.\nIt also has the meaning of blessing.\nPeople come to the masters and ask for blessing.\nIn English there is no exact word to translatèbaraka', but in Sanskrit, in Hindi, we have the word prasad. Blessings carry a faraway echo of it. If you are receptive... And unless one is receptive one never goes to a master.\nThat has been the Eastern tradition. Why waste your time and why waste the master's time? You go only when you see that your heart is opening, it needs a ray of light, as if your being is just like thirsty earth which needs a raincloud to shower on you. Only in such moments people go to a master, they touch the feet of the master, they sit with the master.\nNothing is said and everything is heard; nothing is asked and everything is given.\nBaraka is a mystical principle that happens between the receiving disciple and the overflowing master.\nIt is possible to pass a master without even noticing him -- if you are not open.\nSufis are very careful. It is not easy to find a Sufi master; he may take months or sometimes years to find -- and perhaps the master is just living in front of your house.\nThe Sufis wait for the right moment.\nThey have their disciples who come to know that a certain man is asking if this village has a Sufi master. And the disciples go on telling him, \"Yes, the Sufi master is here, and you will be called only when you are ready -- because the real thing is your openness.\nThe master is ready, but what will you be doing? Even if we take you to the master, you will not be able to recognize him.\"\nSo the disciples will keep the person hanging around, giving him hope, giving him time --\n\"Next month we will try\" -- making him more and more thirsty. And when they see that he has become a longing, that now it is no longer an ordinary inquiry, it is not just a curiosity to see a Sufi master, but a deep longing, a question of life and death; that if this man does not get in contact with a master he may die, only then will he be introduced into the company of the master. And he will be surprised: the master is a man he has passed in the village many times, he sells vegetables -- because Sufis keep themselves hiding in very ordinary life. Somebody is a shoemaker, somebody is a weaver, somebody sells vegetables -- ordinary things, nothing special about it. And they meet in the middle of the night.\nThen the same man sits with the dignity of an emperor. It is called `the court of the master'. The same man who was selling vegetables the whole day long in the marketplace\n-- now even the emperor comes to touch his feet.\nBut nobody can come to the Sufi master unless somebody from his company introduces him, unless somebody takes the responsibility that the person is ready, somebody brings him, introduces him: \"He is ready. He needs your grace.\"\nWhen Gurdjieff entered into a Sufi circle for the first time -- it took him three years to enter the circle.… When he entered, almost a dozen people were sitting there silently with their eyes closed. He was brought close to the master.\nThe friend who brought him told him, \"Just sit down. Nothing is needed on your part except a silent opening, and the rain will come. And then don't close yourself. Drink of the master as much as you can -- this is his blessing; this will\nkeep you on the path, on the right track. It will keep you courageous enough to pass all the dark nights, it will keep you trusting that the morning is going to happen. The face of the master, the eyes of the master, the gestures of the master, the silence of the master -- everything has to be soaked up so it becomes part of you.\"\nWhen the master is no longer outside you only, but inside you too -- that is real blessing.\nThen the disciple is pregnant, the master has come into his womb, and it will help him in times of danger, in times of discouragement, in times of darkness.\nIt will always keep him together, remembering that if truth can happen to one man, if God can happen to one man, then it is everybody's birthright.\nRemembering...\"It may take a little time for me, I have joined the path a little late. But the dawn is not far away.\"\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nRAJNEESHPURAM WAS A RARE EXPERIMENT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN\nCONSCIOUSNESS WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEKERS OF TRUTH FROM\nTHE WHOLE WORLD GATHERED AROUND A MASTER. IT WAS AN\nINTERNATIONAL COMMUNE FOR THE MOST INTENSE AND THE FASTEST\nGROWTH OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS.\nTHE RAJNEESHPURAM COMMUNE COULD NOT SURVIVE BECAUSE OF\nORTHODOX RELIGIONS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.\nIS THERE ANY HOPE OF SUCH A RARE EXPERIMENT HAPPENING AGAIN\nAROUND YOU? OR IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXPERIMENT POSSIBLE\nON AN INDIVIDUAL SCALE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION? OR IS IT DESTINED\nTHAT SUCH A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS TO\nFLOWER TO ITS OPTIMUM SHOULD BE MISSED? PLEASE COMMENT.\nThe commune in America was only a beginning; a beginning of many communes around the world.\nThey will go on spreading -- because it is not only a question of orthodox religions and dirty politics, it is also a question of the future of humanity. And the future is always more important than the past.\nThe past is heavy and long. The future is light, unknown. But the past is dead, and life belongs to the future -- and death cannot win over life.\nOne commune can be destroyed. Thousands of other communes will arise.\nOf course my way of functioning will be different because the experiment in Rajneeshpuram needed me to be there, it was the first commune.… Every step had to be taken carefully. And within five years, so much was done that is not possible to do even in fifty years. But now the basic rules are clear.\nAnd my being in any commune is going to be dangerous for the commune.\nIt was absolutely necessary for the first commune that I should be present. I took the risk, and the commune has succeeded. Now there are communes all around the world. More communes will be arising. I am just waiting for the right moment to trigger a new kind of process.\nI will not be part of any commune because my presence will be dangerous for the commune. So now I will be just wandering from one commune to another. Before my presence becomes dangerous in one commune, I will move to another\n-- so the commune is saved, and whatever I can give and my presence can give, can be given on a much bigger scale around the globe.\nThere is no need for people to come to me. I can move from commune to commune. This way, many more communes can flourish.\nI am just waiting for the right moment. Preparations are being made, and soon I will start working on a series of communes -- because the movement has to become worldwide, it is already worldwide.\nThe commune is the lifestyle of the future.\nThe family is gone and the commune is going to take its place. Much depends on the success of commune life, and we have to make the commune life such a celebration that it starts spreading like wildfire, that others start communes of their own.\nEach village can become a commune, there is no need to establish different villages. We just have to prove that life in a commune is much richer, much more lovely, much more meditative, that there is a possibility of living in a different way, different from the way humanity has lived up to now.\nWe have proved it in Rajneeshpuram.\nIt was our success that forced America to destroy the commune. If we were not successful, nobody would have bothered about us. Remember this: it was not a failure that we were destroyed; it was our success which could not be tolerated.\nAnd if we have been successful in one place We are successful in Germany, in\nItaly, in Holland, in Japan, in Australia, in different other countries. Because I am not there, the politicians are not worried, the theologians are not afraid.\nSo I want the communes to become more consolidated before I start my world tours, because now it will not be A world tour, it will be just the beginning of world tours. I will be continuously rotating like a satellite around the earth, creating as much trouble as possible. Only then these traditional vested interests can be destroyed.\nBut if the truth is with us, the victory is also with us. Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nDO THOSE CELLS NEEDED FOR A LIVELY AND GROWING INTELLIGENCE\nHAVE ONLY ÀLIMITED' LIFE SPAN, SO THAT THERE IS A POINT BEYOND\nWHICH ONE EITHER BECOMES SENILE OR SIMPLY STAGNATES?\nOR, GIVEN THE NECESSARY STIMULUS, IS IT POSSIBLE FOR INTELLIGENCE\nTO CONTINUE TO GROW RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF ONE'S DEATH?\nThe ordinary human being stops his growth of intelligence at the age fourteen because the biological purpose is complete.\nAt the age of fourteen, the person is mature enough to give birth, to reproduce. Biology is no longer interested beyond this point.\nThis is the reason why the average human being is stuck at the age of fourteen as far as his mental age is concerned. People go on growing physically up to seventy, eighty, ninety, a hundred years -- in some places like Caucasia, up to one hundred and fifty, even one hundred and eighty. But their mental age remains stuck at fourteen. This has been the routine up to now.\nThis can be changed. And this should be changed because there is infinite potential for growth, but the change will come only if you have some goals beyond biology. If your life remains concerned only with sex, children, family, food, house, then there is no need; that much intelligence is enough. But if your interest is that of an Albert Einstein then your intelligence starts moving sometimes even ahead of your physical body.\nEmerson is reported to have said -- and rightly so -- when asked how old he was:\n\"Three hundred and sixty years.\"\nThe journalist who was asking said, \"Three hundred and sixty? You don't look more than sixty.\"\nEmerson said, \"That's right. From one point of view, I am sixty years old. But I have done so much work as far as my intelligence is concerned that either six people would be needed to do it or I would need three hundred and sixty years. My intelligence is so far ahead of my physical body.\"\nIntelligence depends what you are doing with it.\nThe person who is meditating has the greatest possibility of reaching the highest peaks of intelligence because in meditation he is doing the greatest possible work that a man is capable of -- and that is realizing oneself, knowing \"Who am I.\" Entering into the deepest interiority of one's subjectivity is the greatest work for intelligence. Then you cannot even count -- you cannot count Gautam Buddha's intelligence, it is beyond calculations, beyond measurements.\nAnd if you are a meditator, as your meditation goes on becoming more and more luminous, your intelligence will be growing to the last breath of your life. Not only that, even after the last breath your intelligence will continue to grow -- because you are not going to die, only your body will be dying. And the body has nothing to do with intelligence, mind has nothing to do with intelligence.\nIntelligence is the quality of your awareness -- more aware, more intelligent. And if you are totally aware, you are as intelligent as this whole existence is. Beyond Enlightenment\nChapter #31\nChapter title: Discarding the container, discovering the content 3 November 1986 pm in\nArchive code:\n8611035\nShortTitle:\nENLIGH31\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n130\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI AM AFRAID TO JUMP FROM A THREE-METER TOWER INTO A SWIMMING\nPOOL.\nWILL I STILL BE ABLE TO JUMP INTO ENLIGHTENMENT?\nThe first basic thing to understand is that you are not expected to jump into enlightenment. You have to climb for it -- it is higher than you, not lower than you.\nSo at least one fear you can drop!\nAnd climbing to enlightenment is a simple process. It is not something tortuous, arduous.\nIt is something like peeling an onion; after one layer there is another layer --\nfresher, younger, juicier, after that layer there are still more, juicier layers. And if you go on peeling, finally nothing is left in your hands -- because the onion was nothing but layers upon layers.\nEnlightenment is a kind of peeling of the ego.\nIt is parallel to the onion because it has no inner substance, only layers. And those layers sometimes slip by themselves -- they become old sometimes by accident. If you watch your life, you can see it happening. It is not a theorization.\nSometimes you can see that you are not wearing the right mask for the right occasion.\nWhen you are expected to smile, you are not smiling; when you are expected to weep, you are not weeping.\nI used to live with a distant uncle's family. His wife died. In fact it is very difficult to find a husband who never thinks that if his wife died it would be good, a good riddance. And my uncle's wife was certainly a nightmare. In fact everybody was happy that she died, and everybody knew that the husband was happy that she had died, but still the convention, the tradition.…\nI used to sit in the garden. He told me, \"I cannot remain in a miserable posture the whole day long because really I am not miserable. You know it. I cannot hide it from you --\ntwenty-four hours a day you are in the house -- but when relatives come, I have to show that I am very miserable.\" Not to be caught being happy and at ease, he told me, \"You mostly sit in the garden reading, so you can just give me a signal from there that somebody is coming.\" So I had to give him signals.\nAnd the miracle was that the moment I would give him the signal, immediately he would become miserable. Sometimes I would play a joke: I would give the signal and nobody would turn up. And he would be very angry: \"This you should not do, because this is a dangerous joke. Sometimes I may think you are joking and somebody may turn up. You have to understand that I should not be caught enjoying myself. In fact I have never enjoyed myself -- because of this woman! She was such a pain in the neck. And even today, although she is dead, she is torturing me through these relatives -- relatives I have not seen for years, relatives I don't even recognize as relatives. They come and I have to be\nmiserable -- whether the relative is real or false, I have to bring tears to my eyes.\n\"I am surprised myself that I am capable of it -- being miserable, tears flowing. And I pray to you that when I am acting this way, please don't stand so close. You just be out in the garden; you don't have to be present to watch the whole scene, because then it becomes more difficult for me to do the performance.\"\nOne day a man came. He was known to me, he was a bookseller. And I told him, \"Can you pretend just for two minutes to be a far-off relative of a dead wife?\"\nHe said, \"What?\"\nI said, \"I will explain it to you later on when I come to your shop. But remember, it has to be done in a certain way: First, I will introduce you as the best shopkeeper in town, who is not only a shopkeeper but who loves books and has a collection of rare books. Ìt is not just a business for him, it is his love affair.' I will introduce you first in this way. And then in the middle I will tell him, `He's also a relative of your dead wife.' I just want to see how he changes his mask.\"\nI introduced the man. My uncle was perfectly happy. He said, \"Very good, I will come some time. I don't have much time to read, but if you can suggest some rare books I will try to find the time.\"\nAnd then I said, \"But I forgot one thing. He has not come here to sell books; he is a relative of your dead wife.\" And immediately my uncle started crying, tears came to his eyes and he was so miserable.…\nThe bookseller was also amazed at how quickly he changed. He had just been laughing and there had been no question of misery or anything.\nAnd then I said, \"Just don't harass yourself. He is not related to your wife, it is just a misunderstanding.\"\nHe said, \"What kind of misunderstanding?\"\nI said, \"Another woman in the neighborhood has also died; he is related to that woman.\"\nAnd immediately all the tears were gone and he started laughing. He said, \"This is a great joke! Why didn't you tell me?\"\nThe bookseller said, \"I am very new to this locality, I have never been here, and he misled me. He told me that my relative used to live here, and she has died. I came because of my relative who has died -- but I am not acquainted with this locality and I have never seen the husband of my relative, so just forgive me. But it has been a great experience! You could have been a great actor -- within minutes, from laughter to misery, from misery back to laughter.\"\nI said, \"This is nothing. If I tell him the reality, he will be back again to tears and misery.\"\nHe said, \"What reality?\"\nI said, \"No other woman has died. He is a relative of your wife.\"\nHe said, \"Listen, I have told you this is a serious affair.\" And again misery and tears.\nAnd that man felt so sad for this miserable creature... he told me, \"Don't torture him this way.\"\nI said, \"I am not torturing him. He is torturing himself! What is the need? The wife is dead, she cannot come back. He need not be afraid of her, at least not now. While she was alive, it was difficult to say. I knew his wife, and he was perfectly right to be afraid of her. But now he need not be afraid, she cannot come.\"\nI said to my uncle, \"You just be your natural self. If you are feeling pleasant, why change personalities? Why make your life a drama instead of a reality?\"\nBut we are all doing that in different measures.\nYour personality consists only of cultivated layers. Many masks are hanging around you -\n- whichever you need, you put it on. In fact, humanity has developed, by and by, almost an automatic system -- you need not do anything, it happens by itself.\nThe moment you see your boss, your face changes -- not that you change it. It is so unconscious that you start smiling, just like a dog wagging his tail.\nEven dogs are very clever. If they are not certain about a stranger who is coming towards their house -- he may be a friend, he may not be a friend -- they do both things: they go on barking, and they go on wagging their tail also. They are just waiting to see which direction the camel turns; if the man is received by the family as a friend, the barking stops and the tail continues. And if the family rejects the man, then the tail stops and barking continues.\nPoor dogs are being corrupted because of the company they keep with human beings; they have learned your tricks.\nA person meeting the boss has one face. The same person meeting his servant has a different face. He behaves with the servant as if he does not matter at all, he is not human. You can pass him without taking any note of him, he is only a servant.\nBut as far as the boss is concerned, you have to take a joyous attitude, an ear-to- ear smile\n-- a Jimmy Carter smile. And you are not doing it deliberately; now it is your autonomous, unconscious functioning.\nEnlightenment is simply the process of becoming aware of your unconscious layers of personality and dropping those layers. They are not you; they are false faces. And because of those false faces, you cannot discover your original face.\nEnlightenment is nothing but the discovery of the original face -- the essential reality you brought with you, and the essential reality you will have to take with you when you die.\nAll these layers gathered between birth and death will be left here behind you.\nThe man of enlightenment does exactly what death does to everybody, but he does it himself. He dies in a way and is reborn, dies in a way and is resurrected. And his originality is luminous because it is part of eternal life.\nIt is a simple process of discovering yourself. You are not the container but the content.\nDiscarding the container and discovering the content is the whole process of\nenlightenment. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL YOUR PRESENCE ALL AROUND ME, YOUR LOVE AND YOUR\nCOMPASSION, BUT I MYSELF FEEL UNWORTHY OF IT. WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD DESERVE YOU? JUST BECAUSE OF THIS, I HAVE CLOSED A DOOR\nIN FRONT OF YOU. MY HEART IS SUFFERING, BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN\nWHERE THE DOOR IS. PLEASE COMMENT.\nIt is one of the crimes that has been committed against everybody everywhere in human society: you have been continuously conditioned and told that you are unworthy.\nBecause of this conditioning, the major part of humanity has given up even desiring any adventure, any pilgimage to the stars -- they are so convinced of their unworthiness. Their parents were telling them, \"You are unworthy.\" Their teachers were telling them, \"You are unworthy.\" Their priests were telling them, \"You are unworthy.\" Everybody was forcing the idea on them that they were unworthy. Naturally they accepted the idea.\nAnd once you accept the idea of unworthiness, you naturally close. You cannot believe that you have wings, that the whole sky is yours, that you have just to open your wings and the sky is going to be yours, with all its stars.\nAnd it is not a question that somewhere you have forgotten to open one door. You don't have any doors, you don't have any walls.\nThis unworthiness is simply a concept, an idea. You have become hypnotized by the idea.\nSince the very beginning, all cultures, all societies have been using hypnotism to destroy individuals -- their freedom, their uniqueness, their genius -- because the vested interests are not in need of geniuses, not in need of unique individuals, not in need of people who love freedom. They are in need of slaves. And the only psychological way to create slaves is to condition your mind that you are unworthy, that you don't deserve; that you don't even deserve whatever you have, you should not go for anything more. Already you owe too much for things which you are not worthy of.\nAnd hypnotism is a simple process of continuous repetition. Just go on repeating a certain idea and it starts settling inside you, and it becomes a thick wall, invisible -- there are no doors, no windows. There is no wall either.\nGeorge Gurdjieff has remembered his childhood He was born in the Caucasus,\none of the most primitive parts of the world. It is still at the stage where humanity was when it lived by hunting; even cultivation has not started. The people of the Caucasus are great hunters.\nAnd any society that lives by hunting is bound to be a nomadic society. It cannot make houses, it cannot make cities, because you cannot depend on animals -- today they are available here, tomorrow they are not available here. And certainly you will kill them, and because of your presence they will escape -- either they will be killed or they will escape.\nCities are possible only with cultivation because trees cannot escape, and you have to be there to protect them, to water them, to take care of them -- so you have to live in villages near your fields.\nThe Caucasus is still nomadic. They are on their horses, moving from one place to another place, hunting.\nGurdjieff was brought up by a nomadic society, so he was coming from almost another planet. He knew a few things which we have forgotten. He remembers that in his childhood the nomads hypnotized their children -- because they cannot carry them continuously while they are hunting; they have to leave them somewhere under a tree, in a safe place. But what is the guarantee that those children will remain there? They have to be hypnotized. So they used a small strategy -- and they have used it for centuries.\nFrom the very beginning when the child is very small, they will make him sit\nunder a tree. They will draw a circle around the child with a stick and tell him, \"You cannot go out of this circle; if you go out of it, you will be dead.\"\nNow those small children believe, just like you. Why are you Christian? -- because your parents told you. Why are you Hindus? Why are you Jainas? Why are you Mohammedans? -- because your parents told you.\nThose children believe that if they go out of the circle they will die. They grow up with this conditioning.\nAnd you may try to persuade them: \"Come out, I will give you a sweet.\" They cannot, because death.… Even sometimes if they try, they feel as if an invisible wall prevents them, pushes them back into the circle. And that wall exists only in their minds -- there is no wall, there is nothing. Unless the person who has put them in the circle comes and withdraws the circle, takes the child out, the child remains inside.\nAnd the child goes on growing, but the idea remains in the unconscious. So even an old man, if his father draws a circle around him, cannot get out of it.\nSo it is not only a question of the child; the old man also still carries his childhood in his unconscious.\nAnd it is not a question of one child. The whole group of nomads have put their children under trees nearby, and all the children are sitting there the whole day long. By the time their parents come back, it has become such a conditioning that no matter what happens, the child will not leave the circle.\nExactly the same kind of circles are drawn around you by your society. Of course they are more sophisticated. Your religion is nothing but a circle, but very sophisticated; your church, your temple, your holy book is nothing but a hypnotic circle.\nOne has to understand that one is living surrounded by many circles which are only in your mind. They don't have a real existence, but they function almost as if they are real.\nOne night it happened, it must have been nearabout twelve, a young man knocked on my door. I was still awake, writing a few letters. He fell on the ground, took hold of my feet, and said, \"Just give me one glass of water with\nyour hand.\"\nI said, \"What is the purpose?\"\nHe said, \"I have been sent by a Dr. S.C. Barat. I am his patient. I have been suffering from a stomachache for years. He has tried all kinds of medicines, nothing helps. And today he said, `Now medical science cannot help you; only a miracle can help you.' So I asked where I had to go for the miracle and he sent me to you. And he said, `Whatever happens, you go on holding his feet unless he gives you a glass of water -- just that water will be the cure.\"\nDr. Barat was my friend. He had told me that he was going to send this young man. He said, \"He is a hypochondriac. He has no stomachache, nothing -- just he is rich, too much money and nothing to do. So he is doing stomachache, headache... he gets any kind of disease. I have not found any disease in him, he is perfectly healthy. But every day he tortures me for hours. I know that no medicine is going to help because he is not sick. In fact, to give him any medicine is dangerous.\n\"So I have been giving him just colored water, especially prepared for him. I have a whole cabinet full of colored water in bottles; I make a mixture from these bottles and give it to him. He says, `Yes, a little relief but the pain remains.' And if it disappears from one place, it starts appearing in another place. I am tired. And because of him, I am losing many patients. So you have to save me from this rich young man. His father has died and he has a big inheritance, enough money to throw away on anything. But he is destroying my business.\"\nI said, \"I don't understand -- how is he destroying your business?\"\nHe said, \"It is very simple -- because my other patients see him, and see that he has been coming for ten years and I have not been able to cure him. It creates a bad impression. So I am sending him to you, and you have to do the miracle.\"\nI said, \"I don't do miracles, and miracles don't happen. But if you want, I will try.\"\nSo when the young man came, I went on denying him: \"Just water touched by me is not going to help. You should go to another doctor -- why are you after this Dr. Barat? If one doctor has failed, go to another doctor. If onèpathy' fails... change from allopathy: try ayurveda; if ayurveda fails, try homeopathy; if\nhomeopathy fails, try naturopathy. And by that time you will be dead, don't be worried. Whether the disease goes or not, you will be gone!\"\nHe said, \"But I want to live! I am too young to die right now.\" And he was not more than twenty-six. He said, \"I am not even married. Because my father died, I have enough money -- many people are after me. They want me to marry their daughters, and I don't want to be encaged. And first I want to take care of my health. Getting married means bringing more sicknesses, more diseases into the house. You have to give me a glass of water!\"\nI said, \"It is very difficult, because miracles don't happen.\"\nI was staying in a friend's house. His wife was listening as this whole conversation was going on and on, and he was crying Finally the woman came\nout and said, \"I never thought that you are so hard. Whether it helps or not, just give him a glass of water. Half of the night has passed; neither are you going to sleep, nor are you allowing anybody else in the house to sleep -- because we are all excited, waiting to see what happens, whether the miracle happens or not.\"\nI said, \"Because you say so, and because I don't want to torture your family... Bring a glass of water.\"\nAnd I told the young man, \"Remember, you are not to talk about it to anybody -- because I don't want it to happen that from tomorrow the whole day long a queue of patients is there. I don't have time for all this. So promise me that you will not talk.\"\nHe said, \"I promise that I will not talk, but you also have to promise me one thing.\"\nI said, \"What is it?\"\nHe said, \"You will have to promise me that once in a while I can come with a bottle of water and you will touch it.\"\nI said, \"What you are going to do with it?\"\nHe said, \"I will not say anything to anybody about you. But if the miracle happens and my stomachache disappears, there are many people who are suffering. I can distribute the water. But I promise I will not talk.\"\nSo I said, \"Okay, it is a promise. But don't bring anybody here!\"\nI gave him a glass of water, and as he drank the water -- just drinking it, you could see his face changing. And he said, \"My God, the pain is gone!\"\nMy friend's wife was standing behind me. She said, \"You did it!\"\nI said, \"I have not done it -- and remember that you are not to talk about it to anybody.\"\nShe said, \"I may not talk, but everybody in the house knows -- everybody is hiding, all the children are there. Now \" She said, \"If this was going to happen,\nwhy did you waste one hour?\"\nI said, \"Without wasting that hour, the water wouldn't have helped. It was not the water; it was my insistence that I wouldn't give it to him. He became more and more convinced that the water was going to work. And when I told him that he had to promise not to talk to anybody, he was absolutely convinced that the miracle was going to happen.\"\nHe started distributing the water.\nAnd people told me -- even Dr. Barat told me, \"It is strange. You cured my patient and now he is curing my patients. I was thinking I was finished with him\n-- now he comes with a bottle into my dispensary. He sits there and says, `Don't bother about this medicine, it won't help. Take the miraculous water.' That young man seems to be my enemy from a past life! And he has cured a few of my patients!\"\nSeventy percent of sick people are only sick in their minds, they don't have a real sickness.\nHence it has been found that all the pathies -- allopathy, ayurveda, yunani, naturopathy, homeopathy -- they all succeed in seventy percent of cases. In seventy percent of cases anybody can do miracles, one just has to make the right arrangement so the mind is convinced that the miracle is going to happen.\nIt is simply a conditioning that you are unworthy. Nobody is unworthy.\nExistence does not produce people who are unworthy.\nExistence is not unintelligent. If existence produces so many unworthy people, then the whole responsibility goes to existence. Then it can be definitely concluded that existence is not intelligent, that there is no intelligence behind it, that it is an unintelligent, accidental materialist phenomenon and there is no consciousness in it.\nAnd this is our whole fight, our whole struggle: to prove that existence is intelligent, that existence is immensely conscious.\nIt is the same existence which creates Gautam Buddhas. It cannot create unworthy people.\nYou are not unworthy.\nSo there is no question of finding a door; there is only an understanding that unworthiness is a false idea imposed on you by those who want you to be a slave for your whole life.\nYou can drop it just right now.\nExistence gives the same sun to you as to Gautam Buddha, the same moon as to Zarathustra, the same wind as to Mahavira, the same rain as to Jesus -- it makes no difference, it has no idea of discrimination. For existence, Gautam Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Bodhidharma, Kabir, Nanak or you are just the same.\nThe only difference is that Gautam Buddha did not accept the idea of being unworthy, he rejected the idea. It was easy for him to reject it -- he was the prince of a great kingdom, the only son of the king, and the king was thought to be almost a god. So he had no idea of unworthiness.\nBut what about Kabir? What about Raidas the shoemaker? What about Gora the potter?\nThese poor people were burdened by the society with the idea that they were unworthy, but they rejected it.\nIn Kabir's life there were clearcut examples. Kabir lived his whole life in Kashi.\nFor centuries Hindus have believed that to die in Kashi is the greatest thing you can do in life, because for one who dies in Kashi, his paradise is guaranteed. It does not matter what kind of man he was, whether he was a murderer, a thief, a saint or a sinner -- these things are all irrelevant. His dying in Kashi erases everything and he becomes qualified for paradise.\nSo in Kashi you will find old people, old women who have come there just to die. They have not done anything in their life, but they don't want to miss paradise.\nAnd Kabir lived his whole life in Kashi, and when he was going to die he said, \"Take me out of Kashi to the other side, to the small village.\" Just on the other side of the Ganges was a small village.\nHis disciples said, \"Are you mad or something? People come to Kashi, the whole of Kashi is full of people who have come here to die. You have lived your whole life in Kashi, what kind of nonsense is this? And the village you are pointing to is a condemned village; people say whoever dies there is born again as a donkey.\"\nBut Kabir said, \"I will go to that village, and I will die in that village. I want to enter paradise on my own worth, not because of Kashi. And I know my worth.\"\nThey had to take him. Against their will they had to take him to the other side, and he died there.\nThis man is so certain of his worth.\nHe was a weaver. It is not certain whether he was Hindu or Mohammedan because his name, Kabir, is Mohammedan; it is one of the names of God. He was found on the Ganges -- a small child, just a few days old, abandoned by his parents.\nOne great Hindu scholar, Ramananda, had gone for his early bath and he found the child.\nAnd he could not be so hard as to leave him there, so he brought him into his ashram --\nhe had an ashram and hundreds of disciples. So the child was brought up by a\nbrahmin.\nBut on his hand was written the namèKabir'. He didn't change his name.\nIt is still uncertain whether he was Mohammedan or Hindu. He never cared.\nOnce there was a great conference in Kashi. It used to convene only after each twelve years to decide about certain spiritual matters, problems which may have arisen about scriptures. Naturally Kabir was not invited because it was not even certain that he was a Hindu, and only brahmins could be allowed.\nBut about a certain point in the scriptures they could not come to a conclusion. One man said, \"You have to forget about whether Kabir is Hindu or Mohammedan, it doesn't matter. He is the only man alive in Kashi who can immediately decide the meaning, the insight of this scriptural passage.\"\nI am telling you about this incident for a particular reason.\nAt that very time Meera was also in Kashi, she had just come. She was traveling around India.\nReluctantly, the scholars asked Kabir: \"You are invited to the conference because we are stuck at a certain point, and nobody has the experience. And there are many people in the conference who say, `Kabir has the experience.' This passage needs to be interpreted only by one who has known himself; so although we are not certain whether you are Hindu or Mohammedan or brahmin, still we are inviting you, against all precedents.\"\nKabir said, \"There is a condition: I will come only if Meera is also invited.\"\nNow that was even more difficult for the male chauvinist mind -- a woman! What does a woman have to do with it? When wise scholars are deciding things, a woman's function is in the house.\nKabir said, \"Then Kabir is not coming. Kabir can come only if Meera is allowed to come.\nWhen you are ready to allow Kabir -- whose caste is not certain, whose religion is not certain -- what is the problem about Meera? -- because she can also decide. Even if I don't come, she also has the same experience as I have.\"\nAnd the scholars had to agree.\nThis has happened only once, that a woman and a non-brahmin joined with the highest hierarchy of Hinduism to interpret their scriptures. And their interpretation was accepted.\nKabir's disciples asked, \"From where did you get such authority?\"\nHe said, \"If existence accepts me, if existence gives me life, that is enough to prove that I am needed, that existence cannot do without me.\"\nSo drop the idea of unworthiness, it is simply an idea. And with the dropping of it, you are under the sky -- there is no question of doors, everything is open, all directions are open. That you are is enough to prove that existence needs you, loves you, nourishes you, respects you.\nThe idea of unworthiness is created by the social parasites. Drop that idea.\nAnd be grateful to existence -- because it only creates people who are worthy, it never creates anything which is worthless.\nIt only creates people who are needed.\nMy emphasis is that every sannyasin should respect himself and feel grateful to existence that he has been required to be here at this juncture of time and space.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHERE IS A SUFI SAYING THAT \"NO HUMAN BEING CAN AVOID HIS FATE.\nTHIS IS A WORLD OF LIMITATIONS -- BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO GAIN A TASTE OF THE LIMITLESS, DESPITE THIS FACT.\"\nA FAMOUS ASTROLOGER AND COMPOSER, DANE RUDHYAR, WHO WAS A FRIEND OF GEORGE GURDJIEFF, SAID, \"THE OLD IDEA OF\nASTROLOGY --\nTHAT EXPERIENCE HAPPENS TO HUMAN BEINGS -- IS NOT TRUE. ON THE\nCONTRARY, HUMAN BEINGS HAPPEN TO THEIR EXPERIENCE.\"\nMY OBSERVATION IS THAT EVERY ASTROLOGER WHO IS COURAGEOUS\nENOUGH WILL FIND OUT THAT GURDJIEFF IS TRUE WHEN HE SAYS, \"MAN\nIS A MACHINE.\"\nON THE OTHER HAND, MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU, CHRIST, AND\nBUDDHIST TEACHERS HAS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LIMITLESS\nIN THE MIDST OF LIMITATIONS. WHILE RELIGIOUSNESS OPENS THE DOORS\nTO THE LIMITLESS, ASTROLOGY STUDIES THE WORLD OF FORMS AND\nLIMITATIONS. AND WITHOUT THE FIRST, THE SECOND COULD HAVE\nBECOME INTOLERABLE TO ME. NOW, SLOWLY SLOWLY, THE FORMLESS\nAND THE FORM SEEM TO MEET AND MARRY INSIDE OF ME. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nGeorge Gurdjieff is right when he says that man is a machine, but by `man' he means all those who are living unconsciously, who are not aware, who are not awake, who do not respond to reality but only react.\nNinety-nine point nine percent of human beings come in the category of machines. With these machines, astrology is possible.\nIn fact, predictions can be made, guarantees can be issued only about machines. A watch can be guaranteed for five years, a car can be guaranteed for a certain time -- because we know the capacity of the machine, how much it can work, how long it can go. Its scope is limited. And it cannot do anything on its own accord, it can only react to situations --\nwhich are almost predictable.\nFor example, at a certain stage a boy and a girl will become sexually mature, and their hormones and their biology will start forcing them towards each other. They will call it love because nobody wants to be categorized as a machine. But two machines cannot love, two machines can only be together, can struggle, can stumble against each other.\nAnd it is not coincidence that in every language, love is called `falling in love'. It is an unconscious process, it is a fall. You cannot answer why you love a certain person.\nAnd now the science of human biology, genetics, has grown much more mature. It is possible to inject hormones into you which can make all your love disappear, or which can make you a great lover. But these are hormones; it is chemical. You are not consciously involved in it.\nIt happened in Bombay nearabout twenty years ago -- an astrologer came to see me. I told him, \"You will be disappointed. Astrology won't work with me.\"\nHe said, \"It is not a question of you or anybody else, there are no exceptions in astrology.\"\nI said, \"Then do one thing: Write down twelve things that I am going to do in one year.\nYou keep one copy and I will keep one copy, I will write on both copies that these are the twelve things that I will not do. That's the only way to decide whether your astrology works or not.\"\nHe got a little afraid because he had not thought of this possibility.\nI said, \"Even to the extent... if you say that I will live, I will die -- just to make the point clear that astrology won't work with me.\"\nHe said, \"Now I now have to study more in depth. And after three days I will be coming back.\"\nTwenty years have passed; he has not come.\nAnd whenever I have been in Bombay, I have inquired, \"Phone the astrologer and ask when that in-depth study is going to be complete -- because twenty years have passed.\nHas he dropped the idea?\"\nIf you are enlightened, then astrology cannot function for you. Then you can love, then you can do, then you can act, then you have a certain mastery over your own being.\nBut unconscious, you are just moving hither and thither as the wind blows.\nAnd anybody who has studied human nature deeply.… There are many astrological schools which have studied for centuries how the mechanical man works. They have come to certain conclusions, and their conclusions are almost always correct. If they are incorrect, that means the astrologer is not well prepared, his studies in human nature and unconscious behavior are not complete.\nBut the moment you start becoming conscious, you start becoming really a man -\n- not a machine.\nWhen Gurdjieff said for the first time that man is a machine, it shocked many people. But he was saying the truth. Only the truth is applicable just to 99.9 percent of people -- 0.1\npercent of people have to be left out of it. Gautam Buddha was born.…\nAnd in the East those were the days of the highest possibilities for human genius. In all directions in which the East was working, it reached the very peak, the climax... to such an extent that you cannot find a new Yoga posture; Patanjali exhausted all the possibilities of postures, the science is complete. Five thousand years have passed, and in five thousand years thousands of people have tried but\nthere is no way to find a new posture.\nYou cannot find a new sex posture; Vatsyayana has completed all the postures possible --\nand a few which may even look impossible!\nShiva completed all the techniques -- one hundred and twelve. You can play with new combinations, but nothing new is possible.\nAstrology was at its peak.\nAnd as Gautam Buddha was born, the son of a great king, the king immediately called the best astrologers. They all studied the birth chart and they all remained silent.\nOnly one -- a young astrologer -- said to the king, \"These people are silent because this is a strange boy, and we cannot be decisive about him. There are two possibilities\" -- and astrology never speaks in that way. Astrology means you have to predict what is going to be; you are not there to predict all the possibilities -- that will not be prediction.\nBut the young astrologer said, \"These are old wise people, they will not even say this. I am young and I can stick my neck out, I can risk, because I don't have any reputation.\nThere are two possibilities: either this boy will become an emperor of the world, a chakravartin, or he will become an enlightened, awakened liberated soul -- but then he will be a beggar. Either he will be the emperor of the whole world or he will be just a beggar with a begging bowl in his hands. And it is not in our power to say what the outcome will be.\"\nAnd all the old astrologers agreed. \"The young man is right. We were silent because this is not the way astrology functions -- we say, `this is definitely going to happen.' But about this boy we cannot say. And the possibilities are so diametrically opposite -- either the emperor or the beggar.\"\nAnd that's what happened.\nThe king asked all those wise astrologers, \"Then tell me how to protect him so\nthat he does not move towards becoming a beggar but becomes the world emperor. That has been my lifelong desire. I could not achieve it -- but he has the possibility. So just tell me how to prevent him from becoming a beggar.\"\nThey gave all their advice, and their advice turned out to create just the opposite to what they intended. They had suggested, \"Give him all the luxuries. Don't let him know about death, old age. Don't let him know about sannyas. He should not be given time to think,\n`What is the meaning of life?' Keep him engaged continuously in singing, in dancing, wine and women, drown him completely.\"\nAnd that's what created the trouble -- because for twenty-nine years he was kept so isolated from the world, so ignorant about the ordinary reality of the world where people become sick, people become old, people die, there are sannyasins, there are seekers of truth... If he had been allowed from the very beginning, he would have become immune -\n- from the very beginning he would have seen that people become old, people become sick, a few people become sannyasins. But for twenty-nine years he was kept completely aloof.\nAnd after twenty-nine years when he came into contact with the world -- one day, one has to come into contact with the world -- then it was a great shock. He could not believe his eyes that people become old; he could not believe that life is going to end in death. He could not believe that he had been kept in darkness while there were people searching to find the meaning of life, trying to find out whether there was something immortal in man or not.\nThe shock would not have been so much. It is not such a shock for anybody else\n-- from the very childhood, everything... one becomes, slowly slowly, accustomed. But for him the shock was tremendous.\nThat very night he left the palace as a sannyasin in search of truth.\nThe father was trying to save him from the begging bowl, and that's what he adopted that night.\nIt was possible he might have become Alexander the Great if he had not been kept in darkness. But in a way it was good, because Alexander the Great and his\nkind have not helped human consciousness.\nThis man alone, with his begging bowl, raised humanity more than anybody else towards the stars, towards immortality, towards truth.\nAbout such a man, astrology is not possible.\nIt is good to accept that you are functioning like a machine. Don't feel offended -\n-\nbecause if you feel offended, you will defend yourself and you will remain what you are.\nTry to understand your behavior -- is it mechanical or not?\nSomebody insults you -- how do you react? Is that reaction mechanical or conscious? Do you think before you become angry? Do you meditate for a moment before you respond?\nPerhaps what the man has said is right, and if you had not got angry immediately, instantly, without giving a small gap for meditation, you might have been grateful to the man rather than being angry -- \"You are right.\"\nIn fact, things which are right hurt you much more. Lies don't hurt you at all.\nJust the other day, Nirvano brought a newspaper cutting. A Western traveler coming from Tibet gave his first press conference, and in the press conference he said, \"My greatest experience was meeting with Bhagwan in Tibet.\"\nNow people can lie like anything, and whoever reads it will believe it. The printed word has a certain impact on people.\nJust a few days before, there was another news item -- no ifs and no buts, a certainty --\nthat \"Bhagwan is going to appear in Israel very soon. He has decided to become converted to Judaism, and after converting to Judaism, he will declare himself to be the reincarnation of Moses.\"\nNow what can you do with these people? You can laugh, but you cannot be angry. You can enjoy, you can thank them for their imagination. These are the people who keep the world going!\nJust watch your actions, and try not to be mechanical. Try to do something that you have never done before in the same situation.\nThat's what the meaning is when Jesus says, \"When somebody slaps your face, give him the other cheek too.\" The real meaning is, simply act non-mechanically\n-- because the mechanical thing would be when somebody slaps you, you slap him. Or if you are not capable of slapping him right now, then wait for the right moment. But to give him the other cheek is behaving non-mechanically, is behaving very consciously.\nBut people can make anything mechanical.\nI have heard about a Christian saint who was continuously quoting the same thing: \"Love your enemy, and if somebody slaps you on one cheek give him the other too.\"\nOne day a man who was against Christianity found the saint alone, hit him hard on one of his cheeks, looked into the eyes of the saint.… For a moment the saint wanted to hit him back -- but being a saint, remembering all his teachings and remembering that this man sits in his congregation in the front, he gave him the other cheek, thinking that he would not hit it. The man hit him harder on the other cheek! -- and that very moment the saint jumped on the man, hitting him hard on the nose. The man said, \"What are you doing?\nYou are a Christian, you have to love your enemy.\"\nHe said, \"Forget all about it. Jesus only talked about two cheeks -- about the third, I am free. Now there is no third cheek to give you. And he has not said that when he hits you on the second, give him your nose too!\"\nBecause Jesus has not said why.…\nGautam Buddha in one of his sermons said, \"Try to be non-mechanical as much as possible. If somebody hits you, insults you, humiliates you, forgive him seven times. Be conscious.\"\nJesus was saying only one time -- because you have only two cheeks, and one he has hit already. Only one is left, so there is not much.… Buddha is saying seven times.\nOne of the disciples stood up and said, \"What about the eighth? Seven times we will keep patience, but what about the eighth?\"\nEven Buddha was silent for a moment. So deep is man's mechanicalness He\nsaid,\n\"Then change it, make it seventy-seven times.\"\nThe man said, \"You can make it any number, but the question will remain the same --\nwhat about the seventy-eighth time? We can wait seventy-seven times \"\nYou can behave in a saintly way, but if it is mechanical it doesn't change anything.\nBe alert and see that yesterday you have done the same thing. Today make a little difference -- you are not a machine.\nYou said the same thing to your wife, make a little difference -- you are not a machine.\nAnd if in twenty-four hours time you continually go on changing, slowly slowly you will slip out of the mechanical behavior and a consciousness will arise in you.\nThat consciousness makes you really human. Before, you only appear human; in reality you are not.\nBeyond Enlightenment Chapter #32\nChapter title: Truth has to wait but not to wait forever 4 November 1986 pm in\nArchive\ncode:\n8611045\nShortTitle:\nENLIGH32\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n133\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nMANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN YOUR WORLD DURING THE PAST\nFOURTEEN MONTHS THAT WERE VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND LOOKED\nSTRANGE FOR A SPIRITUAL GROUP.\nJUST READING THE FACTS AND FIGURES SET FORTH IN THE 156- PAGE, TWO-SERIES ARTICLE IN RECENT ISSUES OF THE NEW YORKER COULD\nMAKE MOST PEOPLE ANGRY.\nTHOUGH SOME SANNYASINS LEFT, I NOTICE THAT MANY OF US,\nINCLUDING MYSELF, WERE UNDISTURBED IN OUR INNER BEINGS. WITH\nNO REGRETS, MANY OF US JUMPED INTO THE NEW WAY, THE NEW ADVENTURE.\nFAMILY, FRIENDS, STRANGERS, ARE EITHER CURIOUS ABOUT THIS OR\nSUSPECT WE'RE BRAINWASHED DUMMIES, OR IRRESPONSIBLE. IS THERE\nANY WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS INNER TRUST THAT HAPPENS TO A DISCIPLE\nWITH A MASTER? IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ANY OF US TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING\nBEYOND THESE FACTS AND FIGURES? -- THE LOVE, THE FUN, THE\nMYSTERY OF SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION THAT WE ARE SO FORTUNATE\nTO PARTICIPATE IN WITH YOU? SHOULD I EVEN BOTHER, OR JUST\nCONCENTRATE ON YOU AND THE INNER JOURNEY AND IGNORE THE\nCURIOUS AND THE SKEPTICS?\nIt would have been very easy if life were only facts and figures -- easy but boring; easy but flat; easy but not worth living.\nAnd mind is concerned only with facts and figures.\nIt is a great blessing of existence that mind is not all, that there is much more to life which cannot be confined to facts, explanations, theories. Something mysterious remains always unexplained, and that is the most valuable, the most significant part of life.\nIt is impossible to explain love, trust, beauty, grace, gratitude, silence. All that is meaningful seems to be beyond mind, and all that is meaningless seems to be the boundary of the mind.\nI am reminded of a great Sufi master, Junnaid. One day one of his disciples -- who had managed somehow to trust in Junnaid, who had with effort remained unskeptical -- had gone hunting in the forest. And he saw Junnaid sitting by the side of a beautiful lake with a beautiful woman. From far away he saw, and from far away everything is beautiful --\nand particularly a Mohammedan woman.\nNo Mohammedan woman is ugly -- her face is veiled. It is a great strategy of ugly women against the beautiful; in this way the beautiful are lost.\nAll his repressed suspicions and doubts arose, surfaced -- and it was not only that Junnaid was sitting with the woman; the woman was pouring wine from a flask into a cup for Junnaid.\nAll his trust was shattered, all his love was finished: \"There is a limit to everything. This is going too far. This man is a fraud!\"\nAnd if he had returned without going to Junnaid to say something, he would have remained with the idea that the man was a fraud. He had all the facts, he had seen with his own eyes, he was a witness. He needed no other evidence, no other proof. No argument would have convinced him that he could have been wrong.\nBut Junnaid shouted loudly, \"Don't go back! Come close, because when you come close many facts prove to be fictions. The closer you come, the more fictitious they are. Just come close.\"\nA little bit afraid, but he came.\nJunnaid lifted the veil from the woman's face. She was Junnaid's mother, an old woman.\nAnd he said, \"What about the beautiful woman you had seen? -- and you had seen her with your own eyes. Could you have imagined an old woman, my own mother? It was beyond your imagination.\n\"And take this flask and look closely, taste it; it is pure water, not wine. Just the flask is of the wine.\n\"But you were going with absolute certainty: that this man is a fraud -- women and wine in privacy, in the forest -- and in public he has another face, of a great master.\"\nThe disciple fell at his feet and said, \"Please forgive me.\"\nJunnaid said, \"It is not a question of forgiveness; it is a question of understanding. You have a trust which is forced, and a forced trust is bound to sooner or later go through a breakdown. Your love is an effort, and love cannot be an effort -- either you love or you don't, the question of effort does not arise. You were trying to imitate other disciples, and the path of the truth is not for imitators.\n\"I had come to this place only for you, knowing that you were going hunting and you were bound to come to this lake. You have to start from the beginning, and this time your love has not to be an effort and your trust has not to be something forced. These things are beautiful when they grow naturally -- and when they grow naturally then no facts, no figures can destroy them. They have such tremendous energy of their own that all facts and figures simply evaporate.\"\nFacts are not truths, but just like soap bubbles. Yes, a soap bubble is -- but its existence or non-existence is almost equal.\nTruth has an eternity: it was true, it is true, it will remain true. There is no way for the truth to be otherwise.\nFacts go on changing. Facts depend on interpretations. The same fact can be interpreted in a thousand and one ways. And that's what we are all doing; otherwise, there would be no need of so many religions, so many philosophies, so many ideologies.\nTruth is one.\nThe mystic has no philosophy, the mystic has no ideology -- because he has the truth itself.\nJust look at a few facts and how they can be interpreted not only differently but\nin a diametrically opposite way.\nThe most important Jaina master, Mahavira, lived naked all his life. He renounced the world, his kingdom, he renounced everything -- clothes, shoes. He lived just as a child is born, naked, with nothing in his hands. He did not even carry a begging bowl. He used to make a begging bowl with his own hands. He would not use anything on which one becomes dependent.\nHis ultimate goal was total freedom.\nAnd he was so logically consistent that even to use a small blade -- a razor blade to cut his hair or to shave his beard -- he was not ready. To use scissors or a blade would be a dependency, so he used to pull his hair out with his own hand. It was painful, but he managed.\nHe lived eighty-two years... and he had to pull out the hairs because he was not taking baths. According to his approach, to take a bath is to decorate the body, is to believe in the body -- and the body is nothing but bones, blood, flesh, everything rotten, just covered with skin. What is the point of taking a bath? -- you are not the body. And consciousness needs no cleanliness because it cannot become unclean.\nIn India he has been worshipped by the Jainas for twenty-five centuries as one of the most important mystics of the whole world. And even those who are not of his fold have immense respect for the man.\nBut I bring Sigmund Freud to analyze Mahavira's attitude and character -- the same facts.\nIt is strange that there are thousands of madmen in the insane asylums around the world, and there is a certain kind of madness in which nakedness and pulling out the hair happens together. Those mad people live naked and they pull out their hair -- they don't allow anybody to cut their hair or shave their beards. And the same mad people don't allow themselves to be given showers or baths. Strange.…\nIs Mahavira a madman of the same category?\nOr are these mad people Mahaviras, great masters misunderstood by an insane world?\nSomewhere something has to be decided.\nStrangely enough, these mad people who live naked, pull out their hair, don't take any baths, are absolutely non-violent. They are not dangerous; they never hurt anybody, they never kill anybody. They are very harmless people. And that is the whole philosophy of Mahavira -- non-violence.\nPerhaps he was a madman with a genius, with such a talented intelligence that he made a philosophical standpoint out of his madness.\nNow, who is going to decide?\nThe fact in itself is without any judgment; in itself it says nothing, it is simply a fact.\nAt the moment you start thinking about it, you start creating interpretations, and those interpretations will depend on your attitude. They have nothing to do with the fact.\nBecause I have brought Sigmund Freud in, I cannot allow him to go out so easily. He was the founder of psychoanalysis, and yet he remained a practicing Jew for his whole life, subscribing to all the superstitions of the Jews.\nFor example, circumcision: Every Jewish child... as he is born, the male child is immediately circumcised. Mohammedans are also circumcised but after two or three years, not immediately.\nAnd Jews believe that they are the most intelligent people in the world because of circumcision. It is true that they are perhaps the most intelligent group of people in the world. The whole contemporary world is dominated by Jews: Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein -- these three figures stand out amongst billions of people. Their contribution to human well-being is immense.\nI have told you that forty percent of Nobel prizes go to Jews. That is simply out of all proportion -- forty percent to the small group of Jews, and sixty percent to the rest of the world. Naturally they have more intelligence, you cannot suspect it; it is a fact. And they have this idea that they are so intelligent because of circumcision, and they provide philosophical, logical, scientific proofs for it.\nAnd one never knows, they may be right -- because now many governments of\nthe world are getting ready to pass resolutions that every child born in hospitals should be circumcised. It doesn't matter whether he is Jew or Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan, that is not a question; it is a question of hygiene.\nIt is certainly hygienic. But Jews have a very far-fetched philosophical idea behind it: they say when the child is born... and the genitals are the most sensitive parts. This is recognized by science, by physiology, that the genitals are connected with a certain center in the mind. Strangely enough, the center in the mind that is connected with the genitals is absolutely close to the center for intelligence, they are neighbors. And they have to be very close because there are seven hundred centers in your brain, so they are very close knit.\nJews say that when you cut the skin of the small child, the shock goes to the sex center.\nBut the shock is so much and the child is so delicate that the shock does not remain confined to the sex center -- the shock goes to the nearby center, which is the center of intelligence. And intelligence gets a great impetus which other children are missing, so they are far ahead of anybody else.\nNow the rest of the world has looked upon circumcision as a superstition.\nThe fact is the same, but now they are providing scientific fragments to support it. They also are not absolute proofs, that is why I say far-fetched. But Sigmund Freud also believed in them, and he had not all these facts that I have, because at that time it was not known that the centers of sex and intelligence are very close. Neither was it known that sex is really in the mind and the genitals are only extensions, they are not really the sex organs. They can be bypassed, and you can enjoy a sexual experience without your genitals even knowing about it.\nSigmund Freud never inquired, never raised a question about the Jewish idea of circumcision -- which he should have, because he was a Jew, and his whole work was with sexuality. His whole life was devoted to finding out everything about sexuality, but he bypassed circumcision, he did not talk about it. Others have laughed for centuries.\nI have heard that one bishop and one rabbi lived opposite each other, and naturally there was great competition in everything. One day the bishop purchased a beautiful Chevrolet.\nThe rabbi came out and he said, \"A beautiful car... whose car is this?\"\nAnd the bishop came out with a bucket of water and poured the water on the car. He said,\n\"I have purchased it.\"\nThe rabbi said, \"But what are you doing?\"\nHe said, \"Baptism.\" He was a Christian Baptist. \"Now the car is a Christian Baptist car --\nbaptized.\"\nThis was too much for the rabbi.\nNext day, as the bishop woke up, he saw a beautiful Cadillac sitting in the garage of the rabbi. He was shocked -- because the Chevrolet is a poor man's car in America. The poor peoples' neighborhoods are called \"Chevrolet neighborhoods.\" It is a rich man's car in other countries, but in America the Chevrolet is a poor man's car. But the Cadillac is especially Jewish.\nThe bishop came out and he said, \"How could you manage it?\"\nThe rabbi said, \"God looks after his chosen few.\" And he said, \"Come on -- because there is going to be a ceremony.\"\nThe bishop said, \"What kind of ceremony?\" He said, \"You come inside.\"\nThe bishop came into the garage, and the rabbi went into his house and brought out a big pair of garden scissors. The bishop could not believe -- what is happening? What kind of ceremony...? The rabbi started chanting some mantras in Hebrew, and then finally he cut the exhaust pipe.\nThe bishop asked, \"What are you doing?\"\nHe said, \"Circumcision -- now the car is absolutely Jewish. If you can baptize, what do you think? -- can't we do something to make the car a Jew?\"\nEverybody has been laughing about circumcision.\nBut Sigmund Freud never even raised a question about it. He never raised a single question that goes against Jewish tradition. All his logic, all his reason was used to criticize everybody else.\nI have asked a Jaina saint: \"Sigmund Freud would say these things about Mahavira, although he has not said them, because he knew nothing about Mahavira. But I am absolutely certain he would say these things. Have you something to say about Sigmund Freud, about Jews?\"\nAnd the first thing he said was: \"If the skin on the male genitals was not needed, then existence would not have given it to the child. Existence gives only that which is needed.\nTo remove that skin is egoistic, it is an effort to prove that you are wiser than existence itself. And the very idea that man is wiser than existence is stupid.\"\nI asked him about Jesus -- because I had taken with me a Christian missionary, Stanley Jones, to meet the Jaina saint. And I said, \"Stanley Jones is here, and his criticism against Jaina saints, Buddhist saints, Hindu saints, is that they don't do any service to humanity.\nOn the contrary, they demand that they should be served, worshipped -- that it is their birthright.\n\"People may be dying from starvation -- that is not their concern. Mahavira and Buddha have not opened a single hospital, not a single school for poor children, not a single orphanage, like Mother Teresa. But these people are thought to be great compassionate people. What compassion is there? What do you think about Jesus?\"\nHe said, \"About Jesus? According to us, everything in life is a connected link of cause and effect, the theory of action.\"\nThere are stories that if Mahavira is passing on the road and a thorn is there, the thorn will jump out of the road -- because Mahavira has finished all evil actions. Now no pain can be given to him by existence. It looks logical: if existence is deciding rewards and punishments, certainly the thorn must jump out of the road.\nMohammedans say -- because Mohammed was in Arabia... hot sun, no clouds, no shade, no trees. But a beautiful cloud always moved over Mohammed, wherever he went --\nbecause he was finished with all evil acts. That's why he was chosen by God as his best messenger; he had become so pure that he could be a vehicle. Now it is God's duty to protect him. In the hot burning sun, a cool breeze surrounds him, and a big cloud goes on keeping him in shadow.\nThe Jaina saint said, \"Jesus being crucified proves that he must have done some very evil acts in his past life. Crucifixion was the punishment.\"\nIt has nothing to do with Jews crucifying him or the Romans crucifying him. Those are the visible facts, but the invisible truth is that he must have committed something really heinous -- murder, rape -- and the result is crucifixion. So crucifixion is not something to be worshipped; it is a condemnation.\nNow for the Christian the same fact, the crucifixion of Jesus, makes him the greatest man on the earth because he suffered for humanity, he was crucified for you; to save you he gave his own life. That is their interpretation.\nBut the Jainas, Hindus and Buddhists will all explain that \"He is suffering from many past lives of crimes. He is not giving his life to save anybody -- because we don't see anybody saved. Who is saved? He could not even save himself.\"\nOne thing should always be remembered: don't be bothered about facts. They can be interpreted this way or that way very convincingly, but facts belong to the mundane world.\nTruth is the thing you should concentrate on.\nYou have mentioned the New Yorker article about me and the commune. Perhaps they may not have ever written such a big article before -- one hundred and fifty-six pages.\nAnd what they call facts are only the facts that the government has supplied to them.\nThey have not asked me; otherwise for every fact there is a counter-fact. But it is easy not to ask both parties.\nI have heard that Mulla Nasruddin in his old age became an honorary magistrate. His first case came up. He heard one side, and started writing the judgment.\nThe court clerk could not believe what was happening. He whispered in his ear,\n\"Honorable magistrate, what are you doing? You have not heard the other side yet. They are waiting.\"\nMulla Nasruddin said, \"I am not going to hear anybody, because right now I am absolutely clear what the situation is, and if I hear the other side also I will become confused. And out of confusion, judgment will be very difficult.\"\nThe New Yorker is simply presenting one side.\nI will give you a few facts on the other side so you can see how facts should not be decisive.\nThe land that we purchased for the commune had been for sale for almost half a century, and nobody had purchased it -- because it was a desert. Not a single flower ever blossomed there, no cultivation was ever done; it was just a useless wasteland. And it was big -- one hundred and twenty-six square miles, eighty- four thousand acres.\nWe purchased the land. The man was very happy, because he had lost hope that the land could ever be sold.\nAnd the government was asking him to give it to them for three million dollars. It was almost a small country -- one hundred and twenty-six square miles, three times bigger than Manhattan. And the man was just going to say yes to the government as we entered the scene.\nWe immediately offered him six million dollars. He could not believe it -- from three million to six million! Immediately everything was settled.\nAnd this was the beginning of conflict with the government.\nBut if the government had really been interested, they could have offered more. They should not have felt offended, it was a simple business matter. And it is not their land either.\nThe whole world has forgotten completely that the real Americans are the red Americans who are living in reservations in the forests. They have been forced to live almost in concentration camps, an American version of the German concentration camps -- far better, because the German concentration camp was barbed wire, guns all around, very crude.\nThe American concentration camp is very sophisticated -- no barbed wire, no guards, you cannot say that this is a concentration camp. But this is a concentration camp -- of a higher order, of a more subtle and delicate quality.\nWhat they have done is to give every red Indian a pension -- because America belongs to them, it is their country. They don't have any work, but they get enough pension. All they do is to go on producing more children, because the more children they have, the more pension they will get. Each individual gets a pension.\nBut you should understand that when you have no work and enough money, what are you going to do? They gamble, they are all drunkards, all kinds of drugs, prostitution, and no worries about anything -- every month the salary is there. Salary for nothing, salary for remaining silent about the fact that America belongs to them, that the people who are known as Americans are not Americans. Somebody is from England, somebody is from Italy, somebody is from France, somebody is from Holland, somebody is from Germany, somebody is from Switzerland -- from all the European countries, but nobody is an American. They are all foreigners.\nAnd my first conflict with the government was that I told it exactly the same way I am telling you: that the American president is as much a foreigner as I am a foreigner. The only difference is that he has been here perhaps for two generations, three generations --\nhe is a two hundred year-old foreigner. I am fresh. And the fresh is always better than the old and rotten.\nI told them: Neither does the land belong to you nor does the land belong to us.\nAnd we purchased the land, we paid money; you invaded the land, you killed people, innocent people. You are criminals.\nIf anybody needs permission to live in America, it is you -- from the American president to the last American beggar. And if you really mean what you say in your constitution --\nthat you are for democracy, for freedom -- if you are sincere and honest, then give the country back to the red Indians. It belongs to them. And apply for your green cards. If they want you here, you can be here; otherwise go home.\nAnd you have killed, you have invaded, you are criminals. We have simply purchased.\nSometimes you have also purchased, but your purchase was simply a facade. For example, New York -- the whole New York area was purchased for thirty silver pieces. Is this business? Do you think it was done by people willingly, or was it just because at the point of the bayonet, at gunpoint they had to sign: \"We sell the land for thirty silver pieces.\"\nThe conflict started because I said: \"Not one of you is any different from the people in my commune. We are newcomers; you came a little earlier. And you have committed all kinds of crimes; we have simply purchased the land. And you were there, you could have purchased it by offering more money -- it was a simple business matter.\"\nBut the American government will not say this.\nAnd America must remain the only country in the world where people like the poor red Americans cannot revolt. It is such a cunning strategy that you are giving them money.\nThey think, \"Revolt? for what? We are getting money, enough money, no work... enjoy, dance, sing, take all kinds of drugs. No problems of worrying about poverty or anything -\n- why bother about revolution?\" The very idea is not possible.\nAnd they are all drunkards, opium addicted, lotus eaters. They are not in a position to fight a revolution. Their revolution has been killed, their spirit has been killed by money.\nBecause I said it clearly.…\nAnd because the land we purchased had belonged to an ancient red Indian tribe which lived just nearby in a forest And they had a prophecy from the old days:\nthat a man from the East, with his followers wearing red clothes, would come to this land and free them from the slavery imposed on them by the invaders.\nBy coincidence, my people were wearing red clothes; by coincidence, I was coming from the East.\nAnd red Indians started coming, saying that \"We have been waiting -- because this prophecy we have heard for generations.\"\nThese were the fears the government would never talk about.\nI could have provoked the red Indians against the whole American government, I could have created a revolution -- this was their fear. They wanted to destroy me and the commune as quickly as possible.\nThe land had never produced anything, but they said that it was farmland; hence, we could not make more than twenty houses, twenty farmhouses. And we fought and we said, \"You have to come and prove -- in fifty years what has been produced? If it is farmland, then something must have been cultivated. Just because you have written in your papers... and we don't know when you have written it. You may have written it just now, just to harass us. You have to prove what kind of cultivation has been happening here. If this is farmland, we will cultivate it; but such a big land area cannot be cultivated by a small group living in twenty houses. This much land needs at least five thousand people to make it lush green, to make lakes, reservoirs -- because everything has to depend on the rainwater. And tremendous effort is needed to make roads, houses.\"\nBut they would not change the zoning -- which was simply stupid, because we were not going to destroy their farmland. We were creating farmland from a desert, we were changing the desert into an oasis.\nSo they went on creating legal problems, and for five years we went on fighting -\n- and we were winning in every court, because the facts were so clear.\nWhen they saw that they could not win legally, then they started behaving illegally.\nAnd when a government itself starts behaving illegally, then it becomes very difficult to fight -- a small minority of five thousand people. The government was fighting, the Christian church was fighting, and nobody could say what harm we were doing to them, what harm we had done.\nThe nearest American town was twenty miles away from us. We were living and doing our own thing. But they became so much afraid.…\nThe fear had unconscious reasons.\nAmerica does not belong to them, and they are talking about democracy, they are talking about liberty, they are talking about freedom, they are talking about the rights of man.\nAnd they have taken all of the land from the poor natives, and they have destroyed them in such a sophisticated way as has not been done anywhere else.\nThere is no hope for the red Indians for two reasons: one, they are not in their senses, they are continuously drunk, continuously unconscious -- fighting, murdering each other.\nSecondly, slavery is paying well -- without working you are getting a salary. To fight against this government means you will lose your salary and you will have all kinds of problems -- so why bother?\nAnd because I said things exactly... and I invited the president, the governor, the attorney general of America to come and see, to show us what cultivation they had done on this land. And we had transformed the whole land.\nRather than praising us, they wanted us to destroy the commune and leave America.\nIt seems they loved the desert so much that now they have made it desert again.\nPerhaps they need a third world war to make the whole of America a desert. If they love the desert so much, their wishes should be fulfilled.\nBut these facts that they have produced after one year... Where was this New Yorker when I was there to reply? Now they are writing facts and figures.\nAnd they have not consulted the other party at all, to ask, \"What are your facts and what are your figures? How has the government misbehaved with you? How has the government proved to be fascist, violent, crude, primitive, undemocratic...?\"\nThey should have asked us -- because we have suffered.\nBut the press is either in the hands of the church or in the hands of a political party, or in the hands of the government, or in the hands of rich people.\nThe man who came first into the conflict was the ex-vice-president Rockefeller -\n-\nbecause he was planning that the whole of Oregon should become a federal state. The federal government owns half of the land of Oregon, and their desire was to have all of the land in Oregon to create shelters in case of a nuclear war. And Oregon is perfectly the right place -- not very populated, could easily be converted into a vast shelter in case of nuclear war.\nWhen we entered the state, the first person who became annoyed was Rockefeller --\nbecause now that one hundred and twenty-six square miles could in no way become federal land.\nIt was he who said in a press conference that, \"This commune is an independent country within a country, and this cannot be tolerated.\"\nIf they had asked us... It was a simple thing. They could have given us land somewhere else, we would have moved the commune. Or from the very beginning they could have told us, \"We are ready to give you another piece of land.\" There was no problem; to us it was the same.\nBut these people have faces of one kind, they say one thing, and they do something else.\nAnd they are thinking still something else -- you never know exactly what is in their minds, what they are doing, what their purpose is.\nThey accepted our right to be a city -- and it was accepted by the court, three\njudges.\nOne judge was against us, was a fanatic Christian. But seeing that two of the judges were ready -- and his being against us would be useless, he also signed, and we became a city.\nNow that was the most difficult thing for them to swallow: that against the president, against the whole government, we won the case and we became a city.\nYou will be surprised, in the twentieth century.… The one judge who was in our favor was a Mormon. They are very good people, a sect of Christians, but very honest and sincere. And they have suffered very much in America at the hands of other Christians because of certain of their ideologies.…\nOne idea they have is that the head of the Mormons is in direct contact with God, with no pope, no mediator in between. The Mormon head has a direct communication line with God. This is not acceptable to Christians -- you are bypassing the pope.\nThey killed the first Mormon founder, and because they killed him they consolidated the Mormons, and they had to give them a city. The same story was being repeated again, so they became afraid. Now Mormons have a city -- one of the most beautiful in America --\nSalt Lake City.\nThis one judge was a Mormon. And a trick was played: the head of the Mormons informed him that he had been chosen by God to resign from his post and go to Nigeria to serve humanity.\nI informed that judge that, \"This is simple politics. They want to remove you from the post because when you are removed... One person is against us, one person is half-half --\nhe will be on the side of whoever is in power. It was because of you and your sincerity, your fairness that we got the city. Now you are leaving us in the dumps!\"\nAnd what a stupid idea. Billions of people in the world, and God has chosen this poor man to resign from his post and go to Nigeria for one year. But they are\nsuch simple people that they believed that it was God's order and they could not go against it.\nSo he resigned, and immediately they appointed a fanatic Christian.\nThe same court that had given us the sanction to be a city, after six months denied that we were a city.\nAnd the simple trick was that they removed the man who would not do anything wrong, and replaced him with a man who was an absolutely fanatical Christian. They completely forgot their own laws, their own constitution, and they did everything against their constitution.\nFor two years continuously there was a rumor that they were going to arrest me, but they would not dare to enter the campus of the commune for the simple reason that they knew that unless they killed five thousand sannyasins they would not be able to arrest me. And they were not ready to take that risk -- killing five thousand people, most of them Americans, would condemn their democracy forever.\nThey wanted me in some way to be out of the commune so they could find me alone.\nThat's why they waited for two years.\nAnd we were hearing the rumor continuously, so by and by it became accepted that this was just a rumor, they didn't have the courage.\nThey had their National Guard just twenty miles away in the American town, every day collecting more and more army forces, so that if there was a need they could be ready to kill five thousand people.\nBut once they could get me out of the commune, things became easy for them.\nWithout any arrest warrant, they arrested me and five sannyasins who were with me. That is absolutely illegal. They could not even show the cause; not even for three days in court could they prove anything to show why they had arrested me.\nStill they would not set bail.\nThese are the facts and figures. The government was pressuring the magistrate: \"If you want to be promoted to federal judge, don't give this man bail.\" So all five sannyasins were given bail; only I was retained.\nAnd the government attorney said in the court, \"We have not been able to prove any charge; still, the government asks that bail should not be granted for this man because he is very intelligent\" -- I heard for the first time that to be intelligent is criminal -- \"and he has thousands of friends.\"\nI had never thought that these things were enough to be a criminal; if that is enough to be a criminal, then Jesus Christ must be the greatest criminal in the world -- because half of the world is Christian. And thirdly, that I had resources enough that I could jump bail --\neven if it were ten million dollars' bail, I could jump it.\nAnd this shows the poverty and the weakness The greatest power of the world\n-- you have all your armies and all your nuclear weapons and all your police forces, and you cannot manage to prevent a man from crossing the country.… Then all your power is impotent.\nBut the reality was that the woman magistrate was not interested in anything else, she was interested in becoming a federal judge.\nEven the jailer did not think that I would go back to jail, he thought that there would be no reason -- \"They don't have an arrest warrant, they don't have any cause, so you will be released.\" So he brought my clothes and everything in his car so that \"I can free you direct from court; there is no need to come back to the jail.\"\nWhen he had to take me back, he was annoyed. He said, \"In my whole life I have not seen such unfairness. The attorney could not prove -- and he accepts that he has not been able to prove in three days of continuous arguing -- anything against this man. Still the government wants \"\nWho is the government? The government was only a part in the case.\nAnd against an individual, the government forces the magistrate -- bribes, blackmails.…\nThe jailer told me, \"The reality is that that woman has been told that if she gives you bail\n-- which is your right -- she will not be promoted to federal judge. And she wants to become a federal judge.\"\nAnd within just three days she was a federal judge.\nThese journalists should think not only of those who have power, but also of those who don't have power, and they should be guards against injustice.\nThey had formed one hundred and thirty-six crimes against me -- a man who never leaves the house. I have not gone out of this house for three months, not even into the garden; how can I manage one hundred and thirty-six crimes?\nBut the government attorneys told my attorneys, \"If you don't accept at least two crimes, then Bhagwan's life will be in danger.\" That was the last blackmail. \"If you want to put his life in danger, you can go for trial\" -- this is just when the court case was going to start, five minutes before. \"It is better you accept and convince Bhagwan to accept any two counts\" -- just to save the government's face, so that they can be right: I must have committed a crime, because I have accepted. And the threat was, \"If you don't accept, then bail will be cancelled and the case can go on for ten to twenty years -- it is in the hands of the government. And there is every risk for the life of Bhagwan. So if you want to save him, you try some way to convince him to accept.\"\nMy attorneys came with tears in their eyes, and they said, \"We have never seen such blackmail -- and the blackmail is being done by the government -- a clearcut threat. So you accept two counts. And they don't want you to be in America more than fifteen minutes longer. Accept two of the charges and your plane is ready at the airport, you immediately move out of America, and for five years you cannot re-enter.\" My whole idea was to refuse.\nBut I looked at my attorneys and I looked at my sannyasins all over the world...\nAnd I had heard that a few sannyasins were not even eating. For the twelve days I had been in jail, a few sannyasins had not been eating at all, they were fasting.\nAnd I am not a rigid man. And I am not a serious man either.\nSo I said, \"There is no problem. Don't be worried -- I accept. And outside the court, just in front of the courthouse, I will announce to the world press that this is blackmail.\"\nAnd it was true that they were ready to kill me, because as I reached the jail to pick up my things, they had planted a bomb under my chair. It did not explode because it was a time bomb.\nAnd I reached there early -- because I had accepted immediately. I said, \"There is no point.\" I said, \"Whatever crimes they want, I have committed. I don't even need to know what those crimes are.\" So within five minutes the case was over.\nThey were thinking I would reach there nearabout five, and I reached there just nearabout one o'clock. So the timing was not right. And as I left the jail, they had to remove the bomb. And they have to accept it -- now, in jail nobody can put a bomb except for the government, nobody else can reach there.\nThe American jail... first you have to pass three big gates, which are all automatic, electric gates. You cannot open them, they open only with remote control buttons. When one gate opens, the other two remain closed. And the second opens only when the first is closed. After three gates, then there are offices.\nAnd the room where my clothes were to be given to me was in the most interior part of the building. It would be impossible for anybody from the outside to reach there and plant a bomb.\nThe bomb was planted by the government. They must have thought that if I refused to accept the crimes, then it would be better to finish me rather than carry on for years with a case which they were going to lose -- because they don't have any evidence, they don't have any proof.\nAll those one hundred and thirty-six crimes are their imagination, and nothing else -- and this has been accepted by the attorney general just now, a few days ago.\nIn a press conference, he was asked, \"Why has Bhagwan not been put into jail?\"\nAnd he said, \"Because he has not committed any crime, and we don't have any proof of any crime.\"\nThis same man was standing in court with the list of one hundred and thirty-six crimes.\nAnd this man is the right-hand man of president Ronald Reagan; they are boyhood friends, they were both actors in Hollywood. And when Reagan became president he called him and made him the attorney general of America; now he is the highest legal authority in America. So it is not possible that whatever he is doing is not known to Ronald Reagan.\nIt is a conspiracy in the White House.\nJournalists should gather a little courage, and when they start writing stories about facts and figures they should look at the other side also. Just put both sides; don't give your judgment. Let the people decide.\nAnd truth has a quality of its own: if both sides are placed before you without any prejudice, you will be able to figure out what is true and what is false.\nAnd it has helped the whole movement around the world. Those whose trust was forced, whose love was managed, naturally have to fall out of my world, from my people.\nBut it has been a fire test for those who really love and trust me. Their trust has become stronger, their love has become deeper. And thousands of new people have come into the movement. Seeing that against a single man... the whole world and the whole worlds'\ngovernments are against him -- it is not possible that the man can be wrong.\nOtherwise, there is no need for so many governments to be against me. They can simply refute me, their theologians can refute me, their legal systems can prove me wrong.\nBecause they cannot do anything, now they have come down to the lowest. Ronald Reagan and the people who are cooperating with him have sunk to the status of terrorists.\nNow, putting a bomb against a man who is under your protection in the jail -- this is pure inhumanity.\nAnd existence will not tolerate it, existence will not forgive it, existence will not forget it.\nAnd you will see every day these people disappearing from the scene.\nTruth has to wait, but not to wait forever. It is patient, it is patient because it knows its victory is certain.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"45117","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/beyond_enlightenment/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/beyond_enlightenment/>Beyond Enlightenment</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: The alchemy of enlightenment</h1><div class=post-meta>212 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;45117 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Beyond_Enlightenment/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-the-alchemy-of-enlightenment><span id=bookmark6>‌</span>Chapter title: The alchemy of enlightenment<span id=bookmark7>‌</span></h2><h3 style=padding-top:15pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=october-1986-pm-in>29 October 1986 pm in</h3><p>Archive code:</p><p>8610295</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>ENLIGH26</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>108</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SINCE MY CHILDHOOD, I HAVE SEEN YOU AS A BUDDHA, EVEN BEFORE</p><p>YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT I SAW YOU AS A BUDDHA -- THE SAME SERENITY, THE

BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, BUDDHAM</p><p>SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI, BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI.</p><p>Narendra, you are almost right. But remember my emphasis on the word
almost.</p><p>And this is true not only about me, this is true about everybody else
too: Everybody is by nature a divine being, an awakened soul, a Gautam
Buddha, who has just fallen asleep for a while, has just forgotten
himself for a moment and is lost in dreams, beautiful dreams of
ambition, desire, success... to be someone special in the world, to
leave footprints behind.</p><p>The moment your dream is broken, your sleep is gone, suddenly you are
in for a great surprise, perhaps the greatest surprise: that the
treasure you have been looking for is within you, that the paradise you
have been searching for is within</p><p>you, that there is no God who can drive you out of the Garden of Eden
because the Garden of Eden is your very being. At the most you can
forget it but you cannot lose it. And once you recognize it, then life
becomes really hilarious; you can laugh at your own efforts and
endeavors, at your whole past that you have spent in searching for
it.</p><p>And the goal of your search was not away from you, not even close to
you. You were the goal, the seeker was the sought.</p><p>And everything that you have done before you became enlightened,
everything that you have been before you became aware of your tremendous
beauty, of your eternal life, will take a different meaning after your
enlightenment. To you and to those who are close to you, the
enlightenment will make such a great difference.</p><p>Narendra has known me since he was a child. But if I had not become
enlightened he would not have asked me this question or raised this
question to himself. Even the very idea of buddhahood might not have
happened to him; he would have known me as a friend, he would have known
me as a loving companion.</p><p>It is the enlightenment that changes the meaning of all his
experiences, gives them a new color, a new light, a new luminosity. The
same incidents start having a totally new meaning.</p><p>I can understand your question, Narendra. Now you look backwards, but
because now you know my enlightenment you can easily conclude that I was
always enlightened, that I was born enlightened; otherwise those
incidents of love, care, understanding would not have taken such a
colorful and meaningful significance. That's why I say you are almost
right.</p><p>I myself can look retrospectively... then everything starts taking on
a new meaning. It would not have had the same meaning. It is the alchemy
of enlightenment that everything has become pure gold, that small and
meaningless things have taken wings and have become great.</p><p>I will give you a few examples which could not have been understood
in the same way they have been understood; there was no possibility, no
hope.</p><p>One of my teachers was very perfectionistic, a great disciplinarian,
a very beautiful man.</p><p>Every year he started his class with the same introduction, because
the students were new; he introduced himself by saying that, "It is
better that I should make clear to you what kind of man I am, so you are
not in the dark and you don't do anything without understanding the
nature of the teacher. First: I don't believe in headaches,
stomachaches, no. Anything that you cannot prove and anything that I
cannot check by myself will not be an excuse to take a holiday or to go
home. You can have a fever, I can feel your fever.</p><p>So remember it -- I simply don't believe in headaches and
stomachaches because there is no proof. Even a physician has to rely
upon the patient, that he has a headache -- he may be lying, or he may
be in illusion. What is the guarantee? How do you know that you are
right?"</p><p>I said, "This is strange; this is going to be difficult" -- because
those were simple excuses to escape from any class, to say that "I have
a strong headache and I want to go home."</p><p>He used to go every evening for a walk. Just by the side of the
school there was a beautiful road, covered from both sides with big
trees, mango trees.</p><p>I said, "Things have to be settled from the very beginning."</p><p>So I climbed up into a tree, high up, and waited for this teacher --
he was a Mohammedan, his name was Rahimuddin. He came exactly on time...
He was very precise in everything; at exactly the same time each day he
used to pass by that tree.</p><p>I dropped a big mango on his head. He said, "Ahhhh!" and looked up.
And he saw me there.</p><p>I said, "What is the matter? What has happened?"</p><p>For a moment there was silence. He said, "Come down." I came
down.</p><p>He said, "You have proved that there is something like a headache,
but don't tell anybody. If you have a headache, you just raise one
finger and I will give you a holiday.</p><p>If you have a stomachache, you need not prove it to me -- you just
raise two fingers, because you seem to be dangerous!"</p><p>He was a bachelor, an old man; he had never married. He lived a very
beautiful life, had a small cottage, a garden.</p><p>And he was very famous for one strange thing -- because he had enough
money, unmarried, no children, no wife.… He had three hundred and
sixty-five suits of clothes, one for each day; then for the whole year
that suit of clothes would not be used again.</p><p>Naturally every husband was jealous.</p><p>He said, "I live alone. I sleep outside in the garden, and I don't
want any proof for stomachache! -- so one is enough. You have given me
the proof that you are capable, so when you have a stomachache raise two
fingers and I will understand. But this is an agreement between us: that
you will not tell anybody else that headaches or stomachaches
exist."</p><p>I said, "I am not worried about anybody else. My problem is solved
because I want things from the very beginning to be clear, just like you
do."</p><p>He said, "You have made it very clear -- it is still hurting! I have
been a teacher thirty years and nobody ever thought of this idea. I will
remember you for my whole life."</p><p>It was a small incident, and would have been forgotten -- but when
people started coming to me many years after this incident he started
telling people, "I knew beforehand that this boy was going to be someone
extraordinary."</p><p>People asked, "How did you come to know? -- and you never mentioned
it before."</p><p>He said, "I had almost forgotten it; just now, as his name is
becoming known around the world and people are coming to him from all
over the world, I remembered. And now that incident has a totally
different meaning. Because for my whole life I was introducing every
class in the same way and nobody ever tried anything. And this was the
only one --</p><p>a singular instance -- who proved to me that a headache had to be
accepted. I</p><p>knew it that very day."</p><p>In 1970 I went to that village for the last time. He had become very
old. Hearing that I was there, he came to see me. I said, "I was going
to come to you. You are too old, you should not have bothered to walk
almost two miles."</p><p>He said, "I am feeling so happy. Seeing you it still hurts, but now I
feel a certain pride that you were my student."</p><p>Now the whole thing takes a different color, it becomes a pride.
Otherwise, if I had turned out to be a thief or a criminal, then the
same incident would have been a proof: "I knew from the very beginning
that this boy was going to be a criminal, that sooner or later he would
murder somebody."</p><p>Retrospectively you always look at things in a way you would not have
looked at them if life had moved in a different direction -- the same
things. The same things would not have given you the same
indications.</p><p>By the way, I would like to remind you that all autobiographies are
false because they are all written retrospectively. A man becomes a
Mahatma Gandhi and then he writes his autobiography in the light what he
has become. He starts looking at things in the past when he was not
Mahatma Gandhi, and everything now has to fit with Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>There has to be a logical connection, a coherence. So it is as if you
are reading a novel backwards -- things will be totally different.</p><p>All autobiographies are fictions. They should not be categorized
separately in any library.</p><p>The science of librarianship should understand a simple fact: that
every autobiography is a fiction.</p><p>For example the day Mahatma Gandhi's father died he was with his
father massaging his feet, and the doctors had said that this was going
to be the last night; there was no hope that this man would ever see the
sunrise, before sunrise he would be gone. In the middle of the night,
Mahatma Gandhi was massaging his father's feet, but he was thinking of
his wife.</p><p>The father was dying. It was an absolute certainty that this was his
last night, and</p><p>he had fallen asleep. Seeing that he was asleep, Mahatma Gandhi
slipped silently into his wife's room, and while he was making love to
his wife, his father died. And suddenly the whole house was awake. He
heard the noise -- "What is the matter?" And he could not forgive
himself, that even for one night he could not remain away from his wife
when the death of his father was absolutely certain.</p><p>If he had not become a famous man, a world-famous man, this incident
would not have carried any importance; perhaps he himself would have
forgiven it, forgotten it -- just an ordinary incident.</p><p>But writing his autobiography, he connects it with the great mahatma
that he became.</p><p>And this is all fiction -- he says that he became concerned about
celibacy because of this incident. He started thinking of brahmacharya,
celibacy, because of this incident. This is not true, but he has to fit
the incident into the life of a mahatma. And it fits perfectly well;
anybody reading it will feel that there seems to be a certain
connection. But it is not true, because all his four sons were born
after this incident. So he cannot deceive me. He is deceiving himself,
he is deceiving his followers, he is deceiving the historians. But if
this was the cause of his becoming a celibate, then he would have
remained without any children. All four sons were born after this
incident, so this incident has nothing to do with celibacy.</p><p>But in his mind -- and in anybody's mind who is reading Mahatma
Gandhi -- it seems relevant, that perhaps the shock was too much, as if
"I am guilty of the death of my father. I could have stayed a few more
minutes, but my lust, my sexuality proved to be more powerful than my
love and respect for my father. And my wife was going to remain with me
for my whole life, but my father was going to disappear that very night
into darkness and into the unknown and there would not be another
meeting again."</p><p>I have read many autobiographies, and I have seen how people when
they look backwards look with the eyes that they have now, and with all
the experience they have accumulated meanwhile. With all this
experience, with these new eyes, the meaning of the incidents starts
changing.</p><p>Narendra, you have been with me from your very childhood.</p><p>If I had not become what I have become, you would have remembered me
as</p><p>loving, as friendly, but you would have never thought I was born as a
buddha -- that idea arises now. It is my enlightenment that gives you
the feeling that, "My God, he was always loving." But it was not the
same love.</p><p>In a sense, the dewdrop and the ocean are both water. But a dewdrop
is a dewdrop, and an ocean is an ocean.</p><p>What you had seen in me was only a dewdrop. Now that dewdrop looks
like an ocean because now you are seeing the ocean. It is exactly as if
you see the Ganges in the Himalayas at Gangotri -- it is just a small
stream. You could not even hope that it would ever reach the ocean, it
is so small. Hindus have placed a marble face of a cow there, and the
Ganges falls from the mouth of the cow, it is such a small stream. You
will find millions of streams in the Himalayas which are far bigger.</p><p>But if you see the same Ganges near Calcutta, in Gangasagar --
Gangasagar means the òcean of Ganges' -- it has become so big, so vast,
so immense that it is difficult to think of it as a river; it looks
oceanic. To connect the two is very difficult. The Ganges in Gangotri
could have been one of those millions of streams which disappear in the
forest, in the desert, and nobody would have remembered it. But because
this stream became Gangasagar... retrospectively, looking backwards,
even standing at the source where the stream is so small, you have the
feeling of vastness, of potentiality, of all the possibilities that it
is going to become. You cannot see it just like a small stream; it is
the stream that is going to become Gangasagar.</p><p>Each autobiography is fictitious; small incidents with no meaning in
themselves suddenly start having meaning in the context of the person
that has come to be.</p><p>Essentially it is true: everybody is a buddha, and naturally I am not
an exception. Please don't exclude me out. But this buddhahood is only a
seed, and out of millions of seeds perhaps one seed comes to blossom. It
indicates that every seed can come to blossom. It is a tremendous
encouragement to every human being.</p><p>In this sense your seeing me as a born buddha is right, but don't
forget your responsibility. It means you have to prove it too -- that
you are also a born buddha.</p><p>Maybe you started growing a little late.</p><p>And in the eternity of time, what is "late"?</p><p>There are only seven days. Choose any day, but start.</p><p>I am not interested at all to convert anybody to my ideology -- I
don't have any. Secondly, I believe that the very effort to convert
anybody is violence, it is interfering in his individuality, in his
uniqueness, into his freedom.</p><p>So my function is not that of a teacher, not that of a prophet, not
that of a savior, not that of a messenger. My function simply is that of
a reminder. I want just to be a mirror to you so that you can see your
original face.</p><p>And if you can see a buddha in me, there is no difficulty in seeing
the buddha in you too -</p><p>- maybe a little lazy, a little sleepy, a little gone off the
track.</p><p>But a buddha is a buddha. It does not matter whether his nuts and
bolts are a little loose, we will fix them.</p><p>One's buddhahood is one's essential nature.</p><p>I don't want you to worship buddhas, I want you to become buddhas.
That is the only right worship.</p><p>If you love, become it. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>GAUTAM BUDDHA, MAHAVIRA, J. KRISHNAMURTI WERE TRAVELING</p><p>FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. IT WAS</p><p>REPORTED ABOUT J. KRISHNAMURTI THAT BEFORE HE LEFT INDIA FOR</p><p>CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST TIME HE TOLD SOMEONE THAT IF THE</p><p>DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA SAID, "NO MORE TRAVEL, NO MORE TALK," THEN</p><p>ALL WOULD BE FINISHED; HE WOULD BE GONE IN FOUR WEEKS -- AND</p><p>THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS THE INSIGHT OF ALL THE MASTERS WHO WERE</p><p>TRAVELING ALL THE TIME AND DIDN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE LIKE RAMAN</p><p>MAHARSHI?</p><p>Raman Maharshi is a mystic, but not a master.</p><p>The mystics have never traveled because the mystics are not making
any effort of any kind to transfer their experience to others. They have
decided that what they have experienced is untransferable, that it
cannot be communicated.</p><p>So the mystics all through the ages have remained in one place. What
is the point of moving around, going from village to village or country
to country -- for what?</p><p>The mystic's experience is expressed in the ancient saying that "The
well remains in its own place; it is the thirsty who should go to the
well, the well cannot go to the thirsty."</p><p>Buddha, Mahavira, Bodhidharma, Shankara, Nagarjuna, Mohammed, Jesus,
J. Krishnamurti, they were all traveling, going continuously.…</p><p>Mohammed has countered the proverb about the well and the thirsty,
and countered it in such a beautiful way. He says, "If the mountain
cannot come to Mohammed, then Mohammed will go to the mountain."</p><p>These are masters.…</p><p>Not that they are against the mystics; basically they agree that it
is difficult,</p><p>almost impossible to communicate, to say anything about the truth,
about self- realization. It is beyond words, beyond language; they agree
on that point.</p><p>But still the masters say that some indirect ways can be always
tried, and there is no harm.</p><p>There is no direct way of translating the inner experience into the
outer languages, but ways can be found, devices can be created in which
something may be said, may not be said, but may be heard.</p><p>The emphasis is not that the truth can be said. On that, the mystics
and the masters agree: it cannot be said.</p><p>But the masters disagree with the mystics on one point: that it may
not be said but it can be heard -- through the eyes of the master,
through the presence of the master, through his love, through his
compassion, through his silence, just being with him. Nothing is said,
but somebody's heart may start dancing, a song may arise.</p><p>In the presence of the master, the disciple may become aware that the
ordinary human life is not all there is; there is something more. Even
to make them aware that there is something more -- greater peace, deeper
silence, overflowing ecstasy -- perhaps they may start searching for it,
perhaps they may become seekers. And what is the harm? If nobody
listens, then too the effort is worth making.</p><p>The mystic and the master both have the same experience, but they
have different views about its transfer -- and both seem to be
right.</p><p>My own understanding is this: that the mystics are of a more ordinary
variety. They come from the categories of human beings who are not
articulate, who are not poets, who are not painters, who are not
musicians, who are not dancers. They come from the common masses.</p><p>And the master is more articulate, more talented. If he cannot say,
he will paint; if he cannot say, he will sculpt; if he cannot say, he
will dance; if he cannot say, he will sing --</p><p>and singing, dancing, painting or any other creative art may become a
vehicle for that which language is not capable of.</p><p>And there are people who are articulate with language too; they can
speak in such a way that through the words they can send the wordless
message to you. The words will be only the packages; the content will be
the wordless. The words will be only the containers. But for that, a
very articulate person is needed, who can use language in such a way
that it becomes music, that it becomes poetry, that it becomes
silence... that it becomes not only that which it says but also that
which remains unsaid.</p><p>Language can become a vehicle -- now the emphasis will be on those
who are listening.</p><p>Much will depend on those who are listening.</p><p>So the basic function of the master is first, to create disciples who
can understand the wordless through the words... who can sit in silence
but can become filled with immense serenity. Just in the presence of the
master, something can start opening up in them -- as if the sun has
risen and the birds start singing; nobody informs the birds that it is
sunrise.</p><p>There are no alarm clocks for poor birds, but just the light... the
darkness is gone, the night is over, and there is a celebration all over
nature. Flowers suddenly start opening, there is fragrance all over.</p><p>The mystic has achieved, is fulfilled, has completed his journey. But
he is not a very talented genius.</p><p>The master is doing overtime. His work is finished, but his genius,
his talents demand expression.</p><p>J. Krishnamurti said, "If I have to follow the doctor's advice and
not speak and not travel then I cannot live more than four weeks." And
within exactly four weeks he died. His work was complete; now he was
living only for others. And if even that cannot be done then what is the
point of being here unnecessarily? His boat had arrived long ago. He had
been delaying his departure -- somebody may listen, somebody may hear,
somebody may be touched. But if he cannot speak and cannot travel, then
there is no reason at all for him to go on breathing. He is not an
idiot.</p><p>Why did he say four weeks? -- because it is just the old momentum.
For breathing and heartbeats to slow down and disappear, it takes
nearabout three to</p><p>four weeks. And the older the man, the longer time it takes. If he
had been younger, it may have been just one week.</p><p>It is a very strange phenomenon -- it is because the younger person's
heart runs fast, it can exhaust the momentum quickly. The older man is
already slow; his heart has become accustomed to a slow pace so it will
take three to four weeks.</p><p>To be a mystic is rare, but to be a master is very rare.</p><p>And to be a successful master... you will have to come to me!
Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHENEVER I AM IN A SILENT SPACE I HEAR A SOUND -- SOMETHING LIKE</p><p>ÀUM' OR HUMMING. I LOVE THIS RHYTHMIC, SWEET, UNENDING SOUND.</p><p>IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES TOO, WHEN I AM TOTAL AND SILENT, THIS LISTENING
HAPPENS.</p><p>IS IT OKAY TO LISTEN AND ENJOY THIS SOUND, OR IS IT A PROJECTION
OR</p><p>DAYDREAMING? PLEASE GUIDE ME.</p><p>First thing to remember: you should not repeat any sound as a mantra,
as a chanting, because when you repeat you create -- then it is your
mental projection.</p><p>If you are simply silent and you hear a certain humming, then it is
the sound of existence.</p><p>That humming has been heard for centuries by meditators. That humming
has been given a special name in the East, OM. It is not exactly OM but
it is</p><p>something similar.</p><p>It has to be remembered that in Sanskrit -- which is the oldest
language in the world, the mother language of all civilized languages in
existence -- they don't write OM in letters.</p><p>They have made a special symbol for it just to create a distinction,
to indicate that it is not something to do with language, it is beyond
language, and it is not part of the Sanskrit alphabet.</p><p>The way it is written is only with a symbol, and that symbol can be
used by any language.</p><p>Sanskrit has no monopoly over it because it is not part of the
alphabet of Sanskrit. It has been heard.…</p><p>Jainas, Buddhists, Hindus -- they differ in their theology on every
single point, but they all have heard the sound OM. There is no question
of differing; it is not a hypothesis and it is not a theory propounded
by somebody.</p><p>Anybody who becomes utterly silent... it is the silence itself
singing, it is the song of silence.</p><p>Hence about OM Hindus, Jainas and Buddhists all agree. They begin
their scriptures with</p><p>"om," they end their scriptures with "om" because that is the
universal sound.</p><p>This has created a problem -- and there are many problems of a
similar type -- because all the mystics in this country and in the far
East have heard the sound OM. The people who read the scriptures start
thinking that, "If OM is the sound of the nature of existence itself,
then if we repeat òm' we will be able to hear it soon." It is logical,
but it is not realistic.</p><p>If you repeat it, you will never hear the real thing; you will go on
repeating, and you may start hearing your own repetition.</p><p>In Tibet, where the greatest work has been done on this "soundless
sound," as they call it, they have made a special instrument. It is a
certain kind of metal pot made with special proportions of different
metals, and a small rod -- again made</p><p>of different proportions of different metals. You put the rod against
the rim of the pot, and you move it fast and it creates a certain
humming. That is something closer to the existential sound than OM.</p><p>In every lamasery in Tibet you will hear that sound -- somebody, some
lama is continuously making it. When he leaves, then somebody else...
twenty-four hours a day that sound is created, but that is a man-made
sound. It is similar, but it is not the same.</p><p>Hindus in India have fallen into the same fallacy. They have made òm'
their most significant mantra; just repeat it continuously inside so
your whole being is filled with the sound of "om, om, om." You are
deceiving yourself; this is your sound.</p><p>So if you are not creating it, then there is no need for any
anxiety.</p><p>If the moment you become silent you hear it, then it is a tremendous
blessing. It means you have gone very deep into the existential world of
serenity.</p><p>But don't try to deceive existence. You can go on chanting "om" your
whole life; it is meaningless, it has nothing to do with existence. With
existence you have to be a listener, absolutely passive, relaxed, in a
let-go. Don't impose yourself. You are the only barrier, your
impositions are your only sins. Just remain utterly passive in a
non-doing witnessing, listening to whatever is happening, allowing it to
happen.</p><p>It is perfectly good, and of great significance. On the path, if you
start hearing OM, you are accepted, you are welcomed. You need not seek
anywhere, you have found the door.</p><p>Just relax more, and leave everything in the hands of existence... a
total trust and a complete passivity.</p><p>Your absence is the presence of godliness.</p><p>The moment you are not, the miracle has happened. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT YOU POINTED OUT THAT JESUS, MARX AND FREUD</p><p>WERE PERHAPS THE WORLD'S GREATEST BUSINESSMEN.</p><p>ON OCCASION I HAVE HEARD YOU CALL YOURSELF AN OLD JEW. OSHO, WHAT IS
YOUR BUSINESS?</p><p>Milarepa, I am a silent partner. Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SINCE SANNYAS IN 1981 PEOPLE HAVE CONTINUALLY BEEN SEEING JESUS</p><p>CHRIST IN ME! WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH THIS GUY?</p><p>Satsanga, it is dangerous. You cut off your beard! Otherwise, they
will cut off your head!</p><p>Jesus! -- they see Jesus Christ in you? Then crucifixion is not far
away. The first thing out of this hall you cut your beard, and if they
recognize you even then, keep a small board hanging on your neck that
says, "I am not Jesus Christ."</p><p>You have to make it clear; otherwise your life is in danger. Beyond

YOU HEALED ME AND GAVE ME BACK EVEN MORE THAN LIFE.</p><p>THEN ONE YEAR AGO I WENT BACK TO THAT SAME WORLD I HAD</p><p>ESCAPED FROM, FEELING LIKE A CHILD JUST OUT OF KINDERGARTEN, WHO
BARELY KNOWS THE ABC. NATURALLY THERE WERE DARK</p><p>MOMENTS. DURING THOSE MOMENTS AN INNER VOICE -- WAS IT YOUR</p><p>VOICE, OSHO? -- KEPT HAMMERING AT ME, "DON'T GET LOST IN YOUR</p><p>EMOTIONS -- WATCH!" FOR MONTHS THIS VOICE BECAME MY</p><p>CONSTANT</p><p>COMPANION UNTIL SUDDENLY A REALIZATION HAPPENED TO ME: THAT</p><p>THE DARKNESS AND THE CONFLICT WERE CREATED BY MY OWN FEARS, DESIRES,
JUDGEMENTS. THIS GLIMPSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A CALM, RELAXED FEELING OF
FREEDOM AND ACCEPTANCE.</p><p>NOW, EXPERIENCING AGAIN THE OVERWHELMING BEAUTY OF SITTING AT</p><p>YOUR FEET, I CAN SEE THAT NO MATTER HOW LONG I WATCH, THIS DESIRE TO
BE IN YOUR PRESENCE WILL REMAIN WITH ME.</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE NOT TO LONG FOR SOMETHING</p><p>SO UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL?</p><p>Lalita, the spiritual path has many crossroads.</p><p>On each crossroad, one feels as if one has arrived. In a certain way
it is true, too. It is a certain blessing which was never known before,
a peace that is absolutely new, a silence undreamt of, and a love, the
fragrance of which one has desired, longed for for lives and has never
found. Naturally one feels the home has come.</p><p>This is one of the most difficult tasks for the master -- to push you
on, to say to you,</p><p>"This is only the beginning; there is much more waiting for you." And
although it is inconceivable to you that there can be anything more than
this, the trust, the love, the devotion towards the master helps you to
move.</p><p>These moments come again and again. Each time it becomes in a way
more difficult, in a way easier. It is difficult in the sense that each
new realization, new achievement, new revelation is so vast, so
absorbing, that everything you have known before simply fades away -- so
it becomes more difficult to move on. But on the other hand, it becomes
easier to move on because each time the master</p><p>has said to you, "Move on" you have always gained more; it has never
been a loss, it has always been a new door to a new mystery, a new sky
beyond the old one.</p><p>So the trust also has increased. It is easier now to listen to the
master and move on.</p><p>An ancient story... I have always loved it. An old woodcutter, poor,
alone, had only one way to earn his everyday bread and that was by
cutting wood and selling it. As he came into the forest, just near the
entrance under a beautiful bodhi tree -- the same tree under which
Gautam Buddha became enlightened; hence the name of the tree has
becomèbodhi tree'. Bodhi means enlightenment.</p><p>By the way, you will be surprised to know, scientists have found that
the bodhi tree has a certain chemical which no other tree has, and that
chemical is absolutely necessary for the growth of intelligence. Perhaps
it is a very intelligent, sensitive tree. It may not have been just a
coincidence.…</p><p>The woodcutter would see this old man sitting silently, always there
-- summer, winter, rain. He would touch his feet before entering the
forest, and every time he would do that the old man would smile and say,
"You are such an idiot."</p><p>The woodcutter would be shocked: "Why? -- I touch his feet, but
rather than giving me a blessing, he simply smiles and says, `You are
such an idiot.'"</p><p>One day he gathered courage and asked, "What do you mean?"</p><p>The old man said, "I mean that you have been cutting trees in this
forest for your whole life, and if you go just a little deeper into it
you will find a copper mine. Only an idiot could miss it! Your whole
life you have been in this forest... you can collect the copper and that
will be enough for seven days' comfortable living, no need to cut wood
every day in your old age."</p><p>The man could not believe it because he knew the whole forest -- "He
must be joking!"</p><p>But perhaps he was right... and there was no harm in going a little
further and being alert and watching to see whether there was some
copper mine.</p><p>And he went in, and he found a copper mine. He said, "Now I know why
he was</p><p>continually saying, `You are such an idiot, working every day in your
old age.'"</p><p>Now he was going only once every week. But the old tradition
continued: he would touch his feet, and the old man would smile and say,
`You are such an idiot!'"</p><p>"But," he said, "now this is not right! Because I have found the
copper mine."</p><p>The old man said, "You don't know. If you go a little further, you
will find a silver mine."</p><p>He said, "My God, why didn't you tell me before?"</p><p>The old man said, "You didn't believe me even about the copper mine
-- how could you have believed about the silver mine? Just go a little
further."</p><p>This time there was suspicion but not so much; there was a certain
trust arising. And he found the silver mine.</p><p>He came back and he said, "Now I have found silver enough that I will
be coming only once in a month. I will miss you very much. I will miss
your blessing very much. I have started loving to hear from you, `What
an idiot you are.'"</p><p>But the old man said, "You are still an idiot, it makes no
difference." The woodcutter said, "Even though I have found the silver
mine?"</p><p>He said, "Yes, even then. You are just an idiot and nothing more --
because if you go just a little deeper there is gold. So don't wait for
a month, come tomorrow."</p><p>Now he thought he must be joking. If there is gold, why should he be
sitting here under this tree in old rags, with no shelter from the rain,
no shelter from the sun, depending on people who bring food to him...
sometimes they bring it, sometimes they don't..." And if he knows where
the gold is, I don't think... this time he is certainly joking! But
there is no harm. He has always been right. Who knows? This old guy is a
little mysterious."</p><p>He went further and found a big gold mine. He could not believe his
own eyes --</p><p>this is the forest he has been working in for his whole life, and
this is the forest where that old man is sitting.…</p><p>He brought much gold, and he said, "I think you will not say anymore
that I am an idiot."</p><p>He said, "I will continue. Come tomorrow because this is not the end;
this is only the beginning."</p><p>He said, "What? Gold is just a beginning?"</p><p>He said, "Come tomorrow. Just a little deeper in the forest you will
find diamonds -- but that too is not the end. But I will not tell you
too much; otherwise you will not be able to sleep tonight. Just go home.
Tomorrow morning, first you find the diamonds, and then come to me."</p><p>He really could not sleep the whole night. A poor woodcutter... he
could not imagine that he was going to become the owner of all these
mines -- gold and silver and copper, and now diamonds! And the old man
was saying this was only the beginning. He thought and thought... what
can be more than diamonds?</p><p>In the morning he went very early -- the old man was asleep. He
touched his feet. The old man opened his eyes and said, "Have you come?
I knew you would come, you couldn't sleep. First go and see the
diamonds."</p><p>The woodcutter said, "Can you tell me what can be more?"</p><p>He said, "First find the diamonds -- step by step; otherwise, you
will go crazy."</p><p>He found the diamonds and he came dancing to the old man. He said,
"Now you cannot say that Ì am an idiot. I have found the diamonds!"</p><p>But the old man said, "Still, you are an idiot."</p><p>He said, "Now I will not leave you unless you explain it to me."</p><p>The old man said, "You can see that I know all about these mines --
silver, gold, diamonds -- and I don't care about them. Because there is
something more which is not in the forest but within you, just a little
deeper -- not outside but inside. And because I have found that, I don't
care about all these diamonds. Now it is</p><p>up to you: you can stop your journey at the diamonds but remember,
you will remain an idiot. And I am a proof --</p><p>because I know about all these mines and I have not bothered with
them. This can make you understand that there is something more which is
never found outside however far you go; it is found inside you."</p><p>The man dropped the diamonds. He said, "I am going to sit by your
side. Unless you drop this idea that I am an idiot, I am not going to
move from here!"</p><p>He was a simple, innocent woodcutter.</p><p>It is difficult for knowledgeable people to go in.</p><p>It was not difficult for the woodcutter. Soon he was entering into a
deep silence -</p><p>- a joy, a blissfulness, a benediction.</p><p>And the old man shook him and said, "This is the place. Now you need
not go into the forest. And I withdraw my word ìdiotàbout you, you have
become a wise man. You can open your eyes. You will see the same world
but not in the same light; the same colors, but now they have become
psychedelic; the same people, but they are no longer just skeletons
covered with skin, they are luminous spiritual beings... the same
cosmos, but for the first time it is an ocean of consciousness."</p><p>The woodcutter opened his eyes.</p><p>He said, "You are a strange fellow. Why did you wait so long? I have
been coming here almost my whole life and I have seen you sitting under
this tree. You could have said this any day."</p><p>The old man said, "I was waiting for the right moment... for the ripe
moment, for the time when you would be able not only to hear but to
understand it. The journey is short, but you should not stop at every
achievement. Because every achievement is so fulfilling that your
imagination cannot think there can be more than this."</p><p>Lalita, you are asking me what can be more beautiful than to be in
the presence of the master. Why not dissolve in the presence? To be in
the presence of the master, there is still separation. Why be in the
presence? Why not become the</p><p>presence itself? And only then you will know that to be in the
presence was only the beginning of a journey that ends in becoming the
presence.</p><p>I know you, and I know your heart. I have not told the story of the
woodcutter without remembering the fact that you have such an innocent
heart yourself.</p><p>Just don't stop anywhere.</p><p>It is possible... make it your realization. Become the light
yourself, and then whatever is experienced is inexpressible.</p><p>In your dark moments, while you have been away for one year, you have
heard the word</p><p>`watch'. With your innocent mind, it is very simple for me to speak
to you from any distance, a heart-to-heart communion. Those words were
mine, and you have recognized them. Because there are things you need
not bother about, you simply have to watch and they pass on -- anger,
greed, jealousy. All the components of darkness have one quality in
common: that if you can watch them they start dispersing. Watching is
enough; you are not supposed to do anything with them.</p><p>In the life of one of the great mystics, Baal Shem, there is an
incident. He used to go towards the river in the middle of the night
just to be in absolute silence, alone, to enjoy the peace and the beauty
of the night. Just on the bank of the river was a rich man's mansion,
and a watchman was there who was puzzled about this man, Baal Shem.
Every night, exactly as the tower bell was tolling twelve, Baal Shem
would appear out of the darkness.</p><p>The poor watchman could not contain the temptation to inquire, "Why
do you come here every night and sit next to the river in the darkness?
What is the purpose of it?"</p><p>Rather than answering him, Baal Shem asked, "What is your work?" He
said, "I am a watchman."</p><p>Baal Shem said, "Exactly -- that is my work. I am a watchman."</p><p>The watchman said, "That is strange. If you are a watchman, then what
are you</p><p>doing here? You should be watching the house where you are the
watchman."</p><p>Baal Shem said, "There is something to be explained to you: You watch
somebody else's house; I watch my own house. This is my house. Wherever
I go, I go with my house --</p><p>but I am continuously the watchman." I love the story.</p><p>Be continuously a watchman of all dark moments. They will pass away.
In fact, that is the definition: anything you watch, if it disappears by
watching that means it was something wrong. If by watching it becomes
more clear, closer, that means it was something to be absorbed.</p><p>There is no other definition of good and bad.</p><p>It is watching that decides -- the only criterion. What is sin and
what is virtue? That which disappears is sin, and that which comes
closer, becomes clearer, wants to become part of you, is virtue.</p><p>Watching is certainly the golden key of spiritual life. Question
2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER DAY YOU TALKED SO BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THE SADNESS</p><p>WHICH FOLLOWS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF OUR INNERMOST SILENCE.</p><p>IS IT NECESSARILY SO, THAT WHEN I FIRST EXPERIENCE THIS SILENCE, I
ALSO FEEL WITH MY WHOLE BEING THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY ALONE ON</p><p>MY JOURNEY?</p><p>Aloneness is also one of the fundamental experiences as you enter
silence.</p><p>In silence there is nobody else, you are simply alone.</p><p>The deeper your silence will be, thoughts will be gone, emotions will
be gone, sentiments will be gone -- just pure being, a flame of light,
burning alone.</p><p>One can get scared because we are so much accustomed to living with
people -- in the crowd, in the marketplace, in all kinds of
relationships.</p><p>You may not be aware that in all these relationships -- with friends,
with your husbands, with your wives, with your children, with your
parents -- you are basically trying to avoid the experience of
aloneness. These are strategies so that you are always with
somebody.</p><p>It is a well-known fact, psychologically established, that if a
person is left alone in isolation, after seven days he starts talking...
a little like whispering. For seven days he keeps talking inside, keeps
himself engaged in the mind, but then it becomes too much --</p><p>things start coming out of his mind through his mouth and he starts
whispering.</p><p>After fourteen days you can hear him clearly, what he is saying.
After twenty- one days he does not bother about anybody, he has gone
insane; now he is talking to walls, to pillars,</p><p>"Hello friend, how are you?" -- to a pillar, hugging a pillar! And
this is true not about somebody special, it is true about everybody. He
is trying to find some relationship. If he cannot find it in reality, he
will create a hallucination.</p><p>You will see: just stand by the side of the road and watch people
going from the office to the house, and you will be surprised. They are
alone -- although there is a crowd all around -- but they are talking to
themselves. They are making gestures, they are telling somebody
something... because the crowd around them is not related to them. They
are alone in the crowd, so they are trying to create their own illusion.
Maybe they are talking to their wife, to their boss -- there are many
things which cannot be said but right now they can say them. In front of
the wife they cannot say it, but in this crowd, where everybody is
engaged in his own thing, everybody is doing his own thing, they can say
things to the wife. Nobody is listening, and at least one thing is
certain -- the wife is not there! But they need the wife, they need
someone to talk to.</p><p>And after thirty days of isolation, a dramatic change happens: it is
not only one- sided; it is not only that they are talking to the pillar,
the pillar also starts talking to them! They do both things: first,
"Hello, how are you?" and then, "I am good. I am fine, doing well."</p><p>They answer from the side of the pillar too -- in a different voice.
Now they have created a world of their own, they are no longer alone. No
madman is alone.</p><p>Either you are mad or not. If you don't know aloneness, there is
something of madness in you.</p><p>Only pure aloneness gives you a clean sanity. You don't need the
other; the dependence on the other is no more there, you are enough unto
yourself. Language is meaningless because language is a medium to relate
with the other. The moment you are no longer dependent on the other,
language is meaningless, words are meaningless.</p><p>In your silence -- when there are no words, no language, nobody else
is present -</p><p>- you are getting in tune with existence. This serenity, this
silence, this aloneness will bring you immense rewards.</p><p>It will allow you to grow to your full potential. For the first time
you will be an individual, for the first time you will have the touch
and the taste of freedom, and for the first time the immensity, the
unboundedness of existence will be yours with all its blissfulness.</p><p>So whatever happens in silence -- either sadness or aloneness --
remember, in silence nothing wrong can ever happen. Whatever happens is
going to enhance the beauty of it, deepen the charm of it; anything that
happens will bring more and more flowers, more and more fragrance to
it.</p><p>Rejoice! Whatever happens in silence is your friend, it is really
your bosom friend. It is going to take you to the ultimate peak of
ecstasies.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU -- EVERYTHING IS VERY</p><p>GOOD. ONLY ONE THING IS CONFUSING ME A LITTLE. YOU HAVE OFTEN</p><p>SPOKEN ABOUT THE "CHOSEN FEW." PLEASE, WHO IS DOING THE CHOOSING?</p><p>It is a very difficult question.</p><p>In the beginning, God used to do it! But there are many hypotheses
about what happened to God: some say he died a natural death, some say
he committed suicide, some say he got into an accident. Some say he was
murdered by man -- because without murdering him, man could not really
be free.</p><p>I will not go into what happened to God. One thing is certain: he is
missing.</p><p>In the beginning, he had chosen the Jews to be the chosen few --
"God's own people." But since then, he has had no opportunity. Although
Jews have been praying continuously in every synagogue all over the
world, "Now it is time for you to choose somebody else; we have suffered
enough!"</p><p>And it is true. If God had not chosen them they would have lived just
like everybody else.</p><p>But because he chose them, he made everybody else their enemies --
great jealousy and competition.</p><p>I remember that once, India's first prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru was asked,</p><p>"Who are you going to choose as your successor?"</p><p>He said, "I am not going to choose anyone, because whoever I choose
would have to face immense difficulties. Everybody else who is ambitious
and wants to become the prime minister would all be together against one
single person, and there would be no possibility for that person I have
chosen to succeed me. So I will keep my mouth shut."</p><p>And you are asking who is choosing here?</p><p>Here, it is a very different process. Here, the moment you become a
sannyasin you have chosen yourself.</p><p>Every sannyasin belongs to the chosen few, and nobody is doing the
choosing -- it is you who are doing it; hence there is a freedom. If you
feel difficulties, you can drop out of it.</p><p>Nobody prevents you from becoming a sannyasin, nobody prevents you
from dropping sannyas. Your freedom is intact.</p><p>So remember: here, nobody is choosing. Everybody is choosing by
becoming a sannyasin. So no need to kill me; I have learned from the
lesson of God -- I will never choose anybody, because it is dangerous!
And to choose anybody is to put him in difficulty.</p><p>Now Jews have suffered so much in four thousand years for the single
reason that they were the chosen few. All over the earth, nobody else
has suffered so much. It gave them a superiority complex, a feeling that
they are holier than thou</p><p>-- and naturally nobody likes people who think themselves holier than
thou.</p><p>So in every country, in every place, they have been put down and
given evidence that they are not holier or higher.</p><p>Just in Germany alone Adolf Hitler killed six million Jews. The
responsibility lies with God, because the reason these Jews were coming
into conflict with Adolf Hitler was that he was saying that the nordic
Germans were the highest race. Jews have to be completely eradicated
from the earth because as long as the Jews remain, you cannot proclaim
that nordic Germans are the highest. Jews are an old race, with a
four-thousand-year history, and they have proved in every way that they
are more intelligent. No Jew is a beggar; they are all rich, they know
how to produce wealth. They are all cultured and well educated. Forty
percent of Nobel prizes go to Jews, and the other sixty percent to the
rest of the world -- it is simply unimaginable.</p><p>It was difficult for Adolf Hitler in the presence of Jews, because
they had all the intelligence, all the riches, everything that proved
that they were somehow more intelligent than others.</p><p>To make the nordic Germans a superior race, Jews had to be completely
eradicated from the earth.</p><p>The fault lies with God; he should not have chosen the poor Jews. And
even if he had chosen them, he should have whispered in the ear of Moses
and told him, "Please don't tell anybody. Just keep it in your mind that
you are the chosen few</p><p>-- but it should not leak out, it is a secret."</p><p>But there is no joy if it is a secret. The joy is when you proclaim
it.</p><p>Here I am not proclaiming anybody as chosen, but I am giving you an
opportunity. If you want to be chosen, there will be difficulties. My
sannyasins everywhere are going through all the difficulties.</p><p>One has to pay for everything. You want to be the chosen few for
free? -- it is not possible. You will have to pay for it.</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>OFTEN, IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE SPOKEN ON DOUBT AND THE VALUE OF</p><p>DOUBTING EVERYTHING.</p><p>ON THE LEVEL WHERE YOU ARE MY MASTER AND I, THROUGH YOUR</p><p>GRACE, HAVE BECOME YOUR DISCIPLE, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY</p><p>DOUBT. FORGETFULNESS ON MY PART, YES; UNAWARENESS ON MY PART, YES --
BUT NEVER THE TORMENT OF DOUBT.</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, COULD YOU SPEAK ON DOUBT IN THE RELATIONSHIP</p><p>OF THE DISCIPLE WITH THE MASTER?</p><p>There is no possibility.</p><p>A disciple becomes a disciple only when he drops all doubts. So in
the very nature of things, a disciple cannot doubt.</p><p>If he doubts, he is not a disciple.</p><p>As a student he can doubt as much as he wants. When all his doubts
are finished and a trust beyond doubt has arisen, he enters into the
world of disciplehood; now there is no possibility of doubt arising. If
it arises, the disciple immediately falls back into the category of
student.</p><p>So as far as the master and discipleship is concerned, doubt is an
impossibility. Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY DO YOU ALWAYS LOOK IN YOUR HAND BEFORE YOU START</p><p>ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION? DO I SEE IT WRONGLY, OR DO YOU</p><p>FIND THE ANSWER THERE?</p><p>My hands are empty.</p><p>I don't have any answer.</p><p>You have questions; I don't answer you, I simply destroy your
questions. And before destroying your questions I have to look at my
hand because it is not only with my language that I destroy your
questions, it is also with my hands.</p><p>So I have to prepare them, to ask "Are you ready?" When they say,
"Yes, master, go ahead" I start!</p><p>Without my hands, I cannot answer you. They do almost most of the
work. My words keep you engaged, and they go on doing the real work.</p><p>So you are not seeing wrongly; you are seeing absolutely right.</p><p>I look at them -- not for answers, but just to see whether they are
ready or not. Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE TO YOU. WHEN I AM</p><p>SITTING HERE WITH YOU I FEEL MY HEART IN TUNE WITH YOUR HEART, I FEEL
A DEEP LOVE FOR YOU. BUT I ALSO FEEL MY OUTER SERIOUSNESS.</p><p>WHY IS LAUGHTER SO DIFFICULT FOR ME?</p><p>Laughter is one of the things most repressed by society all over the
world, in all the ages.</p><p>Society wants you to be serious. Parents want their children to be
serious, teachers want their students to be serious, the bosses want
their servants to be serious, the commanders want their armies to be
serious. Seriousness is required of everybody.</p><p>Laughter is dangerous and rebellious.</p><p>When the teacher is teaching you and you start laughing, it will be
taken as an insult.</p><p>Your parents are saying something to you and you start laughing -- it
will be taken as an insult.</p><p>Seriousness is thought to be honor, respect.</p><p>Naturally laughter has been repressed so much that even though life
all around is hilarious, nobody is laughing. If your laughter is freed
from its chains, from its bondage, you will be surprised -- on each step
there is something hilarious happening.</p><p>Life is not serious.</p><p>Only graveyards are serious, death is serious. Life is love, life is
laughter, life is dance, song.</p><p>But we will have to give life a new orientation. The past has
crippled life very badly, it has made you almost laughter blind, just
like there are people who are colorblind.</p><p>There are ten percent of people who are colorblind -- it is a big
percentage, but they are not aware that they are colorblind.</p><p>George Bernard Shaw was colorblind, and he came to know it when he
was sixty years old. On his birthday somebody sent a present, a
beautiful suit, a coat, but the person forgot to send a tie. So Bernard
Shaw went with his secretary to find a matching tie. He liked the suit
very much. He looked at ties and he chose one, and the secretary was
surprised; she could not believe it -- because the suit was yellow and
the tie was green.</p><p>She said, "What are you doing? This will look very strange." He said,
"Why will it look strange? It is the same color."</p><p>The manager, the salesman... they all gathered, and they tried in
many ways to find out.…</p><p>He could not distinguish between yellow and green; they both appeared
the same to him.</p><p>He was colorblind.</p><p>But for sixty years he was not aware of it.</p><p>And there are ten percent of people in the world who are colorblind.
Some color they are missing, or maybe they are mixing it up with some
other color.</p><p>The constant repression of laughter has made you laughter blind.</p><p>Situations are happening everywhere, but you cannot see that there is
any reason to laugh.</p><p>If your laughter is freed from its bondage, the whole world will be
full of laughter. It needs to be full of laughter; it will change almost
everything in human life.</p><p>You will not be as miserable as you are. In fact, you are not as
miserable as you look -- it is misery plus seriousness that makes you
look so miserable. Just misery plus laughter, and you will not look so
miserable!</p><p>In one apartment house... And modern apartments have such thin walls
that whether you want to or not, you have to hear what is going on on
the other side of the wall. In a way, it is very human.</p><p>The whole apartment house was puzzled about one thing.… Every couple
was fighting, throwing pillows, throwing things, breaking cups and
saucers, shouting at each other, husbands beating wives, wives screaming
-- and they don't need any loudspeaker systems or anything, and the
whole apartment house enjoyed.</p><p>The only problem was with one sardarji. From his flat they never
heard any fight; on the contrary, they always heard laughter. The whole
crowd was puzzled: "What is the matter?</p><p>These people never fight. There is always laughter -- and both are
laughing so loudly that the whole building can hear it!"</p><p>One day they decided that it had to be looked into: "We are missing
so much, and they are enjoying so much. What is their secret?"</p><p>So they caught hold of the sardarji as he was coming from the market,
carrying vegetables and other things. They all caught hold of him and
they said, "First you have to tell us that what the secret is -- why do
you laugh when everybody fights?"</p><p>The sardar said, "Don't force me, because the secret is very
embarrassing."</p><p>They said, "Embarrassing? But we thought you are doing great. We
always hear laughter</p><p>-- either you laugh or your wife laughs... no fight."</p><p>The sardar said, "What happens is, she throws things at me. If she
misses, then I</p><p>laugh; if she hits me then she laughs. The same things are going on,
but it is just that we have made a different arrangement -- what is the
point? So I have learned how to dodge her, and she is learning how to
"</p><p>After twenty years the same sardar wanted to divorce his wife. The
magistrate had heard about them, that this was the only couple in the
whole city who had never been known to fight. They simply laugh -- the
whole city knows them as the laughing couple.</p><p>The magistrate said, "What has gone wrong? You are so famous."</p><p>The sardar said, "Forget all about that -- just give us permission to
divorce." But the magistrate said, "I have to know the reason."</p><p>He said, "The reason is very clear -- she hits me. And it is too
much; I have been getting those hits for years."</p><p>The magistrate asked, "How long have you been married?" He said,
"Almost thirty years."</p><p>The magistrate said, "If you have been able to cope with the woman
for thirty years, then just ten, twenty years more "</p><p>He said, "That is not the point. At first I used to dodge, but now
she has become such a good... there is no way that I can dodge! So only
she laughs, I have not laughed for ten years. This is unbearable. In the
beginning it was perfect; it was almost fifty-fifty, there was no
problem. I was laughing, she was also laughing. But now a hundred
percent of the time she laughs, and a hundred percent I am just standing
there, looking like a fool. No, I cannot tolerate it any more."</p><p>Just look around at life and try to see the humorous side of
things.</p><p>Every event that is happening has its own humorous side, you just
need a sense of humor.</p><p>No religion has accepted the sense of humor as a quality.</p><p>I want a sense of humor to be a fundamental quality of a good man, of
a moral</p><p>man, of a religious man. And it does not need much looking; you just
try to see it, and everywhere.…</p><p>Once I was traveling in a bus when I was a student. The bus conductor
was in trouble because there were thirty-one passengers and he had money
only for thirty tickets. So he was asking, "Who is the fellow who has
not given his money?"</p><p>Nobody would speak.</p><p>He said, "This is strange; now how am I going to find out?"</p><p>I said to him, "Do one thing: tell the driver to stop the bus, and
tell the people that unless the person who has not given the money
confesses, the bus will not move."</p><p>He said, "That's right."</p><p>The bus was stopped. Everybody looked at each other, now what to do?
Nobody knew who the person was.…</p><p>Finally one man stood up and said, "Forgive me, I am the person who
has not given the money. Here it is."</p><p>The bus conductor asked, "What is your name?"</p><p>He said, "My name is Achchelal." Achchelal means "a good man."</p><p>And I was surprised that out of thirty people, nobody laughed! When
he said "Achchelal"</p><p>I could not believe it -- a "good man" doing such a thing... and
nobody seemed to see the humor in it.</p><p>Seriousness has become almost part of our bones and blood. You will
have to make some effort to get rid of seriousness, and you will have to
be on the lookout -- wherever you can find something humorous happening,
don't miss the opportunity.</p><p>Everywhere there are people who are slipping on banana peels -- just
nobody is</p><p>looking at them. In fact, it is thought to be ungentlemanly. It is
not, because only bananas slip on banana peels.</p><p>Laughter needs a great learning, and laughter is a great medicine. It
can cure many of your tensions, anxieties, worries; the whole energy can
flow into laughter. And there is no need that there should be some
occasion, some cause.</p><p>In my meditation camps I used to have a laughing meditation: for no
reason, people would sit and just start laughing. At first they would
feel a little awkward that there was no reason -- but when everybody is
doing it... they would also start. Soon, everybody was in such a great
laughter, people were rolling on the ground. They were laughing at the
very fact that so many people were laughing for no reason at all; there
was nothing, not even a joke had been told. And it went on like
waves.</p><p>So there is no harm... even just sitting in your room, close the
doors and have one hour of simple laughter. Laugh at yourself.</p><p>But learn to laugh.</p><p>Seriousness is a sin, and it is a disease.</p><p>Laughter has tremendous beauty, a lightness. It will bring lightness
to you, and it will give you wings to fly.</p><p>And life is so full of opportunities. You just need the sensitivity.
And create chances for other people to laugh. Laughter should be one of
the most valued, cherished qualities of human beings -- because only man
can laugh, no animals are capable of it.</p><p>Because it is human, it must be of the highest order. To repress it
is to destroy a human quality.</p><p>Beyond Enlightenment Chapter #28</p><p>Chapter title: Unless the whole existence... 31 October 1986 pm
in</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>8610315</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>ENLIGH28</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>119</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU HAVE RECENTLY SAID THAT MOST OF HUMANITY IS VEGETATING, NOT
LIVING. PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US THE ART OF LIVING SO THAT DEATH</p><p>MAY BECOME ALSO A CELEBRATION.</p><p>Suraj Prakash, man is born to achieve life, but it all depends on
him.</p><p>He can miss it. He can go on breathing, he can go on eating, he can
go on growing old, he can go on moving towards the grave -- but this is
not life. This is gradual death from the cradle to the grave, a
seventy-year-long gradual death.</p><p>And because millions of people around you are dying in this gradual,
slow death,</p><p>you also start imitating them. Children learn everything from those
who are around them, and we are surrounded by the dead.</p><p>So first we have to understand what I mean by `life'. It must not be
simply growing old.</p><p>It must be growing up.</p><p>And these are two different things.</p><p>Growing old, any animal is capable of. Growing up is the prerogative
of human beings.</p><p>Only a few claim the right.</p><p>Growing up means moving every moment deeper into the principle of
life; it means going farther away from death -- not towards death. The
deeper you go into life, the more you understand the immortality within
you. You are going away from death; a moment comes when you can see that
death is nothing but changing clothes, or changing houses, changing
forms -- nothing dies, nothing can die.</p><p>Death is the greatest illusion there is.</p><p>For growing up, just watch a tree. As the tree grows up, its roots
are growing down, deeper. There is a balance: the higher the tree goes,
the deeper the roots will go. You cannot have a tree one hundred and
fifty feet high with small roots; they could not support such a huge
tree.</p><p>In life, growing up means growing deep within yourself -- that's
where your roots are.</p><p>To me, the first principle of life is meditation. Everything else
comes second. And childhood is the best time. As you grow older, it
means you are coming closer to death, and it becomes more and more
difficult to go into meditation.</p><p>Meditation means going into your immortality, going into your
eternity, going into your godliness.</p><p>And the child is the most qualified person because he is still
unburdened by knowledge, unburdened by religion, unburdened by
education, unburdened by all kinds of rubbish.</p><p>He is innocent.</p><p>But unfortunately his innocence is being condemned as ignorance.
Ignorance and innocence have a similarity, but they are not the same.
Ignorance is also a state of not knowing, just as innocence is. But
there is a great difference too, which has been overlooked by the whole
of humanity up to now. Innocence is not knowledgeable -- but it is not
desirous of being knowledgeable either. It is utterly content,
fulfilled.</p><p>A small child has no ambitions, he has no desires. He is so absorbed
in the moment -- a bird on the wing catches his eye so totally; just a
butterfly, its beautiful colors, and he is enchanted; the rainbow in the
sky... and he cannot conceive that there can be anything more
significant, richer than this rainbow. And the night full of stars,
stars beyond stars.…</p><p>Innocence is rich, it is full, it is pure.</p><p>Ignorance is poor, it is a beggar -- it wants this, it wants that, it
wants to be knowledgeable, it wants to be respectable, it wants to be
wealthy, it wants to be powerful.</p><p>Ignorance moves on the path of desire. Innocence is a state of
desirelessness.</p><p>But because they both are without knowledge, we have remained
confused about their natures. We have taken it for granted that they are
both the same.</p><p>The first step in the art of living will be to create a demarcation
line between ignorance and innocence. Innocence has to be supported,
protected -- because the child has brought with him the greatest
treasure, the treasure that sages find after arduous effort. Sages have
said that they become children again, that they are reborn.</p><p>In India the real brahmin, the real knower, has called himself dwij,
twice born. Why twice born? What happened to the first birth? What is
the need of the</p><p>second birth? And what is he going to gain in the second birth? In
the second birth he is going to gain what was available in the first
birth but the society, the parents, the people surrounding him crushed
it, destroyed it.</p><p>Every child is being stuffed with knowledge. His simplicity has to be
somehow removed, because simplicity is not going to help him in this
competitive world. His simplicity will look to the world as if he is a
simpleton; his innocence will be exploited in every possible way. Afraid
of the society, afraid of the world we have created ourselves, we try to
make every child be clever, cunning, knowledgeable -- to be in the
category of the powerful, not in the category of the oppressed and the
powerless.</p><p>And once the child starts growing in the wrong direction, he goes on
moving that way --</p><p>his whole life moves in that direction.</p><p>Whenever you understand that you have missed life, the first
principle to be brought back is innocence. Drop your knowledge, forget
your scriptures, forget your religions, your theologies, your
philosophies. Be born again, become innocent -- and it is in your
hands.</p><p>Clean your mind of all that is not known by you, of all that is
borrowed, all that has come from tradition, convention, all that has
been given to you by others -- parents, teachers, universities. Just get
rid of it.</p><p>Once again be simple, once again be a child. And this miracle is
possible by meditation.</p><p>Meditation is simply a strange surgical method which cuts you away
from all that is not yours and saves only that which is your authentic
being. It burns everything else and leaves you standing naked, alone
under the sun, in the wind. It is as if you are the first man who has
descended onto earth -- who knows nothing, who has to discover
everything, who has to be a seeker, who has to go on a pilgrimage.</p><p>The second principle is the pilgrimage.</p><p>Life must be a seeking -- not a desire, but a search; not an ambition
to become</p><p>this, to become that, a president of a country or a prime minister of
a country, but a search to find out "Who am I?"</p><p>It is very strange that people who don't know who they are, are
trying to become somebody. They don't even know who they are right now!
They are unacquainted with their being -- but they have a goal of
becoming.</p><p>Becoming is the disease of the soul. Being is you.</p><p>And to discover your being is the beginning of life. Then each moment
is a new discovery, each moment brings a new joy; a new mystery opens
its doors, a new love starts growing in you, a new compassion that you
have never felt before, a new sensitivity about beauty, about
goodness.</p><p>You become so sensitive that even the smallest blade of grass takes
on an immense importance for you. Your sensitivity makes it clear to you
that this small blade of grass is as important to existence as the
biggest star; without this blade of grass, existence would be less than
it is. And this small blade of grass is unique, it is irreplaceable, it
has its own individuality.</p><p>And this sensitivity will create new friendships for you --
friendships with trees, with birds, with animals, with mountains, with
rivers, with oceans, with stars. Life becomes richer as love grows, as
friendliness grows.</p><p>In the life of St. Francis, there is a beautiful incident. He is
dying, and he has always traveled on a donkey from place to place
sharing his experiences. All his disciples are gathered to listen to his
last words.</p><p>The last words of a man are always the most significant that he has
ever uttered because they contain the whole experience of his life.</p><p>But what the disciples heard, they could not believe.…</p><p>St. Francis did not address the disciples; he addressed the donkey.
He said, "Brother, I am immensely indebted to you. You have been
carrying me from one place to another place with never a complaint,
never grumbling. Before I leave this world, all that I want is
forgiveness from you; I have not been humane to you."</p><p>These were the last words of St. Francis. A tremendous sensitivity to
say to the donkey,</p><p>"Brother donkey" and ask to be forgiven.</p><p>As you become more sensitive, life becomes bigger. It is not a small
pond, it becomes oceanic. It is not confined to you and your wife and
your children -- it is not confined at all. This whole existence becomes
your family, and unless the whole existence is your family you have not
known what life is -- because no man is an island, we are all
connected.</p><p>We are a vast continent, joined in millions of ways.</p><p>And if our hearts are not full of love for the whole, in the same
proportion our life is cut short.</p><p>Meditation will bring you sensitivity, a great sense of belonging to
the world. It is our world -- the stars are ours, and we are not
foreigners here. We belong intrinsically to existence. We are part of
it, we are heart of it.</p><p>Secondly, meditation will bring you a great silence -- because all
rubbish knowledge is gone. Thoughts that are part of the knowledge are
gone too... an immense silence, and you are surprised:</p><p>This silence is the only music there is.</p><p>All music is an effort to bring this silence somehow into
manifestation.</p><p>The seers of the ancient East have been very emphatic about the point
that all the great arts -- music, poetry, dance, painting, sculpture --
are all born out of meditation. They are an effort to in some way bring
the unknowable into the world of the known for those who are not ready
for the pilgrimage -- just gifts for those who are not ready to go on
the pilgrimage. Perhaps a song may trigger a desire to go in search of
the source, perhaps a statue.</p><p>The next time you enter a temple of Gautam Buddha or Mahavira just
sit silently, watch the statue. Because the statue has been made in such
a way, in such proportions that if you watch it you will fall silent. It
is a statue of meditation; it is not concerned with Gautam Buddha or
Mahavira.</p><p>That's why all those statues look alike -- Mahavira, Gautam Buddha,
Neminatha, Adinatha.… Twenty-four tirthankaras of Jainas... in the same
temple you will find twenty-four statues all alike, exactly alike.</p><p>In my childhood I used to ask my father, "Can you explain to me how
it is possible that twenty-four persons are exactly alike? -- the same
size, the same nose, the same face, the same body "</p><p>And he used to say, "I don't know. I am always puzzled myself that
there is not a bit of difference. And it is almost unheard of -- there
are not even two persons in the whole world who are alike, what to say
about twenty-four?"</p><p>But as my meditation blossomed I found the answer -- not from anybody
else, I found the answer: that these statues have nothing to do with the
people. These statues have something to do with what was happening
inside those twenty-four people, and that was exactly the same.</p><p>And we have not bothered about the outside; we have insisted that
only the inner should be paid attention to. The outer is unimportant.
Somebody is young, somebody is old, somebody is black, somebody is
white, somebody is man, somebody is woman -- it does not matter; what
matters is that inside there is an ocean of silence. In that oceanic
state, the body takes a certain posture.</p><p>You have observed it yourself, but you have not been alert. When you
are angry, have you observed? -- your body takes a certain posture. In
anger you cannot keep your hands open; in anger -- the fist. In anger
you cannot smile -- or can you?</p><p>With a certain emotion, the body has to follow a certain posture.
Just small things are deeply related inside.</p><p>So those statues are made in such a way that if you simply sit
silently and watch, and then close your eyes, a negative shadow image
enters into your body and you start feeling something you have not felt
before.</p><p>Those statues and temples were not built for worshipping; they were
built for experiencing. They are scientific laboratories. They have
nothing to do with religion. A certain secret science has been used for
centuries so the coming generations could come in contact with the
experiences of the older generations -</p><p>- not through books, not through words, but through something which
goes deeper -- through silence, through meditation, through peace.</p><p>As your silence grows; your friendliness, your love grows; your life
becomes a moment-to-moment dance, a joy, a celebration.</p><p>Do you hear the firecrackers outside? Have you ever thought about
why, all over the world, in every culture, in every society, there are a
few days in the year for celebration?</p><p>These few days for celebration are just a compensation -- because
these societies have taken away all celebration of your life, and if
nothing is given to you in compensation your life can become a danger to
the culture.</p><p>Every culture has to give some compensation to you so that you don't
feel completely lost in misery, in sadness. But these compensations are
false.</p><p>These firecrackers outside and these lights outside cannot make you
rejoice. They are only for children; for you they are just a nuisance.
But in your inner world there can be a continuity of lights, songs,
joys.</p><p>Always remember that society compensates you when it feels that the
repressed may explode into a dangerous situation if it is not
compensated. The society finds some way of allowing you to let out the
repressed. But this is not true celebration, and it cannot be true.</p><p>True celebration should come from your life, in your life.</p><p>And true celebration cannot be according to the calendar, that on the
first of November you will celebrate. Strange, the whole year you are
miserable and on the first of November suddenly you come out of misery,
dancing. Either the misery was false or the first of November is false;
both cannot be true. And once the first of November is gone, you are
back in your dark hole, everybody in his misery, everybody in his
anxiety.</p><p>Life should be a continuous celebration, a festival of lights the
whole year round. Only then you can grow up, you can blossom.</p><p>Transform small things into celebration.</p><p>For example, in Japan they have the tea ceremony. In every Zen
monastery and in every person's house who can afford it, they have a
small temple for drinking tea. Now, tea is no longer an ordinary,
profane thing; they have transformed it into a celebration. The temple
for drinking tea is made in a certain way -- in a beautiful garden, with
a beautiful pond; swans in the pond, flowers all around... guests come
and they have to leave their shoes outside. It is a temple.</p><p>And as you enter the temple, you cannot speak; you have to leave your
thinking and thoughts and speech outside with your shoes. You sit down
in a meditative posture. And the host, the lady who prepares tea for you
-- her movements are so graceful, as if she is dancing, moving around
preparing tea, putting cups and saucers before you as if you are gods.
With such respect... she will bow down, and you will receive it with the
same respect.</p><p>The tea is prepared in a special samovar which makes beautiful
sounds, a music of its own. And it is part of the tea ceremony that
everybody should listen first to the music of the tea. So everybody is
silent, listening... birds chirping outside in the garden, and the
samovar... the tea is creating its own song. A peace surrounds.…</p><p>When the tea is ready and it is poured into everybody's cup, you are
not just to drink it the way people are doing everywhere. First you will
smell the aroma of the tea. You will sip the tea as if it has come from
the beyond, you will take time</p><p>-- there is no hurry.</p><p>Somebody may start playing on the flute or on the sitar.</p><p>An ordinary thing -- just tea -- and they have made it a beautiful
religious festival, and everybody comes out of it nourished, fresh,
feeling younger, feeling juicier.</p><p>And what can be done with tea can be done with everything -- with
your clothes, with your food.</p><p>People are living almost in sleep; otherwise, every fabric, every
cloth has its own beauty, its own feel. If you are sensitive, then the
clothing is not just to cover your body; then it is something expressing
your individuality, something expressing your taste, your culture, your
being.</p><p>Everything that you do should be expressive of you; it should have
your</p><p>signature on it.</p><p>Then life becomes a continuous celebration.</p><p>Even if you fall sick and you are lying in bed, you will make those
moments of lying in bed moments of beauty and joy, moments of relaxation
and rest, moments of meditation, moments of listening to music or to
poetry. There is no need to be sad that you are sick.</p><p>You should be happy that everybody is in the office and you are in
your bed like a king, relaxing -- somebody is preparing tea for you, the
samovar is singing a song, a friend has offered to come and play flute
for you.… These things are more important than any medicine. When you
are sick, call a doctor. But more important, call those who love you
because there is no medicine more important than love. Call those who
can create beauty, music, poetry around you because there is nothing
that heals like a mood of celebration.</p><p>Medicine is the lowest kind of treatment.</p><p>But it seems we have forgotten everything, so we have to depend on
medicine and be grumpy and sad -- as if you are missing some great joy
that you were having in the office! In the office you were miserable --
just one day off, and you cling to misery too; you won't let it go.</p><p>Make everything creative, make the best out of the worst -- that's
what I call `the art'. And if a man has lived his whole life making
every moment and every phase of it a beauty, a love, a joy, naturally
his death is going to be the ultimate peak of his whole life's endeavor.
The last touches... his death is not going to be ugly as it ordinarily
happens every day to everyone.</p><p>If death is ugly, that means your whole life has been a wastage.</p><p>Death should be a peaceful acceptance, a loving entry into the
unknown, a joyful goodbye to old friends, to the old world. There should
not be any tragedy in it.</p><p>One Zen master, Lin Chi, was dying. Thousands of his disciples had
gathered to listen to the last sermon, but Lin Chi was simply lying down
-- joyous, smiling, but not saying a single word.</p><p>Seeing that he was going to die and he was not saying a single word,
somebody</p><p>reminded Lin Chi -- an old friend, a master in his own right.… He was
not a disciple of Lin Chi.</p><p>That's why he could say to him, "Lin Chi, have you forgotten that you
have to say your last words? I have always said your memory isn't right.
You are dying... have you forgotten?"</p><p>Lin Chi said, "Just listen." And on the roof two squirrels were
running, screeching. And he said, "How beautiful" and he died.</p><p>For a moment, when he said "Just listen," there was absolute silence.
Everybody thought he is going to say something great, but only two
squirrels fighting, screeching, running on the roof And he smiled and he
died.</p><p>But he has given his last message: don't make things small and big,
trivial and important.</p><p>Everything is important. At this moment, Lin Chi's death is as
important as the two squirrels running on the roof, there is no
difference. In existence it is all the same. That was his whole
philosophy, his whole life's teaching -- that there is nothing which is
great and there is nothing which is small; it all depends on you, what
you make out of it.</p><p>Start with meditation, and things will go on growing in you --
silence, serenity, blissfulness, sensitivity. And whatever comes out of
meditation, try to bring it out in life.</p><p>Share it, because everything shared grows fast. And when you have
reached the point of death, you will know there is no death. You can say
goodbye, there is no need for any tears of sadness -- maybe tears of
joy, but not of sadness.</p><p>But you have to begin from being innocent.</p><p>So first, throw out all crap that you are carrying. And everybody is
carrying so much crap</p><p>-- and one wonders, for what? Just because people have been telling
you that these are great ideas, principles...</p><p>You have not been intelligent with yourself. Be intelligent with
yourself.</p><p>Life is very simple; it is a joyful dance. And the whole earth can be
full of joy and dance, but there are people who are seriously vested in
their interest that nobody should enjoy life, that nobody should smile,
that nobody should laugh, that life is a sin, that it is a punishment.
How can you enjoy when the climate is such that you have been told
continuously that it is a punishment? -- that you are suffering because
you have done wrong things and it is a kind of jail where you have been
thrown to suffer?</p><p>I say to you life is not a jail, it is not a punishment. It is a
reward, and it is given only to those who have earned it, who deserve
it. Now it is your right to enjoy; it will be a sin if you DON'T
enjoy.</p><p>It will be against existence if you don't beautify it, if you leave
it just as you have found it. No, leave it a little happier, a little
more beautiful, a little more fragrant.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>AS A DISCIPLE OF YOUR MYSTERY SCHOOL, I WANT TO ASK YOU THE</p><p>FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE</p><p>BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT NOW, IT FELT LIKE A RELAXATION IN MY</p><p>HEART. THAT VERY MOMENT A PICTURE AROSE IN ME SHOWING ME THAT</p><p>YOU ARE EVEN CLOSER TO US NOW, AND IT FEELS TO ME AS IF I CAN</p><p>SOMEHOW UNDERSTAND "BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT" BETTER THAN</p><p>ENLIGHTENMENT ITSELF.</p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?</p><p>Adima, it raises a few fundamental questions.</p><p>First, if you cannot understand enlightenment, how can you understand
that which is beyond it?</p><p>You are MISunderstanding.</p><p>Your misunderstanding is that perhaps beyond enlightenment means
below enlightenment.</p><p>And you are feeling happy, but I cannot feel happy with your
happiness. I feel sorry for it. You are feeling happy that I have come
close to you. You should feel happy when you come close to me.</p><p>Just think: if I say that I have dropped even "beyond enlightenment,"
that it was all fiction -- enlightenment, beyond enlightenment... I am
just one of you who had a few imaginative, fictitious ideas -- you will
feel even happier. Now there is nothing for you to worry about, nowhere
to go, nothing to achieve, you are perfectly okay.</p><p>Your question makes me understand why Gautam Buddha remained with
enlightenment -</p><p>- although he was seeing it, the stars beyond were calling him. He
was the first man to see beyond enlightenment, but he didn't go beyond;
he remained at the stage of enlightenment.</p><p>Perhaps it was for people like you. Because you will not be able to
understand the person who goes beyond enlightenment; in a way he will
become almost ordinary -- and there is the danger. Your ordinariness and
his ordinariness are poles apart -- but both are ordinariness, and the
danger is that you will misunderstand. He has come back home.</p><p>You have not even started the journey.</p><p>It is almost like meeting someone on a staircase -- you are both
standing on the same step; one is going, one is coming. Both are on the
same step -- in a way equal -- but one is going up, one is going down.
Hence, they are not equal, their equality is illusory.</p><p>I thought perhaps that in the twenty-five centuries after Gautam
Buddha man might have become a little more intelligent -- and someone
some day has to try going beyond and see what happens, how people take
it.</p><p>The way you have understood it is absolutely wrong.</p><p>I have not come closer to you, I have gone farther away.</p><p>And you cannot avoid enlightenment; if you avoid it, you cannot reach
beyond it. It is simple arithmetic. That's what is making you happy,
that perhaps enlightenment can be avoided -- when one has to go beyond
it, what is the need to first go to enlightenment and then go beyond it?
We are already beyond it!</p><p>You are not beyond it. You are behind it.</p><p>And in any case enlightenment cannot be avoided. One has to pass
through that fire, through that great experience.</p><p>So drop that idea that I have come closer to you.</p><p>My being closer to you is not significant. What is significant is
your being closer to me.</p><p>You say, "Now you are a friend to us."</p><p>I have always been a friend to you. The question is from your side:
are you a friend to me? And my friendship will enhance and enrich my
life, not your life. It is your friendship that is going to enhance and
enrich your life. And if you can be a friend to one who is enlightened
you have taken a long jump, you have extended your hands for a faraway
star, you have stretched your being to its fullest. This will give you
an evolution.</p><p>And only after you have reached the point of enlightenment can you
see that there are skies beyond skies, that enlightenment is not the
end. Existence is not exhausted yet; there is still much more ahead, the
journey continues.</p><p>Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>NOW THAT I AM SLOWLY, SLOWLY TURNING INWARD, I FIND THIS</p><p>LONGING MIXED WITH SADNESS WELLING UP FREQUENTLY. IT SEEMS</p><p>CONNECTED WITH THE FEELINGS THAT ARISE WHEN I SEE YOU OR DREAM</p><p>ABOUT YOU.</p><p>IS IT THE REALIZATION THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH LOVE AND</p><p>BLISS IN MY LIFE, OR IS IT THE LONGING FOR HOME? WOULD YOU PLEASE
SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THIS?</p><p>It is good and fortunate that nothing satisfies you completely and
entirely. That means you don't become stagnant, that means you have to
keep moving.</p><p>Slowly slowly, you will understand that there is no home, that
movement itself is the home; that there is no end to the pilgrimage but
the pilgrimage itself is the end.</p><p>It is very difficult to understand because we are accustomed to a
certain logic: if we want to go somewhere, going is always just a means,
reaching somewhere is the end.</p><p>But as far as the universal life is concerned, there cannot be a
place where you can say "I have come and now there is nothing
further."</p><p>It is inconceivable that you will find a place which will be the end
and there will be a fence and a board saying, "Here ends the world." And
even if you can find such a place, I would like you to jump the fence --
because there must be something beyond the fence. If the fence cannot
just stand by itself, there must be something beyond it. Somebody is
playing a joke by putting up a board -- "Here ends the world" -- and
fixing a fence there.</p><p>Don't be deceived.</p><p>You will come to many places where you would like to make your home
-- because it is so blissful, so peaceful, you feel so fulfilled; you
don't see the point... why should you continue?</p><p>But I say unless you continue, you will never know that there is much
more. But if you stop, nobody is going to prevent you.</p><p>You need a master to go on goading you, to go on destroying every
home you make, so finally you decide not to make any home -- it is
better to be homeless under the sky and continue the journey.</p><p>In the life of al-Hillaj Mansoor, a beautiful incident is related. He
was a poor man. He collected money from people because he wanted to go
to Kaaba, the sacred place of pilgrimage for the Mohammedans. And
everybody contributed because he was going to Kaaba, and whoever
contributes also gets a share in the virtue that he will get by reaching
there. It is according to how much you give. So people gave him money --
those who could give more, gave more. People even gave beyond their
capacity; they borrowed and gave him money.</p><p>The next day he was back. And they said, "So soon?" -- because in
those days the journey from his place to Kaaba and back used to take
three to six months. "What happened? And where is the money?"</p><p>He said, "A strange man met me on the way just as I was going out of
town. He said,</p><p>`Listen, where are you going?' I said, Ì am going to Kaaba.' He said,
`There is no need.' I said, `But every scripture says there is a need.'
He said, Ì am a living master, and I am saying there is no need. You
just go around me seven times and put all the money in front of me. I am
Junnaid, the great master. Give the money first.' So I said, Ìf you are
Junnaid, then...'"</p><p>Junnaid's name was known all over the country. So al-Hillaj said, "If
Junnaid says something he cannot be wrong. I gave given the money to
Junnaid, went around him seven times, and he told me to go back
home."</p><p>Those people said, "You idiot. First, have you inquired whether he is
Junnaid or not? It seems some cheat has deceived you. Let us go and find
out. If he was</p><p>really Junnaid, he will be sitting there."</p><p>They reached, and Junnaid was sitting there. Junnaid said, "So you
all have come. Put your money here, whatever money you have. Take seven
rounds -- I am a living Kaaba --</p><p>and then go home. And whenever you have money you can come
again."</p><p>So the poor fellows had to put their money there and took seven
rounds, sadly. "This is strange, we never thought that Kaaba would come
just outside our village."</p><p>But the news spread. People started coming from other villages. They
said, "If Junnaid says so, it must be right. That is a dead stone in
Kaaba, and this is a living master."</p><p>Somebody asked him, "We have come. We heard that you were here, so we
have come for the pilgrimage."</p><p>He said, "Just give the money and do the pilgrimage."</p><p>But the man said, "I have a question: After taking seven rounds
around you, is the journey finished? Is the pilgrimage over?"</p><p>He said, "No, whenever you have money again, you can come. This
pilgrimage is never going to end. And if you don't find me here, you
will find somebody else. You can do this pilgrimage around anybody --
you just have to be sensitive to see the real, the living god within. It
is not only within me, it is within you also. If you are alert, you can
take seven rounds around yourself -- no need to waste the money and no
need to go anywhere.</p><p>Remember, there is no home. Or, the home is everywhere -- both are
true." I will not say to you that the home is everywhere -- although it
is true.</p><p>I will say there is no home.</p><p>If you can continue your pilgrimage with this sincerity -- that there
is no home and there is no place you are going to, that just the going
is in itself the beauty, the joy, the blissfulness, everything... the
going itself -- then the second will also</p><p>be true: that wherever you are, it is home. But the second can be
deceptive -- because people are very cunning, even cunning with
themselves. They have misused all truths, they have managed to give them
meanings which support their own ideas. If I say "Everywhere is home"
then they will relax wherever they are, then there is no need.</p><p>So I say: There is no home, and the journey has to be continued. It
has to be a dance.</p><p>Take your guitars and go on, and never stop anywhere.</p><p>That does not mean that you cannot rest for a while. There are
caravanserais but no homes -- stay over for the night, but in the
morning we have to go.</p><p>This ongoing process is what life is.</p><p>The moment it stops, it is death -- and there is no death.</p><p>And why do people hanker for the home? -- security, safety. But in
the name of security and safety, they don't make homes, they make
prisons -- and they are the jailed and they are the jailers, but because
they have the keys in their own hands, they think they are free.</p><p>They are not free. Only a constantly moving river... sometimes slow,
sometimes fast, sometimes falling from the mountains, sometimes moving
very slowly on the plains... but moving all the time.…</p><p>Movement is life, change is life.</p><p>Stay for a while if you feel tired, but stay only to regain enough
energy so that tomorrow morning you can move again.</p><p>The home is everywhere -- but that home is just a caravanserai.</p><p>Never make anything in life stable. That's how things die, that's how
things start stinking.</p><p>Allow movement -- it keeps things fresh, it keeps things alive. It
keeps the adventure alive, the excitement, the ecstasy of the discovery
of the unknown and finally the unknowable.</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU LISTENING, LISTENING, I WAS NEVER</p><p>ABLE TO REMEMBER ANYTHING YOU SAID. AS SO OFTEN BEFORE, YOU</p><p>ARE SPEAKING FROM MY OWN HEART, BUT THE MOMENT THE WORDS</p><p>ARE HEARD, THEY ARE FORGOTTEN TOO.</p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING? AM I NOT REALLY LISTENING?</p><p>It is perfectly good. It is as it should be, because this is not a
kindergarten school where you have to remember every word spoken by
me.</p><p>Here the emphasis is not on remembering; the emphasis is on
listening. If you have listened in silence, then whatever is significant
will be absorbed by the heart. You may forget the words.…</p><p>Words are only containers, not the content. The content will be
absorbed in the heart, and the containers have to be thrown away. You
cannot carry all the containers always.</p><p>Listen perfectly. Never bother about remembering -- because that is a
disturbance. Doing the two things together, then one starts taking notes
-- if not visibly, then inside in the mind. No, don't create
disturbance; just listen. If something is true, your heart will simply
absorb it.</p><p>And the heart has no memory system. The memory system is in the
head.</p><p>But whatever the heart absorbs will be changing your actions, will be
changing your behavior, will be changing you. It will bring a
transformation.</p><p>It will not bring you knowledge, it will bring you transformation. It
will make you a new man.</p><p>So don't be worried about memory at all. Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS THERE ANY WAY TO TRANSCEND BEING A GERMAN?</p><p>Latifa, there is only one way. And you have done it -- you have
become a sannyasin.</p><p>A sannyasin is neither German nor Indian, neither Chinese nor
Japanese. A sannyasin declares that he is simply a human being. He drops
all boundaries, all limitations of nations, of religions, of ideologies.
And that you have done; now don't be worried.</p><p>Now the whole of Germany is afraid of sannyasins.</p><p>You need not be worried about being a German. You just be a sannyasin
and make more and more sannyasins, and Germany will disappear!</p><p>We are going to make Germany the first sannyas land. Beyond

THESE</p><p>STATES ARE NOW BEING CREATED BY ELECTRONIC AND AUDITORY</p><p>STIMULATION OF THE BRAIN, AND THEY CAN BE LEARNED THROUGH</p><p>BIOFEEDBACK.</p><p>THE TRADITIONAL `MEDITATIVE STATE' -- SITTING SILENTLY (OR AT</p><p>LEAST QUIETLY ALERT) IS COMPOSED OF BILATERAL, SYNCHRONOUS</p><p>ALPHA WAVES. DEEPER MEDITATION ALSO HAS BILATERAL THETA</p><p>WAVES. A STATE CALLED `LUCID AWARENESS' HAS THE BILATERAL</p><p>SYNCHRONOUS ALPHA AND THETA WAVES OF DEEP MEDITATION, PLUS</p><p>THE BETA WAVES OF NORMAL THOUGHT PROCESSES. `LUCID AWARENESS'</p><p>CAN BE LEARNED THROUGH BIOFEEDBACK, USING THE MOST MODERN</p><p>EQUIPMENT.</p><p>ARE THESE KINDS OF STIMULATION AND BIOFEEDBACK USEFUL TOOLS</p><p>FOR THE MEDITATOR? WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL
TECHNIQUES TO THE MEDITATION BEYOND</p><p>TECHNIQUE? IS THIS AN EXAMPLE OF BRINGING SCIENCE TOGETHER WITH</p><p>MEDITATION?</p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES -- BOTH</p><p>PERSONALLY IN MY OWN MEDITATION, AND PROFESSIONALLY IN MY</p><p>WORK AS A PHYSICIAN. DO I HAVE YOUR BLESSINGS?</p><p>It is a very complex question.</p><p>You will have to understand one of the most fundamental things about
meditation -- that no technique leads to meditation.</p><p>The old so-called techniques and the new scientific biofeedback
techniques are the same as far as meditation is concerned.</p><p>Meditation is not a byproduct of any technique.</p><p>Meditation happens beyond mind. No technique can go beyond mind.</p><p>But there is going to be a great misunderstanding in scientific
circles, and it has a certain basis. The basis of all misunderstanding
is: When the being of a person is in a state of meditation, it creates
certain waves in the mind. These waves can be created from the outside
by technical means. But those waves will not create meditation -- this
is the misunderstanding.</p><p>Meditation creates those waves; it is the mind reflecting the inner
world.</p><p>You cannot see what is happening inside. But you can see what is
happening in the mind.</p><p>Now there are sensitive instruments... we can judge what kind of
waves are there when a person is asleep, what kinds of waves are there
when a person is dreaming, what kinds of waves are there when a person
is in meditation.</p><p>But by creating the waves, you cannot create the situation -- because
those waves are only symptoms, indicators.</p><p>It is perfectly good, you can study them. But remember that there is
no shortcut to meditation, and no mechanical device can be of any help.
In fact, meditation needs no technique -- scientific or otherwise.</p><p>Meditation is simply an understanding.</p><p>It is not a question of sitting silently, it is not a question of
chanting a mantra. It is a question of understanding the subtle workings
of the mind. As you understand those workings of the mind a great
awareness arises in you which is not of the mind. That awareness arises
in your being, in your soul, in your consciousness.</p><p>Mind is only a mechanism, but when that awareness arises it is bound
to create a certain energy pattern around it. That energy pattern is
noted by the mind. Mind is a very subtle mechanism.</p><p>And you are studying from the outside, so at the most you can study
the mind. Seeing that whenever a person is silent, serene, peaceful, a
certain wave pattern</p><p>always, inevitably appears in the mind, the scientific thinking will
say: if we can create this wave pattern in the mind, through some
biofeedback technology, then the being inside will reach the heights of
awareness.</p><p>This is not going to happen.</p><p>It is not a question of cause and effect.</p><p>These waves in the mind are not the cause of meditation; they are, on
the contrary, the effect. But from the effect you cannot move towards
the cause. It is possible that by biofeedback you can create certain
patterns in the mind and they will give a feeling of peace, silence and
serenity to the person. Because the person himself does not know what
meditation is and has no way of comparing, he may be misled into
believing that this is meditation -- but it is not. Because the moment
the biofeedback mechanism stops, the waves disappear, and the silence
and the peace and the serenity also disappear.</p><p>And you may go on practicing with those scientific instruments for
years; it will not change your character, it will not change your
morality, it will not change your individuality. You will remain the
same.</p><p>Meditation transforms. It takes you to higher levels of consciousness
and changes your whole lifestyle. It changes your reactions into
responses to such an extent that it is unbelievable that the person who
would have reacted in the same situation in anger is now acting in deep
compassion, with love -- in the same situation.</p><p>Meditation is a state of being, arrived at through understanding. It
needs intelligence, it does not need techniques.</p><p>There is no technique that can give you intelligence. Otherwise, we
would have changed all the idiots into geniuses; all the mediocre people
would have become Albert Einsteins, Bertrand Russells, Jean-Paul
Sartres. There is no way to change your intelligence from the outside,
to sharpen it, to make it more penetrating, to give it more insight. It
is simply a question of understanding, and nobody else can do it for you
-- no machine, no man.</p><p>For centuries the so-called gurus have been cheating humanity. Now,
in the future instead of gurus, these guru machines will cheat
humanity.</p><p>The gurus were cheating people, saying that "We will give you a
mantra. You repeat the mantra." Certainly by repeating a mantra
continuously, you create the energy field of a certain wave length; but
the man remains the same, because it is only on the surface.</p><p>Just as if you have throw a pebble into the silent lake and ripples
arise and move all over the lake from one corner to the other corner --
but it does not touch the depths of the lake at all. The depths are
completely unaware of what is happening on the surface.</p><p>And what you see on the surface is also illusory. You think that
ripples are moving --</p><p>that's not true. Nothing is moving.</p><p>When you throw a pebble into the lake, it is not that ripples start
moving. You can check it by putting a small flower on the water. You
will be surprised: the flower remains in the same place. If the waves
were moving and going towards the shore, they would have taken the
flower with them. The flower remains there. The waves are not moving, it
is just the water going up and down in the same place, creating the
illusion of movement.</p><p>The depths of the lake will not know anything about it. And there is
going to be no change in the character, in the beauty of the lake by
creating those waves.</p><p>Mind is between the world and you.</p><p>Whatever happens in the world, the mind is affected by it; and you
can understand through the mind what is happening outside.</p><p>For example, you are seeing me -- you cannot see me; it is your mind
that is affected by certain rays and creates a picture in the mind. You
are inside, and from inside you see the picture. You don't see me; you
can't see me.</p><p>The mind is the mediator. Just as when it is affected by the outside,
the inner consciousness can read it -- what is happening outside -- what
the scientists are trying to do is just the same: they are studying
meditators and reading their wave lengths, the energy fields created by
meditation. And naturally, the scientific approach is that if these
certain patterns appear without any exception when a person is in
meditation, then we have got the key; if we can create these
patterns</p><p>in the mind, then meditation is bound to appear inside. That's where
the fallacy is.</p><p>You can create the pattern in the mind.…</p><p>And if the person does not know about meditation, he may feel a
silence, a serenity -- for the moment, as long as those waves
remain.</p><p>But you cannot deceive a meditator because the meditator will see
that those patterns are appearing in the mind.…</p><p>Mind is a lower reality, and the lower reality cannot change the
higher reality. The mind is the servant; it cannot change the
master.</p><p>But you can experiment.</p><p>Just remain aware that whether it is a biofeedback machine or a
chanting of OM, it does not matter; it only creates a mental peace, and
a mental peace is not meditation.</p><p>Meditation is the flight beyond the mind. It has nothing to do with
mental peace.</p><p>One of America's great thinkers, Joshua Liebman, has written a very
famous book, PEACE OF MIND. I wrote him a letter many years ago when I
came across the book, saying that "If you are sincere and honest, you
should withdraw the book from the market because there is no such thing
as peace of mind. Mind is the problem. When there is no mind then there
is peace, so how there can be peace of mind? And any peace of mind is
only fallacious; it simply means the noise has slowed down to such a
point that you think it is silence. And you don't have anything to
compare it with."</p><p>A man who knows what meditation is cannot be deceived by any
techniques, because no technique can give you understanding of the
workings of the mind.</p><p>For example, you feel anger, you feel jealousy, you feel hatred, you
feel lust. Is there any technique that can help you to get rid of anger?
of jealousy? of hatred? of sexual lust?</p><p>And if these things continue to remain, your lifestyle is going to
remain the same as before.</p><p>There is only one way -- there has never been a second. There is one
and only one way to understand that to be angry is to be stupid: watch
anger in all its phases, be alert to it so it does not catch you
unawares; remain watchful, seeing every step of the anger. And you will
be surprised: that as awareness about the ways of anger grows, the anger
starts evaporating.</p><p>And when the anger disappears, then there is a peace. Peace is not a
positive achievement.</p><p>When the hatred disappears, there is love. Love is not a positive
achievement. When jealousy disappears, there is a deep friendliness
towards all.</p><p>Try to understand.…</p><p>But all the religions have corrupted your minds because they have not
taught you how to watch, how to understand; instead they have given you
conclusions -- that anger is bad.</p><p>And the moment you condemn something, you have already taken a
certain position of judgment. You have judged. Now you cannot be
aware.</p><p>Awareness needs a state of no-judgment.</p><p>And all the religions have been teaching people judgments: this is
good, this is bad, this is sin, this is virtue -- this is the whole crap
that for centuries man's mind has been loaded with. So, with everything
-- the moment you see it -- there is immediately a judgment about it
within you. You cannot simply see it, you cannot be just a mirror
without saying anything.</p><p>Understanding arises by becoming a mirror, a mirror of all that goes
on in the mind.</p><p>There is a beautiful story -- not just a story, but an actual
historical fact.</p><p>One disciple of Gautam Buddha is going on a journey to spread his
message. He has come to see Gautam Buddha and to get his blessings, and
to ask if there is</p><p>any last message, any last words to be said to him.</p><p>And Gautam Buddha said, "Just remember one thing: While walking, keep
your gaze just four feet ahead, looking four feet ahead of you."</p><p>Since that day, for twenty-five centuries, Buddhist monks have walked
in the same way.</p><p>That was a strategy to keep you from seeing women in particular.
Those disciples were monks. They had taken the vow of celibacy.</p><p>Ananda, another of Gautam Buddha's disciples, could not understand
what the matter was, why the monk should keep his eyes always focused
four feet ahead. He inquired: "I want to know, what is the matter?"</p><p>Buddha said, "That's how he will avoid looking at a woman, at least a
woman's face -- at the most he will see her feet."</p><p>But Ananda said, "There may be situations when a woman is in a
danger. For example, she has fallen into a well and is shouting for
help. What is your disciple supposed to do?</p><p>He will have to see her face, her body."</p><p>Buddha said, "In special situations he is allowed to see her, but it
is not the rule, it is only the exception."</p><p>Ananda said, "What about touching? -- because there may be situations
when a woman has fallen on the road. What is your disciple supposed to
do? Should he help her to get up or not? Or an old woman wants to cross
the road -- what is your disciple supposed to do?"</p><p>Buddha said, "As an exception -- but remember it is not a rule -- he
can touch the woman with one condition, and if he cannot fulfill the
condition he is not allowed the exceptions.</p><p>The condition is that he should remain just a mirror, he should not
take any judgment, any attitude. `The woman is beautiful' -- that is a
judgment. `The woman is fair' -- that is a judgment. He should remain a
mirror, then he is allowed the exceptions. Otherwise, let the woman
drown in the well -- somebody</p><p>else will save her. You save yourself!"</p><p>What he is saying is this: in every situation where mind starts any
kind of desire, greed, lust, ambition, possessiveness, the meditator has
to be just a mirror. And what is that going to do? To be just a mirror
means you are simply aware.</p><p>In pure awareness the mind cannot drag you down into the mud, into
the gutter. In anger, in hatred, in jealousy, the mind is absolutely
impotent in the face of awareness. And because the mind is absolutely
impotent, your whole being is in a profound silence -- the peace that
passeth understanding.</p><p>Naturally that peace, that silence, that joy, that blissfulness will
affect the mind. It will create ripples in the mind, it will change the
wave lengths in the mind, and the scientist will be reading those waves,
those wave patterns and he will be thinking, "If these wave patterns can
be created in someone by mechanical devices, then we will be able to
create the profoundness of a Gautam Buddha."</p><p>Don't be stupid.</p><p>All your technical devices can be good, can be helpful. They are not
going to do any harm; they will be giving some taste of peace, of
silence -- although very superficial, still it is something for those
who have never known anything of peace.</p><p>For the thirsty, even dirty water does not look dirty. For the
thirsty, even dirty water is a great blessing.</p><p>So you can start your experiments with all my blessings, but remember
it is not meditation that you are giving to people -- you don't know
meditation yourself. You may be giving them a little rest, a little
relaxation -- and there is nothing wrong in it.</p><p>But if you give them the idea that this is meditation then you are
certainly being harmful -</p><p>- because these people will stop at the technical things, with the
superficial silence, thinking that this is all and they have gained
it.</p><p>You can be helpful to people. Tell them that "This is just a
mechanical way of</p><p>putting your mind at peace, and mind at peace is not the real peace
-- real peace is when mind is absent. And that is not possible from the
outside, but only from the inside. And inside you have the intelligence,
the understanding to do the miracle."</p><p>It is good for people who cannot relax, who cannot find a few moments
of peace, whose minds are continuously chattering -- your technical
devices are good, your biofeedback mechanisms are good. But make it
clear to them that this is not meditation, this is just a mechanical
device to help you relax, to give you a superficial feeling of silence.
If this silence creates an urge in you to find the real, the inner, the
authentic source of peace, then those technical devices have been
friends, and the technicians who have been using them have not been
barriers but have been bridges. Become a bridge.</p><p>Give people the little taste that is possible through machines, but
don't give them the false idea that this is what meditation is. Tell
them that this is only a faraway echo of the real; if you want the real,
you will have to go through a deep inner search, a profound
understanding of your mind, an awareness of all the cunning ways of the
mind so that the mind can be put aside. Then the mind is no longer
between you and existence, and the doors are open.</p><p>Meditation is the ultimate experience of blissfulness.</p><p>It cannot be produced by drugs, it cannot be produced by machines, it
cannot be produced from the outside.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE COMMUNES OF MAHAVIRA AND BUDDHA SURVIVED EVEN AFTER</p><p>THEIR LIFETIMES, BUT YOUR COMMUNES ARE NOT SURVIVING IN YOUR</p><p>LIFETIME ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SELF-SUFFICIENT.</p><p>DOES SURVIVAL OF COMMUNES DEPEND ON SOCIAL STRUCTURE,</p><p>AFFLUENCE OF THE SOCIETY, PREVALENT RELIGIONS, OR NATIONAL AND</p><p>INTERNATIONAL POLITICS? PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>The first thing to understand: Gautam Buddha and Mahavira had no
communes.</p><p>Their disciples were wandering monks; they were not living a commune
life in one place, they were always on the move -- except for the rainy
season. And even in the rainy season they used to stay in different
places.</p><p>My commune was an alternative society.</p><p>Gautam Buddha and Mahavira did not provide an alternative society;
hence they were not in conflict with the society. On the contrary, they
were dependent on the society for food, for clothes, for shelter --
their disciples were dependent on the society for everything.</p><p>They could not be rebellious. How can you be rebellious against a
society which gives you food, which gives you clothes, which gives you
shelter, which gives you everything that you need? You cannot go against
its morality -- it may be rotten, but you have to support it. You cannot
go against its traditions.</p><p>My commune was a totally new experiment. It has never happened
before. There is no comparison in the past because my people were not
dependent on anybody, and they were against the society, the culture,
the civilization, the religion, the politics, the education --
everything that constitutes the world.</p><p>We were fighting an impossible fight -- a small group trying to live
in a totally different way from the whole of humanity.</p><p>Mahavira was not against marriage; I am. Mahavira was not respectful
towards women; I am.</p><p>Buddha was as much a male chauvinist as anybody else. For twenty
years continuously, he refused to initiate any women into Buddhism. He
never accepted the idea that they are equal to men. I say they are not
only equal but in some respects superior.</p><p>My commune was a revolt.</p><p>Their religions -- Gautam Buddha's and Mahavira's religions -- were
simply offshoots of the same civilization, the same society, the same
morality, the same superstitions.</p><p>Yes, they were arguing about invisible things which nobody bothers
about -- whether God is seven feet high or six feet high is nobody's
business. Whether God has three faces or only one face, it is God's
problem, it is nobody else's problem. Maybe if he has three faces then
God's tailor might have a problem!</p><p>They were disagreeing on many points, but all those points were
immaterial, not substantial, not concerned with the life that man is
living here and now -- about that they were all in absolute
agreement.</p><p>Hence it was absolutely to be expected that my commune would be
destroyed.</p><p>It was against the church, it was against the state, it was against
all that your so- called civilization stands for -- because I don't
believe man has yet become civilized.</p><p>If man has become civilized, then there is no need for wars; if man
has become civilized, then there is no need for discrimination between
blacks and whites, men and women; if man has become civilized then there
is no need for people to die because they have nothing to eat -- and
there are people who are dying because they have too much to eat.</p><p>In America, thirty million people are dying from overeating, and
thirty million people are dying because they have nothing to eat.</p><p>And you call this world a civilized world? It is not even sane. And
it cannot be just coincidence: exactly thirty million people overeating,
knowing perfectly well that they are eating themselves to death, knowing
perfectly well that thirty million people are on the streets dying
without food. Strange... sixty million people can be saved within a
second, but these sixty million people will die.</p><p>I have heard.… A man was very much worried because his wife was
getting fatter and fatter and fatter.</p><p>And women have greater capacity for becoming fat than men -- it is a
biological</p><p>privilege, because the woman has to be able to become pregnant, to
become a mother; then for nine months she cannot eat well, she throws
up, she is carrying such a load in her belly. And every day the child
needs more and more food. It is a very strange situation: the woman
cannot eat, and the child wants more food because he is growing. Hence
nature has made woman's body capable of collecting more fat for
emergency measures.</p><p>So even if she does not eat, the child can get as much as he needs
from the reserve fat the woman has; and the woman can also go on eating
her own fat -- and nine months is a long time. So the woman has immense
capacity. If she uses her full capacity, then man is no competitor.</p><p>And women are thinner while they are not married. Once they are
married they start becoming fat -- because now there is no problem. They
have got hold of a man who cannot escape so it does not matter what
happens to their body proportions; they are no more interested in any
beauty competition.</p><p>The man asked his doctor, "What has to be done?"</p><p>The doctor said, "You do one thing: take a beautiful picture of a
naked woman and paste it inside the fridge, so whenever your wife opens
the fridge for more ice cream she will think, `What a beautiful body!'
And she may start thinking about herself, that this is not good."</p><p>The man said, "That idea is very good."</p><p>After two months the doctor met the man, and he could not believe it.
He said, "What happened? I have not seen you for two months, and you
have become so fat!"</p><p>He said, "Everything went wrong because of your suggestion, you
idiot! Are you my doctor or my enemy? I pasted a beautiful woman, naked,
inside the fridge. Since then my wife does not open the fridge, but I
cannot remain more than fifteen minutes away before a desire arises to
see the photo. But when one opens the fridge, it is not just the photo
one sees -- the ice cream, the cake... You have destroyed my life. So my
wife has become slimmer, beautiful, and I have become ugly. And the
whole credit goes to you!"</p><p>This society, this world is based on insane superstitions.</p><p>My commune was a revolt. It survived five years -- it was a miracle,
because the whole fascist and imperialist government of America tried
everything to destroy it. Legally they could not do it because we had
four hundred legal experts in the commune -- the commune had the biggest
legal firm in the whole world. Four hundred sannyasins, a few of them
very well-known legal experts; others, new graduates from the
universities --</p><p>four hundred legal experts continuously fighting the American
government on every legal point. Finally the government decided that
legally it was impossible to destroy us, and then they started doing
illegal things.</p><p>And when a world power -- the world's greatest power -- starts being
criminal and illegal, what can four hundred people do?</p><p>We were ready to fight legally, rationally, logically, in every
possible way. But illegally it was impossible to fight.</p><p>I was arrested illegally, without any arrest warrant -- because they
could not find a reason to arrest me, so how to issue an arrest
warrant?</p><p>In the middle of the night at the point of twelve loaded guns, I was
arrested. And I asked them, "Where is the arrest warrant?"</p><p>They said, "There is no arrest warrant."</p><p>I said, "You can at least tell me verbally what the reason is, why I
am being arrested."</p><p>They said, "We don't know."</p><p>I asked them, "Then give me the opportunity to inform my attorney."
And they refused.</p><p>That is every citizen's right everywhere in the world -- to inform
his attorney if the government is doing such an illegal act. But they
were worried that if the attorney comes, the first thing he is going to
ask is, "Where is the arrest warrant?"</p><p>They destroyed the commune in such a way that the world would think
nothing</p><p>criminal had been done, but everything criminal.…</p><p>In court they produced one hundred and thirty-six crimes against
me.</p><p>I was silent for three and a half years, never going out of my room.
And if a man remaining silent -- not meeting anybody, not talking to
anybody, not going out of his room -- can manage to commit one hundred
and thirty-six crimes, then I thought there must be miracles, I must be
doing miracles! And they had no proof of anything.</p><p>They asked for negotiations. The government attorney made it clear to
my attorneys that the government could not accept defeat. They
themselves had foolishly called the case</p><p>"The United States of America versus Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh," they
themselves had called the case that; there was no need to give it such a
name. Now they were in trouble: if I had won the case that would mean
the United States of America would have been defeated in their own
courts under their own law, by their own constitution.</p><p>So they said, "We cannot -- the government cannot accept defeat. And
you know and we know that we don't have any proof. So the best way will
be not to go to trial. We are ready for negotiations. And the
negotiating agreement is that Bhagwan should accept any two charges,
should admit that he has committed two crimes -- just to show the world
that we have not done anything wrong by arresting him -- and pay a
nominal fine. Then on the surface everything looks legal."</p><p>But my attorney said, "It will be very difficult to convince him to
accept."</p><p>They said, "We should make you aware of the fact that if he does not
accept -- and if the case goes to trial -- then the trial can be
prolonged for ten years, twenty years. It is a case against the
government, and you should be aware that government is not ready to lose
the case. So we will go on postponing it, and bail will be cancelled and
Bhagwan will have to remain in jail. His whole movement will be
destroyed, and all his sannyasins all over the world will be in immense
torture."</p><p>And he suggested -- whispered into my chief attorney's ear: "You
should be aware that he can be killed too. If we see that the case is
going to be lost, he can be killed too."</p><p>My attorneys came to me crying -- and they were the topmost attorneys
of America. I asked them, "Why you are crying? What is the matter? --
because there is nothing in those hundred thirty-six charges. We are
going to win."</p><p>They said, "We are going to win, but your life is at risk and we
don't want your life to be at risk."</p><p>And they were right.</p><p>Because they had already planted a bomb under my seat, so if
something went wrong then they could finish me on that very day. It was
just a coincidence that I reached the jail earlier than they expected --
and the bomb was a time bomb, so it did not explode.</p><p>After I left America, the attorney general told the press, "Our first
priority was to destroy the commune."</p><p>Why? -- because the commune had done no harm to America in any way.
But deep down it has hurt America's ego, its pride -- because we have
shown them that a dream can be realized, that five thousand people can
live without any law enforcement authority, without any court, without
any fight, without any drugs, without any murder, without any suicide,
nobody going mad. And people were living so joyously and so beautifully
that the whole of America was starting to feel jealous.</p><p>The very existence of the commune was dangerous to the American
politicians because it showed that they don't have any intelligence;
otherwise they could have done what we had done very easily -- they had
all the power, all the money.</p><p>This small commune of five thousand people had everything that man
needs, and all the freedom, all the love. And everybody was working
seven days a week, twelve to fourteen hours a day, and still were not
tired -- because it was not something forced, it was something they
wanted to do, they wanted to create. It was such a creative act that
after working fourteen hours they were still dancing in the streets;
late in the night they were playing on their guitars, singing,
dancing.</p><p>The commune was destined to be destroyed. It was too good not to be
destroyed. It was the alternative society.</p><p>Mahavira and Buddha did not create any alternative society. They were
part of this society, they remained dependent on this society.</p><p>Their revolution was intellectual, verbal. My revolt was actual and
existential.</p><p>And the destruction of the commune in America does not mean that the
idea of the commune will disappear. There are still communes around the
world flourishing in many countries. More and more communes will be
coming up.</p><p>America is going to repent; it has missed an opportunity. It could
have supported the commune and made it clear to the world that it stands
for freedom, that it stands for a new man, that it stands for a future
humanity.</p><p>It missed a great opportunity.</p><p>By destroying the commune, it has destroyed its own credibility, its
own democracy. It has proved itself simply nothing but a hypocritical
society.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE MOST POWERFUL EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE IS THE LOVE THAT I</p><p>FEEL</p><p>FOR YOU. IT'S LIKE A SHOWER THAT CLEANSES MY SOUL AND FILLS MY</p><p>HEART WITH GRATITUDE.</p><p>BUT STILL I KEEP SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING ELSE, AS IF THERE IS A
SECRET YOU HAVEN'T SHARED WITH ME YET. IS THIS CRAZY LOVE AFFAIR</p><p>BETWEEN US REALLY AND TRULY ALL THAT IS NEEDED? WHY AM I NOT</p><p>SATISFIED WITH THIS EXPERIENCE?</p><p>Love can never be satisfied.</p><p>If it is satisfied, it is not much of a love. The greater and deeper
it is, the more dissatisfaction there will be. That is not against love;
it simply shows the vastness, that your heart wants to love in a way
which is infinite, that it will never be satisfied.</p><p>And it is good that it is not satisfied. The moment it is satisfied,
it is dead.</p><p>The love between the master and the disciple can never be satisfied.
It will always remain a thrill, a new excitement, a new ecstasy. It will
always go on opening doors upon doors -</p><p>- disciplehood will become devotion; one day devotion will become a
merger, just as the river merges in the ocean. But that too is not going
to satisfy.</p><p>Satisfaction is not a great quality. It belongs to the little minds,
to the little hearts which are satisfied with small things.</p><p>There are people who are satisfied with a little money, there are
people who are satisfied with a house, there are people who are
satisfied with a little name, a little fame -- these are pygmies.</p><p>Giants are never satisfied. On every new step they find the journey
is becoming</p><p>deeper, more miraculous, more mysterious -- and the longing is
growing and the heart is full of a sweet ache.</p><p>To be in a love affair with a master is to be in a love affair with
existence itself; the master is only an arrow pointing towards the
unknowable, the miraculous, the mysterious.</p><p>The master is not the end, the master is only the beginning.</p><p>The whole function of the master is to push you the same way a mother
bird pushes a small bird, a new bird who has never opened his wings into
the sky. Naturally he is afraid</p><p>-- a vast sky. He has lived in a small cozy nest, safe and secure,
the mother has been taking care -- and now she wants him to take a jump
and fly. And one day she pushes him. And the moment he is pushed out of
the nest -- for a moment it feels as if he is going to fall down on the
earth, but before he falls on the earth his wings open and the whole sky
is his.</p><p>And there are skies beyond skies.</p><p>The function of the master is nothing but to push you into a more
divine discontentment, into a discontentment that knows no
satisfaction.</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU ARE REALLY SOMETHING -- TALKING ABOUT "BEYOND</p><p>ENLIGHTENMENT" WHEN MOST OF US ARE NOT BEYOND PETTINESS, FUTILITY AND
POSTPONEMENT!</p><p>DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES OR SOMETHING? (PERHAPS LOVE?)</p><p>It is true, I am something!</p><p>I know you are not beyond pettiness, beyond jealousy, beyond greed,
beyond anger. But I don't talk about going beyond them for the simple
reason that if you start struggling with your pettiness, you will remain
petty; if you start struggling against your jealousy, you will remain
jealous.</p><p>An ancient proverb is: "Always choose the enemy very carefully."</p><p>A friend can be chosen without much care, but an enemy has to be
chosen very carefully because you will be fighting with him -- and in
fighting you will become just like the enemy because you will have to
use the same methods, the same means.</p><p>Enemies are very precious.</p><p>I don't want you to fight with small things. Rather than looking down
at the earth, and all around is your pettiness and jealousy and anger,
my effort is to show you the stars and help you to know that you have
wings. And once you start moving towards the stars, those small things
will disappear on their own accord.</p><p>It is better to look at a star and to strive to get to it because the
journey is beautiful, the heart is throbbing with excitement.</p><p>Rather than fighting with small things...</p><p>You will remain small, fighting with small things.</p><p>All your religions teach you to fight with small things, and that's
why the whole of humanity has remained small -- fight with small
things.</p><p>I insist: Don't fight with small things.</p><p>Fight for something great, and as you move towards the great the
small ones will disappear.</p><p>I am crazy, but you are crazier!</p><p>And that is the only bond between us -- I am crazy, you are crazier.
That is the only commitment. We will reach to the stars -- we will not
bother about small things. Leave them here for other people, they will
fight with them.</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS NEEDED TO NOT MISS YOU?</p><p>Prasad, only one thing is needed not to miss me, and that is: You
have to remember constantly that in every mind, in every person who
comes in search of truth, the ego plays a very cunning game.</p><p>I will tell you one story.</p><p>It is said that one of the great Zen masters Bokoju used to ask every
newcomer: "Have you realized that the path of disciplehood is very
difficult? Before you enter on the path, it is my duty to make you alert
to all the difficulties, arduousness, hostilities; it is an uphill task.
Are you ready, or you have come here just out of curiosity?"</p><p>The man said, "No, I have come here to find the truth, but if it is
too difficult to be a disciple then what about making me a master?"</p><p>It is a very strange story.</p><p>But that is the only thing that can prevent you coming closer to me
-- the desire in the ego somewhere to become a master. You have to
become something bigger, something greater.</p><p>The master is just a finger pointing to the moon. Don't be bothered
to become a master; while you can become the moon, why become the
finger?</p><p>You are asking what can keep you missing me. Only one thing: the
desire to be a master.</p><p>It is one of the mysteries of life that only those who don't have any
desire to be a master become masters, and those who have the desire even
fall from the status of being a disciple -- because the desire to be a
master is nothing but a subtle ego.</p><p>So just watch your mind.</p><p>From disciple become a devotee; from devotee take a quantum leap, a
merger with existence.</p><p>Never think for a moment of becoming a master. Leave it to existence:
if existence wants you to become a master -- that means if existence
wants to use you as a master, you will be used. If existence thinks you
have done enough and wants you to relax, disperse into eternity -- leave
it to existence. You should not be desirous of anything.</p><p>The moment you come to the state of desirelessness, then existence
uses you in whatever way is needed: as a mystic, as a master, as a
singer, as a dancer, as a flute player -- or just as nobody; but
everything is a benediction.</p><p>That which comes to you from existence without your desiring it is
always the greatest ecstasy there is.</p><p>Beyond Enlightenment Chapter #30</p><p>Chapter title: You are the watcher not the actor 2 November 1986 pm

-- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.</p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS ON ENLIGHTENMENT --
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.</p><p>ALL I KNOW IS THE MOMENT WHEN I SIT BEFORE YOU: YOU FEEL LIKE</p><p>BLOOD TO MY BODY; YOUR VOICE, MORE FAMILIAR THAN MY OWN
HEARTBEAT.</p><p>OSHO, HAVE I LET YOU DOWN?</p><p>Maneesha, there are things which are beyond understanding.</p><p>Enlightenment is beyond understanding, and of course beyond
enlightenment is going to be more miraculous, more mysterious.</p><p>Understanding itself is not the heart of human beings, it is not
their very being. It is useful only as far as the outside world is
concerned. The moment you start moving inwards, you have to learn new
ways of feeling, of loving, of knowing, and finally of being.</p><p>Understanding is perfectly right for the mind, for intelligence, for
the objective world; but life does not consist only of those things
which you can understand. In fact, the things that you can understand
don't make life a celebration, they don't give life a meaning, a
significance, they don't allow life to become love.</p><p>Understanding is the demarcation line between the mundane and the
sacred.</p><p>The mundane can be understood and should be understood. And the
sacred cannot be understood and should not be understood. Its sacredness
is basically a secret that you experience, just the way you feel the
heartbeat, the way you feel your breathing.</p><p>The sacred gives color to existence, gives music to that which is
mundane. It transforms all prose into poetry and makes everything a
mystery unto itself so that the whole existence becomes a constant
challenge to discover. You go on discovering, but the discovery is never
finished; hence you can never say you have understood. On the contrary,
the deeper you enter into the sacred dimension of life the more you feel
you don't understand, you don't know.</p><p>Socrates had become very old, and before he was given poison the
oracle of the temple of Delphi declared him to be the wisest man in the
whole world. A few people who knew Socrates were immensely glad, they
rushed to Athens to inform Socrates: "It has never happened before, it
is unprecedented that the oracle of Delphi should declare anybody as the
wisest man in the world. You are the first."</p><p>Socrates said, "You will have to go back to the temple of Delphi and
tell the oracle that although it has always been right, this time it has
missed -- because I know nothing."</p><p>The people who brought the news were shocked.</p><p>They went back and told to the oracle: "Socrates refuses. Not only
does he refuse to be the wisest man in the world, he says, Ì know
NOTHING.'"</p><p>And here is the beauty of the incident: The oracle said, "That's why
he is the wisest man in the world, there is no contradiction."</p><p>Maneesha, if you had understood what I was saying for twelve years
about enlightenment, you would have missed. If you had understood what I
have been saying for one month continuously about beyond enlightenment,
you would have missed.</p><p>Because you are aware that you have not been able to understand
anything, you have not missed.</p><p>And your feeling that sitting close to me you feel as if I have
become your</p><p>heartbeat, your breathing, your circulation of blood -- this is true
understanding. This is not knowledge; this is the same understanding as
when Socrates says, "I know nothing." This is closer to love, this is
closer to music, this is closer to feeling beauty.</p><p>You don't understand beauty, you don't understand music, you don't
understand dance --</p><p>you enjoy, you rejoice, you feel. It enters into your being. It
becomes part of you, but you cannot say it is knowledge.</p><p>Listening to the music of the winds as they pass through the pine
trees, what can you understand? Or listening to the sound of running
water, what can you understand? Or looking at a beautiful sunset and all
the colors spread over the horizon, what can you understand? What do you
understand?</p><p>But something happens which is far more precious than understanding.
You fall in love, you feel it, you become it.</p><p>This is how it should be -- aes dhammo sanantano. This is how
religion has always been, this is the eternal mystery I call `religion'
-- not the religion of the mind, but the religion of the heart, of the
being; not the religion of knowing, but the religion of innocence.</p><p>Whatever is happening to you is exactly what should happen to
everybody.</p><p>Those who go from here understanding things, knowing things, becoming
more knowledgeable, it would have been better that they had not come --
because I have not been a help to them, I have burdened them; I have not
been able to unburden them. And my whole effort is to take all weight of
knowing, knowledge, wisdom from you and to make you innocent children
again -- again collecting flowers in the garden, running after
butterflies, collecting seashells, making houses of sand on the beach...
utterly absorbed in whatsoever you are doing, utterly blissful -- so the
whole existence around you is a fairyland because everything is
mysterious.</p><p>If I can take away your knowledge and give you back the sense of
mystery, then I have done my job, I have fulfilled my function.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>READING A SCIENTIFIC REPORT ABOUT BRAIN MANIPULATION, QUESTIONS AROSE
IN ME.</p><p>FOR INSTANCE, IF EVERY FEELING -- LIKE HAPPINESS, SADNESS, SEXUALITY,
AGGRESSION, AND SO ON -- CAN BE STIMULATED BY</p><p>ELECTRODES, OR INDIRECTLY BY CHEMISTRY, CAN BE MANIPULATED</p><p>FROM THE OUTSIDE, THEN THESE FEELINGS ARE NOT MY OWN; THEY ARE</p><p>JUST PUPPETS IN SOMEONE'S HANDS. THEY ARE EITHER MANIPULATED</p><p>FROM THE OUTSIDE OR FROM THE INSIDE AS AUTOMATIC REACTIONS TO</p><p>SITUATIONS -- THEY ARE NOT ME. THIS IS ABOUT FEELINGS.</p><p>MAYBE SOME DAY THOUGHTS CAN BE MANIPULATED EQUALLY EASILY.</p><p>THEN WHAT IS REALLY MINE? THEN WHAT IS LEFT? THEN WHO AM I?</p><p>QUESTIONING AND THINKING IN THESE DIRECTIONS, I CAME TO</p><p>RECOGNIZE THAT I OFTEN THINK ABOUT MYSELF, ABOUT LIFE, ABOUT</p><p>TRUTH IN THESE WAYS. AND THEN THE QUESTION AROSE: IS THIS WAY OF</p><p>QUESTIONING AND THINKING THE WAY THE MIND TRIES TO KNOW</p><p>SOMETHING? IS IT ABLE TO REACH ANY TRUTH AT ALL? IF NOT, IS THIS</p><p>THINKING OR QUESTIONING JUST A FUTILE EFFORT, JUST A WASTE OF</p><p>TIME? OR IS IT NOT THE MIND, NOT THE INTELLECT, BUT A DEEPER</p><p>INTELLIGENCE, A DEEPER INSTRUMENT THAT IS ABLE TO COME TO SOME</p><p>TRUTH?</p><p>WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>It is absolutely true: your emotions, your sentiments, your thoughts
-- the whole paraphernalia of the mind -- is from the outside, is
manipulated by the outside.</p><p>Scientifically it has become more clear. But even without scientific
investigation, the mystics, for thousands of years, have been saying
exactly the same thing -- that all these things that your mind is filled
with are not yours, you are beyond them. You get identified with them,
and that's the only sin.</p><p>For example, somebody insults you and you become angry. You think you
are becoming angry -- but seen scientifically, his insult is only a
remote controller. The man who has insulted you is managing your
behavior. Your anger is in his hands, you are behaving like a
puppet.</p><p>Now scientists are able to put electrodes in the brain at certain
centers -- there are seven hundred centers. And it is almost
unbelievable: the mystics have been talking about these seven hundred
centers in the brain for almost seven, eight thousand years. Science has
just now discovered that there are exactly seven hundred centers
controlling all your behavior.</p><p>An electrode can be put at a particular center -- for example, anger
-- with a remote control so you cannot see that anybody is doing
anything to you. Nobody insults you, nobody humiliates you, nobody says
anything to you; you are sitting silently, happily, and somebody pushes
the button of the remote control and you become angry. It is a very
strange feeling because you cannot see the reason anywhere, why you are
becoming angry. Perhaps you will rationalize somehow:</p><p>you see a man passing down the street and you remember that he
insulted you -- you will find some rationalization just to console
yourself that you are not going mad. Sitting silently... and suddenly
feeling so angry without any provocation?</p><p>And the same remote controller can work to make you happy: sitting in
your chair you start giggling, and you look all around in case somebody
sees you -- he will think you are going crazy! Nobody has said anything,
nothing has happened, nobody has slipped on a banana peel, so why are
you giggling? But you will rationalize it, you will give some apparently
rational grounds for giggling.</p><p>And the strangest thing is that when the next time the same button is
pushed and you giggle, you will again have the same rationale, the same
consolation, the same explanation -- that too is not yours. It is almost
like a gramophone record.</p><p>And the scientists have come to discover a tremendously meaningful
thing: the moment the remote controller releases the center, it rewinds
itself immediately. For example, your speech center: the remote control
can force you to speak. There is no audience, you will feel awkward --
but you cannot do anything, you have to speak. It is just like a
recording.</p><p>When the remote controller releases the button, the pressure on the
electrode, you become silent. Press the button again... and the strange
thing is, you start your speech again from the very beginning!</p><p>When I was reading about the scientific investigations into these
centers, I was reminded of my student days. I was a competitor in an
inter-university debate; all the universities of the country were
participating. The Sanskrit University of Varanasi was also
participating, but naturally the students from the Sanskrit University
were feeling a little inferior compared with competitors from other
universities. They knew ancient scriptures, they knew Sanskrit poetry,
drama, but they were not familiar with the contemporary world of art,
literature, philosophy or logic.</p><p>And the inferiority complex works in very strange ways.</p><p>Just after I had spoken, the next person was the representative from
the Sanskrit University. And just to impress the audience and to hide
his inferiority complex he started his speech with a quotation from
Bertrand Russell -- he had crammed it, and Sanskrit students are more
capable of cramming things than anybody else. But his stage fright.…</p><p>He knew nothing about Bertrand Russell, he knew nothing about what he
was quoting. It would have been better to have quoted something from
Sanskrit because he would have been more at ease.</p><p>In the middle he stopped -- just in the middle of a sentence. And I
was sitting by his side, because I had just finished. There was silence,
and he was perspiring. And just to help him, I said, "Start again" --
because what else to do? he was simply stuck. "And if you cannot go
ahead, you start again; perhaps it may come back to you."</p><p>So he started again: "Brothers and sisters..." and at exactly the
same point he got stuck again. Now it became a joke. The whole hall was
shouting, "Again!" and he was in such a difficult situation. Neither
could he go ahead nor could he keep standing there silent -- it looked
very idiotic. So he had to start again. But he would start again,
"Brothers and sisters..."</p><p>For a whole fifteen minutes we heard only that portion: "Brothers and
sisters..." up to the point where he got stuck, again and again.</p><p>When his time was finished he came and sat next to me. He said, "You
destroyed my whole thing!"</p><p>I said, "I was trying to help you." He said, "This is help?"</p><p>I said, "You were going to be in difficulty anyway. This way at least
everybody enjoyed it except you -- that I can understand, but you should
rejoice that you made so many people happy. And why did you choose that
quotation? When I was saying to you, `Start again' there was no need to
start over -- you could have dropped that quotation, there was no need
to begin again from the very beginning."</p><p>But I came to know through reading the scientific research that the
speech center is exactly like a gramophone record, but with one thing
very strange and special: the moment the needle is taken away from the
record you cannot put the needle back where you took it from. Once it is
taken away, it will have to begin again exactly at the beginning. The
center instantly goes back to the beginning.</p><p>And if this happens, can you say you are the master of what you are
saying? Are</p><p>you the master of what you are feeling? Certainly there are no
electrodes scientifically put into you, but biologically exactly the
same work is going on.</p><p>You see a certain woman, and immediately your mind reacts: "How
beautiful!" This is nothing but remote control. That woman functioned
like a remote control and your speech center simply went into a recorded
speech: "How beautiful!"</p><p>Mind is a mechanism. It is not you.</p><p>It records things from outside, and then reacts to outside situations
according to the recordings. That's the only difference between a Hindu
and a Mohammedan and a Christian and a Jew -- they have just got
different gramophone records. Inside it is one humanity. And do you
think when you play a gramophone record... it may be in Hebrew, it may
be in Sanskrit, it may be in Persian, it may be in Arabic, but it is the
same machine that plays the record. To the machine it does not matter
whether it plays Hebrew or Sanskrit.</p><p>All your religions, all your political ideas, all your cultural
attitudes are nothing but recordings. And in certain situations certain
recordings are provoked.</p><p>There is a beautiful incident in the life of one of the very wisest
kings of India, Raja Dhoj. He was very much interested in wise people.
His whole treasury was open only for one purpose -- to collect all the
wise people of the country, whatsoever the cost. His capital was Ujjain,
and he had thirty of the country's most famous people in his court. It
was the most precious court in the whole country.</p><p>One of the greatest poets of the world, Kalidas, was one of the
members of the court of Raja Dhoj.</p><p>One day a man appeared at the court saying that he spoke thirty
languages with the same fluency, the same accuracy and accent as any
native person could, and he had come to make a challenge: "Hearing that
you have in your court the wisest people of the country, here are one
thousand gold pieces..."</p><p>The rupee used to be golden. We should stop calling it the rupee now,
because the word</p><p>`rupee' comes from the word rupya. `Rupya' means gold. It went on
falling from gold to silver, from silver to something else. Now it is
just paper and you go on</p><p>calling it `rupee'.</p><p>The very word means gold.</p><p>And he said, "Anybody who can recognize my mother tongue, these one
thousand gold pieces are his. And if he cannot recognize it, then he
will have to give me one thousand gold pieces."</p><p>There were great scholars there, and everybody knows that whatever
you do, you can never speak any language the way you can speak your own
mother tongue because every other language has to be learned by effort.
Only the mother tongue is spontaneous -- you don't even learn it,
just... the very situation and you start speaking it. It has a
spontaneity.</p><p>That's why even Germans who call their country `fatherland'.… That is
the only country which calls itself `fatherland'. All other countries
call their land</p><p>`motherland'. But even the Germans don't call their languagèfather
tongue'. Every language is called a mother tongue because the child
starts learning from the mother, and anyway the father never has the
chance to speak in the house. It is always the mother who is speaking --
father is listening.</p><p>Many took the challenge. He spoke in thirty languages -- a few pieces
in one language, a few pieces in another language -- and it was really
hard; he was certainly a master artist.</p><p>He was speaking each language the way only a native can speak his own
mother language. All of the thirty great scholars lost. The competition
continued for thirty days, and every day one person took the challenge
and lost it. The man would say, "This is not my mother tongue."</p><p>On the thirty-first day.… King Dhoj had been continually saying to
Kalidas, "Why don't you accept the challenge? -- because a poet knows
language in a more delicate way, with all its nuances, more than anybody
else."</p><p>But Kalidas remained silent. He had been watching for thirty days,
trying to find out which language the man spoke with more ease, with
more spontaneity, with more joy.</p><p>But he could not manage to find any difference, he spoke all the
languages in exactly the same way.</p><p>On the thirty-first day, Kalidas asked King Dhoj and all the wise
people to stand outside in front of the court. There was a long row of
steps and the man was coming up; as he came up to the last step, Kalidas
pushed him down. And as he fell rolling down the steps, anger came up --
he shouted.</p><p>And Kalidas said, "This is your mother tongue!" Because in anger you
cannot remember, and the man had not been expecting this to be a
challenge.</p><p>And that actually was his mother tongue.</p><p>Deepest in his mind, the recording was of the mother tongue.</p><p>One of my professors used to say -- he lived all over the world,
teaching in different universities -- that "Only in two situations in
life have I been in difficulty in different countries -- fighting or
falling in love. In those times one remembers one's mother tongue.
However beautifully you express your love, it is not the same, it seems
superficial. And when you are angry and fighting in somebody else's
language, you cannot have that joy "</p><p>He said, "Those are two very significant situations -- fighting and
loving -- and mostly they are together with the same person. With the
same person you are in love, with that same person you have to
fight."</p><p>And he was right, that everything remains superficial -- you can
neither sing a beautiful song nor can you use real four-letter words of
your language. In both cases, it remains lukewarm.</p><p>Mind certainly is a mechanism for recording experiences from the
outside, and reacting and responding accordingly. It is not you.</p><p>But unfortunately the psychologists think mind is all, beyond mind
there is nothing. That means you are nothing but impressions from the
outside. You don't have any soul of your own. The very idea of the soul
is also given by the outside.</p><p>This is where the mystics are different: they will agree absolutely
that about the mind, the contemporary scientific research is right. But
it is not right about man's total personality.</p><p>Beyond mind, there is an awareness which is not given by the outside
and which is not an idea -- and there is no experiment up to now which
has found any</p><p>center in the brain which corresponds to awareness.</p><p>The whole work of religion, of meditation is to make you aware of all
that is mind and disidentify yourself with it. When the mind is angry,
you should think, "It is simply a gramophone record." When the mind is
sad, you should simply remember: it is only a gramophone record.</p><p>A certain situation is pressing the remote controller, and you feel
sad, you feel angry, you feel frustrated, you feel worried, you feel
tense -- all these things are coming from the outside, and the mind is
responding to them.</p><p>But you are the watcher.</p><p>You are not the actor. It is not your reaction.</p><p>Hence the whole art of meditation is to learn awareness, alertness,
consciousness.</p><p>While you are feeling angry, don't repress it; let it be there. Just
become aware. See it as if it is some object outside you.</p><p>Slowly slowly, go on cutting your identifications with the mind. Then
you have found your real individuality, your being, your soul.</p><p>Finding this awareness is enlightenment -- you have become
luminous.</p><p>You are no more in darkness, and you are no more just a puppet in the
hands of the mind.</p><p>You are a master, not a servant. Now the mind cannot react
automatically, autonomously</p><p>-- the way it used to do before. It needs your permission. Somebody
insults you, and you don't want to be angry.…</p><p>Gautam Buddha used to say to his disciples that, "To be angry is so
stupid that it is inconceivable that intelligent human beings go on
doing it. Somebody else is doing something and you are getting angry. He
may be doing something wrong, he may be saying something wrong, he may
be making some effort to humiliate</p><p>you, to insult you --</p><p>but that is his freedom. If you react, you are a slave."</p><p>And if you say to the person, "It is your joy to insult me, it is my
joy not to be angry,"</p><p>you are behaving like a master.</p><p>And unless this master becomes crystal clear in you, crystallized,
you don't have any soul. You are just a phonograph record.</p><p>As you grow older, your recording goes on becoming more and more. You
become more knowledgeable. People think you are becoming wiser -- you
are simply becoming a donkey loaded with scriptures.</p><p>Wisdom consists only of one thing, not of knowing many things but of
knowing only one thing: that is your awareness and its separation from
the mind.</p><p>Just try watching in small things, and you will be surprised. People
go on doing the same things every day. They go on deciding to do
something, and they go on repenting because they have not done it; it
becomes a routine.</p><p>Everything you do is not new. The things which have been giving you
misery, sadness, worries, wounds, and you don't want -- somehow
mechanically you go on doing these things again and again as if you are
helpless. And you will remain helpless unless you create a separation
between mind and awareness.</p><p>That very separation is the greatest revolution that can happen to
man. And from that very moment your life is a life of continuous
celebration -- because you need not do anything that harms you, you need
not do anything that makes you miserable. Now you can do and act on only
that which makes you more joyous, fulfills you, gives you contentment,
makes your life a piece of art, a beauty.</p><p>But this is possible only if the master in you is awake. Right now
the master is fast asleep, and the servant is playing the role of
master.</p><p>And the servant is not your servant; the servant is created by the
outside world, it belongs to the outside world, it follows the outside
world and its laws.</p><p>This is the whole tragedy of human life: you are asleep, and the
outside world is dominating you, creating your mind according to its own
needs -- and the mind is a puppet.</p><p>Once your awareness becomes a flame, it burns up the whole slavery
that the mind has created.</p><p>And there is no blissfulness more precious than freedom, than being a
master of your own destiny.</p><p>Mind is not your friend. Either the mind is pretending to be the
master or it has to be put into its right place as a servant -- but mind
is not your friend.</p><p>And the struggle for freedom, for bliss, for truth is not with the
world; it is a fight with this puppet mind. It is very simple.</p><p>Kahlil Gibran has a beautiful story.</p><p>The farmers in the villages, to protect their cultivated farms,
create a false man: just a stick, another stick... it looks almost like
a cross. And then they put a kurta on it, and a mud pot in place of the
head. That's enough to make poor animals afraid that somebody may be
standing there. The white kurta and two hands, in the night... somebody
is watching. For the animals it is enough, they keep away from the
farm.</p><p>Gibran says, "Once I asked such a false man, Ì can understand the
farmer who made you, he needs you. I can understand the poor animals,
they don't have great intelligence to see that you are bogus. But in
rain, in sun, in hot summer, in cold winter you remain standing here --
for what?'</p><p>"And the false, bogus man said, `You don't know my joy. Just to make
those animals afraid is such a joy that it is worth suffering rain,
suffering sun, suffering heat, winter --</p><p>everything. I am making thousands of animals afraid! I know I am
bogus, there is nothing inside me -- but I don't care about that. My joy
is in making others afraid.'"</p><p>I want to ask you: would you like to be just like this bogus man --
nothing inside, making somebody afraid, making somebody happy, making
somebody</p><p>humiliated, making somebody respectful? Is your life only for
others?</p><p>Will you ever look inside?</p><p>Is there anybody in the house or not?</p><p>The people who are with me, their search is to find the master of the
house.</p><p>I say to you the master is there -- perhaps asleep, but he can be
awakened. And once the master is awakened within you, your whole life
takes new colors, new rainbows, new flowers, new music, new dances.</p><p>For the first time you become alive. Before, you were only
vegetating. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I LOVE BEING HERE. I WANTED AND FELT TO BE WITH YOU EVEN IF IT</p><p>WERE JUST FOR TWO DAYS.</p><p>AT YOUR BIRTHDAY IN 1981 WE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE REASON</p><p>WAS THAT I HAD JUST READ A BOOK ABOUT GURDJIEFF AND THE</p><p>PHENOMENON OF baraka. THIS GAVE ME SUCH A HIT THAT I MADE IT TO</p><p>COME TO THE RANCH.</p><p>THESE DAYS I AM WORKING WITH MANAGERS AND TEACHING THEM</p><p>MEDITATION TECHNIQUES. I'M ALSO PREPARING A WORLDWIDE MEDITATION
PROJECT. AGAIN I FEEL I NEED `BARAKA'!</p><p>PLEASE CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BARAKA?</p><p>Baraka is a Sufi word meaning grace.</p><p>George Gurdjieff was trained in Sufi schools. He has carried many
ideas of the Sufis into the West.</p><p>The Sufi master -- just like any other master in the world -- is full
of grace. If you are receptive, if you are open, just coming close to
the master something invisible, some vibe of the divine, some rays of
the unknowable start penetrating you.</p><p>It also has the meaning of blessing.</p><p>People come to the masters and ask for blessing.</p><p>In English there is no exact word to translatèbaraka', but in
Sanskrit, in Hindi, we have the word prasad. Blessings carry a faraway
echo of it. If you are receptive... And unless one is receptive one
never goes to a master.</p><p>That has been the Eastern tradition. Why waste your time and why
waste the master's time? You go only when you see that your heart is
opening, it needs a ray of light, as if your being is just like thirsty
earth which needs a raincloud to shower on you. Only in such moments
people go to a master, they touch the feet of the master, they sit with
the master.</p><p>Nothing is said and everything is heard; nothing is asked and
everything is given.</p><p>Baraka is a mystical principle that happens between the receiving
disciple and the overflowing master.</p><p>It is possible to pass a master without even noticing him -- if you
are not open.</p><p>Sufis are very careful. It is not easy to find a Sufi master; he may
take months or sometimes years to find -- and perhaps the master is just
living in front of your house.</p><p>The Sufis wait for the right moment.</p><p>They have their disciples who come to know that a certain man is
asking if this village has a Sufi master. And the disciples go on
telling him, "Yes, the Sufi master is here, and you will be called only
when you are ready -- because the real thing is your openness.</p><p>The master is ready, but what will you be doing? Even if we take you
to the master, you will not be able to recognize him."</p><p>So the disciples will keep the person hanging around, giving him
hope, giving him time --</p><p>"Next month we will try" -- making him more and more thirsty. And
when they see that he has become a longing, that now it is no longer an
ordinary inquiry, it is not just a curiosity to see a Sufi master, but a
deep longing, a question of life and death; that if this man does not
get in contact with a master he may die, only then will he be introduced
into the company of the master. And he will be surprised: the master is
a man he has passed in the village many times, he sells vegetables --
because Sufis keep themselves hiding in very ordinary life. Somebody is
a shoemaker, somebody is a weaver, somebody sells vegetables -- ordinary
things, nothing special about it. And they meet in the middle of the
night.</p><p>Then the same man sits with the dignity of an emperor. It is called
`the court of the master'. The same man who was selling vegetables the
whole day long in the marketplace</p><p>-- now even the emperor comes to touch his feet.</p><p>But nobody can come to the Sufi master unless somebody from his
company introduces him, unless somebody takes the responsibility that
the person is ready, somebody brings him, introduces him: "He is ready.
He needs your grace."</p><p>When Gurdjieff entered into a Sufi circle for the first time -- it
took him three years to enter the circle.… When he entered, almost a
dozen people were sitting there silently with their eyes closed. He was
brought close to the master.</p><p>The friend who brought him told him, "Just sit down. Nothing is
needed on your part except a silent opening, and the rain will come. And
then don't close yourself. Drink of the master as much as you can --
this is his blessing; this will</p><p>keep you on the path, on the right track. It will keep you courageous
enough to pass all the dark nights, it will keep you trusting that the
morning is going to happen. The face of the master, the eyes of the
master, the gestures of the master, the silence of the master --
everything has to be soaked up so it becomes part of you."</p><p>When the master is no longer outside you only, but inside you too --
that is real blessing.</p><p>Then the disciple is pregnant, the master has come into his womb, and
it will help him in times of danger, in times of discouragement, in
times of darkness.</p><p>It will always keep him together, remembering that if truth can
happen to one man, if God can happen to one man, then it is everybody's

path a little late. But the dawn is not far away."</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>RAJNEESHPURAM WAS A RARE EXPERIMENT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN</p><p>CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEKERS OF TRUTH FROM</p><p>THE WHOLE WORLD GATHERED AROUND A MASTER. IT WAS AN</p><p>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNE FOR THE MOST INTENSE AND THE FASTEST</p><p>GROWTH OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS.</p><p>THE RAJNEESHPURAM COMMUNE COULD NOT SURVIVE BECAUSE OF</p><p>ORTHODOX RELIGIONS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.</p><p>IS THERE ANY HOPE OF SUCH A RARE EXPERIMENT HAPPENING AGAIN</p><p>AROUND YOU? OR IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXPERIMENT POSSIBLE</p><p>ON AN INDIVIDUAL SCALE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION? OR IS IT
DESTINED</p><p>THAT SUCH A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS TO</p><p>FLOWER TO ITS OPTIMUM SHOULD BE MISSED? PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>The commune in America was only a beginning; a beginning of many
communes around the world.</p><p>They will go on spreading -- because it is not only a question of
orthodox religions and dirty politics, it is also a question of the
future of humanity. And the future is always more important than the
past.</p><p>The past is heavy and long. The future is light, unknown. But the
past is dead, and life belongs to the future -- and death cannot win
over life.</p><p>One commune can be destroyed. Thousands of other communes will
arise.</p><p>Of course my way of functioning will be different because the
experiment in Rajneeshpuram needed me to be there, it was the first
commune.… Every step had to be taken carefully. And within five years,
so much was done that is not possible to do even in fifty years. But now
the basic rules are clear.</p><p>And my being in any commune is going to be dangerous for the
commune.</p><p>It was absolutely necessary for the first commune that I should be
present. I took the risk, and the commune has succeeded. Now there are
communes all around the world. More communes will be arising. I am just
waiting for the right moment to trigger a new kind of process.</p><p>I will not be part of any commune because my presence will be
dangerous for the commune. So now I will be just wandering from one
commune to another. Before my presence becomes dangerous in one commune,
I will move to another</p><p>-- so the commune is saved, and whatever I can give and my presence
can give, can be given on a much bigger scale around the globe.</p><p>There is no need for people to come to me. I can move from commune to
commune. This way, many more communes can flourish.</p><p>I am just waiting for the right moment. Preparations are being made,
and soon I will start working on a series of communes -- because the
movement has to become worldwide, it is already worldwide.</p><p>The commune is the lifestyle of the future.</p><p>The family is gone and the commune is going to take its place. Much
depends on the success of commune life, and we have to make the commune
life such a celebration that it starts spreading like wildfire, that
others start communes of their own.</p><p>Each village can become a commune, there is no need to establish
different villages. We just have to prove that life in a commune is much
richer, much more lovely, much more meditative, that there is a
possibility of living in a different way, different from the way
humanity has lived up to now.</p><p>We have proved it in Rajneeshpuram.</p><p>It was our success that forced America to destroy the commune. If we
were not successful, nobody would have bothered about us. Remember this:
it was not a failure that we were destroyed; it was our success which
could not be tolerated.</p><p>And if we have been successful in one place We are successful in
Germany, in</p><p>Italy, in Holland, in Japan, in Australia, in different other
countries. Because I am not there, the politicians are not worried, the
theologians are not afraid.</p><p>So I want the communes to become more consolidated before I start my
world tours, because now it will not be A world tour, it will be just
the beginning of world tours. I will be continuously rotating like a
satellite around the earth, creating as much trouble as possible. Only
then these traditional vested interests can be destroyed.</p><p>But if the truth is with us, the victory is also with us. Question
5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DO THOSE CELLS NEEDED FOR A LIVELY AND GROWING INTELLIGENCE</p><p>HAVE ONLY ÀLIMITED' LIFE SPAN, SO THAT THERE IS A POINT BEYOND</p><p>WHICH ONE EITHER BECOMES SENILE OR SIMPLY STAGNATES?</p><p>OR, GIVEN THE NECESSARY STIMULUS, IS IT POSSIBLE FOR INTELLIGENCE</p><p>TO CONTINUE TO GROW RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF ONE'S DEATH?</p><p>The ordinary human being stops his growth of intelligence at the age
fourteen because the biological purpose is complete.</p><p>At the age of fourteen, the person is mature enough to give birth, to
reproduce. Biology is no longer interested beyond this point.</p><p>This is the reason why the average human being is stuck at the age of
fourteen as far as his mental age is concerned. People go on growing
physically up to seventy, eighty, ninety, a hundred years -- in some
places like Caucasia, up to one hundred and fifty, even one hundred and
eighty. But their mental age remains stuck at fourteen. This has been
the routine up to now.</p><p>This can be changed. And this should be changed because there is
infinite potential for growth, but the change will come only if you have
some goals beyond biology. If your life remains concerned only with sex,
children, family, food, house, then there is no need; that much
intelligence is enough. But if your interest is that of an Albert
Einstein then your intelligence starts moving sometimes even ahead of
your physical body.</p><p>Emerson is reported to have said -- and rightly so -- when asked how
old he was:</p><p>"Three hundred and sixty years."</p><p>The journalist who was asking said, "Three hundred and sixty? You
don't look more than sixty."</p><p>Emerson said, "That's right. From one point of view, I am sixty years
old. But I have done so much work as far as my intelligence is concerned
that either six people would be needed to do it or I would need three
hundred and sixty years. My intelligence is so far ahead of my physical
body."</p><p>Intelligence depends what you are doing with it.</p><p>The person who is meditating has the greatest possibility of reaching
the highest peaks of intelligence because in meditation he is doing the
greatest possible work that a man is capable of -- and that is realizing
oneself, knowing "Who am I." Entering into the deepest interiority of
one's subjectivity is the greatest work for intelligence. Then you
cannot even count -- you cannot count Gautam Buddha's intelligence, it
is beyond calculations, beyond measurements.</p><p>And if you are a meditator, as your meditation goes on becoming more
and more luminous, your intelligence will be growing to the last breath
of your life. Not only that, even after the last breath your
intelligence will continue to grow -- because you are not going to die,
only your body will be dying. And the body has nothing to do with
intelligence, mind has nothing to do with intelligence.</p><p>Intelligence is the quality of your awareness -- more aware, more
intelligent. And if you are totally aware, you are as intelligent as
this whole existence is. Beyond Enlightenment</p><p>Chapter #31</p><p>Chapter title: Discarding the container, discovering the content 3
November 1986 pm in</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>8611035</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>ENLIGH31</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>130</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM AFRAID TO JUMP FROM A THREE-METER TOWER INTO A SWIMMING</p><p>POOL.</p><p>WILL I STILL BE ABLE TO JUMP INTO ENLIGHTENMENT?</p><p>The first basic thing to understand is that you are not expected to
jump into enlightenment. You have to climb for it -- it is higher than
you, not lower than you.</p><p>So at least one fear you can drop!</p><p>And climbing to enlightenment is a simple process. It is not
something tortuous, arduous.</p><p>It is something like peeling an onion; after one layer there is
another layer --</p><p>fresher, younger, juicier, after that layer there are still more,
juicier layers. And if you go on peeling, finally nothing is left in
your hands -- because the onion was nothing but layers upon layers.</p><p>Enlightenment is a kind of peeling of the ego.</p><p>It is parallel to the onion because it has no inner substance, only
layers. And those layers sometimes slip by themselves -- they become old
sometimes by accident. If you watch your life, you can see it happening.
It is not a theorization.</p><p>Sometimes you can see that you are not wearing the right mask for the
right occasion.</p><p>When you are expected to smile, you are not smiling; when you are
expected to weep, you are not weeping.</p><p>I used to live with a distant uncle's family. His wife died. In fact
it is very difficult to find a husband who never thinks that if his wife
died it would be good, a good riddance. And my uncle's wife was
certainly a nightmare. In fact everybody was happy that she died, and
everybody knew that the husband was happy that she had died, but still
the convention, the tradition.…</p><p>I used to sit in the garden. He told me, "I cannot remain in a
miserable posture the whole day long because really I am not miserable.
You know it. I cannot hide it from you --</p><p>twenty-four hours a day you are in the house -- but when relatives
come, I have to show that I am very miserable." Not to be caught being
happy and at ease, he told me, "You mostly sit in the garden reading, so
you can just give me a signal from there that somebody is coming." So I
had to give him signals.</p><p>And the miracle was that the moment I would give him the signal,
immediately he would become miserable. Sometimes I would play a joke: I
would give the signal and nobody would turn up. And he would be very
angry: "This you should not do, because this is a dangerous joke.
Sometimes I may think you are joking and somebody may turn up. You have
to understand that I should not be caught enjoying myself. In fact I
have never enjoyed myself -- because of this woman! She was such a pain
in the neck. And even today, although she is dead, she is torturing me
through these relatives -- relatives I have not seen for years,
relatives I don't even recognize as relatives. They come and I have to
be</p><p>miserable -- whether the relative is real or false, I have to bring
tears to my eyes.</p><p>"I am surprised myself that I am capable of it -- being miserable,
tears flowing. And I pray to you that when I am acting this way, please
don't stand so close. You just be out in the garden; you don't have to
be present to watch the whole scene, because then it becomes more
difficult for me to do the performance."</p><p>One day a man came. He was known to me, he was a bookseller. And I
told him, "Can you pretend just for two minutes to be a far-off relative
of a dead wife?"</p><p>He said, "What?"</p><p>I said, "I will explain it to you later on when I come to your shop.
But remember, it has to be done in a certain way: First, I will
introduce you as the best shopkeeper in town, who is not only a
shopkeeper but who loves books and has a collection of rare books. Ìt is
not just a business for him, it is his love affair.' I will introduce
you first in this way. And then in the middle I will tell him, `He's
also a relative of your dead wife.' I just want to see how he changes
his mask."</p><p>I introduced the man. My uncle was perfectly happy. He said, "Very
good, I will come some time. I don't have much time to read, but if you
can suggest some rare books I will try to find the time."</p><p>And then I said, "But I forgot one thing. He has not come here to
sell books; he is a relative of your dead wife." And immediately my
uncle started crying, tears came to his eyes and he was so
miserable.…</p><p>The bookseller was also amazed at how quickly he changed. He had just
been laughing and there had been no question of misery or anything.</p><p>And then I said, "Just don't harass yourself. He is not related to
your wife, it is just a misunderstanding."</p><p>He said, "What kind of misunderstanding?"</p><p>I said, "Another woman in the neighborhood has also died; he is
related to that woman."</p><p>And immediately all the tears were gone and he started laughing. He
said, "This is a great joke! Why didn't you tell me?"</p><p>The bookseller said, "I am very new to this locality, I have never
been here, and he misled me. He told me that my relative used to live
here, and she has died. I came because of my relative who has died --
but I am not acquainted with this locality and I have never seen the
husband of my relative, so just forgive me. But it has been a great
experience! You could have been a great actor -- within minutes, from
laughter to misery, from misery back to laughter."</p><p>I said, "This is nothing. If I tell him the reality, he will be back
again to tears and misery."</p><p>He said, "What reality?"</p><p>I said, "No other woman has died. He is a relative of your wife."</p><p>He said, "Listen, I have told you this is a serious affair." And
again misery and tears.</p><p>And that man felt so sad for this miserable creature... he told me,
"Don't torture him this way."</p><p>I said, "I am not torturing him. He is torturing himself! What is the
need? The wife is dead, she cannot come back. He need not be afraid of
her, at least not now. While she was alive, it was difficult to say. I
knew his wife, and he was perfectly right to be afraid of her. But now
he need not be afraid, she cannot come."</p><p>I said to my uncle, "You just be your natural self. If you are
feeling pleasant, why change personalities? Why make your life a drama
instead of a reality?"</p><p>But we are all doing that in different measures.</p><p>Your personality consists only of cultivated layers. Many masks are
hanging around you -</p><p>- whichever you need, you put it on. In fact, humanity has developed,
by and by, almost an automatic system -- you need not do anything, it
happens by itself.</p><p>The moment you see your boss, your face changes -- not that you
change it. It is so unconscious that you start smiling, just like a dog
wagging his tail.</p><p>Even dogs are very clever. If they are not certain about a stranger
who is coming towards their house -- he may be a friend, he may not be a
friend -- they do both things: they go on barking, and they go on
wagging their tail also. They are just waiting to see which direction
the camel turns; if the man is received by the family as a friend, the
barking stops and the tail continues. And if the family rejects the man,
then the tail stops and barking continues.</p><p>Poor dogs are being corrupted because of the company they keep with
human beings; they have learned your tricks.</p><p>A person meeting the boss has one face. The same person meeting his
servant has a different face. He behaves with the servant as if he does
not matter at all, he is not human. You can pass him without taking any
note of him, he is only a servant.</p><p>But as far as the boss is concerned, you have to take a joyous
attitude, an ear-to- ear smile</p><p>-- a Jimmy Carter smile. And you are not doing it deliberately; now
it is your autonomous, unconscious functioning.</p><p>Enlightenment is simply the process of becoming aware of your
unconscious layers of personality and dropping those layers. They are
not you; they are false faces. And because of those false faces, you
cannot discover your original face.</p><p>Enlightenment is nothing but the discovery of the original face --
the essential reality you brought with you, and the essential reality
you will have to take with you when you die.</p><p>All these layers gathered between birth and death will be left here
behind you.</p><p>The man of enlightenment does exactly what death does to everybody,
but he does it himself. He dies in a way and is reborn, dies in a way
and is resurrected. And his originality is luminous because it is part
of eternal life.</p><p>It is a simple process of discovering yourself. You are not the
container but the content.</p><p>Discarding the container and discovering the content is the whole
process of</p><p>enlightenment. Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL YOUR PRESENCE ALL AROUND ME, YOUR LOVE AND YOUR</p><p>COMPASSION, BUT I MYSELF FEEL UNWORTHY OF IT. WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD
DESERVE YOU? JUST BECAUSE OF THIS, I HAVE CLOSED A DOOR</p><p>IN FRONT OF YOU. MY HEART IS SUFFERING, BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN</p><p>WHERE THE DOOR IS. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>It is one of the crimes that has been committed against everybody
everywhere in human society: you have been continuously conditioned and
told that you are unworthy.</p><p>Because of this conditioning, the major part of humanity has given up
even desiring any adventure, any pilgimage to the stars -- they are so
convinced of their unworthiness. Their parents were telling them, "You
are unworthy." Their teachers were telling them, "You are unworthy."
Their priests were telling them, "You are unworthy." Everybody was
forcing the idea on them that they were unworthy. Naturally they
accepted the idea.</p><p>And once you accept the idea of unworthiness, you naturally close.
You cannot believe that you have wings, that the whole sky is yours,
that you have just to open your wings and the sky is going to be yours,
with all its stars.</p><p>And it is not a question that somewhere you have forgotten to open
one door. You don't have any doors, you don't have any walls.</p><p>This unworthiness is simply a concept, an idea. You have become
hypnotized by the idea.</p><p>Since the very beginning, all cultures, all societies have been using
hypnotism to destroy individuals -- their freedom, their uniqueness,
their genius -- because the vested interests are not in need of
geniuses, not in need of unique individuals, not in need of people who
love freedom. They are in need of slaves. And the only psychological way
to create slaves is to condition your mind that you are unworthy, that
you don't deserve; that you don't even deserve whatever you have, you
should not go for anything more. Already you owe too much for things
which you are not worthy of.</p><p>And hypnotism is a simple process of continuous repetition. Just go
on repeating a certain idea and it starts settling inside you, and it
becomes a thick wall, invisible -- there are no doors, no windows. There
is no wall either.</p><p>George Gurdjieff has remembered his childhood He was born in the
Caucasus,</p><p>one of the most primitive parts of the world. It is still at the
stage where humanity was when it lived by hunting; even cultivation has
not started. The people of the Caucasus are great hunters.</p><p>And any society that lives by hunting is bound to be a nomadic
society. It cannot make houses, it cannot make cities, because you
cannot depend on animals -- today they are available here, tomorrow they
are not available here. And certainly you will kill them, and because of
your presence they will escape -- either they will be killed or they
will escape.</p><p>Cities are possible only with cultivation because trees cannot
escape, and you have to be there to protect them, to water them, to take
care of them -- so you have to live in villages near your fields.</p><p>The Caucasus is still nomadic. They are on their horses, moving from
one place to another place, hunting.</p><p>Gurdjieff was brought up by a nomadic society, so he was coming from
almost another planet. He knew a few things which we have forgotten. He
remembers that in his childhood the nomads hypnotized their children --
because they cannot carry them continuously while they are hunting; they
have to leave them somewhere under a tree, in a safe place. But what is
the guarantee that those children will remain there? They have to be
hypnotized. So they used a small strategy -- and they have used it for
centuries.</p><p>From the very beginning when the child is very small, they will make
him sit</p><p>under a tree. They will draw a circle around the child with a stick
and tell him, "You cannot go out of this circle; if you go out of it,
you will be dead."</p><p>Now those small children believe, just like you. Why are you
Christian? -- because your parents told you. Why are you Hindus? Why are
you Jainas? Why are you Mohammedans? -- because your parents told
you.</p><p>Those children believe that if they go out of the circle they will
die. They grow up with this conditioning.</p><p>And you may try to persuade them: "Come out, I will give you a
sweet." They cannot, because death.… Even sometimes if they try, they
feel as if an invisible wall prevents them, pushes them back into the
circle. And that wall exists only in their minds -- there is no wall,
there is nothing. Unless the person who has put them in the circle comes
and withdraws the circle, takes the child out, the child remains
inside.</p><p>And the child goes on growing, but the idea remains in the
unconscious. So even an old man, if his father draws a circle around
him, cannot get out of it.</p><p>So it is not only a question of the child; the old man also still
carries his childhood in his unconscious.</p><p>And it is not a question of one child. The whole group of nomads have
put their children under trees nearby, and all the children are sitting
there the whole day long. By the time their parents come back, it has
become such a conditioning that no matter what happens, the child will
not leave the circle.</p><p>Exactly the same kind of circles are drawn around you by your
society. Of course they are more sophisticated. Your religion is nothing
but a circle, but very sophisticated; your church, your temple, your
holy book is nothing but a hypnotic circle.</p><p>One has to understand that one is living surrounded by many circles
which are only in your mind. They don't have a real existence, but they
function almost as if they are real.</p><p>One night it happened, it must have been nearabout twelve, a young
man knocked on my door. I was still awake, writing a few letters. He
fell on the ground, took hold of my feet, and said, "Just give me one
glass of water with</p><p>your hand."</p><p>I said, "What is the purpose?"</p><p>He said, "I have been sent by a Dr. S.C. Barat. I am his patient. I
have been suffering from a stomachache for years. He has tried all kinds
of medicines, nothing helps. And today he said, `Now medical science
cannot help you; only a miracle can help you.' So I asked where I had to
go for the miracle and he sent me to you. And he said, `Whatever
happens, you go on holding his feet unless he gives you a glass of water
-- just that water will be the cure."</p><p>Dr. Barat was my friend. He had told me that he was going to send
this young man. He said, "He is a hypochondriac. He has no stomachache,
nothing -- just he is rich, too much money and nothing to do. So he is
doing stomachache, headache... he gets any kind of disease. I have not
found any disease in him, he is perfectly healthy. But every day he
tortures me for hours. I know that no medicine is going to help because
he is not sick. In fact, to give him any medicine is dangerous.</p><p>"So I have been giving him just colored water, especially prepared
for him. I have a whole cabinet full of colored water in bottles; I make
a mixture from these bottles and give it to him. He says, `Yes, a little
relief but the pain remains.' And if it disappears from one place, it
starts appearing in another place. I am tired. And because of him, I am
losing many patients. So you have to save me from this rich young man.
His father has died and he has a big inheritance, enough money to throw
away on anything. But he is destroying my business."</p><p>I said, "I don't understand -- how is he destroying your
business?"</p><p>He said, "It is very simple -- because my other patients see him, and
see that he has been coming for ten years and I have not been able to
cure him. It creates a bad impression. So I am sending him to you, and
you have to do the miracle."</p><p>I said, "I don't do miracles, and miracles don't happen. But if you
want, I will try."</p><p>So when the young man came, I went on denying him: "Just water
touched by me is not going to help. You should go to another doctor --
why are you after this Dr. Barat? If one doctor has failed, go to
another doctor. If onèpathy' fails... change from allopathy: try
ayurveda; if ayurveda fails, try homeopathy; if</p><p>homeopathy fails, try naturopathy. And by that time you will be dead,
don't be worried. Whether the disease goes or not, you will be
gone!"</p><p>He said, "But I want to live! I am too young to die right now." And
he was not more than twenty-six. He said, "I am not even married.
Because my father died, I have enough money -- many people are after me.
They want me to marry their daughters, and I don't want to be encaged.
And first I want to take care of my health. Getting married means
bringing more sicknesses, more diseases into the house. You have to give
me a glass of water!"</p><p>I said, "It is very difficult, because miracles don't happen."</p><p>I was staying in a friend's house. His wife was listening as this
whole conversation was going on and on, and he was crying Finally the
woman came</p><p>out and said, "I never thought that you are so hard. Whether it helps
or not, just give him a glass of water. Half of the night has passed;
neither are you going to sleep, nor are you allowing anybody else in the
house to sleep -- because we are all excited, waiting to see what
happens, whether the miracle happens or not."</p><p>I said, "Because you say so, and because I don't want to torture your
family... Bring a glass of water."</p><p>And I told the young man, "Remember, you are not to talk about it to
anybody -- because I don't want it to happen that from tomorrow the
whole day long a queue of patients is there. I don't have time for all
this. So promise me that you will not talk."</p><p>He said, "I promise that I will not talk, but you also have to
promise me one thing."</p><p>I said, "What is it?"</p><p>He said, "You will have to promise me that once in a while I can come
with a bottle of water and you will touch it."</p><p>I said, "What you are going to do with it?"</p><p>He said, "I will not say anything to anybody about you. But if the
miracle happens and my stomachache disappears, there are many people who
are suffering. I can distribute the water. But I promise I will not
talk."</p><p>So I said, "Okay, it is a promise. But don't bring anybody here!"</p><p>I gave him a glass of water, and as he drank the water -- just
drinking it, you could see his face changing. And he said, "My God, the
pain is gone!"</p><p>My friend's wife was standing behind me. She said, "You did it!"</p><p>I said, "I have not done it -- and remember that you are not to talk
about it to anybody."</p><p>She said, "I may not talk, but everybody in the house knows --
everybody is hiding, all the children are there. Now " She said, "If
this was going to happen,</p><p>why did you waste one hour?"</p><p>I said, "Without wasting that hour, the water wouldn't have helped.
It was not the water; it was my insistence that I wouldn't give it to
him. He became more and more convinced that the water was going to work.
And when I told him that he had to promise not to talk to anybody, he
was absolutely convinced that the miracle was going to happen."</p><p>He started distributing the water.</p><p>And people told me -- even Dr. Barat told me, "It is strange. You
cured my patient and now he is curing my patients. I was thinking I was
finished with him</p><p>-- now he comes with a bottle into my dispensary. He sits there and
says, `Don't bother about this medicine, it won't help. Take the
miraculous water.' That young man seems to be my enemy from a past life!
And he has cured a few of my patients!"</p><p>Seventy percent of sick people are only sick in their minds, they
don't have a real sickness.</p><p>Hence it has been found that all the pathies -- allopathy, ayurveda,
yunani, naturopathy, homeopathy -- they all succeed in seventy percent
of cases. In seventy percent of cases anybody can do miracles, one just
has to make the right arrangement so the mind is convinced that the
miracle is going to happen.</p><p>It is simply a conditioning that you are unworthy. Nobody is
unworthy.</p><p>Existence does not produce people who are unworthy.</p><p>Existence is not unintelligent. If existence produces so many
unworthy people, then the whole responsibility goes to existence. Then
it can be definitely concluded that existence is not intelligent, that
there is no intelligence behind it, that it is an unintelligent,
accidental materialist phenomenon and there is no consciousness in
it.</p><p>And this is our whole fight, our whole struggle: to prove that
existence is intelligent, that existence is immensely conscious.</p><p>It is the same existence which creates Gautam Buddhas. It cannot
create unworthy people.</p><p>You are not unworthy.</p><p>So there is no question of finding a door; there is only an
understanding that unworthiness is a false idea imposed on you by those
who want you to be a slave for your whole life.</p><p>You can drop it just right now.</p><p>Existence gives the same sun to you as to Gautam Buddha, the same
moon as to Zarathustra, the same wind as to Mahavira, the same rain as
to Jesus -- it makes no difference, it has no idea of discrimination.
For existence, Gautam Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Bodhidharma, Kabir,
Nanak or you are just the same.</p><p>The only difference is that Gautam Buddha did not accept the idea of
being unworthy, he rejected the idea. It was easy for him to reject it
-- he was the prince of a great kingdom, the only son of the king, and
the king was thought to be almost a god. So he had no idea of
unworthiness.</p><p>But what about Kabir? What about Raidas the shoemaker? What about
Gora the potter?</p><p>These poor people were burdened by the society with the idea that
they were unworthy, but they rejected it.</p><p>In Kabir's life there were clearcut examples. Kabir lived his whole
life in Kashi.</p><p>For centuries Hindus have believed that to die in Kashi is the
greatest thing you can do in life, because for one who dies in Kashi,
his paradise is guaranteed. It does not matter what kind of man he was,
whether he was a murderer, a thief, a saint or a sinner -- these things
are all irrelevant. His dying in Kashi erases everything and he becomes
qualified for paradise.</p><p>So in Kashi you will find old people, old women who have come there
just to die. They have not done anything in their life, but they don't
want to miss paradise.</p><p>And Kabir lived his whole life in Kashi, and when he was going to die
he said, "Take me out of Kashi to the other side, to the small village."
Just on the other side of the Ganges was a small village.</p><p>His disciples said, "Are you mad or something? People come to Kashi,
the whole of Kashi is full of people who have come here to die. You have
lived your whole life in Kashi, what kind of nonsense is this? And the
village you are pointing to is a condemned village; people say whoever
dies there is born again as a donkey."</p><p>But Kabir said, "I will go to that village, and I will die in that
village. I want to enter paradise on my own worth, not because of Kashi.
And I know my worth."</p><p>They had to take him. Against their will they had to take him to the
other side, and he died there.</p><p>This man is so certain of his worth.</p><p>He was a weaver. It is not certain whether he was Hindu or Mohammedan
because his name, Kabir, is Mohammedan; it is one of the names of God.
He was found on the Ganges -- a small child, just a few days old,
abandoned by his parents.</p><p>One great Hindu scholar, Ramananda, had gone for his early bath and
he found the child.</p><p>And he could not be so hard as to leave him there, so he brought him
into his ashram --</p><p>he had an ashram and hundreds of disciples. So the child was brought
up by a</p><p>brahmin.</p><p>But on his hand was written the namèKabir'. He didn't change his
name.</p><p>It is still uncertain whether he was Mohammedan or Hindu. He never
cared.</p><p>Once there was a great conference in Kashi. It used to convene only
after each twelve years to decide about certain spiritual matters,
problems which may have arisen about scriptures. Naturally Kabir was not
invited because it was not even certain that he was a Hindu, and only
brahmins could be allowed.</p><p>But about a certain point in the scriptures they could not come to a
conclusion. One man said, "You have to forget about whether Kabir is
Hindu or Mohammedan, it doesn't matter. He is the only man alive in
Kashi who can immediately decide the meaning, the insight of this
scriptural passage."</p><p>I am telling you about this incident for a particular reason.</p><p>At that very time Meera was also in Kashi, she had just come. She was
traveling around India.</p><p>Reluctantly, the scholars asked Kabir: "You are invited to the
conference because we are stuck at a certain point, and nobody has the
experience. And there are many people in the conference who say, `Kabir
has the experience.' This passage needs to be interpreted only by one
who has known himself; so although we are not certain whether you are
Hindu or Mohammedan or brahmin, still we are inviting you, against all
precedents."</p><p>Kabir said, "There is a condition: I will come only if Meera is also
invited."</p><p>Now that was even more difficult for the male chauvinist mind -- a
woman! What does a woman have to do with it? When wise scholars are
deciding things, a woman's function is in the house.</p><p>Kabir said, "Then Kabir is not coming. Kabir can come only if Meera
is allowed to come.</p><p>When you are ready to allow Kabir -- whose caste is not certain,
whose religion is not certain -- what is the problem about Meera? --
because she can also decide. Even if I don't come, she also has the same
experience as I have."</p><p>And the scholars had to agree.</p><p>This has happened only once, that a woman and a non-brahmin joined
with the highest hierarchy of Hinduism to interpret their scriptures.
And their interpretation was accepted.</p><p>Kabir's disciples asked, "From where did you get such authority?"</p><p>He said, "If existence accepts me, if existence gives me life, that
is enough to prove that I am needed, that existence cannot do without
me."</p><p>So drop the idea of unworthiness, it is simply an idea. And with the
dropping of it, you are under the sky -- there is no question of doors,
everything is open, all directions are open. That you are is enough to
prove that existence needs you, loves you, nourishes you, respects
you.</p><p>The idea of unworthiness is created by the social parasites. Drop
that idea.</p><p>And be grateful to existence -- because it only creates people who
are worthy, it never creates anything which is worthless.</p><p>It only creates people who are needed.</p><p>My emphasis is that every sannyasin should respect himself and feel
grateful to existence that he has been required to be here at this
juncture of time and space.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THERE IS A SUFI SAYING THAT "NO HUMAN BEING CAN AVOID HIS FATE.</p><p>THIS IS A WORLD OF LIMITATIONS -- BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO GAIN A TASTE
OF THE LIMITLESS, DESPITE THIS FACT."</p><p>A FAMOUS ASTROLOGER AND COMPOSER, DANE RUDHYAR, WHO WAS A FRIEND OF
GEORGE GURDJIEFF, SAID, "THE OLD IDEA OF</p><p>ASTROLOGY --</p><p>THAT EXPERIENCE HAPPENS TO HUMAN BEINGS -- IS NOT TRUE. ON THE</p><p>CONTRARY, HUMAN BEINGS HAPPEN TO THEIR EXPERIENCE."</p><p>MY OBSERVATION IS THAT EVERY ASTROLOGER WHO IS COURAGEOUS</p><p>ENOUGH WILL FIND OUT THAT GURDJIEFF IS TRUE WHEN HE SAYS, "MAN</p><p>IS A MACHINE."</p><p>ON THE OTHER HAND, MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU, CHRIST, AND</p><p>BUDDHIST TEACHERS HAS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF THE LIMITLESS</p><p>IN THE MIDST OF LIMITATIONS. WHILE RELIGIOUSNESS OPENS THE DOORS</p><p>TO THE LIMITLESS, ASTROLOGY STUDIES THE WORLD OF FORMS AND</p><p>LIMITATIONS. AND WITHOUT THE FIRST, THE SECOND COULD HAVE</p><p>BECOME INTOLERABLE TO ME. NOW, SLOWLY SLOWLY, THE FORMLESS</p><p>AND THE FORM SEEM TO MEET AND MARRY INSIDE OF ME. WOULD YOU PLEASE
COMMENT?</p><p>George Gurdjieff is right when he says that man is a machine, but by
`man' he means all those who are living unconsciously, who are not
aware, who are not awake, who do not respond to reality but only
react.</p><p>Ninety-nine point nine percent of human beings come in the category
of machines. With these machines, astrology is possible.</p><p>In fact, predictions can be made, guarantees can be issued only about
machines. A watch can be guaranteed for five years, a car can be
guaranteed for a certain time -- because we know the capacity of the
machine, how much it can work, how long it can go. Its scope is limited.
And it cannot do anything on its own accord, it can only react to
situations --</p><p>which are almost predictable.</p><p>For example, at a certain stage a boy and a girl will become sexually
mature, and their hormones and their biology will start forcing them
towards each other. They will call it love because nobody wants to be
categorized as a machine. But two machines cannot love, two machines can
only be together, can struggle, can stumble against each other.</p><p>And it is not coincidence that in every language, love is called
`falling in love'. It is an unconscious process, it is a fall. You
cannot answer why you love a certain person.</p><p>And now the science of human biology, genetics, has grown much more
mature. It is possible to inject hormones into you which can make all
your love disappear, or which can make you a great lover. But these are
hormones; it is chemical. You are not consciously involved in it.</p><p>It happened in Bombay nearabout twenty years ago -- an astrologer
came to see me. I told him, "You will be disappointed. Astrology won't
work with me."</p><p>He said, "It is not a question of you or anybody else, there are no
exceptions in astrology."</p><p>I said, "Then do one thing: Write down twelve things that I am going
to do in one year.</p><p>You keep one copy and I will keep one copy, I will write on both
copies that these are the twelve things that I will not do. That's the
only way to decide whether your astrology works or not."</p><p>He got a little afraid because he had not thought of this
possibility.</p><p>I said, "Even to the extent... if you say that I will live, I will
die -- just to make the point clear that astrology won't work with
me."</p><p>He said, "Now I now have to study more in depth. And after three days
I will be coming back."</p><p>Twenty years have passed; he has not come.</p><p>And whenever I have been in Bombay, I have inquired, "Phone the
astrologer and ask when that in-depth study is going to be complete --
because twenty years have passed.</p><p>Has he dropped the idea?"</p><p>If you are enlightened, then astrology cannot function for you. Then
you can love, then you can do, then you can act, then you have a certain
mastery over your own being.</p><p>But unconscious, you are just moving hither and thither as the wind
blows.</p><p>And anybody who has studied human nature deeply.… There are many
astrological schools which have studied for centuries how the mechanical
man works. They have come to certain conclusions, and their conclusions
are almost always correct. If they are incorrect, that means the
astrologer is not well prepared, his studies in human nature and
unconscious behavior are not complete.</p><p>But the moment you start becoming conscious, you start becoming
really a man -</p><p>- not a machine.</p><p>When Gurdjieff said for the first time that man is a machine, it
shocked many people. But he was saying the truth. Only the truth is
applicable just to 99.9 percent of people -- 0.1</p><p>percent of people have to be left out of it. Gautam Buddha was
born.…</p><p>And in the East those were the days of the highest possibilities for
human genius. In all directions in which the East was working, it
reached the very peak, the climax... to such an extent that you cannot
find a new Yoga posture; Patanjali exhausted all the possibilities of
postures, the science is complete. Five thousand years have passed, and
in five thousand years thousands of people have tried but</p><p>there is no way to find a new posture.</p><p>You cannot find a new sex posture; Vatsyayana has completed all the
postures possible --</p><p>and a few which may even look impossible!</p><p>Shiva completed all the techniques -- one hundred and twelve. You can
play with new combinations, but nothing new is possible.</p><p>Astrology was at its peak.</p><p>And as Gautam Buddha was born, the son of a great king, the king
immediately called the best astrologers. They all studied the birth
chart and they all remained silent.</p><p>Only one -- a young astrologer -- said to the king, "These people are
silent because this is a strange boy, and we cannot be decisive about
him. There are two possibilities" -- and astrology never speaks in that
way. Astrology means you have to predict what is going to be; you are
not there to predict all the possibilities -- that will not be
prediction.</p><p>But the young astrologer said, "These are old wise people, they will
not even say this. I am young and I can stick my neck out, I can risk,
because I don't have any reputation.</p><p>There are two possibilities: either this boy will become an emperor
of the world, a chakravartin, or he will become an enlightened, awakened
liberated soul -- but then he will be a beggar. Either he will be the
emperor of the whole world or he will be just a beggar with a begging
bowl in his hands. And it is not in our power to say what the outcome
will be."</p><p>And all the old astrologers agreed. "The young man is right. We were
silent because this is not the way astrology functions -- we say, `this
is definitely going to happen.' But about this boy we cannot say. And
the possibilities are so diametrically opposite -- either the emperor or
the beggar."</p><p>And that's what happened.</p><p>The king asked all those wise astrologers, "Then tell me how to
protect him so</p><p>that he does not move towards becoming a beggar but becomes the world
emperor. That has been my lifelong desire. I could not achieve it -- but
he has the possibility. So just tell me how to prevent him from becoming
a beggar."</p><p>They gave all their advice, and their advice turned out to create
just the opposite to what they intended. They had suggested, "Give him
all the luxuries. Don't let him know about death, old age. Don't let him
know about sannyas. He should not be given time to think,</p><p>`What is the meaning of life?' Keep him engaged continuously in
singing, in dancing, wine and women, drown him completely."</p><p>And that's what created the trouble -- because for twenty-nine years
he was kept so isolated from the world, so ignorant about the ordinary
reality of the world where people become sick, people become old, people
die, there are sannyasins, there are seekers of truth... If he had been
allowed from the very beginning, he would have become immune -</p><p>- from the very beginning he would have seen that people become old,
people become sick, a few people become sannyasins. But for twenty-nine
years he was kept completely aloof.</p><p>And after twenty-nine years when he came into contact with the world
-- one day, one has to come into contact with the world -- then it was a
great shock. He could not believe his eyes that people become old; he
could not believe that life is going to end in death. He could not
believe that he had been kept in darkness while there were people
searching to find the meaning of life, trying to find out whether there
was something immortal in man or not.</p><p>The shock would not have been so much. It is not such a shock for
anybody else</p><p>-- from the very childhood, everything... one becomes, slowly slowly,
accustomed. But for him the shock was tremendous.</p><p>That very night he left the palace as a sannyasin in search of
truth.</p><p>The father was trying to save him from the begging bowl, and that's
what he adopted that night.</p><p>It was possible he might have become Alexander the Great if he had
not been kept in darkness. But in a way it was good, because Alexander
the Great and his</p><p>kind have not helped human consciousness.</p><p>This man alone, with his begging bowl, raised humanity more than
anybody else towards the stars, towards immortality, towards truth.</p><p>About such a man, astrology is not possible.</p><p>It is good to accept that you are functioning like a machine. Don't
feel offended -</p><p>-</p><p>because if you feel offended, you will defend yourself and you will
remain what you are.</p><p>Try to understand your behavior -- is it mechanical or not?</p><p>Somebody insults you -- how do you react? Is that reaction mechanical
or conscious? Do you think before you become angry? Do you meditate for
a moment before you respond?</p><p>Perhaps what the man has said is right, and if you had not got angry
immediately, instantly, without giving a small gap for meditation, you
might have been grateful to the man rather than being angry -- "You are
right."</p><p>In fact, things which are right hurt you much more. Lies don't hurt
you at all.</p><p>Just the other day, Nirvano brought a newspaper cutting. A Western
traveler coming from Tibet gave his first press conference, and in the
press conference he said, "My greatest experience was meeting with
Bhagwan in Tibet."</p><p>Now people can lie like anything, and whoever reads it will believe
it. The printed word has a certain impact on people.</p><p>Just a few days before, there was another news item -- no ifs and no
buts, a certainty --</p><p>that "Bhagwan is going to appear in Israel very soon. He has decided
to become converted to Judaism, and after converting to Judaism, he will
declare himself to be the reincarnation of Moses."</p><p>Now what can you do with these people? You can laugh, but you cannot
be angry. You can enjoy, you can thank them for their imagination. These
are the people who keep the world going!</p><p>Just watch your actions, and try not to be mechanical. Try to do
something that you have never done before in the same situation.</p><p>That's what the meaning is when Jesus says, "When somebody slaps your
face, give him the other cheek too." The real meaning is, simply act
non-mechanically</p><p>-- because the mechanical thing would be when somebody slaps you, you
slap him. Or if you are not capable of slapping him right now, then wait
for the right moment. But to give him the other cheek is behaving
non-mechanically, is behaving very consciously.</p><p>But people can make anything mechanical.</p><p>I have heard about a Christian saint who was continuously quoting the
same thing: "Love your enemy, and if somebody slaps you on one cheek
give him the other too."</p><p>One day a man who was against Christianity found the saint alone, hit
him hard on one of his cheeks, looked into the eyes of the saint.… For a
moment the saint wanted to hit him back -- but being a saint,
remembering all his teachings and remembering that this man sits in his
congregation in the front, he gave him the other cheek, thinking that he
would not hit it. The man hit him harder on the other cheek! -- and that
very moment the saint jumped on the man, hitting him hard on the nose.
The man said, "What are you doing?</p><p>You are a Christian, you have to love your enemy."</p><p>He said, "Forget all about it. Jesus only talked about two cheeks --
about the third, I am free. Now there is no third cheek to give you. And
he has not said that when he hits you on the second, give him your nose
too!"</p><p>Because Jesus has not said why.…</p><p>Gautam Buddha in one of his sermons said, "Try to be non-mechanical
as much as possible. If somebody hits you, insults you, humiliates you,
forgive him seven times. Be conscious."</p><p>Jesus was saying only one time -- because you have only two cheeks,
and one he has hit already. Only one is left, so there is not much.…
Buddha is saying seven times.</p><p>One of the disciples stood up and said, "What about the eighth? Seven
times we will keep patience, but what about the eighth?"</p><p>Even Buddha was silent for a moment. So deep is man's mechanicalness
He</p><p>said,</p><p>"Then change it, make it seventy-seven times."</p><p>The man said, "You can make it any number, but the question will
remain the same --</p><p>what about the seventy-eighth time? We can wait seventy-seven times
"</p><p>You can behave in a saintly way, but if it is mechanical it doesn't
change anything.</p><p>Be alert and see that yesterday you have done the same thing. Today
make a little difference -- you are not a machine.</p><p>You said the same thing to your wife, make a little difference -- you
are not a machine.</p><p>And if in twenty-four hours time you continually go on changing,
slowly slowly you will slip out of the mechanical behavior and a
consciousness will arise in you.</p><p>That consciousness makes you really human. Before, you only appear
human; in reality you are not.</p><p>Beyond Enlightenment Chapter #32</p><p>Chapter title: Truth has to wait but not to wait forever 4 November

easy but boring; easy but flat; easy but not worth living.</p><p>And mind is concerned only with facts and figures.</p><p>It is a great blessing of existence that mind is not all, that there
is much more to life which cannot be confined to facts, explanations,
theories. Something mysterious remains always unexplained, and that is
the most valuable, the most significant part of life.</p><p>It is impossible to explain love, trust, beauty, grace, gratitude,
silence. All that is meaningful seems to be beyond mind, and all that is
meaningless seems to be the boundary of the mind.</p><p>I am reminded of a great Sufi master, Junnaid. One day one of his
disciples -- who had managed somehow to trust in Junnaid, who had with
effort remained unskeptical -- had gone hunting in the forest. And he
saw Junnaid sitting by the side of a beautiful lake with a beautiful
woman. From far away he saw, and from far away everything is beautiful
--</p><p>and particularly a Mohammedan woman.</p><p>No Mohammedan woman is ugly -- her face is veiled. It is a great
strategy of ugly women against the beautiful; in this way the beautiful
are lost.</p><p>All his repressed suspicions and doubts arose, surfaced -- and it was
not only that Junnaid was sitting with the woman; the woman was pouring
wine from a flask into a cup for Junnaid.</p><p>All his trust was shattered, all his love was finished: "There is a
limit to everything. This is going too far. This man is a fraud!"</p><p>And if he had returned without going to Junnaid to say something, he
would have remained with the idea that the man was a fraud. He had all
the facts, he had seen with his own eyes, he was a witness. He needed no
other evidence, no other proof. No argument would have convinced him
that he could have been wrong.</p><p>But Junnaid shouted loudly, "Don't go back! Come close, because when
you come close many facts prove to be fictions. The closer you come, the
more fictitious they are. Just come close."</p><p>A little bit afraid, but he came.</p><p>Junnaid lifted the veil from the woman's face. She was Junnaid's
mother, an old woman.</p><p>And he said, "What about the beautiful woman you had seen? -- and you
had seen her with your own eyes. Could you have imagined an old woman,
my own mother? It was beyond your imagination.</p><p>"And take this flask and look closely, taste it; it is pure water,
not wine. Just the flask is of the wine.</p><p>"But you were going with absolute certainty: that this man is a fraud
-- women and wine in privacy, in the forest -- and in public he has
another face, of a great master."</p><p>The disciple fell at his feet and said, "Please forgive me."</p><p>Junnaid said, "It is not a question of forgiveness; it is a question
of understanding. You have a trust which is forced, and a forced trust
is bound to sooner or later go through a breakdown. Your love is an
effort, and love cannot be an effort -- either you love or you don't,
the question of effort does not arise. You were trying to imitate other
disciples, and the path of the truth is not for imitators.</p><p>"I had come to this place only for you, knowing that you were going
hunting and you were bound to come to this lake. You have to start from
the beginning, and this time your love has not to be an effort and your
trust has not to be something forced. These things are beautiful when
they grow naturally -- and when they grow naturally then no facts, no
figures can destroy them. They have such tremendous energy of their own
that all facts and figures simply evaporate."</p><p>Facts are not truths, but just like soap bubbles. Yes, a soap bubble
is -- but its existence or non-existence is almost equal.</p><p>Truth has an eternity: it was true, it is true, it will remain true.
There is no way for the truth to be otherwise.</p><p>Facts go on changing. Facts depend on interpretations. The same fact
can be interpreted in a thousand and one ways. And that's what we are
all doing; otherwise, there would be no need of so many religions, so
many philosophies, so many ideologies.</p><p>Truth is one.</p><p>The mystic has no philosophy, the mystic has no ideology -- because
he has the truth itself.</p><p>Just look at a few facts and how they can be interpreted not only
differently but</p><p>in a diametrically opposite way.</p><p>The most important Jaina master, Mahavira, lived naked all his life.
He renounced the world, his kingdom, he renounced everything -- clothes,
shoes. He lived just as a child is born, naked, with nothing in his
hands. He did not even carry a begging bowl. He used to make a begging
bowl with his own hands. He would not use anything on which one becomes
dependent.</p><p>His ultimate goal was total freedom.</p><p>And he was so logically consistent that even to use a small blade --
a razor blade to cut his hair or to shave his beard -- he was not ready.
To use scissors or a blade would be a dependency, so he used to pull his
hair out with his own hand. It was painful, but he managed.</p><p>He lived eighty-two years... and he had to pull out the hairs because
he was not taking baths. According to his approach, to take a bath is to
decorate the body, is to believe in the body -- and the body is nothing
but bones, blood, flesh, everything rotten, just covered with skin. What
is the point of taking a bath? -- you are not the body. And
consciousness needs no cleanliness because it cannot become unclean.</p><p>In India he has been worshipped by the Jainas for twenty-five
centuries as one of the most important mystics of the whole world. And
even those who are not of his fold have immense respect for the man.</p><p>But I bring Sigmund Freud to analyze Mahavira's attitude and
character -- the same facts.</p><p>It is strange that there are thousands of madmen in the insane
asylums around the world, and there is a certain kind of madness in
which nakedness and pulling out the hair happens together. Those mad
people live naked and they pull out their hair -- they don't allow
anybody to cut their hair or shave their beards. And the same mad people
don't allow themselves to be given showers or baths. Strange.…</p><p>Is Mahavira a madman of the same category?</p><p>Or are these mad people Mahaviras, great masters misunderstood by an
insane world?</p><p>Somewhere something has to be decided.</p><p>Strangely enough, these mad people who live naked, pull out their
hair, don't take any baths, are absolutely non-violent. They are not
dangerous; they never hurt anybody, they never kill anybody. They are
very harmless people. And that is the whole philosophy of Mahavira --
non-violence.</p><p>Perhaps he was a madman with a genius, with such a talented
intelligence that he made a philosophical standpoint out of his
madness.</p><p>Now, who is going to decide?</p><p>The fact in itself is without any judgment; in itself it says
nothing, it is simply a fact.</p><p>At the moment you start thinking about it, you start creating
interpretations, and those interpretations will depend on your attitude.
They have nothing to do with the fact.</p><p>Because I have brought Sigmund Freud in, I cannot allow him to go out
so easily. He was the founder of psychoanalysis, and yet he remained a
practicing Jew for his whole life, subscribing to all the superstitions
of the Jews.</p><p>For example, circumcision: Every Jewish child... as he is born, the
male child is immediately circumcised. Mohammedans are also circumcised
but after two or three years, not immediately.</p><p>And Jews believe that they are the most intelligent people in the
world because of circumcision. It is true that they are perhaps the most
intelligent group of people in the world. The whole contemporary world
is dominated by Jews: Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein -- these
three figures stand out amongst billions of people. Their contribution
to human well-being is immense.</p><p>I have told you that forty percent of Nobel prizes go to Jews. That
is simply out of all proportion -- forty percent to the small group of
Jews, and sixty percent to the rest of the world. Naturally they have
more intelligence, you cannot suspect it; it is a fact. And they have
this idea that they are so intelligent because of circumcision, and they
provide philosophical, logical, scientific proofs for it.</p><p>And one never knows, they may be right -- because now many
governments of</p><p>the world are getting ready to pass resolutions that every child born
in hospitals should be circumcised. It doesn't matter whether he is Jew
or Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan, that is not a question; it is a
question of hygiene.</p><p>It is certainly hygienic. But Jews have a very far-fetched
philosophical idea behind it: they say when the child is born... and the
genitals are the most sensitive parts. This is recognized by science, by
physiology, that the genitals are connected with a certain center in the
mind. Strangely enough, the center in the mind that is connected with
the genitals is absolutely close to the center for intelligence, they
are neighbors. And they have to be very close because there are seven
hundred centers in your brain, so they are very close knit.</p><p>Jews say that when you cut the skin of the small child, the shock
goes to the sex center.</p><p>But the shock is so much and the child is so delicate that the shock
does not remain confined to the sex center -- the shock goes to the
nearby center, which is the center of intelligence. And intelligence
gets a great impetus which other children are missing, so they are far
ahead of anybody else.</p><p>Now the rest of the world has looked upon circumcision as a
superstition.</p><p>The fact is the same, but now they are providing scientific fragments
to support it. They also are not absolute proofs, that is why I say
far-fetched. But Sigmund Freud also believed in them, and he had not all
these facts that I have, because at that time it was not known that the
centers of sex and intelligence are very close. Neither was it known
that sex is really in the mind and the genitals are only extensions,
they are not really the sex organs. They can be bypassed, and you can
enjoy a sexual experience without your genitals even knowing about
it.</p><p>Sigmund Freud never inquired, never raised a question about the
Jewish idea of circumcision -- which he should have, because he was a
Jew, and his whole work was with sexuality. His whole life was devoted
to finding out everything about sexuality, but he bypassed circumcision,
he did not talk about it. Others have laughed for centuries.</p><p>I have heard that one bishop and one rabbi lived opposite each other,
and naturally there was great competition in everything. One day the
bishop purchased a beautiful Chevrolet.</p><p>The rabbi came out and he said, "A beautiful car... whose car is
this?"</p><p>And the bishop came out with a bucket of water and poured the water
on the car. He said,</p><p>"I have purchased it."</p><p>The rabbi said, "But what are you doing?"</p><p>He said, "Baptism." He was a Christian Baptist. "Now the car is a
Christian Baptist car --</p><p>baptized."</p><p>This was too much for the rabbi.</p><p>Next day, as the bishop woke up, he saw a beautiful Cadillac sitting
in the garage of the rabbi. He was shocked -- because the Chevrolet is a
poor man's car in America. The poor peoples' neighborhoods are called
"Chevrolet neighborhoods." It is a rich man's car in other countries,
but in America the Chevrolet is a poor man's car. But the Cadillac is
especially Jewish.</p><p>The bishop came out and he said, "How could you manage it?"</p><p>The rabbi said, "God looks after his chosen few." And he said, "Come
on -- because there is going to be a ceremony."</p><p>The bishop said, "What kind of ceremony?" He said, "You come
inside."</p><p>The bishop came into the garage, and the rabbi went into his house
and brought out a big pair of garden scissors. The bishop could not
believe -- what is happening? What kind of ceremony...? The rabbi
started chanting some mantras in Hebrew, and then finally he cut the
exhaust pipe.</p><p>The bishop asked, "What are you doing?"</p><p>He said, "Circumcision -- now the car is absolutely Jewish. If you
can baptize, what do you think? -- can't we do something to make the car
a Jew?"</p><p>Everybody has been laughing about circumcision.</p><p>But Sigmund Freud never even raised a question about it. He never
raised a single question that goes against Jewish tradition. All his
logic, all his reason was used to criticize everybody else.</p><p>I have asked a Jaina saint: "Sigmund Freud would say these things
about Mahavira, although he has not said them, because he knew nothing
about Mahavira. But I am absolutely certain he would say these things.
Have you something to say about Sigmund Freud, about Jews?"</p><p>And the first thing he said was: "If the skin on the male genitals
was not needed, then existence would not have given it to the child.
Existence gives only that which is needed.</p><p>To remove that skin is egoistic, it is an effort to prove that you
are wiser than existence itself. And the very idea that man is wiser
than existence is stupid."</p><p>I asked him about Jesus -- because I had taken with me a Christian
missionary, Stanley Jones, to meet the Jaina saint. And I said, "Stanley
Jones is here, and his criticism against Jaina saints, Buddhist saints,
Hindu saints, is that they don't do any service to humanity.</p><p>On the contrary, they demand that they should be served, worshipped
-- that it is their birthright.</p><p>"People may be dying from starvation -- that is not their concern.
Mahavira and Buddha have not opened a single hospital, not a single
school for poor children, not a single orphanage, like Mother Teresa.
But these people are thought to be great compassionate people. What
compassion is there? What do you think about Jesus?"</p><p>He said, "About Jesus? According to us, everything in life is a
connected link of cause and effect, the theory of action."</p><p>There are stories that if Mahavira is passing on the road and a thorn
is there, the thorn will jump out of the road -- because Mahavira has
finished all evil actions. Now no pain can be given to him by existence.
It looks logical: if existence is deciding rewards and punishments,
certainly the thorn must jump out of the road.</p><p>Mohammedans say -- because Mohammed was in Arabia... hot sun, no
clouds, no shade, no trees. But a beautiful cloud always moved over
Mohammed, wherever he went --</p><p>because he was finished with all evil acts. That's why he was chosen
by God as his best messenger; he had become so pure that he could be a
vehicle. Now it is God's duty to protect him. In the hot burning sun, a
cool breeze surrounds him, and a big cloud goes on keeping him in
shadow.</p><p>The Jaina saint said, "Jesus being crucified proves that he must have
done some very evil acts in his past life. Crucifixion was the
punishment."</p><p>It has nothing to do with Jews crucifying him or the Romans
crucifying him. Those are the visible facts, but the invisible truth is
that he must have committed something really heinous -- murder, rape --
and the result is crucifixion. So crucifixion is not something to be
worshipped; it is a condemnation.</p><p>Now for the Christian the same fact, the crucifixion of Jesus, makes
him the greatest man on the earth because he suffered for humanity, he
was crucified for you; to save you he gave his own life. That is their
interpretation.</p><p>But the Jainas, Hindus and Buddhists will all explain that "He is
suffering from many past lives of crimes. He is not giving his life to
save anybody -- because we don't see anybody saved. Who is saved? He
could not even save himself."</p><p>One thing should always be remembered: don't be bothered about facts.
They can be interpreted this way or that way very convincingly, but
facts belong to the mundane world.</p><p>Truth is the thing you should concentrate on.</p><p>You have mentioned the New Yorker article about me and the commune.
Perhaps they may not have ever written such a big article before -- one
hundred and fifty-six pages.</p><p>And what they call facts are only the facts that the government has
supplied to them.</p><p>They have not asked me; otherwise for every fact there is a
counter-fact. But it is easy not to ask both parties.</p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasruddin in his old age became an honorary
magistrate. His first case came up. He heard one side, and started
writing the judgment.</p><p>The court clerk could not believe what was happening. He whispered in
his ear,</p><p>"Honorable magistrate, what are you doing? You have not heard the
other side yet. They are waiting."</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, "I am not going to hear anybody, because right
now I am absolutely clear what the situation is, and if I hear the other
side also I will become confused. And out of confusion, judgment will be
very difficult."</p><p>The New Yorker is simply presenting one side.</p><p>I will give you a few facts on the other side so you can see how
facts should not be decisive.</p><p>The land that we purchased for the commune had been for sale for
almost half a century, and nobody had purchased it -- because it was a
desert. Not a single flower ever blossomed there, no cultivation was
ever done; it was just a useless wasteland. And it was big -- one
hundred and twenty-six square miles, eighty- four thousand acres.</p><p>We purchased the land. The man was very happy, because he had lost
hope that the land could ever be sold.</p><p>And the government was asking him to give it to them for three
million dollars. It was almost a small country -- one hundred and
twenty-six square miles, three times bigger than Manhattan. And the man
was just going to say yes to the government as we entered the scene.</p><p>We immediately offered him six million dollars. He could not believe
it -- from three million to six million! Immediately everything was
settled.</p><p>And this was the beginning of conflict with the government.</p><p>But if the government had really been interested, they could have
offered more. They should not have felt offended, it was a simple
business matter. And it is not their land either.</p><p>The whole world has forgotten completely that the real Americans are
the red Americans who are living in reservations in the forests. They
have been forced to live almost in concentration camps, an American
version of the German concentration camps -- far better, because the
German concentration camp was barbed wire, guns all around, very
crude.</p><p>The American concentration camp is very sophisticated -- no barbed
wire, no guards, you cannot say that this is a concentration camp. But
this is a concentration camp -- of a higher order, of a more subtle and
delicate quality.</p><p>What they have done is to give every red Indian a pension -- because
America belongs to them, it is their country. They don't have any work,
but they get enough pension. All they do is to go on producing more
children, because the more children they have, the more pension they
will get. Each individual gets a pension.</p><p>But you should understand that when you have no work and enough
money, what are you going to do? They gamble, they are all drunkards,
all kinds of drugs, prostitution, and no worries about anything -- every
month the salary is there. Salary for nothing, salary for remaining
silent about the fact that America belongs to them, that the people who
are known as Americans are not Americans. Somebody is from England,
somebody is from Italy, somebody is from France, somebody is from
Holland, somebody is from Germany, somebody is from Switzerland -- from
all the European countries, but nobody is an American. They are all
foreigners.</p><p>And my first conflict with the government was that I told it exactly
the same way I am telling you: that the American president is as much a
foreigner as I am a foreigner. The only difference is that he has been
here perhaps for two generations, three generations --</p><p>he is a two hundred year-old foreigner. I am fresh. And the fresh is
always better than the old and rotten.</p><p>I told them: Neither does the land belong to you nor does the land
belong to us.</p><p>And we purchased the land, we paid money; you invaded the land, you
killed people, innocent people. You are criminals.</p><p>If anybody needs permission to live in America, it is you -- from the
American president to the last American beggar. And if you really mean
what you say in your constitution --</p><p>that you are for democracy, for freedom -- if you are sincere and
honest, then give the country back to the red Indians. It belongs to
them. And apply for your green cards. If they want you here, you can be
here; otherwise go home.</p><p>And you have killed, you have invaded, you are criminals. We have
simply purchased.</p><p>Sometimes you have also purchased, but your purchase was simply a
facade. For example, New York -- the whole New York area was purchased
for thirty silver pieces. Is this business? Do you think it was done by
people willingly, or was it just because at the point of the bayonet, at
gunpoint they had to sign: "We sell the land for thirty silver
pieces."</p><p>The conflict started because I said: "Not one of you is any different
from the people in my commune. We are newcomers; you came a little
earlier. And you have committed all kinds of crimes; we have simply
purchased the land. And you were there, you could have purchased it by
offering more money -- it was a simple business matter."</p><p>But the American government will not say this.</p><p>And America must remain the only country in the world where people
like the poor red Americans cannot revolt. It is such a cunning strategy
that you are giving them money.</p><p>They think, "Revolt? for what? We are getting money, enough money, no
work... enjoy, dance, sing, take all kinds of drugs. No problems of
worrying about poverty or anything -</p><p>- why bother about revolution?" The very idea is not possible.</p><p>And they are all drunkards, opium addicted, lotus eaters. They are
not in a position to fight a revolution. Their revolution has been
killed, their spirit has been killed by money.</p><p>Because I said it clearly.…</p><p>And because the land we purchased had belonged to an ancient red
Indian tribe which lived just nearby in a forest And they had a prophecy
from the old days:</p><p>that a man from the East, with his followers wearing red clothes,
would come to this land and free them from the slavery imposed on them
by the invaders.</p><p>By coincidence, my people were wearing red clothes; by coincidence, I
was coming from the East.</p><p>And red Indians started coming, saying that "We have been waiting --
because this prophecy we have heard for generations."</p><p>These were the fears the government would never talk about.</p><p>I could have provoked the red Indians against the whole American
government, I could have created a revolution -- this was their fear.
They wanted to destroy me and the commune as quickly as possible.</p><p>The land had never produced anything, but they said that it was
farmland; hence, we could not make more than twenty houses, twenty
farmhouses. And we fought and we said, "You have to come and prove -- in
fifty years what has been produced? If it is farmland, then something
must have been cultivated. Just because you have written in your
papers... and we don't know when you have written it. You may have
written it just now, just to harass us. You have to prove what kind of
cultivation has been happening here. If this is farmland, we will
cultivate it; but such a big land area cannot be cultivated by a small
group living in twenty houses. This much land needs at least five
thousand people to make it lush green, to make lakes, reservoirs --
because everything has to depend on the rainwater. And tremendous effort
is needed to make roads, houses."</p><p>But they would not change the zoning -- which was simply stupid,
because we were not going to destroy their farmland. We were creating
farmland from a desert, we were changing the desert into an oasis.</p><p>So they went on creating legal problems, and for five years we went
on fighting -</p><p>- and we were winning in every court, because the facts were so
clear.</p><p>When they saw that they could not win legally, then they started
behaving illegally.</p><p>And when a government itself starts behaving illegally, then it
becomes very difficult to fight -- a small minority of five thousand
people. The government was fighting, the Christian church was fighting,
and nobody could say what harm we were doing to them, what harm we had
done.</p><p>The nearest American town was twenty miles away from us. We were
living and doing our own thing. But they became so much afraid.…</p><p>The fear had unconscious reasons.</p><p>America does not belong to them, and they are talking about
democracy, they are talking about liberty, they are talking about
freedom, they are talking about the rights of man.</p><p>And they have taken all of the land from the poor natives, and they
have destroyed them in such a sophisticated way as has not been done
anywhere else.</p><p>There is no hope for the red Indians for two reasons: one, they are
not in their senses, they are continuously drunk, continuously
unconscious -- fighting, murdering each other.</p><p>Secondly, slavery is paying well -- without working you are getting a
salary. To fight against this government means you will lose your salary
and you will have all kinds of problems -- so why bother?</p><p>And because I said things exactly... and I invited the president, the
governor, the attorney general of America to come and see, to show us
what cultivation they had done on this land. And we had transformed the
whole land.</p><p>Rather than praising us, they wanted us to destroy the commune and
leave America.</p><p>It seems they loved the desert so much that now they have made it
desert again.</p><p>Perhaps they need a third world war to make the whole of America a
desert. If they love the desert so much, their wishes should be
fulfilled.</p><p>But these facts that they have produced after one year... Where was
this New Yorker when I was there to reply? Now they are writing facts
and figures.</p><p>And they have not consulted the other party at all, to ask, "What are
your facts and what are your figures? How has the government misbehaved
with you? How has the government proved to be fascist, violent, crude,
primitive, undemocratic...?"</p><p>They should have asked us -- because we have suffered.</p><p>But the press is either in the hands of the church or in the hands of
a political party, or in the hands of the government, or in the hands of
rich people.</p><p>The man who came first into the conflict was the ex-vice-president
Rockefeller -</p><p>-</p><p>because he was planning that the whole of Oregon should become a
federal state. The federal government owns half of the land of Oregon,
and their desire was to have all of the land in Oregon to create
shelters in case of a nuclear war. And Oregon is perfectly the right
place -- not very populated, could easily be converted into a vast
shelter in case of nuclear war.</p><p>When we entered the state, the first person who became annoyed was
Rockefeller --</p><p>because now that one hundred and twenty-six square miles could in no
way become federal land.</p><p>It was he who said in a press conference that, "This commune is an
independent country within a country, and this cannot be tolerated."</p><p>If they had asked us... It was a simple thing. They could have given
us land somewhere else, we would have moved the commune. Or from the
very beginning they could have told us, "We are ready to give you
another piece of land." There was no problem; to us it was the same.</p><p>But these people have faces of one kind, they say one thing, and they
do something else.</p><p>And they are thinking still something else -- you never know exactly
what is in their minds, what they are doing, what their purpose is.</p><p>They accepted our right to be a city -- and it was accepted by the
court, three</p><p>judges.</p><p>One judge was against us, was a fanatic Christian. But seeing that
two of the judges were ready -- and his being against us would be
useless, he also signed, and we became a city.</p><p>Now that was the most difficult thing for them to swallow: that
against the president, against the whole government, we won the case and
we became a city.</p><p>You will be surprised, in the twentieth century.… The one judge who
was in our favor was a Mormon. They are very good people, a sect of
Christians, but very honest and sincere. And they have suffered very
much in America at the hands of other Christians because of certain of
their ideologies.…</p><p>One idea they have is that the head of the Mormons is in direct
contact with God, with no pope, no mediator in between. The Mormon head
has a direct communication line with God. This is not acceptable to
Christians -- you are bypassing the pope.</p><p>They killed the first Mormon founder, and because they killed him
they consolidated the Mormons, and they had to give them a city. The
same story was being repeated again, so they became afraid. Now Mormons
have a city -- one of the most beautiful in America --</p><p>Salt Lake City.</p><p>This one judge was a Mormon. And a trick was played: the head of the
Mormons informed him that he had been chosen by God to resign from his
post and go to Nigeria to serve humanity.</p><p>I informed that judge that, "This is simple politics. They want to
remove you from the post because when you are removed... One person is
against us, one person is half-half --</p><p>he will be on the side of whoever is in power. It was because of you
and your sincerity, your fairness that we got the city. Now you are
leaving us in the dumps!"</p><p>And what a stupid idea. Billions of people in the world, and God has
chosen this poor man to resign from his post and go to Nigeria for one
year. But they are</p><p>such simple people that they believed that it was God's order and
they could not go against it.</p><p>So he resigned, and immediately they appointed a fanatic
Christian.</p><p>The same court that had given us the sanction to be a city, after six
months denied that we were a city.</p><p>And the simple trick was that they removed the man who would not do
anything wrong, and replaced him with a man who was an absolutely
fanatical Christian. They completely forgot their own laws, their own
constitution, and they did everything against their constitution.</p><p>For two years continuously there was a rumor that they were going to
arrest me, but they would not dare to enter the campus of the commune
for the simple reason that they knew that unless they killed five
thousand sannyasins they would not be able to arrest me. And they were
not ready to take that risk -- killing five thousand people, most of
them Americans, would condemn their democracy forever.</p><p>They wanted me in some way to be out of the commune so they could
find me alone.</p><p>That's why they waited for two years.</p><p>And we were hearing the rumor continuously, so by and by it became
accepted that this was just a rumor, they didn't have the courage.</p><p>They had their National Guard just twenty miles away in the American
town, every day collecting more and more army forces, so that if there
was a need they could be ready to kill five thousand people.</p><p>But once they could get me out of the commune, things became easy for
them.</p><p>Without any arrest warrant, they arrested me and five sannyasins who
were with me. That is absolutely illegal. They could not even show the
cause; not even for three days in court could they prove anything to
show why they had arrested me.</p><p>Still they would not set bail.</p><p>These are the facts and figures. The government was pressuring the
magistrate: "If you want to be promoted to federal judge, don't give
this man bail." So all five sannyasins were given bail; only I was
retained.</p><p>And the government attorney said in the court, "We have not been able
to prove any charge; still, the government asks that bail should not be
granted for this man because he is very intelligent" -- I heard for the
first time that to be intelligent is criminal -- "and he has thousands
of friends."</p><p>I had never thought that these things were enough to be a criminal;
if that is enough to be a criminal, then Jesus Christ must be the
greatest criminal in the world -- because half of the world is
Christian. And thirdly, that I had resources enough that I could jump
bail --</p><p>even if it were ten million dollars' bail, I could jump it.</p><p>And this shows the poverty and the weakness The greatest power of the
world</p><p>-- you have all your armies and all your nuclear weapons and all your
police forces, and you cannot manage to prevent a man from crossing the
country.… Then all your power is impotent.</p><p>But the reality was that the woman magistrate was not interested in
anything else, she was interested in becoming a federal judge.</p><p>Even the jailer did not think that I would go back to jail, he
thought that there would be no reason -- "They don't have an arrest
warrant, they don't have any cause, so you will be released." So he
brought my clothes and everything in his car so that "I can free you
direct from court; there is no need to come back to the jail."</p><p>When he had to take me back, he was annoyed. He said, "In my whole
life I have not seen such unfairness. The attorney could not prove --
and he accepts that he has not been able to prove in three days of
continuous arguing -- anything against this man. Still the government
wants "</p><p>Who is the government? The government was only a part in the
case.</p><p>And against an individual, the government forces the magistrate --
bribes, blackmails.…</p><p>The jailer told me, "The reality is that that woman has been told
that if she gives you bail</p><p>-- which is your right -- she will not be promoted to federal judge.
And she wants to become a federal judge."</p><p>And within just three days she was a federal judge.</p><p>These journalists should think not only of those who have power, but
also of those who don't have power, and they should be guards against
injustice.</p><p>They had formed one hundred and thirty-six crimes against me -- a man
who never leaves the house. I have not gone out of this house for three
months, not even into the garden; how can I manage one hundred and
thirty-six crimes?</p><p>But the government attorneys told my attorneys, "If you don't accept
at least two crimes, then Bhagwan's life will be in danger." That was
the last blackmail. "If you want to put his life in danger, you can go
for trial" -- this is just when the court case was going to start, five
minutes before. "It is better you accept and convince Bhagwan to accept
any two counts" -- just to save the government's face, so that they can
be right: I must have committed a crime, because I have accepted. And
the threat was, "If you don't accept, then bail will be cancelled and
the case can go on for ten to twenty years -- it is in the hands of the
government. And there is every risk for the life of Bhagwan. So if you
want to save him, you try some way to convince him to accept."</p><p>My attorneys came with tears in their eyes, and they said, "We have
never seen such blackmail -- and the blackmail is being done by the
government -- a clearcut threat. So you accept two counts. And they
don't want you to be in America more than fifteen minutes longer. Accept
two of the charges and your plane is ready at the airport, you
immediately move out of America, and for five years you cannot
re-enter." My whole idea was to refuse.</p><p>But I looked at my attorneys and I looked at my sannyasins all over
the world...</p><p>And I had heard that a few sannyasins were not even eating. For the
twelve days I had been in jail, a few sannyasins had not been eating at
all, they were fasting.</p><p>And I am not a rigid man. And I am not a serious man either.</p><p>So I said, "There is no problem. Don't be worried -- I accept. And
outside the court, just in front of the courthouse, I will announce to
the world press that this is blackmail."</p><p>And it was true that they were ready to kill me, because as I reached
the jail to pick up my things, they had planted a bomb under my chair.
It did not explode because it was a time bomb.</p><p>And I reached there early -- because I had accepted immediately. I
said, "There is no point." I said, "Whatever crimes they want, I have
committed. I don't even need to know what those crimes are." So within
five minutes the case was over.</p><p>They were thinking I would reach there nearabout five, and I reached
there just nearabout one o'clock. So the timing was not right. And as I
left the jail, they had to remove the bomb. And they have to accept it
-- now, in jail nobody can put a bomb except for the government, nobody
else can reach there.</p><p>The American jail... first you have to pass three big gates, which
are all automatic, electric gates. You cannot open them, they open only
with remote control buttons. When one gate opens, the other two remain
closed. And the second opens only when the first is closed. After three
gates, then there are offices.</p><p>And the room where my clothes were to be given to me was in the most
interior part of the building. It would be impossible for anybody from
the outside to reach there and plant a bomb.</p><p>The bomb was planted by the government. They must have thought that
if I refused to accept the crimes, then it would be better to finish me
rather than carry on for years with a case which they were going to lose
-- because they don't have any evidence, they don't have any proof.</p><p>All those one hundred and thirty-six crimes are their imagination,
and nothing else -- and this has been accepted by the attorney general
just now, a few days ago.</p><p>In a press conference, he was asked, "Why has Bhagwan not been put
into jail?"</p><p>And he said, "Because he has not committed any crime, and we don't
have any proof of any crime."</p><p>This same man was standing in court with the list of one hundred and
thirty-six crimes.</p><p>And this man is the right-hand man of president Ronald Reagan; they
are boyhood friends, they were both actors in Hollywood. And when Reagan
became president he called him and made him the attorney general of
America; now he is the highest legal authority in America. So it is not
possible that whatever he is doing is not known to Ronald Reagan.</p><p>It is a conspiracy in the White House.</p><p>Journalists should gather a little courage, and when they start
writing stories about facts and figures they should look at the other
side also. Just put both sides; don't give your judgment. Let the people
decide.</p><p>And truth has a quality of its own: if both sides are placed before
you without any prejudice, you will be able to figure out what is true
and what is false.</p><p>And it has helped the whole movement around the world. Those whose
trust was forced, whose love was managed, naturally have to fall out of
my world, from my people.</p><p>But it has been a fire test for those who really love and trust me.
Their trust has become stronger, their love has become deeper. And
thousands of new people have come into the movement. Seeing that against
a single man... the whole world and the whole worlds'</p><p>governments are against him -- it is not possible that the man can be
wrong.</p><p>Otherwise, there is no need for so many governments to be against me.
They can simply refute me, their theologians can refute me, their legal
systems can prove me wrong.</p><p>Because they cannot do anything, now they have come down to the
lowest. Ronald Reagan and the people who are cooperating with him have
sunk to the status of terrorists.</p><p>Now, putting a bomb against a man who is under your protection in the
jail -- this is pure inhumanity.</p><p>And existence will not tolerate it, existence will not forgive it,
existence will not forget it.</p><p>And you will see every day these people disappearing from the
scene.</p><p>Truth has to wait, but not to wait forever. It is patient, it is
patient because it knows its victory is certain.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_diamond_sutra/part1/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: That Realm of Nirvana</span>

I FEEL SO MUCH LOVE FOR YOU! IS THIS ENOUGH?\nDeva Bhasha, love is never enough. There are mysteries in existence which don’t have any limitation. Love is the closest experience to understanding all those mysteries – because as far as the mind is concerned, it imposes limits; it cannot accept anything that is unlimited.\nJust think of the whole universe. The mind can conceive of it as very vast, perhaps the boundaries of it are not available to us, but the mind finds it intrinsically impossible to conceive that there may be no boundaries at all, anywhere.\nThe universe has no boundaries; life has no boundaries.\nAnd love is our closest experience of this unbounded, unlimited pure space, extending and extending and you never come to the point where it is written, “This is the end.”\nBecause of this intrinsic incapacity of the mind, it always inquires, “Is it enough?” It wants it to be enough so that it can create a boundary around it. Anything that can be limited by the mind becomes\nan object. Love is not an object. You cannot put it on the scientist’s table to dissect it, to find out what basic elements it is made of.\nBecause the scientist cannot make love objective, there are only two possibilities for him. If he is authentic and sincere, he will say, “I do not know love,” because his way of knowing is only objective and love cannot be reduced to an object. But if he is not a sincere scientific mind but a fanatic, then rather than accepting his own ignorance he will deny the existence of love itself. He will say it is all imagination, it is all emotion, it is all sentimentality; it is not even worth considering.\nThere is not even a single treatise on love written by any scientist. But that is his general attitude about love, about life, about consciousness – anything that he cannot hold in his hand, he simply denies its very existence. You cannot ask a scientist, “Does beauty exist? Is there something like blissfulness? Is there a possibility of an inner ecstasy?” His answer is going to be consistently “No.” Basically, he denies the inner world of man.\nAnd the most hilarious part is that scientists fall in love, scientists feel hurt if insulted. If there is nobody inside, what does it matter whether somebody insults you, abuses you? And if love is not existential, then no scientist should dare to fall in love. But the scientist is not just a one-dimensional being; science is not his whole life, and cannot be.\nLife contains many dimensions. The most important is the fact, the interiority, of man. And the interiority of man is as infinite as the exterior universe.\nLove is part of the interiority of man; it has no limits. But there are misunderstandings which have to be clarified.\nDeva Bhasha, your question is, “Can you talk about the art of nourishing oneself with love?” There is no art because there is no need of any effort. Love is the nourishment. But humanity has been so confused by its leaders that one does not know the most inner realms of one’s own being. Love is nourishment in itself. The more you love, the more you will find untrodden spaces where love goes on and on spreading around you like an aura.\nBut that kind of love has not been allowed by any culture. They have forced love into a very small tunnel: you can love your wife, your wife can love you; you can love your children, you can love your parents, you can love your friends. And they have made two things so deeply rooted in every human being. One is that love is something very limited – friends, family, children, husband, wife. And the second thing they have insisted is that there are many kinds of love. You love in one way when you love your husband or your wife; then you have to bring another kind of love when you love your children, and another kind of love when you love your elders, your family, your teachers, and then another kind of love for your friends.\nBut the truth is, love cannot be categorized the way it has been categorized throughout the whole history of mankind. There were reasons for them to categorize it but their reasons are ugly and inhuman, because in this categorization they killed love.\nEither you can have a loving heart... it has nothing to do with who you are loving; the emphasis of existence is that you are loving. It has not to be directed towards a certain person, because that is\naccepting that if someone is not part of the direction in which you are forcing your love to move, you become indifferent to them; you become even unloving to them. There are possibilities that you may even become hateful to them.\nThe reason why all the cultures have insisted on categorization is because they have been very much afraid of love, is because if there is existential love, then it does not know boundaries – then you cannot put Hindus against Mohammedans, then you cannot put Protestants against Catholics. Then you cannot draw a line saying that you cannot love this person because he is Jewish, Chinese. The leaders of the world wanted to divide the world, but to divide the world they have to do the basic division which is of love. Love is only for our people.\nAnd it has to be insisted so deeply in your unconscious that in wars, in riots, when you kill other people who don’t belong to your clan or to your country or your tribe, you don’t feel anything. It is simply the way things are. A German killing an Italian will not think, “I don’t have any personal enmity with him, and just as my wife will be waiting for me and my old mother may be praying for me and my children will be hoping that soon I will be back home, the person I am killing is in the same situation. He also has a wife, he also has old parents, he also has children, and they are waiting for him to come back. I don’t have any reason to kill him; neither has he any reason to kill me, except that some idiotic politicians are not satisfied with the power they have. They want more power. They want to be world conquerors.”\nBecause of this lust for power, love has been completely destroyed. Both cannot exist together. I want it to be absolutely clear to you:\nLust for power and the beauty of love cannot exist together.\nBut religions would like you only to love people of your own religion – others are foreigners. Countries would like you to love only the people who live in that country. And you can see, there are divisions upon divisions.\nIndia became independent in 1947. I was very young, but I had kept my eyes clear and uncontaminated by the older generation. From my very childhood I have insisted on having my own insight, my own intelligence, and I don’t want to borrow any knowledge from anybody.\nMy whole family was involved in the struggle for the freedom of the country. Everybody had been in jail. Although I was never in jail because of the liberation movement, I suffered as much as one can suffer, because all the earning males were forced into jails and the family was left without any source of earning.\nI asked my father, “Are you aware that once you are liberated from the British empire... and it is going to happen, because now Britain is burdened. They have exploited the land to the maximum; now the situation has reversed – they have to help the country to survive. It is better for them to escape from here and get rid of a burden which has become absolutely unnecessary.” They were not here to serve the people, they were here to exploit. And that’s exactly what happened.\nThe revolution happened in 1942 without any effect. It was quashed completely within nine days, and with those nine days all hope of freedom disappeared. But suddenly, out of the blue, Britain decided in 1947 to make the country free.\nI told my father, “Don’t think that your freedom movement has succeeded. Between the freedom movement and the actual coming of freedom there is a five-year gap. This is not logical. You are being given freedom because now you have become a burden and a trouble, just your existence.”\nAnd I have come to know that researchers, looking into the whole history of the British Parliament and their decisions, found out that the British Prime Minister Attlee sent Mountbatten with the message: “Do it as quickly as possible.” He had given him a set time, that, “by 1948 we should get rid of this burden.”\nMountbatten proved even more efficient. He managed it one year earlier. But I told my father, “You have been fighting, not knowing that once this country is free it will start having new fights, within itself.”\nNow Mohammedans have taken Pakistan – it was part and parcel of the freedom, because Mohammedans refused to live with the Hindus. They had lived together for almost fourteen hundred years and there was no problem. In my childhood I have participated in Mohammedan celebrations; Mohammedans were participating in Hindu marriages, Hindu celebrations. There was no question of fight, because everybody was fighting the British empire. Once the British empire was leaving, suddenly the Mohammedans and Hindus became alert – a new division. They declared that they could not live together because their religions are different. Mohammedans became adamant: “Either the British empire remains... we can risk freedom, but we cannot live with Hindus in an independent country because they are in the majority. They will rule, and Mohammedans don’t have any chance of ruling.”\nThe situation became so ugly that there were only two alternatives. Either accept the slavery – which the British empire was not ready to continue – or to accept the division. The division was accepted; the country was divided into two parts. The Mohammedan part became Pakistan. But they were not aware, and neither were Indians aware that the Mohammedans got two parts – one part in the east, Punjab and Sindh, where they were in the majority, and another part far away, thousands of miles away in Bengal. Half of Bengal was Mohammedan.\nSo Pakistan became a strange country, and immediately... both parts were Mohammedan but Bengalis saw that they were being dominated by the Punjabi Mohammedans. The shift away from the division of religions was immediate; now it became a question of language. Bengali Mohammedans speak Bengali; the Punjabi speaks Punjabi. Now they forgot completely that they were together in the fight to gain Pakistan.\nFinally, the Bengalis separated from Pakistan and created a new country, Bangladesh. The distance was so great that it was impossible for Pakistan to keep control over it. But the same situation goes on happening every day.\nForty years ago the constitution decided that Hindi should be the national language. But it has not been implemented because in India there are thirty languages. Taken as a whole the Hindi- speaking people are the majority, but if those twenty-nine languages are against it, then they are in the majority. Each single language is not capable of fighting against Hindi, but those twenty-nine languages together are a tremendous force. Now you cannot believe it – that they are all Hindus, and they have been killing other Hindus because they speak different languages! It is not a question\nthat you can give all these thirty languages the status of a national language. Then suddenly you will find... for example Hindi is spoken in one way in one state, a slightly different way in another state. And there are five states – soon they will be fighting: “Our Hindi is the RIGHT Hindi and the others are only distortions.”\nMan has been trained to cut humanity into so many pieces on any excuse: religion, country, language, color. But the basic root is in teaching human beings that love is a limited phenomenon, and secondly, that love has varieties.\nI am trying to say to you that love has no varieties. It may have different expressions – certainly the love between husband and wife will have a different expression than the love between the couple and their children. It will have a different expression, but the expression does not change the quality. It is the same love.\nAnd its center is not the other – that’s how we have been taught, that the center of love is the other: you love somebody. The emphasis has to be completely changed. It is not a question of loving somebody, it is a question of being a loving human being. Love should not have an address; it should be simply a radiation of your being. Whoever comes in contact with you will find the immensely nourishing energy of love.\nYou are saying, “I feel so much love for you.” I would like you to feel the same love for the whole existence – for the trees and for the birds and for the oceans and for the stars. Your love should not be confined. You can love me as much as you want, but that does not mean that I should become the only object of your love. Then it is not nourishing. On the contrary, it starts becoming a poisoning force.\nLove is a nourishing force if it spreads all around just the way the sun rises, and it showers its light, its rays, to all the trees without any discrimination. Not thinking that “this is just a poor marigold, just a little bit less will do. This is a beautiful rose, a little more. This is a lotus, shower as much as you can.” No, the sunlight showers over the whole planet without any discrimination.\nYour love should become subjective, not objective. It should become a radiation, from the center of your being to all directions. Then it is nourishing and then it has a certain quality which can only be called divine.\nOur so-called love only creates jealousy, only creates conflict, only creates two people living in intimate enmity, judging, looking, watching. Just look on the road and you can decide without asking anybody whether the couples who are walking together are husband and wives, or just boyfriends and girlfriends. I have never seen a husband and wife together smiling. What kind of love is this? Yes, they are both detecting each otherThe husband cannot look around if a beautiful woman\npasses by. Just looking at that beautiful woman can create so much harassment that it is not worth it.\nWhat kind of society have you created? Is it human? It is absolutely human that if a beautiful woman passes by, the husband should tell his wife, “Look, a beautiful woman!” Beauty should not be made a question of jealousy or comparison. You can say that the roseflower is beautiful and your husband or your wife will not object to it, because you can’t have any relationship with it.\nJust the other day I was listening to a song of one of the most beautiful singers of India. The meaning of the song is, “I was just passing by here and I thought just to say hello to you, although I know if my wife comes to know about it, this hello is going to be very dangerous. Because her insistence is, ‘You should not see anybody else except me. Your whole love is monopolized by me.’” And the singer says – his name is Jagjit Singh – “That is her insistence. But my hobby is that wherever there is beauty, I should at least be respectful to it.”\nWe have created an idea of love as a possession. And all kinds of possessions ultimately turn into poisons. One should live a life non-possessive, available, open, respectful. There is so much beauty around you and so many different ways the beauty is expressing itself; to confine you is to destroy you.\nAnd remember: anyone who confines you, you are not going to be loving to that person. Husbands don’t love their wives, wives don’t love their husbands. How can a wife love a husband who has confined her infinite capacity of radiating love, who has forced her to accept that he is the only one that all her love should be directed to? This is insulting and this is against nature, against existence.\nBut religions have been doing everything to destroy the individuality of man. It seems to be that without destroying man, they cannot exist. Either man can exist in his dignity or your so-called churches and popes and priests can exist, with great power.\nJust the other day... I could not believe it, but I have to believe because it is a fact. Anando brought me the news that the Catholic church has decided that there will not be any other kind of music in the churches than that which is absolutely devoted to the church. Even in weddings – and it has been going on for centuries; it is not something new. Even the classical music and the geniuses of the past are no longer allowed in the church. In a church wedding the music should be only what is approved by the church, and its function should be religious – no other music.\nWhy are these people afraid of people becoming light, rejoicing, enjoying? They have a certain investment in your misery. The more miserable you are, the better, because only the miserable people go to the churches. Only the miserable people are in the bondage of the past. Only the miserable people are under the domination of the dead.\nA man who is alive can be alive only if he is allowed total expression of his individuality.\nWho are these people to decide? On what authority do these people go on deciding things for millions of people? A very strange strategy has been used. First they invented God, then they invented his son Jesus Christ, and now they have imposed themselves as his representatives. Only they have the direct line to God.\nA few months ago the Catholic church has prohibited that anybody should confess to God directly. He has to confess to the priest, everything through the right channel. Then the priest will inform Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ will persuade God the Father – “Let this poor man be freed from his sin.” But directly you cannot confess to God. And not a single Catholic in the whole world revolted against the idea.\nAt least man should be given the freedom to be in direct relationship with existence.\nBut the business point is clear: unless you confess to the priest, the priest cannot punish you. And what is the punishment? Five dollars, ten dollars... and I don’t understand how these dollars reach to Jesus Christ. And then he gives the bribe to God the Father: “Just forgive this man, he is a good man. Just look, he has sent ten dollars.” Those ten dollars disappear in the pocket of the priest. They have nothing to do with Jesus Christ or with God.\nI have heard that one rabbi and one bishop were very friendly. The friendship had arisen because both were golf lovers, and they decided that on the next Sunday they were going to the golf club.\nThe rabbi waited and waited outside, but it was getting late so he entered the church. The bishop was in the confession booth – it is a small room, partitioned. On one side sits the bishop with a small window; on the other side stands the confessor. The strategy is that the confessor should not be made embarrassed; his face should not be seen, so that he can confess wholeheartedly because unless he confesses wholeheartedly he is not going to be contributing dollars wholeheartedly either.\nThe rabbi entered the booth and said to the bishop, “We are going to be late.”\nThe bishop said, “I am doing everything as quickly as possible, but there is still a queue.”\nThe rabbi said, “I don’t know what this confession is, just let me see what you are doing. And then you can get ready while I function in your place, because nobody can see from the other side.”\nThe bishop said, “It is very simple; you just watch.” One man came and he said, “I have committed a rape.”\nThe bishop said, “Don’t be worried. Just contribute ten dollars to the charity box and I will pray for you.”\nThe rabbi said, “It is very simple. Now you go and get ready.” He sat in the bishop’s chair. Another man came and he said, “I have committed two rapes this week.”\nThe rabbi said, “My son, don’t be worried. Thirty dollars.”\nThe man said, “Thirty dollars? Has the rate increased? Just in front of me, for one rape you asked ten dollars.”\nThe rabbi said, “Don’t be worried. You just put thirty dollars in the box – ten dollars are in advance.”\nThese are the people who have destroyed everything that is beautiful in man. But they are exploiting and they will cling to their exploitation to the very last. Otherwise, there is no reason for all these organized religions to exist.\nEach individual should have a direct contact with the universe, its beauty, its tremendous glory – which creates without any effort a gratitude, a prayer, perhaps a song, a dance. If we can remove all these organized religions from the world, organized nations from the world, and allow each individual his dignity and respect, there will be immense love, immense respect, immense understanding. We\ncan change this ugly world which has been created by the past, into a beautiful garden where everyone can rise to his potential height, can shower his flowers and can release his fragrance.\nI stand for the individual.\nAll organizations have proved criminal. There is no need of any organization either in the name of politics or in the name of religion or in any other name. And the world will be an ocean of love, an ocean of beauty.\nBut this needs, Deva Bhasha, a tremendous courage to revolt and assert your individuality, whatever the consequences. It is long enough that we have been exploited, sucked, destroyed. And the end result is this miserable world – where once in a while perhaps you can smile, but even that smile does not come from your deepest core; where once in awhile you can love, but even that love is surrounded by all kinds of fears. Nothing in you has been left in freedom. And the people who have done this greatest crime are the people you worship. That makes it more difficult to take humanity out of their clutches.\nYou have to learn to love yourself first, to respect yourself first. And then certainly it will give you tremendous nourishment and it will start spreading around you.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nWHY DOES SPONTANEITY CREATE SO MUCH FEAR IN ME?\nHAVING NO STRUCTURE FEELS LIKE A DEATH. HOW CAN I TURN THIS FEAR INTO A LET-GO, A WELCOME, A REJOICING?\nAnand Anupam, perhaps you are not aware that you are again asking for another structure. I will read your question so that you can become conscious of what you are asking:\n“Why does spontaneity create so much fear in me?” It creates fear in everybody, because spontaneity means you are taking the responsibility for your act, whatever it may be. If you rely on the conditionings you have been given by your parents, by your teachers, professors, priests, leaders, and instead of being spontaneous just act out of your past conditioning, there is no fear. Because you know you are not alone; you know your action is approved.\nThe fear arises when you find yourself alone and you are doing something which goes against the whole training. You know you are revolting; you are going against your parents, you are going against the whole heritage of humanity. The weight of the past is so big and huge, so Himalayan, and you seem to be such a small individual, afraid of going against it. You may be crushed.\nIn my childhood I loved having hair as long as possible. My father had a shop and the house together, and I used to move in and out through his shop. He felt very embarrassed because people asked him, “Whose girl is this?” Such long hair in India is allowed only to the girls, and naturally he felt embarrassed and angry that I was creating every day some trouble. Finally he became so angry that he took his scissors, caught hold of me and cut my hair.\nI said, “You can cut my hair but remember, I am not going to leave it at that.” He said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “You will see tomorrow.”\nAnd I went just on the other side of the road, where all the hair-cutting salons were. I had a friend, an old opium addict. I loved the man, because sometimes he would cut half somebody’s mustache and say, “Wait, I have to go somewhere.” And he would be gone for hours, and the man would be caught because he could not leave with the half mustache. Sometimes people would ask him for a shave and he would shave their heads. And by the time they became aware, he had already done some work – now there is no point in preventing him. And he was such a nice man; he would say, “There is no need to worry – if you don’t like it, don’t pay me anything.”\nI used to sit in his small salon discussing with him, because it was a joy. He used to come up with really original ideas. One day he told me, “If all the opium addicts of India are organized, we can take over the whole country.”\nI said, “The idea is very good.”\nHe said, “But you will have to help, because these opium addicts don’t listen to anybody.”\nI said, “I will try to contact first all the opium addicts in this town. Let us create one small organization here. If it succeeds in taking over the municipal corporation...”\nSo I went to him, because he was the only man who could have done this. In India a child’s head is completely shaved only if his father dies. So I told him, “I am tired of this long hair. You simply shave my head completely clean.”\nFor a moment he hesitated. He said, “Your father will be very angry, I am telling you!”\nI said, “You don’t be worried. It is my responsibility. And you are the only man of guts; no other barber is going to cut my hair.”\nSo he said okay. He finished all my hair and I entered my father’s shop. Looking at me, immediately his customers asked, “What happened to this poor boy? His father has died?”\nNow it was even more embarrassing for him to admit, “I am the father.” He came to me inside the house and he said, “This is too much.”\nI said, “I have warned you. Whenever I do anything I do it totally. From now onwards if you interfere with me, remember, I can move to the other extreme.”\nPeople from the neighborhood started coming to inquire... and when they saw my father they said, “What is the matter? You are alive? And I have seen with my own eyes that your son is completely shaved.”\nFrom my school, my teachers, my headmaster, seeing that my father must have died were very sorry. They told me, “We are going to your house to express our sadness and our mourning. Your father was a good man.” I allowed them to go, and when they would see my father sitting there they were in such a strange situation – what to do? because it had never happened.\nAnd my father would ask, “Why have you come? There must be some reason.”\nThey said, “There was... but your son is so strange that we were telling him, ‘He was a good man’ and he did not even tell us that you were still alive.” That was the last time he interfered with me. He knew perfectly well that it was going to be dangerous.\nSpontaneity means you are acting in the moment – not reacting, but acting. That is the difference between those two words. When you react it comes from your past accumulation of knowledge, experience. But when you respond, it is a pure act out of your present consciousness – not from memory. These are two different sources within you. Memory is comfortable, because everybody will appreciate that you are doing the right thing because they also have the same memory. But if you act on your own, then you are taking a risk. It may not fit. Most probably it is not going to fit with the structure which has been created around you. Hence, fear arises.\nBut I would say to you, it is better to suffer fear rather than remain a slave of those who had no idea in what situations you are going to be. They have given you fixed ideas, answers to questions and they don’t know in what form the question is going to arise in your life.\nFive thousand years ago, they wrote RIG VEDA, and Hindus are still following the structure. It is no longer relevant. But the same is the situation everywhere. Mohammed allowed Mohammedans to have four wives. It was perfectly right at that moment because in Arabia the proportion was exactly one man and four wives, because men were continuously being killed. They were continuously fighting; war was their life. They would rape the woman, but they would not kill her. That was not according to their culture, to kill a woman. So there were four times more women than men and naturally it was creating a very difficult situation. If three women remained unmarried, there was going to be great prostitution, corruption of all kinds. To avoid the situation, Mohammed suggested that every man marries four women. It was perfectly right in Saudi Arabia fourteen hundred years ago, but they are doing the same in India even today.\nNow India wants fewer people. It is already past the limit; it has never been so crowded in the whole of history. In 1947, when India became independent, the population was four hundred million, and just in forty years the population has gone to nine hundred million. By the end of this century it is going beyond one billion. For the first time India will have a greater population than China. But Mohammedans insist that it is their religion and the government cannot interfere with their religion.\nIt is difficult, because in India the proportion of men and women is almost equal. They go on raping women who are not Mohammedans; and once a woman, whether raped or not, has been kept in a Mohammedan house – Hindus are following another tradition five thousand years old – she has fallen, she is no longer acceptable. Neither her parents will allow her into the house nor her own husband. She has to become a Mohammedan or commit suicide.\nAnd when Mohammedans go on marrying four women, naturally they produce four times more people than Hindus. Soon this country will have more Mohammedans than Hindus. Already, you will\nbe surprised to know, India has the largest Mohammedan population in the whole world. There are Mohammedan countries – Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan – but no country has a greater Mohammedan population than India. And the reason is simple, because in those countries there are only Mohammedans and the proportion between men and women is equal. It is very difficult in a Mohammedan country to find four women. What will happen to the three other men whose wives you have taken? So it is only in India where they have a good pasture around to get more and more women and more and more children.\nTo respond to the situation that is facing you needs intelligence, not memory; needs awareness, not your past heritage. So even though it creates fear, which is natural, decide to be spontaneous in spite of all the fears. Soon those fears will disappear.\nIt is only a question of acting out of spontaneity more and more, and then you will see your individuality becoming more integrated, more solid, freer from all the chains that the past has put around you. The fear will disappear, but it will take a little time. If you listen to the fear you will never be able to gain your dignity as an individual.\nEven trees have their individuality. Every animal has his own individuality. It is simply shameful that man has lost his individuality. So in spite of all your fears, take the risk. Be courageous and act according to your own consciousness. And soon you will see that whenever you act spontaneously you are right, because you are answering the situation directly.\nBut you are asking, “Having no structure feels like a death.” There is no harm. Die! Your life is not much more valuable. Rather than be a prisoner of all the dead, it is better to die spontaneously. At least you will have the dignity to say, “At one point I am at least free from the whole past and all the prisons of religion, nation, race, color.”\nThen you are asking, “How can I turn this fear into a let-go?” Do you understand? “How” means again filling your memory with a new structure. But no structure can be spontaneous. You cannot know what is going to happen the next moment. You cannot conceive of what tomorrow is going to bring to you. So whatever structure you make, whatever homework you do, is going to be irrelevant to the situation.\nI have never done any homework. In my schools, colleges, universities, I made it absolutely clear to all my teachers and professors, “Never ask for any homework from me.”\nAnd they said, “But this is so strange, nobody has ever said such a thing.”\nI said, “I don’t care whether anybody has said such a thing or not. One thing is certain: you can answer me, you can question me, you can do anything you want – I will be spontaneous, I will not be prepared.”\nHomework is preparation; you have already prepared everything. In my final examinations of post- graduation, the professors who loved me very much were so afraid, because I was not preparing anything for the examination. I was still reading whatever I wanted to read in the library. It had no concern with the examination. I was asking questions in the classes and one professor had to say to me, “Now only one month is left, and you should not bring such questions which have no relevance to your examination.”\nI said, “I am not here to be worried about an examination which is going to happen one month later. My concern is this moment, and this is my question.”\nOne of my professors was so concerned that he gave me one of the questionnaires, telling me, “I have made this so that you can at least be ready for these five questions. They are going to be asked because I am the composer of the paper.”\nWithout reading it, I threw it away and I said, “You should not insult me in this way. I want to live life unprepared. Whether I fail or succeed, it doesn’t matter.”\nHe used to come to my hostel room just fifteen minutes before the examination was going to commence. Everybody had gone into the examination hall. He would pick me in his car and tell me, “Unless you enter the examination hall, I cannot feel at ease. I am always afraid you may be sleeping, you may be discussing things which have nothing to do with the examination, you may be reading things.” And he used to say to the superintendent of the examination, “Don’t let him out before three hours.”\nI used to answer those questions in one hour or one and a half hours. The superintendent would say, “I am sorry but I have promised your professor that I will not allow you to leave.”\nI said, “It is up to you. If you don’t allow me to go out... has he told you that I cannot even sleep here?”\nHe said, “He has not said anything about sleep.”\nI said, “That’s okay. You take this paper; I am finished with it. And for one and a half hours let me rest.”\nWhen my professor came to know, he said, “It is very impossible to deal with you. I prevented you from going out but you managed to go out! And how can you answer those five questions in three hours? Others find that they have answered only four; somebody has answered only three.”\nI said, “They are prepared people. They have done so much preparation that they want to impress the examiner with how much they are informed. I am absolutely uninformed. Sometimes I simply write one sentence as an answer and sometimes I ask another question because I cannot agree that the question is right. But I am absolutely free. I have no preparation.”\nOne professor had asked the question, “Can you define Indian philosophy?” And I simply answered him that “There is no such thing as Indian philosophy so the question of defining it does not arise. There is Western philosophy because the very word philosophy means a search for knowledge, a search for wisdom, a love for wisdom.” In India we don’t have any word which can be translated as philosophy.…\nThe Indian word is darshan and its approach is totally different. It means an inquiry to see the truth. Darshan means seeing. It is not a question of thinking. A blind man can think about the light and can be a great philosopher, can propose hypotheses about light. In India there has never existed anything like philosophy. What has existed is seeing. We want to see the light, we don’t want to philosophize about it.\nJust by coincidence that paper was sent to one very eccentric retired professor, Dr. Ranade of Allahabad. Basically he belonged to Poona. And he gave me ninety-nine percent out of one hundred, with a note to the vice-chancellor saying that “I always wanted somebody to answer spontaneously, and I always wanted somebody to answer as sharply as possible.” He had never given a first class to anybody else in his whole life. With him, even to pass was a difficult job. But he wrote the note and he also wrote, “What I am writing you should show to the student. I loved his answers and I loved the way he made me aware that Western philosophy is one thing and there is no equivalent in India for it.”\nHe has written books on Indian philosophy and he said in his note, “I am too old now to change it, but your point is absolutely right. We don’t have anything similar to what has happened in the West.”\nIt is because of this difference that Western philosophy has never come to meditation. It was always contemplation. And the Indian counterpart has never bothered about thinking, contemplation, concentration; its whole concern is meditation. In fact they are two such different directions that a single word cannot describe both.\nMy professor was amazed. He said, “I was thinking you were going to fail, you were so unprepared.”\nI said, “Your whole idea is preparation and my whole idea is to be simply spontaneous.” I got the gold medal, topped the whole university, shocking everybody. And as I came out of the auditorium I threw that gold medal into the well. A professor was standing by my side. He said, “What are you doing?”\nI said, “I have nothing to do with gold, and I don’t want to be appreciated as topping the whole university. I would love it if somebody appreciated that spontaneity has its own beauty, freshness. Whether it fails or succeeds is irrelevant.”\nYou should not ask, “How can I turn this fear into a let-go?” Because whatever I say to you will be your structure again.\nJust be simple.\nWhenever you find a situation, act!\nPut the fear aside and rejoice in the spontaneous response. It is only a question of a few times and you will find the fear has disappeared. Because the spontaneous response gives you such a joy, such an opening of the heart, such freshness... as if you have just taken a shower. But don’t ask for any strategy – “How to be spontaneous” – because how simply means a structure.\nJust be spontaneous. Don’t ask how.\nTry it. Without knowing, innocently, respond to a situation and you will learn out of it the great experience of let-go. And you will rejoice because you have attained your freedom from all kinds of fears.\nIn my childhood I had a friend whose father was a magician. They had a very good business – the business was that they had a few snakes. Being continually in their house, slowly I learned that\nninety-seven percent of snakes don’t have any poison. Only three percent of snakes have poison, and only one percent, the cobra, is very dangerous. Once the cobra bites you it is very difficult to save you. Death is almost certain. But the snakes all look alike.\nThe father used to have non-poisonous snakes, and he would send his son – who was my friend, and I accompanied him many times – to somebody’s house. There we would leave two or three snakes around, and then the father would come with his special musical instrument that was used for snakes. He would announce, “If anybody has snakes in his house, I can catch them.” As he started playing on his instrument, the snakes that we had left around the house would start coming, and for that service the housekeeper had to pay. He would say, “It is very good of you – once in a while you should come back, because we were not aware that there were snakes in our garden.”\nKnowing that there are snakes which don’t have any poison, I would enter into my class with a snake in my pocket. I would just leave it on the table of the teacher, and he would stand on his chair and shout, “Save me!” The other students are running out... who is going to save him except me? And I would tell him, “I will save you, but remember that I have saved your life. You should not be nasty with me. Promise?” And with that snake sitting on his table, you could have taken any kind of promise.\nFinally it was reported to the principal that a strange thing was going on. But a principal is just the same as anybody else. When he called me, I went there with two snakes. And I left them on his table, and he stood on his chair, and everybody in the whole school was looking through the windows – what is happening? I said, “Now, do you have something to say to me?”\nHe said, “No. Just don’t bring these things in my office!”\nI said, “I have not come on my own, you have called me. Now I cannot go without your promising me that you will not be nasty to me.”\nHe said, “This is strange... but I promise, I will not be nasty to you.” I said, “That’s okay; then I can persuade the snakes.”\nPeople have lived with such fear. Fear always seems to be around them – anything can create fear. And if the man had been a little spontaneous, he could have seen that if I can manage those snakes, certainly there must be some trick and there is no need to be afraid. But the very word snake is enough to trigger all the fears, of centuries of humanity, that you are carrying within you.\nTo my father it was reported, “Now your son is becoming more and more dangerous.” My father said, “I have promised him, just as you have promised, not to interfere. Otherwise he will start bringing those snakes in the house!”\nWhat are your fears? What can you lose? The only thing that you can lose is your life. And that does not belong to you, that belongs to the universe. One day you are going to lose it, so what does it matter? In a week there are only seven days. Either you will lose your life on Monday or on Tuesday... so it is only a question of seven days. But I have never thought for a single moment that I have anything to lose.\nI don’t have anything to lose.\nThat has given me a tremendous freedom to act spontaneously, to act without any fear, to say whatever I want to say – to be against all the governments of the world, to be against all the religions of the world. And I don’t think that even a shadow of fear arises in my heart.\nOn the contrary, the more I hit these idiots the more I rejoice, because according to me they are criminals. According to me they are the greatest calamities that have happened to humanity. There is nothing to fear from these people. There is nothing to be afraid of in the ghosts who are lying in their graves. But everybody is injected with fear from the very beginning, so that his whole blood becomes full of fear. This fearfulness helps all these criminals to dominate you, to destroy you, not to let you live your life of love and blissfulness.\nAs far as my sannyasins are concerned, fear should not be at all a part of their being. The fear exists in the darker corners of your being – bring more light. Bring more consciousness, bring more awareness, and the fear will disappear.\nA lady health inspector, after checking the sanitary conditions in Boccala’s Bakery, summons the proprietor.\n“Listen,” she complains. “One of the bakers back there is throwing the dough against his bare chest to flatten it out for pizzas!”\n“That’s-a not-a so bad-a,” says Boccala. “You should-a be here yesterday when he make-a the doughnuts!”\nThe newlywed Greek couple is in a deep embrace. While kissing and caressing her, he whispers, “My love, now I will put it where nobody else ever has!”\nIn a frightened voice she cries, “No, no! In my ears? Never!”\nWhat is there to fear? There is everything to laugh and there is nothing to fear. Laughter has to be our sword to cut all these heads who have been torturing humanity for centuries.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7963","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/>Om Mani Padme Hum</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20 Life has no boundaries</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7963 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I
FEEL SO MUCH LOVE FOR YOU! IS THIS ENOUGH?</p><p>Deva Bhasha, love is never enough. There are mysteries in existence
which don’t have any limitation. Love is the closest experience to
understanding all those mysteries – because as far as the mind is
concerned, it imposes limits; it cannot accept anything that is
unlimited.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of the whole universe. The mind can conceive of it as very
vast, perhaps the boundaries of it are not available to us, but the mind
finds it intrinsically impossible to conceive that there may be no
boundaries at all, anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe has no boundaries; life has no boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>And love is our closest experience of this unbounded, unlimited pure
space, extending and extending and you never come to the point where it
is written, “This is the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this intrinsic incapacity of the mind, it always inquires,
“Is it enough?” It wants it to be enough so that it can create a
boundary around it. Anything that can be limited by the mind becomes</p><p>an object. Love is not an object. You cannot put it on the
scientist’s table to dissect it, to find out what basic elements it is
made of.</p><p><br></p><p>Because the scientist cannot make love objective, there are only two
possibilities for him. If he is authentic and sincere, he will say, “I
do not know love,” because his way of knowing is only objective and love
cannot be reduced to an object. But if he is not a sincere scientific
mind but a fanatic, then rather than accepting his own ignorance he will
deny the existence of love itself. He will say it is all imagination, it
is all emotion, it is all sentimentality; it is not even worth
considering.</p><p><br></p><p>There is not even a single treatise on love written by any scientist.
But that is his general attitude about love, about life, about
consciousness – anything that he cannot hold in his hand, he simply
denies its very existence. You cannot ask a scientist, “Does beauty
exist? Is there something like blissfulness? Is there a possibility of
an inner ecstasy?” His answer is going to be consistently “No.”
Basically, he denies the inner world of man.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most hilarious part is that scientists fall in love,
scientists feel hurt if insulted. If there is nobody inside, what does
it matter whether somebody insults you, abuses you? And if love is not
existential, then no scientist should dare to fall in love. But the
scientist is not just a one-dimensional being; science is not his whole
life, and cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>Life contains many dimensions. The most important is the fact, the
interiority, of man. And the interiority of man is as infinite as the
exterior universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is part of the interiority of man; it has no limits. But there
are misunderstandings which have to be clarified.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Bhasha, your question is, “Can you talk about the art of
nourishing oneself with love?” There is no art because there is no need
of any effort. Love is the nourishment. But humanity has been so
confused by its leaders that one does not know the most inner realms of
one’s own being. Love is nourishment in itself. The more you love, the
more you will find untrodden spaces where love goes on and on spreading
around you like an aura.</p><p><br></p><p>But that kind of love has not been allowed by any culture. They have
forced love into a very small tunnel: you can love your wife, your wife
can love you; you can love your children, you can love your parents, you
can love your friends. And they have made two things so deeply rooted in
every human being. One is that love is something very limited – friends,
family, children, husband, wife. And the second thing they have insisted
is that there are many kinds of love. You love in one way when you love
your husband or your wife; then you have to bring another kind of love
when you love your children, and another kind of love when you love your
elders, your family, your teachers, and then another kind of love for
your friends.</p><p><br></p><p>But the truth is, love cannot be categorized the way it has been
categorized throughout the whole history of mankind. There were reasons
for them to categorize it but their reasons are ugly and inhuman,
because in this categorization they killed love.</p><p><br></p><p>Either you can have a loving heart... it has nothing to do with who
you are loving; the emphasis of existence is that you are loving. It has
not to be directed towards a certain person, because that is</p><p>accepting that if someone is not part of the direction in which you
are forcing your love to move, you become indifferent to them; you
become even unloving to them. There are possibilities that you may even
become hateful to them.</p><p>The reason why all the cultures have insisted on categorization is
because they have been very much afraid of love, is because if there is
existential love, then it does not know boundaries – then you cannot put
Hindus against Mohammedans, then you cannot put Protestants against
Catholics. Then you cannot draw a line saying that you cannot love this
person because he is Jewish, Chinese. The leaders of the world wanted to
divide the world, but to divide the world they have to do the basic
division which is of love. Love is only for our people.</p><p>And it has to be insisted so deeply in your unconscious that in wars,
in riots, when you kill other people who don’t belong to your clan or to
your country or your tribe, you don’t feel anything. It is simply the
way things are. A German killing an Italian will not think, “I don’t
have any personal enmity with him, and just as my wife will be waiting
for me and my old mother may be praying for me and my children will be
hoping that soon I will be back home, the person I am killing is in the
same situation. He also has a wife, he also has old parents, he also has
children, and they are waiting for him to come back. I don’t have any
reason to kill him; neither has he any reason to kill me, except that
some idiotic politicians are not satisfied with the power they have.
They want more power. They want to be world conquerors.”</p><p>Because of this lust for power, love has been completely destroyed.
Both cannot exist together. I want it to be absolutely clear to you:</p><p>Lust for power and the beauty of love cannot exist together.</p><p><br></p><p>But religions would like you only to love people of your own religion
– others are foreigners. Countries would like you to love only the
people who live in that country. And you can see, there are divisions
upon divisions.</p><p>India became independent in 1947. I was very young, but I had kept my
eyes clear and uncontaminated by the older generation. From my very
childhood I have insisted on having my own insight, my own intelligence,
and I don’t want to borrow any knowledge from anybody.</p><p>My whole family was involved in the struggle for the freedom of the
country. Everybody had been in jail. Although I was never in jail
because of the liberation movement, I suffered as much as one can
suffer, because all the earning males were forced into jails and the
family was left without any source of earning.</p><p>I asked my father, “Are you aware that once you are liberated from
the British empire... and it is going to happen, because now Britain is
burdened. They have exploited the land to the maximum; now the situation
has reversed – they have to help the country to survive. It is better
for them to escape from here and get rid of a burden which has become
absolutely unnecessary.” They were not here to serve the people, they
were here to exploit. And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>The revolution happened in 1942 without any effect. It was quashed
completely within nine days, and with those nine days all hope of
freedom disappeared. But suddenly, out of the blue, Britain decided in
1947 to make the country free.</p><p>I told my father, “Don’t think that your freedom movement has
succeeded. Between the freedom movement and the actual coming of freedom
there is a five-year gap. This is not logical. You are being given
freedom because now you have become a burden and a trouble, just your
existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I have come to know that researchers, looking into the whole
history of the British Parliament and their decisions, found out that
the British Prime Minister Attlee sent Mountbatten with the message: “Do
it as quickly as possible.” He had given him a set time, that, “by 1948
we should get rid of this burden.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mountbatten proved even more efficient. He managed it one year
earlier. But I told my father, “You have been fighting, not knowing that
once this country is free it will start having new fights, within
itself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now Mohammedans have taken Pakistan – it was part and parcel of the
freedom, because Mohammedans refused to live with the Hindus. They had
lived together for almost fourteen hundred years and there was no
problem. In my childhood I have participated in Mohammedan celebrations;
Mohammedans were participating in Hindu marriages, Hindu celebrations.
There was no question of fight, because everybody was fighting the
British empire. Once the British empire was leaving, suddenly the
Mohammedans and Hindus became alert – a new division. They declared that
they could not live together because their religions are different.
Mohammedans became adamant: “Either the British empire remains... we can
risk freedom, but we cannot live with Hindus in an independent country
because they are in the majority. They will rule, and Mohammedans don’t
have any chance of ruling.”</p><p><br></p><p>The situation became so ugly that there were only two alternatives.
Either accept the slavery – which the British empire was not ready to
continue – or to accept the division. The division was accepted; the
country was divided into two parts. The Mohammedan part became Pakistan.
But they were not aware, and neither were Indians aware that the
Mohammedans got two parts – one part in the east, Punjab and Sindh,
where they were in the majority, and another part far away, thousands of
miles away in Bengal. Half of Bengal was Mohammedan.</p><p><br></p><p>So Pakistan became a strange country, and immediately... both parts
were Mohammedan but Bengalis saw that they were being dominated by the
Punjabi Mohammedans. The shift away from the division of religions was
immediate; now it became a question of language. Bengali Mohammedans
speak Bengali; the Punjabi speaks Punjabi. Now they forgot completely
that they were together in the fight to gain Pakistan.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the Bengalis separated from Pakistan and created a new
country, Bangladesh. The distance was so great that it was impossible
for Pakistan to keep control over it. But the same situation goes on
happening every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Forty years ago the constitution decided that Hindi should be the
national language. But it has not been implemented because in India
there are thirty languages. Taken as a whole the Hindi- speaking people
are the majority, but if those twenty-nine languages are against it,
then they are in the majority. Each single language is not capable of
fighting against Hindi, but those twenty-nine languages together are a
tremendous force. Now you cannot believe it – that they are all Hindus,
and they have been killing other Hindus because they speak different
languages! It is not a question</p><p>that you can give all these thirty languages the status of a national
language. Then suddenly you will find... for example Hindi is spoken in
one way in one state, a slightly different way in another state. And
there are five states – soon they will be fighting: “Our Hindi is the
RIGHT Hindi and the others are only distortions.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man has been trained to cut humanity into so many pieces on any
excuse: religion, country, language, color. But the basic root is in
teaching human beings that love is a limited phenomenon, and secondly,
that love has varieties.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying to say to you that love has no varieties. It may have
different expressions – certainly the love between husband and wife will
have a different expression than the love between the couple and their
children. It will have a different expression, but the expression does
not change the quality. It is the same love.</p><p><br></p><p>And its center is not the other – that’s how we have been taught,
that the center of love is the other: you love somebody. The emphasis
has to be completely changed. It is not a question of loving somebody,
it is a question of being a loving human being. Love should not have an
address; it should be simply a radiation of your being. Whoever comes in
contact with you will find the immensely nourishing energy of love.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “I feel so much love for you.” I would like you to
feel the same love for the whole existence – for the trees and for the
birds and for the oceans and for the stars. Your love should not be
confined. You can love me as much as you want, but that does not mean
that I should become the only object of your love. Then it is not
nourishing. On the contrary, it starts becoming a poisoning force.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a nourishing force if it spreads all around just the way the
sun rises, and it showers its light, its rays, to all the trees without
any discrimination. Not thinking that “this is just a poor marigold,
just a little bit less will do. This is a beautiful rose, a little more.
This is a lotus, shower as much as you can.” No, the sunlight showers
over the whole planet without any discrimination.</p><p><br></p><p>Your love should become subjective, not objective. It should become a
radiation, from the center of your being to all directions. Then it is
nourishing and then it has a certain quality which can only be called
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Our so-called love only creates jealousy, only creates conflict, only
creates two people living in intimate enmity, judging, looking,
watching. Just look on the road and you can decide without asking
anybody whether the couples who are walking together are husband and
wives, or just boyfriends and girlfriends. I have never seen a husband
and wife together smiling. What kind of love is this? Yes, they are both
detecting each other<span class=s4></span>The husband cannot look
around if a beautiful woman</p><p>passes by. Just looking at that beautiful woman can create so much
harassment that it is not worth it.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of society have you created? Is it human? It is absolutely
human that if a beautiful woman passes by, the husband should tell his
wife, “Look, a beautiful woman!” Beauty should not be made a question of
jealousy or comparison. You can say that the roseflower is beautiful and
your husband or your wife will not object to it, because you can’t have
any relationship with it.</p><p>Just the other day I was listening to a song of one of the most
beautiful singers of India. The meaning of the song is, “I was just
passing by here and I thought just to say hello to you, although I know
if my wife comes to know about it, this hello is going to be very
dangerous. Because her insistence is, ‘You should not see anybody else
except me. Your whole love is monopolized by me.’” And the singer says –
his name is Jagjit Singh – “That is her insistence. But my hobby is that
wherever there is beauty, I should at least be respectful to it.”</p><p><br></p><p>We have created an idea of love as a possession. And all kinds of
possessions ultimately turn into poisons. One should live a life
non-possessive, available, open, respectful. There is so much beauty
around you and so many different ways the beauty is expressing itself;
to confine you is to destroy you.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember: anyone who confines you, you are not going to be loving
to that person. Husbands don’t love their wives, wives don’t love their
husbands. How can a wife love a husband who has confined her infinite
capacity of radiating love, who has forced her to accept that he is the
only one that all her love should be directed to? This is insulting and
this is against nature, against existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But religions have been doing everything to destroy the individuality
of man. It seems to be that without destroying man, they cannot exist.
Either man can exist in his dignity or your so-called churches and popes
and priests can exist, with great power.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day... I could not believe it, but I have to believe
because it is a fact. Anando brought me the news that the Catholic
church has decided that there will not be any other kind of music in the
churches than that which is absolutely devoted to the church. Even in
weddings – and it has been going on for centuries; it is not something
new. Even the classical music and the geniuses of the past are no longer
allowed in the church. In a church wedding the music should be only what
is approved by the church, and its function should be religious – no
other music.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are these people afraid of people becoming light, rejoicing,
enjoying? They have a certain investment in your misery. The more
miserable you are, the better, because only the miserable people go to
the churches. Only the miserable people are in the bondage of the past.
Only the miserable people are under the domination of the dead.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who is alive can be alive only if he is allowed total
expression of his individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>Who are these people to decide? On what authority do these people go
on deciding things for millions of people? A very strange strategy has
been used. First they invented God, then they invented his son Jesus
Christ, and now they have imposed themselves as his representatives.
Only they have the direct line to God.</p><p><br></p><p>A few months ago the Catholic church has prohibited that anybody
should confess to God directly. He has to confess to the priest,
everything through the right channel. Then the priest will inform Jesus
Christ, then Jesus Christ will persuade God the Father – “Let this poor
man be freed from his sin.” But directly you cannot confess to God. And
not a single Catholic in the whole world revolted against the idea.</p><p><br></p><p>At least man should be given the freedom to be in direct relationship
with existence.</p><p>But the business point is clear: unless you confess to the priest,
the priest cannot punish you. And what is the punishment? Five dollars,
ten dollars... and I don’t understand how these dollars reach to Jesus
Christ. And then he gives the bribe to God the Father: “Just forgive
this man, he is a good man. Just look, he has sent ten dollars.” Those
ten dollars disappear in the pocket of the priest. They have nothing to
do with Jesus Christ or with God.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that one rabbi and one bishop were very friendly. The
friendship had arisen because both were golf lovers, and they decided
that on the next Sunday they were going to the golf club.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi waited and waited outside, but it was getting late so he
entered the church. The bishop was in the confession booth – it is a
small room, partitioned. On one side sits the bishop with a small
window; on the other side stands the confessor. The strategy is that the
confessor should not be made embarrassed; his face should not be seen,
so that he can confess wholeheartedly because unless he confesses
wholeheartedly he is not going to be contributing dollars wholeheartedly
either.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi entered the booth and said to the bishop, “We are going to
be late.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “I am doing everything as quickly as possible, but
there is still a queue.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “I don’t know what this confession is, just let me
see what you are doing. And then you can get ready while I function in
your place, because nobody can see from the other side.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “It is very simple; you just watch.” One man came
and he said, “I have committed a rape.”</p><p>The bishop said, “Don’t be worried. Just contribute ten dollars to
the charity box and I will pray for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “It is very simple. Now you go and get ready.” He sat
in the bishop’s chair. Another man came and he said, “I have committed
two rapes this week.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “My son, don’t be worried. Thirty dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Thirty dollars? Has the rate increased? Just in front
of me, for one rape you asked ten dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “Don’t be worried. You just put thirty dollars in the
box – ten dollars are in advance.”</p><p><br></p><p>These are the people who have destroyed everything that is beautiful
in man. But they are exploiting and they will cling to their
exploitation to the very last. Otherwise, there is no reason for all
these organized religions to exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual should have a direct contact with the universe, its
beauty, its tremendous glory – which creates without any effort a
gratitude, a prayer, perhaps a song, a dance. If we can remove all these
organized religions from the world, organized nations from the world,
and allow each individual his dignity and respect, there will be immense
love, immense respect, immense understanding. We</p><p>can change this ugly world which has been created by the past, into a
beautiful garden where everyone can rise to his potential height, can
shower his flowers and can release his fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>I stand for the individual.</p><p><br></p><p>All organizations have proved criminal. There is no need of any
organization either in the name of politics or in the name of religion
or in any other name. And the world will be an ocean of love, an ocean
of beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>But this needs, Deva Bhasha, a tremendous courage to revolt and
assert your individuality, whatever the consequences. It is long enough
that we have been exploited, sucked, destroyed. And the end result is
this miserable world – where once in a while perhaps you can smile, but
even that smile does not come from your deepest core; where once in
awhile you can love, but even that love is surrounded by all kinds of
fears. Nothing in you has been left in freedom. And the people who have
done this greatest crime are the people you worship. That makes it more
difficult to take humanity out of their clutches.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to learn to love yourself first, to respect yourself first.
And then certainly it will give you tremendous nourishment and it will
start spreading around you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHY DOES SPONTANEITY CREATE SO MUCH FEAR IN ME?</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING NO STRUCTURE FEELS LIKE A DEATH. HOW CAN I TURN THIS FEAR INTO
A LET-GO, A WELCOME, A REJOICING?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Anupam, perhaps you are not aware that you are again asking for
another structure. I will read your question so that you can become
conscious of what you are asking:</p><p><br></p><p>“Why does spontaneity create so much fear in me?” It creates fear in
everybody, because spontaneity means you are taking the responsibility
for your act, whatever it may be. If you rely on the conditionings you
have been given by your parents, by your teachers, professors, priests,
leaders, and instead of being spontaneous just act out of your past
conditioning, there is no fear. Because you know you are not alone; you
know your action is approved.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear arises when you find yourself alone and you are doing
something which goes against the whole training. You know you are
revolting; you are going against your parents, you are going against the
whole heritage of humanity. The weight of the past is so big and huge,
so Himalayan, and you seem to be such a small individual, afraid of
going against it. You may be crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood I loved having hair as long as possible. My father
had a shop and the house together, and I used to move in and out through
his shop. He felt very embarrassed because people asked him, “Whose girl
is this?” Such long hair in India is allowed only to the girls, and
naturally he felt embarrassed and angry that I was creating every day
some trouble. Finally he became so angry that he took his scissors,
caught hold of me and cut my hair.</p><p>I said, “You can cut my hair but remember, I am not going to leave it
at that.” He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p>I said, “You will see tomorrow.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I went just on the other side of the road, where all the
hair-cutting salons were. I had a friend, an old opium addict. I loved
the man, because sometimes he would cut half somebody’s mustache and
say, “Wait, I have to go somewhere.” And he would be gone for hours, and
the man would be caught because he could not leave with the half
mustache. Sometimes people would ask him for a shave and he would shave
their heads. And by the time they became aware, he had already done some
work – now there is no point in preventing him. And he was such a nice
man; he would say, “There is no need to worry – if you don’t like it,
don’t pay me anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>I used to sit in his small salon discussing with him, because it was
a joy. He used to come up with really original ideas. One day he told
me, “If all the opium addicts of India are organized, we can take over
the whole country.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The idea is very good.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But you will have to help, because these opium addicts
don’t listen to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will try to contact first all the opium addicts in this
town. Let us create one small organization here. If it succeeds in
taking over the municipal corporation...”</p><p><br></p><p>So I went to him, because he was the only man who could have done
this. In India a child’s head is completely shaved only if his father
dies. So I told him, “I am tired of this long hair. You simply shave my
head completely clean.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment he hesitated. He said, “Your father will be very angry,
I am telling you!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried. It is my responsibility. And you are
the only man of guts; no other barber is going to cut my hair.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he said okay. He finished all my hair and I entered my father’s
shop. Looking at me, immediately his customers asked, “What happened to
this poor boy? His father has died?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now it was even more embarrassing for him to admit, “I am the
father.” He came to me inside the house and he said, “This is too
much.”</p><p>I said, “I have warned you. Whenever I do anything I do it totally.
From now onwards if you interfere with me, remember, I can move to the
other extreme.”</p><p><br></p><p>People from the neighborhood started coming to inquire... and when
they saw my father they said, “What is the matter? You are alive? And I
have seen with my own eyes that your son is completely shaved.”</p><p>From my school, my teachers, my headmaster, seeing that my father
must have died were very sorry. They told me, “We are going to your
house to express our sadness and our mourning. Your father was a good
man.” I allowed them to go, and when they would see my father sitting
there they were in such a strange situation – what to do? because it had
never happened.</p><p><br></p><p>And my father would ask, “Why have you come? There must be some
reason.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “There was... but your son is so strange that we were
telling him, ‘He was a good man’ and he did not even tell us that you
were still alive.” That was the last time he interfered with me. He knew
perfectly well that it was going to be dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Spontaneity means you are acting in the moment – not reacting, but
acting. That is the difference between those two words. When you react
it comes from your past accumulation of knowledge, experience. But when
you respond, it is a pure act out of your present consciousness – not
from memory. These are two different sources within you. Memory is
comfortable, because everybody will appreciate that you are doing the
right thing because they also have the same memory. But if you act on
your own, then you are taking a risk. It may not fit. Most probably it
is not going to fit with the structure which has been created around
you. Hence, fear arises.</p><p><br></p><p>But I would say to you, it is better to suffer fear rather than
remain a slave of those who had no idea in what situations you are going
to be. They have given you fixed ideas, answers to questions and they
don’t know in what form the question is going to arise in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Five thousand years ago, they wrote RIG VEDA, and Hindus are still
following the structure. It is no longer relevant. But the same is the
situation everywhere. Mohammed allowed Mohammedans to have four wives.
It was perfectly right at that moment because in Arabia the proportion
was exactly one man and four wives, because men were continuously being
killed. They were continuously fighting; war was their life. They would
rape the woman, but they would not kill her. That was not according to
their culture, to kill a woman. So there were four times more women than
men and naturally it was creating a very difficult situation. If three
women remained unmarried, there was going to be great prostitution,
corruption of all kinds. To avoid the situation, Mohammed suggested that
every man marries four women. It was perfectly right in Saudi Arabia
fourteen hundred years ago, but they are doing the same in India even
today.</p><p><br></p><p>Now India wants fewer people. It is already past the limit; it has
never been so crowded in the whole of history. In 1947, when India
became independent, the population was four hundred million, and just in
forty years the population has gone to nine hundred million. By the end
of this century it is going beyond one billion. For the first time India
will have a greater population than China. But Mohammedans insist that
it is their religion and the government cannot interfere with their
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult, because in India the proportion of men and women is
almost equal. They go on raping women who are not Mohammedans; and once
a woman, whether raped or not, has been kept in a Mohammedan house –
Hindus are following another tradition five thousand years old – she has
fallen, she is no longer acceptable. Neither her parents will allow her
into the house nor her own husband. She has to become a Mohammedan or
commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>And when Mohammedans go on marrying four women, naturally they
produce four times more people than Hindus. Soon this country will have
more Mohammedans than Hindus. Already, you will</p><p>be surprised to know, India has the largest Mohammedan population in
the whole world. There are Mohammedan countries – Egypt, Iraq, Iran,
Afghanistan, Pakistan – but no country has a greater Mohammedan
population than India. And the reason is simple, because in those
countries there are only Mohammedans and the proportion between men and
women is equal. It is very difficult in a Mohammedan country to find
four women. What will happen to the three other men whose wives you have
taken? So it is only in India where they have a good pasture around to
get more and more women and more and more children.</p><p><br></p><p>To respond to the situation that is facing you needs intelligence,
not memory; needs awareness, not your past heritage. So even though it
creates fear, which is natural, decide to be spontaneous in spite of all
the fears. Soon those fears will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only a question of acting out of spontaneity more and more, and
then you will see your individuality becoming more integrated, more
solid, freer from all the chains that the past has put around you. The
fear will disappear, but it will take a little time. If you listen to
the fear you will never be able to gain your dignity as an
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Even trees have their individuality. Every animal has his own
individuality. It is simply shameful that man has lost his
individuality. So in spite of all your fears, take the risk. Be
courageous and act according to your own consciousness. And soon you
will see that whenever you act spontaneously you are right, because you
are answering the situation directly.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are asking, “Having no structure feels like a death.” There
is no harm. Die! Your life is not much more valuable. Rather than be a
prisoner of all the dead, it is better to die spontaneously. At least
you will have the dignity to say, “At one point I am at least free from
the whole past and all the prisons of religion, nation, race,
color.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are asking, “How can I turn this fear into a let-go?” Do you
understand? “How” means again filling your memory with a new structure.
But no structure can be spontaneous. You cannot know what is going to
happen the next moment. You cannot conceive of what tomorrow is going to
bring to you. So whatever structure you make, whatever homework you do,
is going to be irrelevant to the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never done any homework. In my schools, colleges,
universities, I made it absolutely clear to all my teachers and
professors, “Never ask for any homework from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they said, “But this is so strange, nobody has ever said such a
thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t care whether anybody has said such a thing or not.
One thing is certain: you can answer me, you can question me, you can do
anything you want – I will be spontaneous, I will not be prepared.”</p><p><br></p><p>Homework is preparation; you have already prepared everything. In my
final examinations of post- graduation, the professors who loved me very
much were so afraid, because I was not preparing anything for the
examination. I was still reading whatever I wanted to read in the
library. It had no concern with the examination. I was asking questions
in the classes and one professor had to say to me, “Now only one month
is left, and you should not bring such questions which have no relevance
to your examination.”</p><p>I said, “I am not here to be worried about an examination which is
going to happen one month later. My concern is this moment, and this is
my question.”</p><p><br></p><p>One of my professors was so concerned that he gave me one of the
questionnaires, telling me, “I have made this so that you can at least
be ready for these five questions. They are going to be asked because I
am the composer of the paper.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without reading it, I threw it away and I said, “You should not
insult me in this way. I want to live life unprepared. Whether I fail or
succeed, it doesn’t matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>He used to come to my hostel room just fifteen minutes before the
examination was going to commence. Everybody had gone into the
examination hall. He would pick me in his car and tell me, “Unless you
enter the examination hall, I cannot feel at ease. I am always afraid
you may be sleeping, you may be discussing things which have nothing to
do with the examination, you may be reading things.” And he used to say
to the superintendent of the examination, “Don’t let him out before
three hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>I used to answer those questions in one hour or one and a half hours.
The superintendent would say, “I am sorry but I have promised your
professor that I will not allow you to leave.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is up to you. If you don’t allow me to go out... has he
told you that I cannot even sleep here?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “He has not said anything about sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s okay. You take this paper; I am finished with it. And
for one and a half hours let me rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>When my professor came to know, he said, “It is very impossible to
deal with you. I prevented you from going out but you managed to go out!
And how can you answer those five questions in three hours? Others find
that they have answered only four; somebody has answered only
three.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “They are prepared people. They have done so much preparation
that they want to impress the examiner with how much they are informed.
I am absolutely uninformed. Sometimes I simply write one sentence as an
answer and sometimes I ask another question because I cannot agree that
the question is right. But I am absolutely free. I have no
preparation.”</p><p><br></p><p>One professor had asked the question, “Can you define Indian
philosophy?” And I simply answered him that “There is no such thing as
Indian philosophy so the question of defining it does not arise. There
is Western philosophy because the very word philosophy means a search
for knowledge, a search for wisdom, a love for wisdom.” In India we
don’t have any word which can be translated as philosophy.…</p><p><br></p><p>The Indian word is darshan and its approach is totally different. It
means an inquiry to see the truth. Darshan means seeing. It is not a
question of thinking. A blind man can think about the light and can be a
great philosopher, can propose hypotheses about light. In India there
has never existed anything like philosophy. What has existed is seeing.
We want to see the light, we don’t want to philosophize about it.</p><p>Just by coincidence that paper was sent to one very eccentric retired
professor, Dr. Ranade of Allahabad. Basically he belonged to Poona. And
he gave me ninety-nine percent out of one hundred, with a note to the
vice-chancellor saying that “I always wanted somebody to answer
spontaneously, and I always wanted somebody to answer as sharply as
possible.” He had never given a first class to anybody else in his whole
life. With him, even to pass was a difficult job. But he wrote the note
and he also wrote, “What I am writing you should show to the student. I
loved his answers and I loved the way he made me aware that Western
philosophy is one thing and there is no equivalent in India for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has written books on Indian philosophy and he said in his note, “I
am too old now to change it, but your point is absolutely right. We
don’t have anything similar to what has happened in the West.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of this difference that Western philosophy has never
come to meditation. It was always contemplation. And the Indian
counterpart has never bothered about thinking, contemplation,
concentration; its whole concern is meditation. In fact they are two
such different directions that a single word cannot describe both.</p><p><br></p><p>My professor was amazed. He said, “I was thinking you were going to
fail, you were so unprepared.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Your whole idea is preparation and my whole idea is to be
simply spontaneous.” I got the gold medal, topped the whole university,
shocking everybody. And as I came out of the auditorium I threw that
gold medal into the well. A professor was standing by my side. He said,
“What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have nothing to do with gold, and I don’t want to be
appreciated as topping the whole university. I would love it if somebody
appreciated that spontaneity has its own beauty, freshness. Whether it
fails or succeeds is irrelevant.”</p><p><br></p><p>You should not ask, “How can I turn this fear into a let-go?” Because
whatever I say to you will be your structure again.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be simple.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you find a situation, act!</p><p><br></p><p>Put the fear aside and rejoice in the spontaneous response. It is
only a question of a few times and you will find the fear has
disappeared. Because the spontaneous response gives you such a joy, such
an opening of the heart, such freshness... as if you have just taken a
shower. But don’t ask for any strategy – “How to be spontaneous” –
because how simply means a structure.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be spontaneous. Don’t ask how.</p><p><br></p><p>Try it. Without knowing, innocently, respond to a situation and you
will learn out of it the great experience of let-go. And you will
rejoice because you have attained your freedom from all kinds of
fears.</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood I had a friend whose father was a magician. They had
a very good business – the business was that they had a few snakes.
Being continually in their house, slowly I learned that</p><p>ninety-seven percent of snakes don’t have any poison. Only three
percent of snakes have poison, and only one percent, the cobra, is very
dangerous. Once the cobra bites you it is very difficult to save you.
Death is almost certain. But the snakes all look alike.</p><p><br></p><p>The father used to have non-poisonous snakes, and he would send his
son – who was my friend, and I accompanied him many times – to
somebody’s house. There we would leave two or three snakes around, and
then the father would come with his special musical instrument that was
used for snakes. He would announce, “If anybody has snakes in his house,
I can catch them.” As he started playing on his instrument, the snakes
that we had left around the house would start coming, and for that
service the housekeeper had to pay. He would say, “It is very good of
you – once in a while you should come back, because we were not aware
that there were snakes in our garden.”</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing that there are snakes which don’t have any poison, I would
enter into my class with a snake in my pocket. I would just leave it on
the table of the teacher, and he would stand on his chair and shout,
“Save me!” The other students are running out... who is going to save
him except me? And I would tell him, “I will save you, but remember that
I have saved your life. You should not be nasty with me. Promise?” And
with that snake sitting on his table, you could have taken any kind of
promise.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally it was reported to the principal that a strange thing was
going on. But a principal is just the same as anybody else. When he
called me, I went there with two snakes. And I left them on his table,
and he stood on his chair, and everybody in the whole school was looking
through the windows – what is happening? I said, “Now, do you have
something to say to me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No. Just don’t bring these things in my office!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have not come on my own, you have called me. Now I cannot
go without your promising me that you will not be nasty to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is strange... but I promise, I will not be nasty to
you.” I said, “That’s okay; then I can persuade the snakes.”</p><p>People have lived with such fear. Fear always seems to be around them
– anything can create fear. And if the man had been a little
spontaneous, he could have seen that if I can manage those snakes,
certainly there must be some trick and there is no need to be afraid.
But the very word snake is enough to trigger all the fears, of centuries
of humanity, that you are carrying within you.</p><p><br></p><p>To my father it was reported, “Now your son is becoming more and more
dangerous.” My father said, “I have promised him, just as you have
promised, not to interfere. Otherwise he will start bringing those
snakes in the house!”</p><p><br></p><p>What are your fears? What can you lose? The only thing that you can
lose is your life. And that does not belong to you, that belongs to the
universe. One day you are going to lose it, so what does it matter? In a
week there are only seven days. Either you will lose your life on Monday
or on Tuesday... so it is only a question of seven days. But I have
never thought for a single moment that I have anything to lose.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have anything to lose.</p><p>That has given me a tremendous freedom to act spontaneously, to act
without any fear, to say whatever I want to say – to be against all the
governments of the world, to be against all the religions of the world.
And I don’t think that even a shadow of fear arises in my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, the more I hit these idiots the more I rejoice,
because according to me they are criminals. According to me they are the
greatest calamities that have happened to humanity. There is nothing to
fear from these people. There is nothing to be afraid of in the ghosts
who are lying in their graves. But everybody is injected with fear from
the very beginning, so that his whole blood becomes full of fear. This
fearfulness helps all these criminals to dominate you, to destroy you,
not to let you live your life of love and blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as my sannyasins are concerned, fear should not be at all a
part of their being. The fear exists in the darker corners of your being
– bring more light. Bring more consciousness, bring more awareness, and
the fear will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>A lady health inspector, after checking the sanitary conditions in
Boccala’s Bakery, summons the proprietor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Listen,” she complains. “One of the bakers back there is throwing
the dough against his bare chest to flatten it out for pizzas!”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s-a not-a so bad-a,” says Boccala. “You should-a be here
yesterday when he make-a the doughnuts!”</p><p><br></p><p>The newlywed Greek couple is in a deep embrace. While kissing and
caressing her, he whispers, “My love, now I will put it where nobody
else ever has!”</p><p><br></p><p>In a frightened voice she cries, “No, no! In my ears? Never!”</p><p><br></p><p>What is there to fear? There is everything to laugh and there is
nothing to fear. Laughter has to be our sword to cut all these heads who
have been torturing humanity for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

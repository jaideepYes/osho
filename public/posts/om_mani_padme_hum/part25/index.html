KNOWINGLY AND UNKNOWINGLY, AN INNER MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN CLIMBED, EFFORTLESSLY FOR THE MOST PART. JUST TODAY I LOOKED DOWN AND IT FRIGHTENED ME HOW FAR OFF THE GROUND I AM. A FEAR THAT I COULD FALL GRIPS ME. THE ROAD IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER, AND I FEEL THE DANGER. WOULD YOU SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THIS?\nDavid, the path back home is certainly a razor’s edge. As you come closer and closer to yourself, the path goes on becoming narrower and narrower. At the very end of this path you are going to find your pure aloneness.\nThe crowd has never found any truth. On the contrary, whenever anybody has found the truth, the crowd has rewarded him with crucifixion. To seek truth is the most dangerous, but very exciting, challenging, experiment.\nAn ancient Tibetan proverb says: One hundred seekers start; ninety-nine are lost somewhere on the way, go astray. Only one – that too, very rarely – reaches the goal of his search. With this proverb is attached a small story.…\nDeep in the mountains there is a monastery, far away from Lhasa. The chief monk is getting old and he wants a master from Lhasa to replace him. He sends a messenger, a young man, to the main\nmonastery in Lhasa to ask them, “Our master is getting very old and he wants a man to replace him.” After long, long difficulties of mountainous paths the young man finally reaches to the main monastery.\nAn audience is given to him. And the master says to him, “I can understand. I will send one hundred people with you.”\nThe young man said, “But I have asked only for one.” And the master said, “Have you forgotten the old proverb? A hundred should go; rarely, one reaches.”\nThe proverb was certainly known to the young man, but he could not trust that a hundred people could go and only one would reach. But he could not argue either, with the chief of all the monasteries of Tibet. One hundred monks followed the young man.\nThey had not gone very far when they were stopped by a few soldiers with naked swords, who said, “Our small kingdom has lost its master. We need a master urgently. The pay is good, the palace to live in, and you will be the only religious man in the whole kingdom. And we are simply conveying to you the orders from the emperor. Refusal can be dangerous – you can see the naked swords.”\nMany of those hundred monks started thinking, “This is a good place – why unnecessarily go deep into the mountains? It is close to Lhasa, the kingdom is rich, the monastery is rich, all facilities are available, and you will be the high priest of the kingdom...” So not only one, many wanted to go.\nThe young man said, “Have you forgotten?”\nThey said, “We have not forgotten. You forget it – all! We are going to stay.”\nThe soldiers said, “We need only one, but the monastery is big. If many of you want to come, you can be part of the monastery and the emperor will be immensely happy.”\nHalf of the crowd disappeared. The young man could not believe.…\nJust a few miles further they were again prevented, this time by a crowd. They needed four priests because the richest man’s daughter was being married, and the reward was going to be great.\n“... And it is only a question of a few days, and then you can go on wherever you are going.” Immediately, more than four were ready, but the crowd said, “We don’t want more than four.”\nThe other monks tried to ask them, “What are you doing? We have been sent for a certain purpose, because of a certain message.”\nThey said, “We are not going astray. It is only a question of a few days. Soon we will finish the marriage and we will come a little faster and join you. Your journey is long. The path is tedious. And we cannot miss this opportunity of earning, getting rewards, from the richest man.” Four persons again disappeared.\nIn this way it went on, and the young man started feeling that “Perhaps I am the only one who is going to make it back!”\nAs they were passing a river, a very beautiful young woman with tears in her eyes said, “You are all compassionate people. My father is a famous hunter – I live with my father, my mother is dead. He was supposed to come back this morning and it is evening and he is not back. And I am immensely afraid in this lonely part of the Himalayas. Won’t you be kind enough, at least one, to be with me for the night? And in the morning you can go as soon as my father comes home.”\nImmediately a young man... in fact many were ready, but a young man said, “I am coming. This is the essential teaching of Gautam Buddha – compassion!”\nAnd this goes on.It is a long story, how people went on disappearing. Finally only two monks and\nthe young man remained. They were passing the last village and soon they would be arriving at the monastery. It was already shining in the morning sun on the mountains.\nIn that village there was an atheist who challenged those monks: “If you have any guts, first accept my challenge for a debate. I don’t believe in Gautam Buddha and I don’t believe in his teachings, and I am ready to fight on each and every point.”\nThe young man said to the remaining two fellows, “Don’t get involved in this. Our monastery is there, you can see it – so beautiful in the eternal snows of the Himalayas.”\nBut one of them said, “I cannot move an inch. My master Gautam Buddha has been challenged. I am going to remain here. Either I will convert this man to Buddhism or I will be converted to his disciplehood, however long it takes.” So he was left in that village.\nOnly one monk and the young man reached the monastery. The young man said, “I have passed through an immense experience. I had never thought that proverbs are so accurately true.”\nThe old master said, “I knew he would send at least one hundred people because I had asked for one.”\nThe young man said, “But you never mentioned it to me.”\nThe old man said, “There was no need to mention it. This is how things go on happening in this world. We are fortunate that at least one has arrived. There is no certainty; there are so many by-paths, so many allurements, and once you have gone astray it is not easy to come back to the right path.”\nThe crowd consists of people who have all gone astray. Once in a while a courageous person comes out of the crowd and starts searching a path of his own. It needs daring, it needs courage, it needs intelligence. It needs trust in yourself, and also a deep understanding that you will be condemned by the crowd.\nThe crowd never likes people to be individuals. Individuals irritate the crowd very much. The crowd wants you just to be a part of the crowd, a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Christian. The moment you declare that “I am myself; neither a Hindu nor a Christian nor a Buddhist, and I am going to search on my own the truth of my being,” all the crowds around you will become antagonistic.\nThere is a deep psychology behind it. Your standing aloof and alone and moving in the direction of the unknown – without any companion, without any guide – irritates the mind of the crowd, because you are showing them that they are cowards clinging to each other like sheep, not moving like lions.\nBut the truth is not for the sheep. The sheep is not courageous enough to allow truth to reveal its mysteries and its glories to the mind of a sheep. The glories are so immense, so boundless, the mysteries are so infinite, that only the heart of the lion can rejoice, can dance, can sing.\nYes, there are moments when even the heart of the lion trembles, feels fear, because the path is so alone. And it goes on becoming narrower. As you are reaching higher and the path is becoming narrower, naturally, to look by the side... your whole being goes into a trembling. Just a single wrong step and you will be finished. On both sides are such depths.…\nBut strangely enough, although the path is of the razor’s edge, nobody has fallen from it. Everybody has felt the fear, but existence supports those who are in search of truth. Its support is unconditional.\nExistence does not support those who are nothing but living lies. They may have great power, but their own power will destroy them. Many civilizations have existed on the earth and they destroyed themselves by their own power. We are not the first civilization in the world. Atlantis drowned – perhaps the people of Atlantis had reached a far higher civilization than we have.\nIn India we have the story of Mahabharata, the great Indian war that happened five thousand years ago. In minute detail, the story describes weapons which can only be nuclear. The civilization had certainly reached to the same point where we are. But power in the hands of ignorant, retarded crowds is self-destructive.\nCrowds upon crowds have come and disappeared, but not a single individual seeker has ever fallen from those heights where, David, you are feeling – “What will happen?” I have been watching you. This is perhaps your first question to me.…\nFor all these years you have been silently with me. That is the only right way to be with a master – not to ask, and the answer will be given to you. Wait, and you will be showered with all the blessings possible. Don’t be in a hurry; otherwise you will miss the whole point.\nPatience is the only prayer by the side of a master. Utterly relaxed, in deep love, in great gratitude, something goes on growing in you without any effort. Something goes on maturing, something goes on becoming more and more crystallized, without any effort on your part. You are just a watcher of the miracle that is happening to you.\nDavid, your question is not just out of intellectual curiosity. You have been long enough with me; there is no point to remain silent so long and now suddenly become curious. Your question is coming from your existential experience. And only these questions are authentic.\nYou are asking, “For years now, I have been sitting by your side.” In fact, that is the very meaning of the ancient word UPANISHAD – sitting by the side of the master. Nothing else is expected, just sitting by the side. The master is radiating and if you are ready to receive silently, seasons will change, days will come and go, and slowly, slowly you will find you are no more the same person who had come.\nAnd as your insight deepens, you start becoming aware that each and every moment you are changing, becoming something new, fresh, just born, and the joy of this freshness is immense.\nI have been watching you, sitting by my side. In fact, if you are capable of just going on sitting, nothing else is needed. All the meditations will happen on their own, all the flowers of love and silence will blossom on their own, and once you have learned the secret, then there is nothing else to do in the world.\nYou are saying, “Knowingly and unknowingly, an inner mountain has been climbed, effortlessly for the most part. Just today I looked down and it frightened me, how far off the ground I am. A fear that I could fall grips me. The road is getting smaller and smaller and I feel the danger.” There is no need to feel the danger, because it is unprecedented: nobody has ever fallen from the path that leads to truth.\nNobody has ever fallen from his own being. However big the mountain of being may be, you cannot fall. That is simply not in the nature of things. I have never heard that any seeker, any searcher, any honest inquirer has ever gone astray. Existence protects.\nIt is good you have asked it. Relax, because it is an absolute guarantee that existence supports you. The higher you reach, the more and more you become a beloved of this whole universe.\nThis is my vision of a sannyasin. He has to become a beloved of this whole universe. And when you become a beloved of the whole universe, fear disappears – just as if it was nothing but darkness, and the light of love has come in and the darkness has disappeared.\nEverything is going exactly right with you. Just remain in a let-go. Don’t make any effort even to keep yourself on the path. Don’t be worried that you may fall and at least you have to be alert not to fall. That will be unnecessary and will be preventing your growth, your evolution.\nYou have come far away, certainly, from the earth. And it is natural to look and see the depths that are on both the sides of the path. I am not saying that fear is unnatural. It is natural, because you are not aware of a far higher law, that existence protects those who are in search of truth. Slowly slowly, you will see that you cannot fall; the universe will not allow it.\nThe universe is not unintelligent. You are not living in a cosmos which has no intelligence. It is pure intelligence that the existence is made of. Call it love, call it silence, call it nothingness, but in everything remember, the tremendous intelligence of existence is always there. And once you have learned the art of trusting, you are beyond all fear – you will learn it, because there is no going back.\nAnd when I am saying that it is absolutely guaranteed; I am saying it from my own experience. I have passed through the same fears. And as I became aware of a certain protection that surrounds me, I relaxed. Then I could move on this razor’s edge, this narrowest path possible, with closed eyes. In fact, most of the people who have reached, have reached with closed eyes! At the final stage the trust becomes so deep, who cares to look here and there? The eyes become closed on their own.\nIt is the fear that keeps them open. You may take a wrong step. But when trust becomes total you drop all cautiousness; you simply relax. Whatever existence decides to be your destiny, you\nare absolutely willing to relax in it. This is the only experience that has transformed people from ordinary, mundane mortals into immortal beings, has transformed them into luminous lights.\nThe search for truth is the only search that makes you authentically human. Otherwise there is no difference between you and the animals – and the crowd remains at the level of the animals.\nNever belong to a crowd; never belong to a nation; never belong to a religion; never belong to a race. Belong to the whole existence. Why limit yourself to small things? When the whole is available, only stupid people will cling to small things.\nBe oceanic.\nOnly then will you have the taste of what true life is. And a great gratitude arises, David, on its own accord. Not towards anyone in particular, but just towards this WHOLE... all these stars, and the trees and the mountains and the rivers and the oceans and the people and the birds... all that is. You simply feel a tremendous gratitude.\nAnd when you open your eyes with gratitude, the same world becomes so psychedelically beautiful, so colorful – you could never have believed that trees are so green; they have never been, and these are the same trees. That the winds passing through the trees are creating such subtle music – they have always been creating, but you were deaf. That sunsets and sunrises and the tremendous beauty they bring... you had been missing because you were blind.\nYour trust in the total opens all your sensitivities to their extreme. This whole existence becomes a sheer dance, a sheer celebration.\nLittle Ernie comes home early from school. “What are you doing home?” asks his mother.\n“I put a stick of dynamite under the teacher’s desk,” replies little Ernie. “You march right back to school” says his mother, “and apologize!” “Mom,” says Ernie, “What school?”\nDavid, what earth you are talking about? It is just a shadow, a dream, a memory. And you cannot fall into a memory, you cannot fall into a shadow, you cannot fall into a dream. Forget all about falling and the fear, because this is the time: either you will become very much afraid and stuck... Back you cannot go, and forward you may not dare. That’s why I am emphasizing the fact. Go ahead; there is nothing to be feared at all.\nIf a master cannot teach his disciples fearlessness, then that master is simply fake. I teach you in every possible way to be fearless, daring, courageous – risking, taking every challenge of life, because this is the whole science of how to create a steel spine in you – which will be needed!\nFirst learn to drop small fears; then slowly slowly bigger fears; then finally, your whole energy which was involved in all kinds of fears, worries, tensions, anxieties, is released. The energy that is\nreleased is so much that it makes you dance, that it makes you laugh, that it makes you sing. Suddenly a deep feeling that you have arrived – arrived to the place which you have never left. It is just that you have gone astray into your mind, far away, traveling all over the world. You simply needed a good hit.\nJust today, I loved the news from GermanyA young man punched his girlfriend in the nose, and\nthe girl reported it to the police. They were produced before the magistrate. The magistrate must have been a wise man, which is very rare. He said, “Young man, you can slap her a little here and there, but don’t punch her exactly in the nose.” And with this advice he released them. Must have been a man of great understanding. A little slapping here and there is perfectly okay; otherwise life loses all juice. But punching in the nose, that is not for boyfriends – that is left for the masters!\nA little pygmy living in the jungle in Africa gets a sore ass every time it rains. He goes to the witch doctor who offers him a cure which costs six chickens.\nThe pygmy catches the six chickens and receives an ointment from the witch doctor.\nThe next time it rains the ointment does not work, so the pygmy returns to the witch doctor. This time the witch doctor says that he will need a dozen chickens to make the cure.\nWith much effort the pygmy catches a dozen chickens and he is given some medicine by the witch doctor.\nWhen it rains again the pygmy takes the medicine, but he still has a sore ass. So he goes to the missionaries. They cure him for nothing, and the witch doctor becomes very embarrassed.\nThe pygmy offers to tell the witch doctor how he was cured, but says it will cost him eighteen chickens.\nThe witch doctor catches the eighteen chickens and hands them over. “Okay,” he says, “How did the missionaries stop you from getting a sore ass each time it rains?”\n“The method is very simple,” says the pygmy. “They cut the tops off my rubber boots.” David, take life very nonseriously. You are not going to fall; there is nowhere to fall to.\nPope the Polack is on a pilgrimage when his plane crashes in the Sahara. Only the pope and a nun survive. They are lucky to catch a camel and start to ride it towards the nearest town, a hundred miles away. But on the second day the camel drops dead.\nAs they wait for death, the pope sighs, “The only thing I regret,” he says, “is that I have never seen a naked woman in my life.”\n“All is pure to a pure man,” says the nun, and takes off her clothes.\nThe pope is amazed and blesses the nun for showing him. Then the nun confesses her desire to see a man’s body before she dies.\nPope the Polack takes off his clothes.\nThe nun gazes at his prick. “What is that?” she asks. “that,” says Pope the Polack, “is the giver of life.”\n“The giver of life!” exclaims the nun, jumping up and down. “Well then, stick it in the camel and let’s go home!”\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3583","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/>Om Mani Padme Hum</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">25 Nowhere to fall to</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3583 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

he wants a man to replace him.” After long, long difficulties of
mountainous paths the young man finally reaches to the main
monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>An audience is given to him. And the master says to him, “I can
understand. I will send one hundred people with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “But I have asked only for one.” And the master
said, “Have you forgotten the old proverb? A hundred should go; rarely,
one reaches.”</p><p><br></p><p>The proverb was certainly known to the young man, but he could not
trust that a hundred people could go and only one would reach. But he
could not argue either, with the chief of all the monasteries of Tibet.
One hundred monks followed the young man.</p><p><br></p><p>They had not gone very far when they were stopped by a few soldiers
with naked swords, who said, “Our small kingdom has lost its master. We
need a master urgently. The pay is good, the palace to live in, and you
will be the only religious man in the whole kingdom. And we are simply
conveying to you the orders from the emperor. Refusal can be dangerous –
you can see the naked swords.”</p><p><br></p><p>Many of those hundred monks started thinking, “This is a good place –
why unnecessarily go deep into the mountains? It is close to Lhasa, the
kingdom is rich, the monastery is rich, all facilities are available,
and you will be the high priest of the kingdom...” So not only one, many
wanted to go.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “Have you forgotten?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We have not forgotten. You forget it – all! We are going
to stay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers said, “We need only one, but the monastery is big. If
many of you want to come, you can be part of the monastery and the
emperor will be immensely happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Half of the crowd disappeared. The young man could not believe.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few miles further they were again prevented, this time by a
crowd. They needed four priests because the richest man’s daughter was
being married, and the reward was going to be great.</p><p><br></p><p>“... And it is only a question of a few days, and then you can go on
wherever you are going.” Immediately, more than four were ready, but the
crowd said, “We don’t want more than four.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other monks tried to ask them, “What are you doing? We have been
sent for a certain purpose, because of a certain message.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are not going astray. It is only a question of a few
days. Soon we will finish the marriage and we will come a little faster
and join you. Your journey is long. The path is tedious. And we cannot
miss this opportunity of earning, getting rewards, from the richest
man.” Four persons again disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way it went on, and the young man started feeling that
“Perhaps I am the only one who is going to make it back!”</p><p>As they were passing a river, a very beautiful young woman with tears
in her eyes said, “You are all compassionate people. My father is a
famous hunter – I live with my father, my mother is dead. He was
supposed to come back this morning and it is evening and he is not back.
And I am immensely afraid in this lonely part of the Himalayas. Won’t
you be kind enough, at least one, to be with me for the night? And in
the morning you can go as soon as my father comes home.”</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately a young man... in fact many were ready, but a young man
said, “I am coming. This is the essential teaching of Gautam Buddha –
compassion!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this goes on.<span class=s4></span>It is a long story, how
people went on disappearing. Finally only two monks and</p><p>the young man remained. They were passing the last village and soon
they would be arriving at the monastery. It was already shining in the
morning sun on the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>In that village there was an atheist who challenged those monks: “If
you have any guts, first accept my challenge for a debate. I don’t
believe in Gautam Buddha and I don’t believe in his teachings, and I am
ready to fight on each and every point.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said to the remaining two fellows, “Don’t get involved
in this. Our monastery is there, you can see it – so beautiful in the
eternal snows of the Himalayas.”</p><p><br></p><p>But one of them said, “I cannot move an inch. My master Gautam Buddha
has been challenged. I am going to remain here. Either I will convert
this man to Buddhism or I will be converted to his disciplehood, however
long it takes.” So he was left in that village.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one monk and the young man reached the monastery. The young man
said, “I have passed through an immense experience. I had never thought
that proverbs are so accurately true.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old master said, “I knew he would send at least one hundred
people because I had asked for one.”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “But you never mentioned it to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “There was no need to mention it. This is how
things go on happening in this world. We are fortunate that at least one
has arrived. There is no certainty; there are so many by-paths, so many
allurements, and once you have gone astray it is not easy to come back
to the right path.”</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd consists of people who have all gone astray. Once in a
while a courageous person comes out of the crowd and starts searching a
path of his own. It needs daring, it needs courage, it needs
intelligence. It needs trust in yourself, and also a deep understanding
that you will be condemned by the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd never likes people to be individuals. Individuals irritate
the crowd very much. The crowd wants you just to be a part of the crowd,
a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Christian. The moment you declare that “I am
myself; neither a Hindu nor a Christian nor a Buddhist, and I am going
to search on my own the truth of my being,” all the crowds around you
will become antagonistic.</p><p>There is a deep psychology behind it. Your standing aloof and alone
and moving in the direction of the unknown – without any companion,
without any guide – irritates the mind of the crowd, because you are
showing them that they are cowards clinging to each other like sheep,
not moving like lions.</p><p><br></p><p>But the truth is not for the sheep. The sheep is not courageous
enough to allow truth to reveal its mysteries and its glories to the
mind of a sheep. The glories are so immense, so boundless, the mysteries
are so infinite, that only the heart of the lion can rejoice, can dance,
can sing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there are moments when even the heart of the lion trembles,
feels fear, because the path is so alone. And it goes on becoming
narrower. As you are reaching higher and the path is becoming narrower,
naturally, to look by the side... your whole being goes into a
trembling. Just a single wrong step and you will be finished. On both
sides are such depths.…</p><p><br></p><p>But strangely enough, although the path is of the razor’s edge,
nobody has fallen from it. Everybody has felt the fear, but existence
supports those who are in search of truth. Its support is
unconditional.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence does not support those who are nothing but living lies.
They may have great power, but their own power will destroy them. Many
civilizations have existed on the earth and they destroyed themselves by
their own power. We are not the first civilization in the world.
Atlantis drowned – perhaps the people of Atlantis had reached a far
higher civilization than we have.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have the story of Mahabharata, the great Indian war that
happened five thousand years ago. In minute detail, the story describes
weapons which can only be nuclear. The civilization had certainly
reached to the same point where we are. But power in the hands of
ignorant, retarded crowds is self-destructive.</p><p><br></p><p>Crowds upon crowds have come and disappeared, but not a single
individual seeker has ever fallen from those heights where, David, you
are feeling – “What will happen?” I have been watching you. This is
perhaps your first question to me.…</p><p><br></p><p>For all these years you have been silently with me. That is the only
right way to be with a master – not to ask, and the answer will be given
to you. Wait, and you will be showered with all the blessings possible.
Don’t be in a hurry; otherwise you will miss the whole point.</p><p><br></p><p>Patience is the only prayer by the side of a master. Utterly relaxed,
in deep love, in great gratitude, something goes on growing in you
without any effort. Something goes on maturing, something goes on
becoming more and more crystallized, without any effort on your part.
You are just a watcher of the miracle that is happening to you.</p><p><br></p><p>David, your question is not just out of intellectual curiosity. You
have been long enough with me; there is no point to remain silent so
long and now suddenly become curious. Your question is coming from your
existential experience. And only these questions are authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “For years now, I have been sitting by your side.” In
fact, that is the very meaning of the ancient word UPANISHAD – sitting
by the side of the master. Nothing else is expected, just sitting by the
side. The master is radiating and if you are ready to receive silently,
seasons will change, days will come and go, and slowly, slowly you will
find you are no more the same person who had come.</p><p>And as your insight deepens, you start becoming aware that each and
every moment you are changing, becoming something new, fresh, just born,
and the joy of this freshness is immense.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been watching you, sitting by my side. In fact, if you are
capable of just going on sitting, nothing else is needed. All the
meditations will happen on their own, all the flowers of love and
silence will blossom on their own, and once you have learned the secret,
then there is nothing else to do in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “Knowingly and unknowingly, an inner mountain has
been climbed, effortlessly for the most part. Just today I looked down
and it frightened me, how far off the ground I am. A fear that I could
fall grips me. The road is getting smaller and smaller and I feel the
danger.” There is no need to feel the danger, because it is
unprecedented: nobody has ever fallen from the path that leads to
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has ever fallen from his own being. However big the mountain
of being may be, you cannot fall. That is simply not in the nature of
things. I have never heard that any seeker, any searcher, any honest
inquirer has ever gone astray. Existence protects.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good you have asked it. Relax, because it is an absolute
guarantee that existence supports you. The higher you reach, the more
and more you become a beloved of this whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my vision of a sannyasin. He has to become a beloved of this
whole universe. And when you become a beloved of the whole universe,
fear disappears – just as if it was nothing but darkness, and the light
of love has come in and the darkness has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is going exactly right with you. Just remain in a let-go.
Don’t make any effort even to keep yourself on the path. Don’t be
worried that you may fall and at least you have to be alert not to fall.
That will be unnecessary and will be preventing your growth, your
evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>You have come far away, certainly, from the earth. And it is natural
to look and see the depths that are on both the sides of the path. I am
not saying that fear is unnatural. It is natural, because you are not
aware of a far higher law, that existence protects those who are in
search of truth. Slowly slowly, you will see that you cannot fall; the
universe will not allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe is not unintelligent. You are not living in a cosmos
which has no intelligence. It is pure intelligence that the existence is
made of. Call it love, call it silence, call it nothingness, but in
everything remember, the tremendous intelligence of existence is always
there. And once you have learned the art of trusting, you are beyond all
fear – you will learn it, because there is no going back.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I am saying that it is absolutely guaranteed; I am saying it
from my own experience. I have passed through the same fears. And as I
became aware of a certain protection that surrounds me, I relaxed. Then
I could move on this razor’s edge, this narrowest path possible, with
closed eyes. In fact, most of the people who have reached, have reached
with closed eyes! At the final stage the trust becomes so deep, who
cares to look here and there? The eyes become closed on their own.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the fear that keeps them open. You may take a wrong step. But
when trust becomes total you drop all cautiousness; you simply relax.
Whatever existence decides to be your destiny, you</p><p>are absolutely willing to relax in it. This is the only experience
that has transformed people from ordinary, mundane mortals into immortal
beings, has transformed them into luminous lights.</p><p><br></p><p>The search for truth is the only search that makes you authentically
human. Otherwise there is no difference between you and the animals –
and the crowd remains at the level of the animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Never belong to a crowd; never belong to a nation; never belong to a
religion; never belong to a race. Belong to the whole existence. Why
limit yourself to small things? When the whole is available, only stupid
people will cling to small things.</p><p><br></p><p>Be oceanic.</p><p><br></p><p>Only then will you have the taste of what true life is. And a great
gratitude arises, David, on its own accord. Not towards anyone in
particular, but just towards this WHOLE... all these stars, and the
trees and the mountains and the rivers and the oceans and the people and
the birds... all that is. You simply feel a tremendous gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you open your eyes with gratitude, the same world becomes so
psychedelically beautiful, so colorful – you could never have believed
that trees are so green; they have never been, and these are the same
trees. That the winds passing through the trees are creating such subtle
music – they have always been creating, but you were deaf. That sunsets
and sunrises and the tremendous beauty they bring... you had been
missing because you were blind.</p><p><br></p><p>Your trust in the total opens all your sensitivities to their
extreme. This whole existence becomes a sheer dance, a sheer
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Ernie comes home early from school. “What are you doing home?”
asks his mother.</p><p>“I put a stick of dynamite under the teacher’s desk,” replies little
Ernie. “You march right back to school” says his mother, “and
apologize!” “Mom,” says Ernie, “What school?”</p><p>David, what earth you are talking about? It is just a shadow, a
dream, a memory. And you cannot fall into a memory, you cannot fall into
a shadow, you cannot fall into a dream. Forget all about falling and the
fear, because this is the time: either you will become very much afraid
and stuck... Back you cannot go, and forward you may not dare. That’s
why I am emphasizing the fact. Go ahead; there is nothing to be feared
at all.</p><p><br></p><p>If a master cannot teach his disciples fearlessness, then that master
is simply fake. I teach you in every possible way to be fearless,
daring, courageous – risking, taking every challenge of life, because
this is the whole science of how to create a steel spine in you – which
will be needed!</p><p><br></p><p>First learn to drop small fears; then slowly slowly bigger fears;
then finally, your whole energy which was involved in all kinds of
fears, worries, tensions, anxieties, is released. The energy that is</p><p>released is so much that it makes you dance, that it makes you laugh,
that it makes you sing. Suddenly a deep feeling that you have arrived –
arrived to the place which you have never left. It is just that you have
gone astray into your mind, far away, traveling all over the world. You
simply needed a good hit.</p><p><br></p><p>Just today, I loved the news from Germany<span class=s4></span>A
young man punched his girlfriend in the nose, and</p><p>the girl reported it to the police. They were produced before the
magistrate. The magistrate must have been a wise man, which is very
rare. He said, “Young man, you can slap her a little here and there, but
don’t punch her exactly in the nose.” And with this advice he released
them. Must have been a man of great understanding. A little slapping
here and there is perfectly okay; otherwise life loses all juice. But
punching in the nose, that is not for boyfriends – that is left for the
masters!</p><p><br></p><p>A little pygmy living in the jungle in Africa gets a sore ass every
time it rains. He goes to the witch doctor who offers him a cure which
costs six chickens.</p><p><br></p><p>The pygmy catches the six chickens and receives an ointment from the
witch doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>The next time it rains the ointment does not work, so the pygmy
returns to the witch doctor. This time the witch doctor says that he
will need a dozen chickens to make the cure.</p><p><br></p><p>With much effort the pygmy catches a dozen chickens and he is given
some medicine by the witch doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>When it rains again the pygmy takes the medicine, but he still has a
sore ass. So he goes to the missionaries. They cure him for nothing, and
the witch doctor becomes very embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>The pygmy offers to tell the witch doctor how he was cured, but says
it will cost him eighteen chickens.</p><p><br></p><p>The witch doctor catches the eighteen chickens and hands them over.
“Okay,” he says, “How did the missionaries stop you from getting a sore
ass each time it rains?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The method is very simple,” says the pygmy. “They cut the tops off
my rubber boots.” David, take life very nonseriously. You are not going
to fall; there is nowhere to fall to.</p><p>Pope the Polack is on a pilgrimage when his plane crashes in the
Sahara. Only the pope and a nun survive. They are lucky to catch a camel
and start to ride it towards the nearest town, a hundred miles away. But
on the second day the camel drops dead.</p><p><br></p><p>As they wait for death, the pope sighs, “The only thing I regret,” he
says, “is that I have never seen a naked woman in my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All is pure to a pure man,” says the nun, and takes off her
clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope is amazed and blesses the nun for showing him. Then the nun
confesses her desire to see a man’s body before she dies.</p><p>Pope the Polack takes off his clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>The nun gazes at his prick. “What is that?” she asks. “that,” says
Pope the Polack, “is the giver of life.”</p><p>“The giver of life!” exclaims the nun, jumping up and down. “Well
then, stick it in the camel and let’s go home!”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

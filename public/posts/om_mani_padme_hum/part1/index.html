Its findings are of tremendous value. Om mani padme hum is one of the most beautiful expressions for the ultimate experience. Its meaning is “the sound of silence, the diamond in the lotus.”\nSilence also has its sound, its music... although the outer ears cannot hear it, just as the outer eyes cannot see it. We have six outer senses. In the past man knew only that we have five outer senses; the sixth is a new discovery. It is inside your ears; hence people failed to recognize it. It is the sense of balance. When you feel giddy or when you see a drunkard walking, it is the sense of balance that is affected.\nJust as these six senses are used to experience the outer, exactly the same six senses exist to experience the inner – to see it, to hear it, to feel its utter balance, its beauty. It is invisible to the outer eyes but not to the inner. You cannot touch it with your outer senses, but the inner senses are absolutely immersed in it.\nOM is the sound when everything else disappears from your being – no thought, no dream, no projections, no expectations, not even a single ripple – your whole lake of consciousness is simply\n2\nsilent; it has become just a mirror. In those rare moments you hear the sound of silence. It is the most valuable experience because it not only shows a quality of the inner music – it also shows that the inner is full of harmony, joy, blissfulness. All that is implied in the music of OM.\nYou are not to say it. If you say it you will miss the real thing. You have to hear it, you have to be utterly calm and quiet and suddenly it is all around you, a very subtle dance. And the moment you are able to hear it, you have entered into the very secrets of existence. You have become so subtle that now you deserve that all the mysteries be exposed to you.\nExistence waits till you are ready.\nIn the East all the religions without exception agree on this point, that the sound which is heard in the final, highest peak of silence is something similar to OM.\nThe word OM is not written alphabetically in any language of the East because it is not part of language. It is written as a symbol; hence the same symbol is used in Sanskrit, in Pali, in Prakrit, in Tibetan – everywhere the same symbol, because all the mystics of all the ages have reached to the same experience, that it is not part of our mundane world; hence it should not be written in letters. It should have its own symbol which is beyond language. It does not mean anything as far as mind is concerned, but it means tremendously much as far as your spiritual growth is concerned.\nAll music, particularly the classical music, has been trying to catch the sound of silence so that even people who have not entered into their beings can experience something similar. But the similar is not the same, it is a very faraway echo. Even the greatest musician has to use sounds, but howsoever beautifully he arranges them, he cannot be absolutely silent. He gives gaps of silence in between; the whole play is between sound and silence. Those who don’t understand hear the sounds, and those who understand hear the silence, the gaps between two sounds.\nThe real music is in the gaps.\nIt is not created by the musician – the musician is creating the sounds and leaving the gaps as a contrast, so that you can experience something of what happens to the mystic in his inner world.\nOM is one of the great achievements of the seekers of truth. There have been cases which are absolutely unbelievable, but they are historical.…\nWhen Marpa, a Tibetan mystic, died, his closest disciples were sitting all around him ... because the death of a mystic is as tremendously valuable as his life, perhaps more. If you can be close to the mystic when he is dying, you can experience many things, because his whole consciousness is leaving the body – and if you are alert and conscious, you can feel a new fragrance; you can see a new light, you can hear a new music.\nWhen Marpa died he was living in a temple. And all his disciples became suddenly surprised – they looked all around – from where is the sound of OM coming? Then finally they realized that it was not coming from anywhere – it was coming from Marpa! They heard it by putting their ears to his feet, to his hands, and they could not believe it – inside his whole body there was a vibration creating the sound of OM. He had been hearing that sound for his whole life since he became enlightened.\nBecause of his constant inner experience of the sound, the sound had entered even into his physical cells. Every fiber of his body had learned a certain synchronicity, the same wavelength.\nBut it has been experienced with other mystics also. The inner starts radiating, particularly at the moment of death when everything comes to a crescendo. But man is so blind and so utterly unintelligent: knowing that the mystics experience the music of silence within them and they name it OM, people started repeating OM as a mantra, thinking that by repeating it they will also be able to hear it.\nBy repeating it you will never be able to hear it. Your mind is functioning when you are repeating it. But perhaps I am the first person to tell it to you; otherwise for centuries people have been teaching: Repeat OM. That creates a false experience, and you can be lost in the false and you will never discover the real.\nI say to you not to repeat it but simply be silent and listen to it. As your mind becomes calm and quiet, suddenly you will become aware: like a whisper, the OM is arising within your being. When it arises on its own, it has a totally different quality. It transforms you.\nModern physics says that everything in the world is constituted of electrical energy. According to modern physics even sounds are nothing but electric waves. The physicists have been working from the outside.\nThe mystics say just the opposite, but I don’t see that they are contradictory. They say the whole existence is made up of the soundless sound OM. And even electricity or fire are nothing but a certain condensed form of the sound.\nIn the East it has been known: there have been musicians who could create by their music a flame on an unlit candle. As the music falls over the unlit candle suddenly the flame arises. It was a test in the ancient days, that unless a musician could create light, fire, flame, with his music he was still amateur. He was not recognized as a master.\nThe explanations of physics and the mystics look different, but perhaps there is some deeper source which can withdraw the contradiction and opposition. Perhaps it is only a different interpretation, because the mystic is coming from the inside and the physicist is looking at the outside. What the physicist feels as electricity, the mystic feels as the music of the whole existence. They are both saying the same thing in different languages. And if there is a choice, I would choose the mystic, because he is experiencing it in his very center. His experience is not just an experiment on objects, his experience is an experiment on his own consciousness. And consciousness is the very cream of existence.\nThis mantra has many secrets in it. The first wordless word is OM, and the last is HUM. The first is the flowering and the last is the seed.\nThe Sufis don’t use the whole name of Allah – that is the Mohammedan name for God. They use allah hoo, and slowly, slowly they change allah hoo into simply hoo, hoo. They have found that the sound of hoo strikes exactly at the life source just below the navel. You were connected with your life, with your mother, from the navel. Just below the navel is the source of your own life.\nJust try: when you say hoo the hit is below the navel. That’s what we are using in our Dynamic Meditation. It is a Sufi discovery, but it can also be done in the Tibetan way. Rather than hoo – hoo seems to be a little harsh – hum seems to be a little softer. But the softer will take a longer time to wake up your energies. It is possible that in the particular climate of Tibet, the softer was perfectly good. They did not need such a harsh sound in order to hit the life source. But in the harsh desert of Arabia where Sufi mystics started using hoo.…\nI had a choice when I was working on the Dynamic Meditation, whether to use hum or to choose hoo. I tried both and I found that perhaps in India, hoo is better than in the colder heights of Tibet where things are bound to be different. Just hum is perfectly right for them.\nHum is the hit to create OM in you.\nIf you hit the seed of your life it starts disappearing in the soil and green leaves, sprouts start growing. Between the two – OM and hum – is mani padme. I don’t think anybody has been able to express the ultimate experience, the ultimate beatitude, better than mani padme. You have to visualize it. The lotus flower in the East is the most beautiful, the biggest flower. And if you put diamonds on the lotus flower in the early morning sun, you will have a tremendously beautiful experience... the lotus flower with diamonds.\nIt is very difficult to say anything about the ultimate experience, but Tibetan mystics have tried the best. Many things have been said about it, but “diamond in the lotus” seems to be the best expression – because it is the greatest, most beautiful experience, and they have chosen two of the most beautiful things of the ordinary world, the lotus and the diamond. It is just a visual expression of the beauty that you come to see within yourself.\nThis mantra om mani padme hum has a whole philosophy within it. Start with hum, the last word, and the first will arise on its own accord. And when your inner being is filled with the sound of silence, you will also have the beautiful experience of seeing a lotus with a diamond in the early morning sun. The diamond is radiating. The lotus is so soft, so feminine, so delicate – it has no comparison in any other flower.\nIt became so important to the mystics... you must have seen Gautam Buddha’s statues sitting on a lotus. They are showing symbolically that he has reached the ultimate; his own inner lotus has flowered. And not only the lotus has flowered, the diamond hidden behind it, inside it... as it opens its petals, you find a Kohinoor. The diamond has a quality – that’s why it has been chosen. It is symbolic of eternity. The diamond is for ever, it knows no death; it is immortal. The experience is beautiful and eternal.\nBut unfortunately, Tibet has fallen into a darkness. Its monasteries have been closed, its seekers of truth have been forced to work in labor camps. The only country in the world which was working – a one-pointed genius, all its intelligence in the search for one’s own interiority and its treasures – has been stopped by the communist invasion of Tibet.\nAnd it is such an ugly world that nobody has objected to it. On the contrary, because China is big and powerful, even countries which are more powerful than China can ever be, like America, have accepted that Tibet belongs to China. That is sheer nonsense – just because China is powerful and\neverybody wants China to be on their side. Neither the Soviets nor America have challenged the claim of China. Leave America and the Soviets aside – even India has not objected. It was such a beautiful experiment, and Tibet had no weapons to fight with, they had no army to fight; they had never thought about it. Their whole thing was an introverted pilgrimage.\nNowhere has such concentrated effort been made to discover man’s being. Every family in Tibet used to give their eldest son to some monastery where he was to meditate and grow closer to awakening. It was a joy to every family that at least one of them was wholeheartedly, twenty-four hours a day, working on the inner being. They were also working but they could not give all their time; they had to create food and clothes and shelter, and in Tibet it is a difficult matter. The climate is not very helpful; to live in Tibet is a tremendous struggle. But still every family used to give their first-born child to the monastery.\nThere were hundreds of monasteries... and these monasteries should not be compared with any Catholic monasteries. These monasteries had no comparison in the whole world. These monasteries were concerned with only one thing: to make you aware of yourself.\nThousands of devices have been created down the centuries so that your lotus can blossom and you can find your ultimate treasure, the diamond. These are just symbolic words, but the destruction of Tibet should be known in history, particularly when man becomes a little more aware and humanity a little more humane.…\nThis is the greatest calamity of the twentieth century that Tibet has fallen into the hands of materialists who don’t believe that you have anything inside you. They believe that you are only matter and your consciousness is only a by-product of matter. And all this is simply without any experience of the inner – just logical, rational philosophizing.\nNot a single communist in the world has meditated, but it is strange – they all deny the inner. Nobody thinks about how the outer can exist if there is no inner. They exist together, they are inseparable. The outer is only a protection for the inner, because the inner is very delicate and soft. But the outer is accepted and the inner is denied. And even if sometimes it is accepted, the world is dominated by such dirty politicians that they use even the inner experiences for ugly ends.\nJust the other day, I came to know that America is now training its soldiers in meditation so that they can fight without any nervous breakdown, without going mad, without feeling any fear – so they can lie down in their ditches silently, calm and cool and collected. No meditator may have ever thought that meditation can also be used for fighting wars, but in the hands of politicians everything becomes ugly – even meditation. Now the army camps in America are teaching meditation so that their soldiers can be more calm and quiet while killing people.\nBut I want to warn America: you are playing with fire. You don’t understand exactly what meditation will do. Your soldiers will become so calm and quiet that they will throw away their weapons and they will simply refuse to kill. A meditator cannot kill; a meditator cannot be destructive. So they are going to be surprised one day that their soldiers are no longer interested in fighting. War, violence, murder, massacre of millions of people – this is not possible if a man knows something of meditation. Then he also knows not only himself, he knows the other whom he is killing. He is his brother. They all belong to the same oceanic existence.\nIn the Soviet Union, also, they are interested in meditation. But the purpose is the same – not realization of yourself, but making you stronger so that you can kill and bomb and use nuclear weapons and missiles to kill whole nations.\nBut they are both going on a dangerous path, unknowingly. It is good, they should be helped. Once meditation spreads among their soldiers, those soldiers will become sannyasins! So I am immensely happy that their idea is different, and they don’t know anything about meditation. They have only heard that it makes people calm and cool so they can fight without any fear, without looking back. Meditation gives them a feeling of immortality; hence their fear will disappear.\nBut meditation not only gives them the experience of their own immortality – it also gives them the experience that everybody is immortal. Death is a fiction. Why unnecessarily harass people? They will be living, you cannot kill them. Not even your nuclear weapons are going to kill them.\nKrishna, in the Gita, has a beautiful statement: Nainam chhindanti shastrani; naham dahati pavakahr. “Neither can any weapon destroy me nor can any fire burn me.” Yes the body will be burned, but I am not the body.…\nMeditation gives you the feel, for the first time, of your authentic reality.\nIf humanity were a little more aware, Tibet should be made free because it is the only country which has devoted almost two thousand years to doing nothing but going deeper into meditation. And it can teach the whole world something which is immensely needed.\nBut Communist China is trying to destroy everything that has been created in two thousand years. All their devices, all their methods of meditation, their whole spiritual climate is being polluted, poisoned. And they are simple people; they cannot defend themselves. They don’t have anything to defend themselves with – no tanks, no bombs, no airplanes, no army. An innocent race which has lived without any war for two thousand years... It disturbs nobody; it is so far away from everybody – even to reach there is a difficult task. They live on the very roof of the world. The highest mountains, eternal snows, are their home. Leave them alone! China will not lose anything, but the whole world will be benefited by their experience.\nAnd the world will need their experience. The world is getting fed up with money, power, prestige, all that scientific technology has created – people are getting fed up. They are finished with it. People in the advanced countries are no longer interested in sex, are no longer interested in drugs. Things are falling away, and a strange despair like a dark cloud is descending on the advanced countries – of deep frustration, meaninglessness, and anguish. They will all need a different climate of meditation to dispel all these clouds and bring again a new day into their lives, a new dawn, a new experience of themselves, a discovery of their original being.\nTibet should be left as an experimental lab for man’s inner search. But not a single nation in the world has raised its voice against this ugly attack on Tibet. And China has not only attacked it, they have amalgamated it into their map. Now, on the modern Chinese map, Tibet is their territory.\nAnd we think the world is civilized, where innocent people who are not doing any harm to anybody are simply destroyed. And with them, something of great importance to all humanity is also\ndestroyed. If there were something civilized in man, every nation would have stood against the invasion of Tibet by China. It is the invasion of matter against consciousness; it is the invasion of materialism against spiritual heights.\nManeesha, the word mantra is untranslatable in English, in any Western language, but its meaning, its significance, can be explained to you. A mantra is not just something to chant. It is not chanting. A mantra is something to let sink deep in your being, just as roots go deep into the earth. The deeper the roots go into the earth, the higher the tree will go into the sky. A mantra is something like a seed to be allowed to go deep into your being so that it can send its roots to the sources of your life and finally to the universal life. Then its branches, its foliage will go high into the sky, and when the right time comes, when the spring comes, it will be filled with thousands of flowers.\nUnless a tree blossoms, it knows no blissfulness. It goes on feeling something is missing. You may have all the pleasures and comforts and luxuries of the world, but unless you know yourself, unless your inner lotus opens, you will go on missing something. You may not be certain what you are missing but a feeling... that something is being missed, that “I am not complete,” that “I am not whole,” that “I am not what existence wanted me to be.” This “missing” feeling goes on nagging everybody. Only the expansion of your consciousness will help you to get rid of this feeling, of this nagging, of this anguish, this angst.\nEven people like Jaspers, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, the highest geniuses of the West, are agreed on a few things: that life is nothing but boredom, that life is nothing but anxiety, anguish, that life is accidental, it has no significance... that it is absolutely futile to search for any blissful space; there exists none. And when great philosophers like these agree on such points, the ordinary masses simply follow them.\nWhatever they are saying is absolutely wrong, because none of them has ever meditated, none of them has entered into his own subjectivity. They are just in their heads. They have not even moved to their hearts, what to say about their beings? What to say about their disappearing into the universal?\nUnless you disappear into the universal ocean just like a dewdrop, you will not find significance. You will not find your real dignity. You will not find that existence showers so much joy and so much celebration on you that you cannot contain it; you have to share it. You become a raincloud which is so much burdened with rain that it has to shower. A man of deep insight, a man of intuition, a man who has reached to his being becomes a raincloud. He is not just a blessing to himself, he becomes a blessing to the whole world.\nThis Tibetan mantra om mani padme hum is a condensed form of the whole inner pilgrimage. It says how to start, what will happen when the flower opens, what will be your ultimate experience of your inner treasures.\nEastern languages are very rich in the sense that they have made very condensed statements which can be unfolded into big scriptures. The reason was that when these mantras were created there was no writing. People had to remember them. When people have to remember them, you have to be very telegraphic, as condensed as possible. Once writing came into existence, that condensedness disappeared. Now you can explain with page after page of writing. But have you\never thought that when you receive a long letter... the longer the letter, the less is the meaning. But when you receive a telegram, naturally... just eight or ten words, but the meaning is immense and the impact is immense.\nThese are telegrams. They can easily be remembered, they can be passed from one generation to another generation without any fear that they will be distorted.\nYou have not to repeat the mantra, you have to understand its meaning and let that meaning sink into you. Sitting silently, be utterly quiet, unmoving. Watch your mind. A few thoughts will be there, but as you become silent those thoughts will disappear, and suddenly you hear a humming sound all around you.\nThat humming sound is not made by you. It is at the very center of existence.\nIt is the sound of the skies. It is the sound of space.\nIt is the sound of the universe; it is its indication of aliveness. It is vibrating with dance and music. This OM is perhaps the greatest symbol in the whole world.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED MASTER,\nCAN IT BE THAT CRYING IS MY CELEBRATION AT THE MOMENT? WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, MY HEART IS TURNING INSIDE OUT AND A WHOLE MONSOON IS BREAKING LOOSE, LEAVING ME HELPLESS.\nBELOVED MASTER, WHO IS IT THAT IS CRYING?\nDeva Paro, it looks a little strange but it is true: you can transform anything into a celebration. Just as you can transform any celebration into a miserable affair – it all depends on you.\nI have heard, in a small school the drawing teacher made a painting on the board. He was a good painter, and he was showing his students that the artist can change, just by a little touch, the whole meaning of the painting.\nIt was a portrait of a man, very sad. He touched the lips and immediately the sadness disappeared from the painting – the man was smiling. And as the man started smiling, the whole painting had a different perspective.\nJust then a little boy stood up and said, “This is nothing.” The painter said, “What do you mean this is nothing?”\nHe said, “My mother, just giving me a slap, changes the whole world! I may be smiling and when she hits I start crying, and when I look all around it looks so sad. You need a brush and the painting and all this; my mother needs nothing.”\nYou are saying, “Can it be that crying is my celebration?” If you feel blissful in crying, there is no harm. It is perfectly beautiful. Tears can be of joy, of love. Tears can show that you are overfilled with something that starts flowing through the tears. It need not be sadness, it need not be mourning; it can be festivity. It all depends on you. And you have to feel what it is, because you will be absolutely certain whether your tears are coming out of frustration, out of sadness, out of failure, or they are coming out of love, joy, gratitude, prayer.\nTears are one of the most mysterious things you have. They can have all the colors of the rainbow. It depends on your consciousness what colors you give to them.\nI have heard a very beautiful story. It is Julius Caesar’s birthday, and after breakfast the Roman senators are eager for him to take a chariot ride with them to view their present to him.\nCaesar is delighted to find the whole of the driveway to the imperial palace is lined with crucified Christians. As they drive along, Caesar brings the procession to a sudden halt. “That man there!” he cries. “He must be alive – his lips are moving. I want to hear what he is saying.”\nThe senators raise Caesar on their shoulders. “Closer, closer!” he shouts. “I can’t hear.” Finally, with his ear almost touching the man’s lips, he hears, “Happy birthday to you.”\nOne can change every situation. Now he is being crucified, but he has no complaint. Within minutes he may be dead, but his heart wants to say, “Happy birthday to you.”\nAnd he must have embarrassed Caesar; he must have created a deep impression on him. From that day onwards, Christians were not crucified again in Caesar’s time. He felt so humble. He felt so sorry about what he was doing to these beautiful people, who are capable of rejoicing in his birthday and are being crucified as a present.\nIt all depends on you, Paro.\nOld man Finkelstein suspects that his butler has been stealing cigars and shouts to him in the next room, “James, you have been stealing my cigars.” There is no answer so he repeats it louder. There is still no answer, so he goes into the next room and confronts his servant. “James,” he says, “didn’t you hear me speaking to you just now?”\n“No, sir,” replies the butler, “there must be something wrong with the acoustics.”\n“Really,” says Finkelstein. “Well, you go next door and say something and we will see whether I can hear it.”\nJames goes into the next room and yells out at the top of his voice, “Some fat son-of-a-bitch has been screwing around with my wife.”\nHe then returns. “Did you hear me, sir?” he asks nonchalantly.\n“You are right, James” replies Finkelstein, blushing, “I could not hear a word. Have a cigar.”\nIf you are feeling blissful, peaceful, silent in your crying, in your tears, and if after tears you feel relaxed, relieved of some burden, it is perfectly good. Don’t try to stop it... because humanity has been given such wrong training about so many things that it has not left any human being natural. Everybody has become artificial, and particularly men – every society has forced them not to cry; it is against your manliness.\nIt is okay for women to cry and weep. They don’t belong to your status, they are second class citizens. But you, being first class, should show your strength. Your tears expose your weakness. But if you go on for thousands of years teaching every child such nonsense, he starts holding his tears back. Nobody wants to be exposed as a weakling. But the simple truth is, nature has given you exactly the same glands for tears as nature has given to women.\nAnd if nature is listened to, then stopping your tears is a dangerous thing. It is not only tears that will be stopped – you will become less sensitive, you will become less loving. You will become harder, you will become cruel, you will become a sadist. This will be the outcome of a simple thing. You will go neurotic, psychotic – four times more men end up in insane asylums than women. And the reason is that women know how to cry and weep. They know how to let their burdens and tensions be relieved through tears.\nMan goes on accumulating and one day it is too late. Then either he jumps from a sixty-storey building and finishes himself off...\nThere are strange people. A man jumped from the eightieth floor and he passed the window where one of his friends was standing. The friend said, “Goodbye,” and the man also waved his hand. And soon he was flat on the ground, finished.\nPeople came running to his friend and said, “Have you seen anything?” And he said, “Yes.”\nThey said, “Your friend has committed suicide!”\nHe said, “This is strange, because just a few minutes before, he was perfectly okay. While he was passing my window, we even said hello to each other.”\nMan has been prevented from being natural so that he can be made into a soldier, so that he can be made into a harder personality, to compete in the world. Because the woman was not going to compete in the world, and she was not going to wars either, there was no need. She could be allowed to cry and weep. It became a distinction, that it is manly not to weep, not to cry.\nIt is simply against nature. The women don’t go so mad because in their tears they are throwing away all their tensions. They don’t accumulate to such a point that it is beyond their capacity to control it and everything goes through a breakdown.\nExactly four times more men commit suicide, although at least forty times more women threaten to commit suicide. But they don’t. Women have remained in a way closer to nature because they were deprived from participating in man’s power struggle. In disguise, this curse proved a blessing.\nMan made himself more and more tense, neurotic – and then there comes a point where life becomes so heavy, each moment such a torture, that it is better to commit suicide.\nWomen just talk about it. Even if sometimes they try with sleeping pills – not jumping from buildings, because that is dangerous – they will take just a few sleeping pills which will be enough to harass the husband and will make him more henpecked, because he will remain always alert that the whole neighborhood condemns him...”You must be treating your wife badly; otherwise why does she try to commit suicide?” The doctor is angry, and the wife is enjoying a good sleep! Once in a while a woman, just by mistake, takes too many pills – it is not really the intention, just a mistake.\nIt is good, Paro, to enjoy your tears. And don’t keep them only for tensions and anxieties and frustrations and moments of sadness. No, that is using them in a wrong way. Use them when you are in love. Use them when you are feeling peaceful. Use them when you see a beautiful sunset.\nWhat can be said to the sunset? It won’t understand any language. But your tears, perhaps, will be understood. When you see a beautiful flower, how can you resist having a few tears that existence is so beautiful? If you see a Gautam Buddha and you don’t have tears in your eyes, then you are behaving inhumanly, unnaturally. Seeing Gautam Buddha, you should be in such a celebration – at least one of us has reached to the ultimate potential of his being, and he is a proof that we can also reach.\nYou are also saying, Paro, “When I look at you my heart is turning inside out and a whole monsoon is breaking loose, leaving me helpless. Who is it that is crying?”\nIt is your original being. The false never cries. The hypocrite never cries. It is only the original, the authentic.\nThis is the whole purpose of the communion that is happening here – to fall into a synchronicity with my heart. Naturally your heart will have to change. It will have to take a new rhythm, a new harmony, a new wavelength. And it is natural to feel helpless because you have been told that tears are a sign of weakness, helplessness.\nTears are your strength, not helplessness.\nTears show that you are alive, that you have not shrunk and lost all your juice. Tears show that your heart still feels, still can dance, still can rejoice.\nThere is a statue of Mahavira in Rajasthan. It is very famous because it is made of a very strange stone – which is not found in India, but is found in Africa. Somebody must have brought that stone. But in India it has become a miracle because it perspires; tears flow from the eyes. And the people who follow Mahavira, naturally, are deeply impressed. They think perhaps he is weeping for us out of compassion.\nOne woman had come to me and she said, “I have never been impressed by anything so much as the tears coming from a stone statue of Mahavira.”\nI said, “You don’t understand; I have seen the statue...” The statue is in the middle of the lake – a small temple, an open temple, just pillars. And because the statue is porous, when the vapors are rising from the lake because of the hot sun – and Rajasthan is very hot, it is a desert – that porous statue goes on soaking up much of the vapor that is moving around. You will not find that statue in summer with tears or perspiration or anything, but in winter when it is cold the vapors that it has soaked up start becoming water again. Because of the coldness, they start coming out of the rock.\nI told the woman, “You are impressed by it, and you are not impressed by millions of people who cry? And that stone is not doing anything as far as compassion is concerned; it is just that this kind of stone is not available in India.”\nShe was very much shocked because I hurt her religious feelings. I said, “I am not hurting your religious feelings. I am simply making you aware that if you can be so much impressed by the tears of a stone statue, what about living human beings?”\nBut tears are taboo – one of the things that have been repressed. Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying that he smiles because he is afraid if he does not smile he will start crying and tears will come to his eyes. His smile is just a protection; it keeps him occupied, he remains with a false smile so that authentic tears cannot come out. Naturally, for a German, it is a question of manliness. How can a German cry and weep and have tears?\nBut more or less all men around the world are Germans. They are all male oriented, trying to impose a supremacy of men over women. But I say unto you, your tears are far more valuable than man’s domination. His supremacy is nothing. He has suffered much because of this stupid attitude. Allow those tears. They are not of helplessness, they are of tremendous joy.\nAnd you ask, “Who is it that is crying?” It is you in your originality, not you in your personality. “I am leaving home,” shouts Giovanni to his parents. “I want wine, women, adventure.”\nHis old father gets up out of his chair.\n“And don’t you try to stop me,” cries Giovanni.\n“Who’s trying to stop you?” exclaims the old man. “I’m coming with you!”\nJust be a little more understanding of all your sentiments, emotions – they all have a certain place in the total harmony of your being. But we have been kept almost blind to our own potentialities, dimensions. Be a little more alert about everything, and remember that the natural is the superior and the unnatural is phony and American.\nRabbi Finklebaum had never gambled in his life, so one day he went to the horse races just for the experience. Before the first race he saw a priest making some strange sign over a horse and then watched the priest put ten dollars on the horse to win. And sure enough, the horse won the race.\nSo he followed the priest and watched him make signs over another horse. This time the rabbi went off and put fifty dollars on the horse and it won at ten to one.\nAgain he followed the priest and saw him make weird signs over another horse, so he went off and put all the five hundred dollars he had won on the previous race on this horse. He ran up into the stand to watch the race, hoping to make a fortune, but this time the horse he had backed fell at the first fence and died.\nThe rabbi ran off and found the priest. “Look here,” said the rabbi, “what was the meaning of all that? The first two horses you made signs over won, and then the third one fell at the first fence and I lost all my money. What is going on?”\n“I am sorry, rabbi,” said the priest, “but I can’t help it if you don’t know the difference between a blessing and the last rites.”\nThere is so much misunderstanding. You don’t know what is real, what is unreal. You don’t know what has been imposed on you by others and what you have brought from existence itself as a gift.\nYou have to discriminate, and always choose the natural. Even if it goes against all traditions, all religions, all cultures, don’t be worried: except the natural, there is no authentic religiousness anywhere. Except the existential, there is nothing holy that you can find... in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Gita.\nJust watch – inside you is nature, inside you is the existential. Always follow it, and you will never be going wrong. To be natural, to be in tune with existence, is the only authentic spirituality.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6772","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/>Om Mani Padme Hum</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 The music of OM</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6772 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

MANI PADME HUM”?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the only country in the world which has devoted all its
genius to the inner exploration is Tibet. Its findings are of tremendous
value. Om mani padme hum is one of the most beautiful expressions for
the ultimate experience. Its meaning is “the sound of silence, the
diamond in the lotus.”</p><p><br></p><p>Silence also has its sound, its music... although the outer ears
cannot hear it, just as the outer eyes cannot see it. We have six outer
senses. In the past man knew only that we have five outer senses; the
sixth is a new discovery. It is inside your ears; hence people failed to
recognize it. It is the sense of balance. When you feel giddy or when
you see a drunkard walking, it is the sense of balance that is
affected.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as these six senses are used to experience the outer, exactly
the same six senses exist to experience the inner – to see it, to hear
it, to feel its utter balance, its beauty. It is invisible to the outer
eyes but not to the inner. You cannot touch it with your outer senses,
but the inner senses are absolutely immersed in it.</p><p><br></p><p>OM is the sound when everything else disappears from your being – no
thought, no dream, no projections, no expectations, not even a single
ripple – your whole lake of consciousness is simply</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>silent; it has become just a mirror. In those rare moments you hear
the sound of silence. It is the most valuable experience because it not
only shows a quality of the inner music – it also shows that the inner
is full of harmony, joy, blissfulness. All that is implied in the music
of OM.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to say it. If you say it you will miss the real thing.
You have to hear it, you have to be utterly calm and quiet and suddenly
it is all around you, a very subtle dance. And the moment you are able
to hear it, you have entered into the very secrets of existence. You
have become so subtle that now you deserve that all the mysteries be
exposed to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence waits till you are ready.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East all the religions without exception agree on this point,
that the sound which is heard in the final, highest peak of silence is
something similar to OM.</p><p><br></p><p>The word OM is not written alphabetically in any language of the East
because it is not part of language. It is written as a symbol; hence the
same symbol is used in Sanskrit, in Pali, in Prakrit, in Tibetan –
everywhere the same symbol, because all the mystics of all the ages have
reached to the same experience, that it is not part of our mundane
world; hence it should not be written in letters. It should have its own
symbol which is beyond language. It does not mean anything as far as
mind is concerned, but it means tremendously much as far as your
spiritual growth is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>All music, particularly the classical music, has been trying to catch
the sound of silence so that even people who have not entered into their
beings can experience something similar. But the similar is not the
same, it is a very faraway echo. Even the greatest musician has to use
sounds, but howsoever beautifully he arranges them, he cannot be
absolutely silent. He gives gaps of silence in between; the whole play
is between sound and silence. Those who don’t understand hear the
sounds, and those who understand hear the silence, the gaps between two
sounds.</p><p><br></p><p>The real music is in the gaps.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not created by the musician – the musician is creating the
sounds and leaving the gaps as a contrast, so that you can experience
something of what happens to the mystic in his inner world.</p><p><br></p><p>OM is one of the great achievements of the seekers of truth. There
have been cases which are absolutely unbelievable, but they are
historical.…</p><p><br></p><p>When Marpa, a Tibetan mystic, died, his closest disciples were
sitting all around him ... because the death of a mystic is as
tremendously valuable as his life, perhaps more. If you can be close to
the mystic when he is dying, you can experience many things, because his
whole consciousness is leaving the body – and if you are alert and
conscious, you can feel a new fragrance; you can see a new light, you
can hear a new music.</p><p><br></p><p>When Marpa died he was living in a temple. And all his disciples
became suddenly surprised – they looked all around – from where is the
sound of OM coming? Then finally they realized that it was not coming
from anywhere – it was coming from Marpa! They heard it by putting their
ears to his feet, to his hands, and they could not believe it – inside
his whole body there was a vibration creating the sound of OM. He had
been hearing that sound for his whole life since he became
enlightened.</p><p>Because of his constant inner experience of the sound, the sound had
entered even into his physical cells. Every fiber of his body had
learned a certain synchronicity, the same wavelength.</p><p><br></p><p>But it has been experienced with other mystics also. The inner starts
radiating, particularly at the moment of death when everything comes to
a crescendo. But man is so blind and so utterly unintelligent: knowing
that the mystics experience the music of silence within them and they
name it OM, people started repeating OM as a mantra, thinking that by
repeating it they will also be able to hear it.</p><p><br></p><p>By repeating it you will never be able to hear it. Your mind is
functioning when you are repeating it. But perhaps I am the first person
to tell it to you; otherwise for centuries people have been teaching:
Repeat OM. That creates a false experience, and you can be lost in the
false and you will never discover the real.</p><p><br></p><p>I say to you not to repeat it but simply be silent and listen to it.
As your mind becomes calm and quiet, suddenly you will become aware:
like a whisper, the OM is arising within your being. When it arises on
its own, it has a totally different quality. It transforms you.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern physics says that everything in the world is constituted of
electrical energy. According to modern physics even sounds are nothing
but electric waves. The physicists have been working from the
outside.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystics say just the opposite, but I don’t see that they are
contradictory. They say the whole existence is made up of the soundless
sound OM. And even electricity or fire are nothing but a certain
condensed form of the sound.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East it has been known: there have been musicians who could
create by their music a flame on an unlit candle. As the music falls
over the unlit candle suddenly the flame arises. It was a test in the
ancient days, that unless a musician could create light, fire, flame,
with his music he was still amateur. He was not recognized as a
master.</p><p><br></p><p>The explanations of physics and the mystics look different, but
perhaps there is some deeper source which can withdraw the contradiction
and opposition. Perhaps it is only a different interpretation, because
the mystic is coming from the inside and the physicist is looking at the
outside. What the physicist feels as electricity, the mystic feels as
the music of the whole existence. They are both saying the same thing in
different languages. And if there is a choice, I would choose the
mystic, because he is experiencing it in his very center. His experience
is not just an experiment on objects, his experience is an experiment on
his own consciousness. And consciousness is the very cream of
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This mantra has many secrets in it. The first wordless word is OM,
and the last is HUM. The first is the flowering and the last is the
seed.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sufis don’t use the whole name of Allah – that is the Mohammedan
name for God. They use allah hoo, and slowly, slowly they change allah
hoo into simply hoo, hoo. They have found that the sound of hoo strikes
exactly at the life source just below the navel. You were connected with
your life, with your mother, from the navel. Just below the navel is the
source of your own life.</p><p>Just try: when you say hoo the hit is below the navel. That’s what we
are using in our Dynamic Meditation. It is a Sufi discovery, but it can
also be done in the Tibetan way. Rather than hoo – hoo seems to be a
little harsh – hum seems to be a little softer. But the softer will take
a longer time to wake up your energies. It is possible that in the
particular climate of Tibet, the softer was perfectly good. They did not
need such a harsh sound in order to hit the life source. But in the
harsh desert of Arabia where Sufi mystics started using hoo.…</p><p><br></p><p>I had a choice when I was working on the Dynamic Meditation, whether
to use hum or to choose hoo. I tried both and I found that perhaps in
India, hoo is better than in the colder heights of Tibet where things
are bound to be different. Just hum is perfectly right for them.</p><p><br></p><p>Hum is the hit to create OM in you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you hit the seed of your life it starts disappearing in the soil
and green leaves, sprouts start growing. Between the two – OM and hum –
is mani padme. I don’t think anybody has been able to express the
ultimate experience, the ultimate beatitude, better than mani padme. You
have to visualize it. The lotus flower in the East is the most
beautiful, the biggest flower. And if you put diamonds on the lotus
flower in the early morning sun, you will have a tremendously beautiful
experience... the lotus flower with diamonds.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult to say anything about the ultimate experience,
but Tibetan mystics have tried the best. Many things have been said
about it, but “diamond in the lotus” seems to be the best expression –
because it is the greatest, most beautiful experience, and they have
chosen two of the most beautiful things of the ordinary world, the lotus
and the diamond. It is just a visual expression of the beauty that you
come to see within yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This mantra om mani padme hum has a whole philosophy within it. Start
with hum, the last word, and the first will arise on its own accord. And
when your inner being is filled with the sound of silence, you will also
have the beautiful experience of seeing a lotus with a diamond in the
early morning sun. The diamond is radiating. The lotus is so soft, so
feminine, so delicate – it has no comparison in any other flower.</p><p><br></p><p>It became so important to the mystics... you must have seen Gautam
Buddha’s statues sitting on a lotus. They are showing symbolically that
he has reached the ultimate; his own inner lotus has flowered. And not
only the lotus has flowered, the diamond hidden behind it, inside it...
as it opens its petals, you find a Kohinoor. The diamond has a quality –
that’s why it has been chosen. It is symbolic of eternity. The diamond
is for ever, it knows no death; it is immortal. The experience is
beautiful and eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>But unfortunately, Tibet has fallen into a darkness. Its monasteries
have been closed, its seekers of truth have been forced to work in labor
camps. The only country in the world which was working – a one-pointed
genius, all its intelligence in the search for one’s own interiority and
its treasures – has been stopped by the communist invasion of Tibet.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is such an ugly world that nobody has objected to it. On the
contrary, because China is big and powerful, even countries which are
more powerful than China can ever be, like America, have accepted that
Tibet belongs to China. That is sheer nonsense – just because China is
powerful and</p><p>everybody wants China to be on their side. Neither the Soviets nor
America have challenged the claim of China. Leave America and the
Soviets aside – even India has not objected. It was such a beautiful
experiment, and Tibet had no weapons to fight with, they had no army to
fight; they had never thought about it. Their whole thing was an
introverted pilgrimage.</p><p><br></p><p>Nowhere has such concentrated effort been made to discover man’s
being. Every family in Tibet used to give their eldest son to some
monastery where he was to meditate and grow closer to awakening. It was
a joy to every family that at least one of them was wholeheartedly,
twenty-four hours a day, working on the inner being. They were also
working but they could not give all their time; they had to create food
and clothes and shelter, and in Tibet it is a difficult matter. The
climate is not very helpful; to live in Tibet is a tremendous struggle.
But still every family used to give their first-born child to the
monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>There were hundreds of monasteries... and these monasteries should
not be compared with any Catholic monasteries. These monasteries had no
comparison in the whole world. These monasteries were concerned with
only one thing: to make you aware of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of devices have been created down the centuries so that
your lotus can blossom and you can find your ultimate treasure, the
diamond. These are just symbolic words, but the destruction of Tibet
should be known in history, particularly when man becomes a little more
aware and humanity a little more humane.…</p><p><br></p><p>This is the greatest calamity of the twentieth century that Tibet has
fallen into the hands of materialists who don’t believe that you have
anything inside you. They believe that you are only matter and your
consciousness is only a by-product of matter. And all this is simply
without any experience of the inner – just logical, rational
philosophizing.</p><p><br></p><p>Not a single communist in the world has meditated, but it is strange
– they all deny the inner. Nobody thinks about how the outer can exist
if there is no inner. They exist together, they are inseparable. The
outer is only a protection for the inner, because the inner is very
delicate and soft. But the outer is accepted and the inner is denied.
And even if sometimes it is accepted, the world is dominated by such
dirty politicians that they use even the inner experiences for ugly
ends.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, I came to know that America is now training its
soldiers in meditation so that they can fight without any nervous
breakdown, without going mad, without feeling any fear – so they can lie
down in their ditches silently, calm and cool and collected. No
meditator may have ever thought that meditation can also be used for
fighting wars, but in the hands of politicians everything becomes ugly –
even meditation. Now the army camps in America are teaching meditation
so that their soldiers can be more calm and quiet while killing
people.</p><p><br></p><p>But I want to warn America: you are playing with fire. You don’t
understand exactly what meditation will do. Your soldiers will become so
calm and quiet that they will throw away their weapons and they will
simply refuse to kill. A meditator cannot kill; a meditator cannot be
destructive. So they are going to be surprised one day that their
soldiers are no longer interested in fighting. War, violence, murder,
massacre of millions of people – this is not possible if a man knows
something of meditation. Then he also knows not only himself, he knows
the other whom he is killing. He is his brother. They all belong to the
same oceanic existence.</p><p>In the Soviet Union, also, they are interested in meditation. But the
purpose is the same – not realization of yourself, but making you
stronger so that you can kill and bomb and use nuclear weapons and
missiles to kill whole nations.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are both going on a dangerous path, unknowingly. It is good,
they should be helped. Once meditation spreads among their soldiers,
those soldiers will become sannyasins! So I am immensely happy that
their idea is different, and they don’t know anything about meditation.
They have only heard that it makes people calm and cool so they can
fight without any fear, without looking back. Meditation gives them a
feeling of immortality; hence their fear will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>But meditation not only gives them the experience of their own
immortality – it also gives them the experience that everybody is
immortal. Death is a fiction. Why unnecessarily harass people? They will
be living, you cannot kill them. Not even your nuclear weapons are going
to kill them.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna, in the Gita, has a beautiful statement: Nainam chhindanti
shastrani; naham dahati pavakahr. “Neither can any weapon destroy me nor
can any fire burn me.” Yes the body will be burned, but I am not the
body.…</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation gives you the feel, for the first time, of your authentic
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>If humanity were a little more aware, Tibet should be made free
because it is the only country which has devoted almost two thousand
years to doing nothing but going deeper into meditation. And it can
teach the whole world something which is immensely needed.</p><p><br></p><p>But Communist China is trying to destroy everything that has been
created in two thousand years. All their devices, all their methods of
meditation, their whole spiritual climate is being polluted, poisoned.
And they are simple people; they cannot defend themselves. They don’t
have anything to defend themselves with – no tanks, no bombs, no
airplanes, no army. An innocent race which has lived without any war for
two thousand years... It disturbs nobody; it is so far away from
everybody – even to reach there is a difficult task. They live on the
very roof of the world. The highest mountains, eternal snows, are their
home. Leave them alone! China will not lose anything, but the whole
world will be benefited by their experience.</p><p><br></p><p>And the world will need their experience. The world is getting fed up
with money, power, prestige, all that scientific technology has created
– people are getting fed up. They are finished with it. People in the
advanced countries are no longer interested in sex, are no longer
interested in drugs. Things are falling away, and a strange despair like
a dark cloud is descending on the advanced countries – of deep
frustration, meaninglessness, and anguish. They will all need a
different climate of meditation to dispel all these clouds and bring
again a new day into their lives, a new dawn, a new experience of
themselves, a discovery of their original being.</p><p><br></p><p>Tibet should be left as an experimental lab for man’s inner search.
But not a single nation in the world has raised its voice against this
ugly attack on Tibet. And China has not only attacked it, they have
amalgamated it into their map. Now, on the modern Chinese map, Tibet is
their territory.</p><p><br></p><p>And we think the world is civilized, where innocent people who are
not doing any harm to anybody are simply destroyed. And with them,
something of great importance to all humanity is also</p><p>destroyed. If there were something civilized in man, every nation
would have stood against the invasion of Tibet by China. It is the
invasion of matter against consciousness; it is the invasion of
materialism against spiritual heights.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the word mantra is untranslatable in English, in any
Western language, but its meaning, its significance, can be explained to
you. A mantra is not just something to chant. It is not chanting. A
mantra is something to let sink deep in your being, just as roots go
deep into the earth. The deeper the roots go into the earth, the higher
the tree will go into the sky. A mantra is something like a seed to be
allowed to go deep into your being so that it can send its roots to the
sources of your life and finally to the universal life. Then its
branches, its foliage will go high into the sky, and when the right time
comes, when the spring comes, it will be filled with thousands of
flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless a tree blossoms, it knows no blissfulness. It goes on feeling
something is missing. You may have all the pleasures and comforts and
luxuries of the world, but unless you know yourself, unless your inner
lotus opens, you will go on missing something. You may not be certain
what you are missing but a feeling... that something is being missed,
that “I am not complete,” that “I am not whole,” that “I am not what
existence wanted me to be.” This “missing” feeling goes on nagging
everybody. Only the expansion of your consciousness will help you to get
rid of this feeling, of this nagging, of this anguish, this angst.</p><p><br></p><p>Even people like Jaspers, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Marcel, Jean-Paul
Sartre, the highest geniuses of the West, are agreed on a few things:
that life is nothing but boredom, that life is nothing but anxiety,
anguish, that life is accidental, it has no significance... that it is
absolutely futile to search for any blissful space; there exists none.
And when great philosophers like these agree on such points, the
ordinary masses simply follow them.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever they are saying is absolutely wrong, because none of them
has ever meditated, none of them has entered into his own subjectivity.
They are just in their heads. They have not even moved to their hearts,
what to say about their beings? What to say about their disappearing
into the universal?</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you disappear into the universal ocean just like a dewdrop,
you will not find significance. You will not find your real dignity. You
will not find that existence showers so much joy and so much celebration
on you that you cannot contain it; you have to share it. You become a
raincloud which is so much burdened with rain that it has to shower. A
man of deep insight, a man of intuition, a man who has reached to his
being becomes a raincloud. He is not just a blessing to himself, he
becomes a blessing to the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>This Tibetan mantra om mani padme hum is a condensed form of the
whole inner pilgrimage. It says how to start, what will happen when the
flower opens, what will be your ultimate experience of your inner
treasures.</p><p><br></p><p>Eastern languages are very rich in the sense that they have made very
condensed statements which can be unfolded into big scriptures. The
reason was that when these mantras were created there was no writing.
People had to remember them. When people have to remember them, you have
to be very telegraphic, as condensed as possible. Once writing came into
existence, that condensedness disappeared. Now you can explain with page
after page of writing. But have you</p><p>ever thought that when you receive a long letter... the longer the
letter, the less is the meaning. But when you receive a telegram,
naturally... just eight or ten words, but the meaning is immense and the
impact is immense.</p><p><br></p><p>These are telegrams. They can easily be remembered, they can be
passed from one generation to another generation without any fear that
they will be distorted.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not to repeat the mantra, you have to understand its meaning
and let that meaning sink into you. Sitting silently, be utterly quiet,
unmoving. Watch your mind. A few thoughts will be there, but as you
become silent those thoughts will disappear, and suddenly you hear a
humming sound all around you.</p><p><br></p><p>That humming sound is not made by you. It is at the very center of
existence.</p><p>It is the sound of the skies. It is the sound of space.</p><p>It is the sound of the universe; it is its indication of aliveness.
It is vibrating with dance and music. This OM is perhaps the greatest
symbol in the whole world.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>CAN IT BE THAT CRYING IS MY CELEBRATION AT THE MOMENT? WHEN I LOOK AT
YOU, MY HEART IS TURNING INSIDE OUT AND A WHOLE MONSOON IS BREAKING
LOOSE, LEAVING ME HELPLESS.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, WHO IS IT THAT IS CRYING?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Paro, it looks a little strange but it is true: you can
transform anything into a celebration. Just as you can transform any
celebration into a miserable affair – it all depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, in a small school the drawing teacher made a painting
on the board. He was a good painter, and he was showing his students
that the artist can change, just by a little touch, the whole meaning of
the painting.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a portrait of a man, very sad. He touched the lips and
immediately the sadness disappeared from the painting – the man was
smiling. And as the man started smiling, the whole painting had a
different perspective.</p><p>Just then a little boy stood up and said, “This is nothing.” The
painter said, “What do you mean this is nothing?”</p><p>He said, “My mother, just giving me a slap, changes the whole world!
I may be smiling and when she hits I start crying, and when I look all
around it looks so sad. You need a brush and the painting and all this;
my mother needs nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “Can it be that crying is my celebration?” If you
feel blissful in crying, there is no harm. It is perfectly beautiful.
Tears can be of joy, of love. Tears can show that you are overfilled
with something that starts flowing through the tears. It need not be
sadness, it need not be mourning; it can be festivity. It all depends on
you. And you have to feel what it is, because you will be absolutely
certain whether your tears are coming out of frustration, out of
sadness, out of failure, or they are coming out of love, joy, gratitude,
prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears are one of the most mysterious things you have. They can have
all the colors of the rainbow. It depends on your consciousness what
colors you give to them.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a very beautiful story. It is Julius Caesar’s birthday,
and after breakfast the Roman senators are eager for him to take a
chariot ride with them to view their present to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Caesar is delighted to find the whole of the driveway to the imperial
palace is lined with crucified Christians. As they drive along, Caesar
brings the procession to a sudden halt. “That man there!” he cries. “He
must be alive – his lips are moving. I want to hear what he is
saying.”</p><p><br></p><p>The senators raise Caesar on their shoulders. “Closer, closer!” he
shouts. “I can’t hear.” Finally, with his ear almost touching the man’s
lips, he hears, “Happy birthday to you.”</p><p>One can change every situation. Now he is being crucified, but he has
no complaint. Within minutes he may be dead, but his heart wants to say,
“Happy birthday to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he must have embarrassed Caesar; he must have created a deep
impression on him. From that day onwards, Christians were not crucified
again in Caesar’s time. He felt so humble. He felt so sorry about what
he was doing to these beautiful people, who are capable of rejoicing in
his birthday and are being crucified as a present.</p><p><br></p><p>It all depends on you, Paro.</p><p><br></p><p>Old man Finkelstein suspects that his butler has been stealing cigars
and shouts to him in the next room, “James, you have been stealing my
cigars.” There is no answer so he repeats it louder. There is still no
answer, so he goes into the next room and confronts his servant.
“James,” he says, “didn’t you hear me speaking to you just now?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, sir,” replies the butler, “there must be something wrong with
the acoustics.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really,” says Finkelstein. “Well, you go next door and say something
and we will see whether I can hear it.”</p><p><br></p><p>James goes into the next room and yells out at the top of his voice,
“Some fat son-of-a-bitch has been screwing around with my wife.”</p><p>He then returns. “Did you hear me, sir?” he asks nonchalantly.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are right, James” replies Finkelstein, blushing, “I could not
hear a word. Have a cigar.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are feeling blissful, peaceful, silent in your crying, in your
tears, and if after tears you feel relaxed, relieved of some burden, it
is perfectly good. Don’t try to stop it... because humanity has been
given such wrong training about so many things that it has not left any
human being natural. Everybody has become artificial, and particularly
men – every society has forced them not to cry; it is against your
manliness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is okay for women to cry and weep. They don’t belong to your
status, they are second class citizens. But you, being first class,
should show your strength. Your tears expose your weakness. But if you
go on for thousands of years teaching every child such nonsense, he
starts holding his tears back. Nobody wants to be exposed as a weakling.
But the simple truth is, nature has given you exactly the same glands
for tears as nature has given to women.</p><p><br></p><p>And if nature is listened to, then stopping your tears is a dangerous
thing. It is not only tears that will be stopped – you will become less
sensitive, you will become less loving. You will become harder, you will
become cruel, you will become a sadist. This will be the outcome of a
simple thing. You will go neurotic, psychotic – four times more men end
up in insane asylums than women. And the reason is that women know how
to cry and weep. They know how to let their burdens and tensions be
relieved through tears.</p><p><br></p><p>Man goes on accumulating and one day it is too late. Then either he
jumps from a sixty-storey building and finishes himself off...</p><p><br></p><p>There are strange people. A man jumped from the eightieth floor and
he passed the window where one of his friends was standing. The friend
said, “Goodbye,” and the man also waved his hand. And soon he was flat
on the ground, finished.</p><p><br></p><p>People came running to his friend and said, “Have you seen anything?”
And he said, “Yes.”</p><p>They said, “Your friend has committed suicide!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is strange, because just a few minutes before, he was
perfectly okay. While he was passing my window, we even said hello to
each other.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man has been prevented from being natural so that he can be made into
a soldier, so that he can be made into a harder personality, to compete
in the world. Because the woman was not going to compete in the world,
and she was not going to wars either, there was no need. She could be
allowed to cry and weep. It became a distinction, that it is manly not
to weep, not to cry.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply against nature. The women don’t go so mad because in
their tears they are throwing away all their tensions. They don’t
accumulate to such a point that it is beyond their capacity to control
it and everything goes through a breakdown.</p><p>Exactly four times more men commit suicide, although at least forty
times more women threaten to commit suicide. But they don’t. Women have
remained in a way closer to nature because they were deprived from
participating in man’s power struggle. In disguise, this curse proved a
blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Man made himself more and more tense, neurotic – and then there comes
a point where life becomes so heavy, each moment such a torture, that it
is better to commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Women just talk about it. Even if sometimes they try with sleeping
pills – not jumping from buildings, because that is dangerous – they
will take just a few sleeping pills which will be enough to harass the
husband and will make him more henpecked, because he will remain always
alert that the whole neighborhood condemns him...”You must be treating
your wife badly; otherwise why does she try to commit suicide?” The
doctor is angry, and the wife is enjoying a good sleep! Once in a while
a woman, just by mistake, takes too many pills – it is not really the
intention, just a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good, Paro, to enjoy your tears. And don’t keep them only for
tensions and anxieties and frustrations and moments of sadness. No, that
is using them in a wrong way. Use them when you are in love. Use them
when you are feeling peaceful. Use them when you see a beautiful
sunset.</p><p><br></p><p>What can be said to the sunset? It won’t understand any language. But
your tears, perhaps, will be understood. When you see a beautiful
flower, how can you resist having a few tears that existence is so
beautiful? If you see a Gautam Buddha and you don’t have tears in your
eyes, then you are behaving inhumanly, unnaturally. Seeing Gautam
Buddha, you should be in such a celebration – at least one of us has
reached to the ultimate potential of his being, and he is a proof that
we can also reach.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also saying, Paro, “When I look at you my heart is turning
inside out and a whole monsoon is breaking loose, leaving me helpless.
Who is it that is crying?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is your original being. The false never cries. The hypocrite never
cries. It is only the original, the authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole purpose of the communion that is happening here –
to fall into a synchronicity with my heart. Naturally your heart will
have to change. It will have to take a new rhythm, a new harmony, a new
wavelength. And it is natural to feel helpless because you have been
told that tears are a sign of weakness, helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears are your strength, not helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears show that you are alive, that you have not shrunk and lost all
your juice. Tears show that your heart still feels, still can dance,
still can rejoice.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a statue of Mahavira in Rajasthan. It is very famous because
it is made of a very strange stone – which is not found in India, but is
found in Africa. Somebody must have brought that stone. But in India it
has become a miracle because it perspires; tears flow from the eyes. And
the people who follow Mahavira, naturally, are deeply impressed. They
think perhaps he is weeping for us out of compassion.</p><p>One woman had come to me and she said, “I have never been impressed
by anything so much as the tears coming from a stone statue of
Mahavira.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t understand; I have seen the statue...” The statue
is in the middle of the lake – a small temple, an open temple, just
pillars. And because the statue is porous, when the vapors are rising
from the lake because of the hot sun – and Rajasthan is very hot, it is
a desert – that porous statue goes on soaking up much of the vapor that
is moving around. You will not find that statue in summer with tears or
perspiration or anything, but in winter when it is cold the vapors that
it has soaked up start becoming water again. Because of the coldness,
they start coming out of the rock.</p><p><br></p><p>I told the woman, “You are impressed by it, and you are not impressed
by millions of people who cry? And that stone is not doing anything as
far as compassion is concerned; it is just that this kind of stone is
not available in India.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was very much shocked because I hurt her religious feelings. I
said, “I am not hurting your religious feelings. I am simply making you
aware that if you can be so much impressed by the tears of a stone
statue, what about living human beings?”</p><p><br></p><p>But tears are taboo – one of the things that have been repressed.
Friedrich Nietzsche is quoted as saying that he smiles because he is
afraid if he does not smile he will start crying and tears will come to
his eyes. His smile is just a protection; it keeps him occupied, he
remains with a false smile so that authentic tears cannot come out.
Naturally, for a German, it is a question of manliness. How can a German
cry and weep and have tears?</p><p><br></p><p>But more or less all men around the world are Germans. They are all
male oriented, trying to impose a supremacy of men over women. But I say
unto you, your tears are far more valuable than man’s domination. His
supremacy is nothing. He has suffered much because of this stupid
attitude. Allow those tears. They are not of helplessness, they are of
tremendous joy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you ask, “Who is it that is crying?” It is you in your
originality, not you in your personality. “I am leaving home,” shouts
Giovanni to his parents. “I want wine, women, adventure.”</p><p>His old father gets up out of his chair.</p><p><br></p><p>“And don’t you try to stop me,” cries Giovanni.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who’s trying to stop you?” exclaims the old man. “I’m coming with
you!”</p><p><br></p><p>Just be a little more understanding of all your sentiments, emotions
– they all have a certain place in the total harmony of your being. But
we have been kept almost blind to our own potentialities, dimensions. Be
a little more alert about everything, and remember that the natural is
the superior and the unnatural is phony and American.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabbi Finklebaum had never gambled in his life, so one day he went to
the horse races just for the experience. Before the first race he saw a
priest making some strange sign over a horse and then watched the priest
put ten dollars on the horse to win. And sure enough, the horse won the
race.</p><p>So he followed the priest and watched him make signs over another
horse. This time the rabbi went off and put fifty dollars on the horse
and it won at ten to one.</p><p><br></p><p>Again he followed the priest and saw him make weird signs over
another horse, so he went off and put all the five hundred dollars he
had won on the previous race on this horse. He ran up into the stand to
watch the race, hoping to make a fortune, but this time the horse he had
backed fell at the first fence and died.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi ran off and found the priest. “Look here,” said the rabbi,
“what was the meaning of all that? The first two horses you made signs
over won, and then the third one fell at the first fence and I lost all
my money. What is going on?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry, rabbi,” said the priest, “but I can’t help it if you
don’t know the difference between a blessing and the last rites.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is so much misunderstanding. You don’t know what is real, what
is unreal. You don’t know what has been imposed on you by others and
what you have brought from existence itself as a gift.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to discriminate, and always choose the natural. Even if it
goes against all traditions, all religions, all cultures, don’t be
worried: except the natural, there is no authentic religiousness
anywhere. Except the existential, there is nothing holy that you can
find... in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Gita.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch – inside you is nature, inside you is the existential.
Always follow it, and you will never be going wrong. To be natural, to
be in tune with existence, is the only authentic spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

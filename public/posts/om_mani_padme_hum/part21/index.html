SITTING IN YOUR DISCOURSE I FIND MYSELF CONNECTING WITH MY INSIDE TO AN EXTENT THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN IN THE WEST. WHAT IS THIS ALCHEMY?\nSat Vijaya, your question can be answered only if you can understand the phenomenon of energy fields. Every place in the world has its own energy field, created by thousands of people who have lived there. The way they have lived, the way they have loved – they are gone, but they have left behind them a throbbing energy that continues to exist for centuries.\nAnd if it has been a continuous reinforcement of the energy, as it has been in the East... The whole genius of the East has been devoted to a single purpose: for thousands of years they have been trying to look inwards – not one or two people, but millions and millions, generation after generation. It has created a certain vibe which is missing in the West.\nHere in the East, meditation is something that you can float in. The whole energy around you is just like a river; it is already going towards the ocean. You don’t have to swim, you have just to float. In the West you have to fight against the current, because for centuries the extrovert mind has created a totally different kind of energy, not just different but absolutely contrary to the East – the outgoing, the extrovert.\nIf you are working as a scientist in the West you will find an invisible support from the whole atmosphere. In the East this happens only to those who are going on an inward journey; then the skies and the air and the trees, everything starts helping you. Not that they have any intention, but simply that for centuries this is how they have been pulled again and again – towards the inward center.\nThere are beautiful stories, which may not be factual but I insist on saying that they are true. I want to make a clear-cut distinction between the fact and the truth: something may be factual and still may not be true. Your dreams are factual – when you kill somebody in a dream you really kill them – but they are not true. When you wake up you suddenly find it was just a dream. Just as something can be factual yet not true, the opposite has also to be understood: something may be true, absolutely true, but may not manifest as a fact. The fact is a lower phenomenon. I can explain it only in a way.…\nOn a full-moon night, sitting by the side of a silent lake, you can see the full moon in the lake. It is factual, but not true. And you might not look at the real moon which is far away in the sky; it might not become part of your factual knowledge, but its truth is indubitable.\nThe beautiful stories that have surrounded people of inner growth create a problem for the historian, but not for the meditator, because the historian is concerned only with the factual. The mystic’s concern is far deeper, far higher. He is not interested in the factual, he is devoted absolutely to the truth.\nI would like to give you a few examples.\nIt is said that whenever Gautam Buddha moved – and he was continuously moving, for eight months of the year except the four months of the rains. He might come to rest under a tree whose leaves had fallen, whose branches were standing naked against the sky – it would be the time of fall. But it is related that, seeing Buddha resting under the tree, it would seem very shameful to the tree that there is no foliage, no shade, no flowers rejoicing and welcoming a man who has reached to the ultimate peaks of consciousness. And in the morning when Gautam Buddha would wake up, all his disciples would see a miracle: the tree which had been absolutely without leaves, without flowers, has suddenly become so green, such beautiful foliage around it and hundreds of flowers. And just the evening before, they had seen it – the miracle has happened in the silences of the night, and the flowers are showering on Gautam Buddha.\nThis incident is repeated so many times, in so many different sources, that it cannot be simply denied as symbolic, as poetic. As far as I am concerned I take it for granted to be a true and existential experience.\nWhenever I have read such things – and there are so many instances – I have always remembered the incident in Jesus Christ’s life, for which Christians cannot give any explanation. They try to hide it. But before you can understand the incident in Jesus’ life I have to give you some relevant information.\nJesus came to India when he was fourteen, and he lived in India for almost fourteen years. Gautam Buddha was still in the air, he had lived just five hundred years before, and he left behind him hundreds of enlightened people. The air was so full of his fragrance that young Jesus must have\nbeen tremendously influenced by it. And the route Jesus followed for his traveling proves it: he went to Ladakh, which is where one of the oldest Buddhist monasteries is still functioning, and then to Tibet, which had become more in tune with Gautam Buddha than India itself.\nThis attraction was pulling him into the very unknown and dangerous spaces of Ladakh, Tibet. The reason was that he wanted to know as much as possible about this strange man, Gautam Buddha, who had transformed the whole atmosphere in the East.\nHe must have come across these stories that when Buddha passed by, trees blossomed even though it was not the season for them to blossom.\nJust one hundred and twenty years ago, one Russian traveler remained in Ladakh for six months, studying the old records. He has reported that those old records remember Jesus as a young man but of immense silence, beauty, and a great search, who had come to the monastery and lived there for three months. They described Jesus exactly: that he was coming from Judea, a faraway country; that it was very difficult for him to understand because of the language barrier, but he tried hard and accumulated as much honey as he could from every possible source which was still available. After Gautam Buddha, although five hundred years had passed, the air was still full of remembrance. The mountains had not forgotten. And there were hundreds of people who could have been called contemporaries of Gautam Buddha as far as their consciousness was concerned.\nI am telling you these facts because now Christian missionaries have removed all those records from Ladakh. There were records in Tibet which were destroyed by Christians in the time of the British empire. They tried to remove any possible evidence that Jesus had been in the East learning the art of inward-going. But in spite of all their efforts, there are intrinsic proofs. And now I come to the story in Jesus’ life:\nFor three days he and his disciples had gone hungry, because the towns they were passing through were very fanatically Jewish and they would not give them shelter. On the contrary, they stoned them and threw them out of their towns. And Jesus came to a fig tree and he was very angry with the tree. He was not a man of anger, certainly. He was a man of immense love and peace. But this incident stands, on its own, without any explanation.\nIn the first place it is absurd to be angry with a fig tree because they are hungry and the tree is not welcoming them with figs – and it is not the season for figs! It looks simply absurd and insane: Jesus cursed the tree. Now for Christians it is very difficult to explain what happened. A man like Jesus cursing a tree without any reason or rhyme, because it was not even the season. And even if it were the season, the tree has no obligation to anybody. You cannot expect that the tree should welcome you.\nFrom where did he get the idea? because in the whole Jewish tradition there is not a single instance from where he could have got the idea. The only explanation is that he got the idea from the Buddhist stories in which trees are welcoming Gautam Buddha with flowers, with fruits. Even whole forests forget about the season, the climate; they become green, they rejoice in the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha. They rejoice in the company of Gautam Buddha and they show in their own language their joy, their appreciation, their blissfulness – because if even a single man recognizes his enlightenment a part of the universe becomes enlightened. Just because of a single man, the whole level of consciousness in the universe rises.\nThis has been a recognized truth in the East. Without being in the East, Jesus could not have dared to expect the fig tree... But he forgot completely that the fig tree also needs a certain climate, a certain vibration and a certain tradition. Unless the fig tree knows that for thousands of years its ancestors have always welcomed the buddhas; that this vibration is enough for the tree: a provocation to dance and to express itself in all its beauty.…\nNeither was the fig tree aware nor was Jesus an enlightened man. He had heard about enlightenment, he may have sat at the feet of enlightened people in the East, he may have created a desire in himself to become enlightened, but enlightenment and its language was foreign to his own people in Judea. They had never heard the word, they had never heard that anybody becomes self-realized. They had lived a totally different kind of religious tradition – of prophets, saviors, messengers, claimers that they are coming from God and if you believe in them you will be saved.\nThe whole Judeo-Christian tradition takes away the responsibility from every individual of becoming enlightened. And people unconsciously think that it is far easier to believe in someone and to be delivered from misery, from this dark night of the soul, rather than to take the responsibility in their own hands. But they are not aware: the moment you give the responsibility to somebody else, without your knowing you have also given your freedom. Responsibility and freedom are two aspects of the same coin. You cannot give one and save another.\nYou cannot say, “The responsibility to save me is that of some prophet, and I am still free to be myself.” The moment you become a believer and you give your responsibility to Jesus Christ or Moses or Ezekiel you have already given your freedom too. Now it is no longer an urgency for you to realize your being, or even to bother about who you are. It all depends now on the prophet you believe in, it is his responsibility. You think that you have become free from responsibility but you have forgotten that you have also denied your freedom. With your responsibility gone you have reduced yourself to a slave.\nJesus could not speak the language of the East. He had to speak the language of his own people. But here and there the influence of the East is clear. For example, the Jewish God in the Old Testament says: “I am not a nice fellow. I am a very jealous God, I am very violent, and whoever is going to disobey me is going to suffer indefinitely. Remember,” finally he says, “I am not your uncle.”\nWhen for the first time I came to the part where he says, “I’m not your uncle...” He is reminding you: “I am your father! And obedience is the only religion.”\nThat’s the whole story of creation in Christianity and Judaism: man was thrown out of the Garden of Eden – not for committing any sin, not for murdering anybody, not for raping; he was thrown out of the garden of God because he disobeyed. That makes the thing absolutely clear: that the Judeo- Christian tradition believes basically that obedience is religion and disobedience is the greatest sin, the original sin.\nAnd it is strange to know what things Adam and Eve disobeyed. If you are impartial, not prejudiced, you can see a very strange scene: God says to Adam and Eve, “In this vast garden you can eat the fruits from any tree; just two trees are prohibited.”\nIt is a parable, but immensely significant. It may not be factual but is certainly true. One is the tree of wisdom, which God is denying you. You can translate it: one is the tree of enlightenment that God\nis denying you, because enlightenment is nothing but wisdom. And the second tree is of eternal life. He is forbiding man to eat the fruits from these two trees.\nHe has taken away everything that can make life an ecstasy. He has taken away your enlightenment and he has taken away your experience of the eternal. What else is left? He has taken your very dignity. He has destroyed your freedom. He has taken away even the urge to go inwards, because those two trees grow inside you. The tree of wisdom and the tree of eternal life are not really two trees. It is one experience with two fragrances.\nUnfortunately, Jesus became acquainted with words which don’t fit the tradition from where he was coming. He went back when he was nearabout twenty-eight; it took two years for him to travel back to Judea. It is natural that he would have to speak the language that could be understood. For example, if he talked about nirvana, enlightenment, inner ecstasy, he would not have been understood. He had to translate it into a language that might have some meaning to the people he was talking to. He talked about the “Kingdom of God” and he tried his best to manage somehow to bring in the flavor that he had learned in the East.\nThat’s why he is the first man in the West to say that “The kingdom of God is within you.” It is not in the Old Testament. Nobody had ever heard that the kingdom of God is within you. This was simply a very clever translation to say that you are the god. “The kingdom of God is within you” is a way of saying that looking outside is not the way of the seeker; you have to go inwards.\nThis created the whole trouble. The Jews could see that he was using words from their tradition but he was giving them some strange meanings. It was absolutely clear: the Jewish God says, “I am a jealous god, very angry god, I will not forgive you if you commit any sin.” And it is proved by the expulsion of Eve and Adam because they committed the sin of eating the fruit from the tree of wisdom.\nThey were not quick enough to eat from the other tree too. They were caught red-handed on the first tree. That is the only sad part in it.\nAnd sometimes, if you are unprejudiced, you can see things which prejudiced minds are absolutely incapable to see. Eve is persuaded by the Devil to eat from the tree of wisdom. Eve is naturally afraid – God has prohibited it – but the reasoning that convinces Eve is very significant. The Devil said, “You don’t understand why. He has prohibited you from the two most significant experiences. He has prohibited you from wisdom, he has prohibited you from immortality, because he is very jealous. If you are also enlightened, and you are also immortal, you will become a god in your own right. And that is his jealousy. He wants to remain as the only god and does not want anybody else to attain to that position.”\nI am surprised that nobody has appreciated the Devil, because what he is saying is more significant – in comparison to God’s orders, which are fascist. God looks like any Adolf Hitler.\nI should remind you that the word ‘devil’ and the word ‘divine’ both come from the same Sanskrit root. Both mean the same. Perhaps the Devil is the first great revolutionary. His own crime was that he had revolted against God; otherwise he himself used to be an angel, but because he had the mind of a revolutionary he was thrown out of the company of God, condemned as evil. But the\nway he persuaded Eve makes me deeply respectful to the man. He is teaching exactly what all the enlightened people of the world have been teaching, that you can become a god. You are essentially a god, it is just that you have forgotten it. Perhaps you are asleep and you don’t know who you are; all that you need is an awakening.\nJesus tried, and that very effort became the cause for his crucifixion. He was not yet enlightened – that can be said without any difficulty, because he was still believing that he was superior, the only begotten son of God, and every other human creature is inferior, needs support. No one can become part of the kingdom of God without believing in him. Now this is not the way of an enlightened man.\nThe moment Gautam Buddha became enlightened the first thing that he suddenly became aware of was that the whole existence is enlightened... just unawareness, people are just fast asleep. Perhaps trees are more deeply asleep; perhaps mountains are in a coma, but the essential core of every being – asleep or awake – is the same. There is no qualitative difference.\nJesus could not be enlightened, because he still believes in phony ideas of virtue. What is virtue? – obedience, slavery. And what is sin? – disobedience, revolt. And he was teaching the same things, but he got mixed up. Being in the East he could not say that God is jealous. That was impossible. He had seen in the East a totally different atmosphere: he had seen godly people and he had seen millions of people who did not have any idea of a ruling god.\nExistence has been accepted in the East as autonomous; it is not a creation. Long before Charles Darwin, very long, thousands of years before, the East had come to understand that existence is an evolution with no beginning and no end. And you will not believe that Ronald Reagan is trying to prohibit in America – he has already prohibited – Charles Darwin. Books on evolution have been burned, universities have been forced to teach the idea of creation, not evolution. Charles Darwin’s name is no longer mentioned in American universities, in American colleges. Strange! And the whole world is simply silent; nobody says anything.\nWe have become accustomed to think that we are already civilized and cultured. Now, what Ronald Reagan is doing is so uncivilized and so uncultured that even a primitive society will be ashamed of it. We have heard stories that in the Middle Ages, Mohammedans burned libraries, the great library of Alexandria. That library was so big that it took six months for the fire to settle down. It contained all the ancient scriptures from Atlantis, the continent that had drowned. And we have thought that this was absolutely primitive behavior, but it is being done in the most pretentious country of the world – which thinks it is democratic, which thinks it allows freedom of speech, but there is no freedom for Charles Darwin. Books have been burned this very year! And whole educational systems have been completely cleaned of the idea of evolution: creation should be taught. Why? – because creation is the Christian idea.\nThere is no scientific evidence for creation. There is every evidence for evolution. The Christian idea of creation is so foolish that one feels not angry but hilarious: God created the world four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ was born. That means the world has existed only six thousand years. It is such utter stupidity.\nBecause of this idea they have not much space, so they have to fix everything within six thousand years. They cannot accept the Hindu idea, which has absolutely scientific grounds, that RIG\nVEDA was written ninety thousand years ago. How can it be arranged in the Christian compass? Everything has to happen within these six thousand years. At the most, Christian scholars have agreed, RIG VEDA can be five thousand years old.\nBut they are not aware that RIG VEDA contains intrinsic proof that it is ninety thousand years old. It describes a certain constellation of stars which happened ninety thousand years ago. Astronomers of all the world are absolutely agreed that that kind of constellation has not happened since. And if it is described in RIG VEDA, that means the people must have seen it, there is no other way. The description is in such detail that there is no need for any other proof. The book must have been written when the constellation happened.\nThere have been found fifty-thousand-year-old skeletons of human beings in China. Christian theologians have been in such a great difficulty – how to manage? But there are always great idiots.… One great theologian has proposed a theory that God created the world exactly as it is described in the Bible four thousand and four years before Jesus was born, but he also made things look like fifty-thousand-year-old skeletons simply to test your faith. Now, these are the great idiots of the world.\nAnd Ronald Reagan is forcing on America the idea of God creating the world – against the constitution of America, because the constitution wants the state and the religion to be kept absolutely separate. But he is being cunning. He is saying, “This is not a religious idea, it is a scientific idea.”\nThe idea of evolution means existence is eternal. It has never been created. It has always been here and it goes on evolving to new peaks of consciousness.\nNow it was very difficult for Jesus to say such things, but a few things he managed. He said that God is love. Now that is absolutely against the Jewish tradition: God is not even your uncle and you are saying God is love!\nOf course for Gautam Buddha the ultimate consciousness is nothing but pure love. Jesus has taken those ideas and tried to give them a Jewish flavor, but he could not deceive the Jews. They immediately suspected he was bringing foreign and strange ideas which would corrupt their tradition, their religion – particularly their younger generation. Jesus was crucified because he was the first man, according to me, who was trying to introduce a few Eastern experiences into the West. The climate was not ready.\nThe climate is not ready even today.\nI have been to the West and I have seen the difference of the climate. I have seen a different vibe, in which meditation becomes fighting against the current. It is not a let-go; it is not easy simply to flow in. All the forces around you are pulling you out.\nThis idea is a little difficult to comprehend, that we are surrounded by different kinds of waves. The people who are outgoing will find meditation to be the most difficult thing. The people who easily relax inwards will find scientific projects, experiments with objects, very difficult and against their innermost desire to relax. They will become tense and will feel a certain anguish. It is unfortunate that this is so, and it has to be changed.\nMan is both, in and out, and humanity should have both kinds of small pools of energy. For example there can be universities absolutely devoted to outer exploration, and there should be universities absolutely dedicated to the inner exploration. Then those universities will slowly become more and more different from each other and finally completely separate from each other.\nIn India there have been universities – long before Oxford or Cambridge existed, there was one university, Nalanda. Every professor in Nalanda – and Nalanda had almost one thousand professors – had to be a meditator. Unless a person had meditated for years there was no possibility for him even to become a student in Nalanda. Nalanda had four gates... and it is beautiful to remember that at these gates, the gatekeepers were no ordinary people. Unless a person was able to answer their questions, unless they were satisfied that he had a possibility to become a meditator, the person was refused from the very gate. There was no question of entering and having an interview with the professors. The gatekeepers were as much meditators as the professors.\nAnd once you were accepted by the gatekeepers into Nalanda it was more than you could have ever expected: a great opportunity opening before you. The whole university was concerned with only one thing, that everybody has to be reminded of enlightenment. All scriptures indicated towards it, every sermon, every act, every exercise, was meant purposefully to take you inwards. There were a few other universities... Takshila... but they were all concerned with the interiority of man.\nWe can create a world where each university can have two different areas. There is no need for any conflict; both the areas can become complimentary. But something has to be done urgently to destroy this difference between the East and the West.\nOne of the great English poets was Rudyard Kipling, who was named by the British empire as the royal poet, the poet laureate. He lived mostly in India, and his experience of India and England is condensed in his two lines: “East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet.” I can see that he had a certain insight, and what he was saying was factual. But if what he is saying becomes the prophecy of the future, if it is forever going to be a fact, then there is no hope for humanity to survive. Then humanity is going to remain schizophrenic.\nI would like to say that at least in this temple West is not West, East is not East, and the twain are already meeting. I don’t see that there is any existential reason for their not meeting. We have lived wrongly in the whole past and this is the ultimate consequence of it. Our whole reasoning about man has to be completely transformed.\nIf man has an inside – and certainly he has an outside – then any worldview, any lifestyle must be inclusive of both; nothing should be excluded. In this possibility of a whole man, of man as an organic unity of the inner and the outer, of the mundane and the sacred, is the whole hope of allowing this beautiful planet to survive. Otherwise we are already on the brink of committing a global suicide.\nSat Vijaya, you are right that you find it difficult in the West to go inwards and here it happens easily. There is certainly this alchemy: the East is vibrating with so many enlightened people that when you meditate here, everything around you invisibly helps you.\nWe are aware now of radio waves; radio waves are always passing all over you, although you cannot hear them. Just a mechanism, a receptive mechanism is needed, a radio, and immediately you can\ncatch almost all the broadcasting stations in the world. Do you think when the radio is tuned to a certain station, then the waves start coming here? The waves are already passing by; it is just that there is no receptive center for them, so you remain unaware of it.\nIt happened in the last world war... A man was very badly damaged, and as he regained consciousness he felt a strange thing: he felt as if he were listening to some broadcast from a radio station. He could not believe it. He looked all around... there was no radio. He finally told the doctor. The doctor laughed and said, “You must have imagined it.”\nHe said, “It is not imagination. The exact time is announced; the broadcasts, the news...” At first nobody believed him, because how can it be?\nBut finally they had to try in some way to figure out what was happening. They put a radio in another room and told the man, “Whatever you hear, go on writing down.” The man wrote down exactly everything that was being broadcast!\nBut it was a very difficult situation. It opened a new door; it made it clear that our ears are capable to receive radio waves. Perhaps one day we may have some mechanism, just a small mechanism attached to the ear. But that man was going mad, because he could not sleep – and as he became more and more clear, it was not only one station that he was hearing; he was receiving many stations simultaneously. He was going mad. He told his doctor, “Stop your experiments and your findings; otherwise I am going to commit suicide! You fix my ear back as it used to be, normal.” An operation had to be done.\nBut an accident suddenly made it clear that we are capable; all that we need is a switch to turn the radio on or off. Or just a small mechanism so that we can fix which station we want to listen to. One day it can be – it has to be. It has been delayed because radio has almost become out of fashion. The television has taken its place.\nBut what has happened with radio waves could also happen with your eyes. We may have to wait for some accident, but the possibility is there, because those are also certain kinds of waves that are bringing pictures to your television screen. Why couldn’t they bring them directly to your eyes?\nScientists say that our capacity to see is very limited. We can hear only certain wavelengths, we can see only certain areas. For example the owl can see more than we can see; its capacity of seeing is far bigger, far stronger. That’s why it can see in the night when we can see only darkness. But because of this, his eyes have become so delicate that he cannot open them when the sun is there. He can catch only very delicate rays; the sun is too much, too harsh. And we are perfectly aware that when we think it is day, for the owl it is night. The owls have lived for millions of years, perfectly capable of seeing in the darkest night. The darker the night the more receptive the owl becomes, because his eyes are so delicate.\nThere are other waves of which a few people become aware, and they are thought to be a little crazy, nuts. But they are not nuts. They may not be normal.…\nFor example in India, medical science developed in a totally different way – ayurveda, the Indian medical science. Even its name is indicative of its difference. “Medicine” simply means that you\nhave accepted the disease and you are trying to cure it. Medicine is curative. “Ayurveda” means the science, or more accurately, the “wisdom of life.” It has nothing to do with disease. Its emphasis is that life should be made stronger so that disease cannot happen. It is not curative, it is preventive.\nJust a few days ago, one Japanese sannyasin, Masashi Murakoshi, was here. He is a great scientist, particularly about atomic radiation. He has been working for twenty years in Hiroshima, and he has discovered... He has brought a few things and he is going to bring more. He discovered these things by chance, because for twenty years he has been working in Hiroshima, where the radiation is becoming less and less.\nThe bomb was thrown on Hiroshima forty years ago. In forty years’ time, the intensity of radiation has become very much lower. And he was surprised: when he came back from Hiroshima after twenty years, his colleagues in the university could not believe it. He had gone there when he was forty-five and when he came back again he was still forty-five! His colleagues were already retired.\nThat made him aware that a small amount of radioactivity, atomic radiation, can be not destructive to life, but on the contrary can be immensely protective to life. So he has created a few things. He has created belts – you can wear the belt twenty-four hours a day. The belt is filled with radioactive material, and it goes on radiating into your body. A few of the sannyasins here have used it and they all say it feels just great. One feels younger, one feels more energetic. He has made small plates to put in your bathtub while you just rest in the bath. And that radioactive material will make the water radioactive around you.\nHis understanding is that life can be prolonged, many diseases can be prevented; those which have already happened can be cured. And he is making many different kinds of things. He has been reading me, and he was very much interested when he heard that I have been poisoned by the American government. That was the reason for his coming, to bring a few things which according to him can take the poison out of the body. Those things he has made for the emperor of Japan, Hirohito. A special tea with radioactive material.…\nThose small belts... One belt costs two thousand dollars, but they look just like a belt not worth more than five rupees. The real material is inside; it can be simply anything that has been exposed to radiation. It can be earth, it can be any rubbish, but because it is still radiating, it is costly.\nThis scientist was told by America’s biggest manufacturer of nuclear bombs that they wanted to purchase – whatever the cost – all his inventions and their patents. He refused because he knew: the idea must be not to let those inventions reach the market for everyone to use. Because if everybody is using radioactivity and radiation, he will become less and less receptive to any dangerous amount. He will create a certain wall within himself; he can survive any atomic explosion. He will have enough atomic energy in himself to resist it.\nThere are other spheres of energy, and particularly you can try some small experiments. You can plant a few rose bushes of the same height, in the same soil, using the same fertilizers, taking the same care, but do one thing: with one bush, be very loving. Just talk to it, sit by its side. And you will see a strange phenomenon: they are all receiving the same nourishment, same food, same soil, same water, but because this bush is receiving something which the others are not receiving, this bush will become bigger, with more foliage, greener, and it will bring bigger flowers than the others.\nYou have created a certain energy field of love around the bush. Neither can you see it, nor are there scientific instruments available to judge, but your eyes can see the difference.\nIf for thousands of years a country has been producing meditators it is filled with invisible vibrations. It is not a coincidence that for centuries, seekers of the inner have come towards the East. A certain pull, a certain magnetic energy has accumulated, and it is still functioning. Although the East has fallen into dark days of poverty and slavery, of hunger, famine, not even water to drink – but still the vibrations of Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma, continue to reach those who are ready to receive them.\nIt all depends on you. If you have an honest search, then the East is the place for you. Here you can blossom more easily, more spontaneously, more effortlessly. This may not be possible anywhere else – you will have to fight for it, you will have to struggle against forces that you cannot see.\nAn Englishman, an American and a Frenchman are on a sea cruise, when the ship hits a rock and begins to sink. “Women and children first!” cries the Englishman. “Women and children first!”\n“Fuck the women and children!” shouts the American. “Oo la la!” says the Frenchman. “Do we have time?”\nAn Englishman goes to visit his doctor. “Doc,” he says, “I’m madly in love with this Polish girl. You’ve got to help me become a Polack.”\n“Are you sure?” says the doctor. “In order to do that, we’ve got to surgically remove half your brain.” The man says that it doesn’t matter what it takes, he wants the operation anyway.\nAfterwards, when he wakes up, he finds the doctor standing beside his bed. “I’m terribly sorry,” says the doctor, “we made a bad mistake. We removed three quarters of your brain.”\nThe man slaps his forehead and cries, “Ah, mama mia!” Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6258","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/om_mani_padme_hum/>Om Mani Padme Hum</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21 The twain are already meeting</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6258 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

SITTING IN YOUR DISCOURSE I FIND
MYSELF CONNECTING WITH MY INSIDE TO AN EXTENT THAT DOESN’T HAPPEN IN THE
WEST. WHAT IS THIS ALCHEMY?</p><p><br></p><p>Sat Vijaya, your question can be answered only if you can understand
the phenomenon of energy fields. Every place in the world has its own
energy field, created by thousands of people who have lived there. The
way they have lived, the way they have loved – they are gone, but they
have left behind them a throbbing energy that continues to exist for
centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>And if it has been a continuous reinforcement of the energy, as it
has been in the East... The whole genius of the East has been devoted to
a single purpose: for thousands of years they have been trying to look
inwards – not one or two people, but millions and millions, generation
after generation. It has created a certain vibe which is missing in the
West.</p><p><br></p><p>Here in the East, meditation is something that you can float in. The
whole energy around you is just like a river; it is already going
towards the ocean. You don’t have to swim, you have just to float. In
the West you have to fight against the current, because for centuries
the extrovert mind has created a totally different kind of energy, not
just different but absolutely contrary to the East – the outgoing, the
extrovert.</p><p>If you are working as a scientist in the West you will find an
invisible support from the whole atmosphere. In the East this happens
only to those who are going on an inward journey; then the skies and the
air and the trees, everything starts helping you. Not that they have any
intention, but simply that for centuries this is how they have been
pulled again and again – towards the inward center.</p><p><br></p><p>There are beautiful stories, which may not be factual but I insist on
saying that they are true. I want to make a clear-cut distinction
between the fact and the truth: something may be factual and still may
not be true. Your dreams are factual – when you kill somebody in a dream
you really kill them – but they are not true. When you wake up you
suddenly find it was just a dream. Just as something can be factual yet
not true, the opposite has also to be understood: something may be true,
absolutely true, but may not manifest as a fact. The fact is a lower
phenomenon. I can explain it only in a way.…</p><p><br></p><p>On a full-moon night, sitting by the side of a silent lake, you can
see the full moon in the lake. It is factual, but not true. And you
might not look at the real moon which is far away in the sky; it might
not become part of your factual knowledge, but its truth is
indubitable.</p><p><br></p><p>The beautiful stories that have surrounded people of inner growth
create a problem for the historian, but not for the meditator, because
the historian is concerned only with the factual. The mystic’s concern
is far deeper, far higher. He is not interested in the factual, he is
devoted absolutely to the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to give you a few examples.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that whenever Gautam Buddha moved – and he was
continuously moving, for eight months of the year except the four months
of the rains. He might come to rest under a tree whose leaves had
fallen, whose branches were standing naked against the sky – it would be
the time of fall. But it is related that, seeing Buddha resting under
the tree, it would seem very shameful to the tree that there is no
foliage, no shade, no flowers rejoicing and welcoming a man who has
reached to the ultimate peaks of consciousness. And in the morning when
Gautam Buddha would wake up, all his disciples would see a miracle: the
tree which had been absolutely without leaves, without flowers, has
suddenly become so green, such beautiful foliage around it and hundreds
of flowers. And just the evening before, they had seen it – the miracle
has happened in the silences of the night, and the flowers are showering
on Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>This incident is repeated so many times, in so many different
sources, that it cannot be simply denied as symbolic, as poetic. As far
as I am concerned I take it for granted to be a true and existential
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever I have read such things – and there are so many instances –
I have always remembered the incident in Jesus Christ’s life, for which
Christians cannot give any explanation. They try to hide it. But before
you can understand the incident in Jesus’ life I have to give you some
relevant information.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus came to India when he was fourteen, and he lived in India for
almost fourteen years. Gautam Buddha was still in the air, he had lived
just five hundred years before, and he left behind him hundreds of
enlightened people. The air was so full of his fragrance that young
Jesus must have</p><p>been tremendously influenced by it. And the route Jesus followed for
his traveling proves it: he went to Ladakh, which is where one of the
oldest Buddhist monasteries is still functioning, and then to Tibet,
which had become more in tune with Gautam Buddha than India itself.</p><p><br></p><p>This attraction was pulling him into the very unknown and dangerous
spaces of Ladakh, Tibet. The reason was that he wanted to know as much
as possible about this strange man, Gautam Buddha, who had transformed
the whole atmosphere in the East.</p><p><br></p><p>He must have come across these stories that when Buddha passed by,
trees blossomed even though it was not the season for them to
blossom.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one hundred and twenty years ago, one Russian traveler remained
in Ladakh for six months, studying the old records. He has reported that
those old records remember Jesus as a young man but of immense silence,
beauty, and a great search, who had come to the monastery and lived
there for three months. They described Jesus exactly: that he was coming
from Judea, a faraway country; that it was very difficult for him to
understand because of the language barrier, but he tried hard and
accumulated as much honey as he could from every possible source which
was still available. After Gautam Buddha, although five hundred years
had passed, the air was still full of remembrance. The mountains had not
forgotten. And there were hundreds of people who could have been called
contemporaries of Gautam Buddha as far as their consciousness was
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>I am telling you these facts because now Christian missionaries have
removed all those records from Ladakh. There were records in Tibet which
were destroyed by Christians in the time of the British empire. They
tried to remove any possible evidence that Jesus had been in the East
learning the art of inward-going. But in spite of all their efforts,
there are intrinsic proofs. And now I come to the story in Jesus’
life:</p><p><br></p><p>For three days he and his disciples had gone hungry, because the
towns they were passing through were very fanatically Jewish and they
would not give them shelter. On the contrary, they stoned them and threw
them out of their towns. And Jesus came to a fig tree and he was very
angry with the tree. He was not a man of anger, certainly. He was a man
of immense love and peace. But this incident stands, on its own, without
any explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place it is absurd to be angry with a fig tree because
they are hungry and the tree is not welcoming them with figs – and it is
not the season for figs! It looks simply absurd and insane: Jesus cursed
the tree. Now for Christians it is very difficult to explain what
happened. A man like Jesus cursing a tree without any reason or rhyme,
because it was not even the season. And even if it were the season, the
tree has no obligation to anybody. You cannot expect that the tree
should welcome you.</p><p><br></p><p>From where did he get the idea? because in the whole Jewish tradition
there is not a single instance from where he could have got the idea.
The only explanation is that he got the idea from the Buddhist stories
in which trees are welcoming Gautam Buddha with flowers, with fruits.
Even whole forests forget about the season, the climate; they become
green, they rejoice in the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha. They rejoice
in the company of Gautam Buddha and they show in their own language
their joy, their appreciation, their blissfulness – because if even a
single man recognizes his enlightenment a part of the universe becomes
enlightened. Just because of a single man, the whole level of
consciousness in the universe rises.</p><p>This has been a recognized truth in the East. Without being in the
East, Jesus could not have dared to expect the fig tree... But he forgot
completely that the fig tree also needs a certain climate, a certain
vibration and a certain tradition. Unless the fig tree knows that for
thousands of years its ancestors have always welcomed the buddhas; that
this vibration is enough for the tree: a provocation to dance and to
express itself in all its beauty.…</p><p><br></p><p>Neither was the fig tree aware nor was Jesus an enlightened man. He
had heard about enlightenment, he may have sat at the feet of
enlightened people in the East, he may have created a desire in himself
to become enlightened, but enlightenment and its language was foreign to
his own people in Judea. They had never heard the word, they had never
heard that anybody becomes self-realized. They had lived a totally
different kind of religious tradition – of prophets, saviors,
messengers, claimers that they are coming from God and if you believe in
them you will be saved.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole Judeo-Christian tradition takes away the responsibility
from every individual of becoming enlightened. And people unconsciously
think that it is far easier to believe in someone and to be delivered
from misery, from this dark night of the soul, rather than to take the
responsibility in their own hands. But they are not aware: the moment
you give the responsibility to somebody else, without your knowing you
have also given your freedom. Responsibility and freedom are two aspects
of the same coin. You cannot give one and save another.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot say, “The responsibility to save me is that of some
prophet, and I am still free to be myself.” The moment you become a
believer and you give your responsibility to Jesus Christ or Moses or
Ezekiel you have already given your freedom too. Now it is no longer an
urgency for you to realize your being, or even to bother about who you
are. It all depends now on the prophet you believe in, it is his
responsibility. You think that you have become free from responsibility
but you have forgotten that you have also denied your freedom. With your
responsibility gone you have reduced yourself to a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus could not speak the language of the East. He had to speak the
language of his own people. But here and there the influence of the East
is clear. For example, the Jewish God in the Old Testament says: “I am
not a nice fellow. I am a very jealous God, I am very violent, and
whoever is going to disobey me is going to suffer indefinitely.
Remember,” finally he says, “I am not your uncle.”</p><p><br></p><p>When for the first time I came to the part where he says, “I’m not
your uncle...” He is reminding you: “I am your father! And obedience is
the only religion.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the whole story of creation in Christianity and Judaism: man
was thrown out of the Garden of Eden – not for committing any sin, not
for murdering anybody, not for raping; he was thrown out of the garden
of God because he disobeyed. That makes the thing absolutely clear: that
the Judeo- Christian tradition believes basically that obedience is
religion and disobedience is the greatest sin, the original sin.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is strange to know what things Adam and Eve disobeyed. If you
are impartial, not prejudiced, you can see a very strange scene: God
says to Adam and Eve, “In this vast garden you can eat the fruits from
any tree; just two trees are prohibited.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a parable, but immensely significant. It may not be factual but
is certainly true. One is the tree of wisdom, which God is denying you.
You can translate it: one is the tree of enlightenment that God</p><p>is denying you, because enlightenment is nothing but wisdom. And the
second tree is of eternal life. He is forbiding man to eat the fruits
from these two trees.</p><p><br></p><p>He has taken away everything that can make life an ecstasy. He has
taken away your enlightenment and he has taken away your experience of
the eternal. What else is left? He has taken your very dignity. He has
destroyed your freedom. He has taken away even the urge to go inwards,
because those two trees grow inside you. The tree of wisdom and the tree
of eternal life are not really two trees. It is one experience with two
fragrances.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, Jesus became acquainted with words which don’t fit the
tradition from where he was coming. He went back when he was nearabout
twenty-eight; it took two years for him to travel back to Judea. It is
natural that he would have to speak the language that could be
understood. For example, if he talked about nirvana, enlightenment,
inner ecstasy, he would not have been understood. He had to translate it
into a language that might have some meaning to the people he was
talking to. He talked about the “Kingdom of God” and he tried his best
to manage somehow to bring in the flavor that he had learned in the
East.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why he is the first man in the West to say that “The kingdom
of God is within you.” It is not in the Old Testament. Nobody had ever
heard that the kingdom of God is within you. This was simply a very
clever translation to say that you are the god. “The kingdom of God is
within you” is a way of saying that looking outside is not the way of
the seeker; you have to go inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>This created the whole trouble. The Jews could see that he was using
words from their tradition but he was giving them some strange meanings.
It was absolutely clear: the Jewish God says, “I am a jealous god, very
angry god, I will not forgive you if you commit any sin.” And it is
proved by the expulsion of Eve and Adam because they committed the sin
of eating the fruit from the tree of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not quick enough to eat from the other tree too. They were
caught red-handed on the first tree. That is the only sad part in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes, if you are unprejudiced, you can see things which
prejudiced minds are absolutely incapable to see. Eve is persuaded by
the Devil to eat from the tree of wisdom. Eve is naturally afraid – God
has prohibited it – but the reasoning that convinces Eve is very
significant. The Devil said, “You don’t understand why. He has
prohibited you from the two most significant experiences. He has
prohibited you from wisdom, he has prohibited you from immortality,
because he is very jealous. If you are also enlightened, and you are
also immortal, you will become a god in your own right. And that is his
jealousy. He wants to remain as the only god and does not want anybody
else to attain to that position.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am surprised that nobody has appreciated the Devil, because what he
is saying is more significant – in comparison to God’s orders, which are
fascist. God looks like any Adolf Hitler.</p><p><br></p><p>I should remind you that the word ‘devil’ and the word ‘divine’ both
come from the same Sanskrit root. Both mean the same. Perhaps the Devil
is the first great revolutionary. His own crime was that he had revolted
against God; otherwise he himself used to be an angel, but because he
had the mind of a revolutionary he was thrown out of the company of God,
condemned as evil. But the</p><p>way he persuaded Eve makes me deeply respectful to the man. He is
teaching exactly what all the enlightened people of the world have been
teaching, that you can become a god. You are essentially a god, it is
just that you have forgotten it. Perhaps you are asleep and you don’t
know who you are; all that you need is an awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus tried, and that very effort became the cause for his
crucifixion. He was not yet enlightened – that can be said without any
difficulty, because he was still believing that he was superior, the
only begotten son of God, and every other human creature is inferior,
needs support. No one can become part of the kingdom of God without
believing in him. Now this is not the way of an enlightened man.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment Gautam Buddha became enlightened the first thing that he
suddenly became aware of was that the whole existence is enlightened...
just unawareness, people are just fast asleep. Perhaps trees are more
deeply asleep; perhaps mountains are in a coma, but the essential core
of every being – asleep or awake – is the same. There is no qualitative
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus could not be enlightened, because he still believes in phony
ideas of virtue. What is virtue? – obedience, slavery. And what is sin?
– disobedience, revolt. And he was teaching the same things, but he got
mixed up. Being in the East he could not say that God is jealous. That
was impossible. He had seen in the East a totally different atmosphere:
he had seen godly people and he had seen millions of people who did not
have any idea of a ruling god.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence has been accepted in the East as autonomous; it is not a
creation. Long before Charles Darwin, very long, thousands of years
before, the East had come to understand that existence is an evolution
with no beginning and no end. And you will not believe that Ronald
Reagan is trying to prohibit in America – he has already prohibited –
Charles Darwin. Books on evolution have been burned, universities have
been forced to teach the idea of creation, not evolution. Charles
Darwin’s name is no longer mentioned in American universities, in
American colleges. Strange! And the whole world is simply silent; nobody
says anything.</p><p><br></p><p>We have become accustomed to think that we are already civilized and
cultured. Now, what Ronald Reagan is doing is so uncivilized and so
uncultured that even a primitive society will be ashamed of it. We have
heard stories that in the Middle Ages, Mohammedans burned libraries, the
great library of Alexandria. That library was so big that it took six
months for the fire to settle down. It contained all the ancient
scriptures from Atlantis, the continent that had drowned. And we have
thought that this was absolutely primitive behavior, but it is being
done in the most pretentious country of the world – which thinks it is
democratic, which thinks it allows freedom of speech, but there is no
freedom for Charles Darwin. Books have been burned this very year! And
whole educational systems have been completely cleaned of the idea of
evolution: creation should be taught. Why? – because creation is the
Christian idea.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no scientific evidence for creation. There is every evidence
for evolution. The Christian idea of creation is so foolish that one
feels not angry but hilarious: God created the world four thousand and
four years before Jesus Christ was born. That means the world has
existed only six thousand years. It is such utter stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this idea they have not much space, so they have to fix
everything within six thousand years. They cannot accept the Hindu idea,
which has absolutely scientific grounds, that RIG</p><p>VEDA was written ninety thousand years ago. How can it be arranged in
the Christian compass? Everything has to happen within these six
thousand years. At the most, Christian scholars have agreed, RIG VEDA
can be five thousand years old.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are not aware that RIG VEDA contains intrinsic proof that it
is ninety thousand years old. It describes a certain constellation of
stars which happened ninety thousand years ago. Astronomers of all the
world are absolutely agreed that that kind of constellation has not
happened since. And if it is described in RIG VEDA, that means the
people must have seen it, there is no other way. The description is in
such detail that there is no need for any other proof. The book must
have been written when the constellation happened.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been found fifty-thousand-year-old skeletons of human
beings in China. Christian theologians have been in such a great
difficulty – how to manage? But there are always great idiots.… One
great theologian has proposed a theory that God created the world
exactly as it is described in the Bible four thousand and four years
before Jesus was born, but he also made things look like
fifty-thousand-year-old skeletons simply to test your faith. Now, these
are the great idiots of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And Ronald Reagan is forcing on America the idea of God creating the
world – against the constitution of America, because the constitution
wants the state and the religion to be kept absolutely separate. But he
is being cunning. He is saying, “This is not a religious idea, it is a
scientific idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of evolution means existence is eternal. It has never been
created. It has always been here and it goes on evolving to new peaks of
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it was very difficult for Jesus to say such things, but a few
things he managed. He said that God is love. Now that is absolutely
against the Jewish tradition: God is not even your uncle and you are
saying God is love!</p><p><br></p><p>Of course for Gautam Buddha the ultimate consciousness is nothing but
pure love. Jesus has taken those ideas and tried to give them a Jewish
flavor, but he could not deceive the Jews. They immediately suspected he
was bringing foreign and strange ideas which would corrupt their
tradition, their religion – particularly their younger generation. Jesus
was crucified because he was the first man, according to me, who was
trying to introduce a few Eastern experiences into the West. The climate
was not ready.</p><p><br></p><p>The climate is not ready even today.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been to the West and I have seen the difference of the
climate. I have seen a different vibe, in which meditation becomes
fighting against the current. It is not a let-go; it is not easy simply
to flow in. All the forces around you are pulling you out.</p><p><br></p><p>This idea is a little difficult to comprehend, that we are surrounded
by different kinds of waves. The people who are outgoing will find
meditation to be the most difficult thing. The people who easily relax
inwards will find scientific projects, experiments with objects, very
difficult and against their innermost desire to relax. They will become
tense and will feel a certain anguish. It is unfortunate that this is
so, and it has to be changed.</p><p>Man is both, in and out, and humanity should have both kinds of small
pools of energy. For example there can be universities absolutely
devoted to outer exploration, and there should be universities
absolutely dedicated to the inner exploration. Then those universities
will slowly become more and more different from each other and finally
completely separate from each other.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there have been universities – long before Oxford or
Cambridge existed, there was one university, Nalanda. Every professor in
Nalanda – and Nalanda had almost one thousand professors – had to be a
meditator. Unless a person had meditated for years there was no
possibility for him even to become a student in Nalanda. Nalanda had
four gates... and it is beautiful to remember that at these gates, the
gatekeepers were no ordinary people. Unless a person was able to answer
their questions, unless they were satisfied that he had a possibility to
become a meditator, the person was refused from the very gate. There was
no question of entering and having an interview with the professors. The
gatekeepers were as much meditators as the professors.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you were accepted by the gatekeepers into Nalanda it was
more than you could have ever expected: a great opportunity opening
before you. The whole university was concerned with only one thing, that
everybody has to be reminded of enlightenment. All scriptures indicated
towards it, every sermon, every act, every exercise, was meant
purposefully to take you inwards. There were a few other universities...
Takshila... but they were all concerned with the interiority of man.</p><p><br></p><p>We can create a world where each university can have two different
areas. There is no need for any conflict; both the areas can become
complimentary. But something has to be done urgently to destroy this
difference between the East and the West.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great English poets was Rudyard Kipling, who was named by
the British empire as the royal poet, the poet laureate. He lived mostly
in India, and his experience of India and England is condensed in his
two lines: “East is East and West is West and never the twain shall
meet.” I can see that he had a certain insight, and what he was saying
was factual. But if what he is saying becomes the prophecy of the
future, if it is forever going to be a fact, then there is no hope for
humanity to survive. Then humanity is going to remain schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to say that at least in this temple West is not West,
East is not East, and the twain are already meeting. I don’t see that
there is any existential reason for their not meeting. We have lived
wrongly in the whole past and this is the ultimate consequence of it.
Our whole reasoning about man has to be completely transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>If man has an inside – and certainly he has an outside – then any
worldview, any lifestyle must be inclusive of both; nothing should be
excluded. In this possibility of a whole man, of man as an organic unity
of the inner and the outer, of the mundane and the sacred, is the whole
hope of allowing this beautiful planet to survive. Otherwise we are
already on the brink of committing a global suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Sat Vijaya, you are right that you find it difficult in the West to
go inwards and here it happens easily. There is certainly this alchemy:
the East is vibrating with so many enlightened people that when you
meditate here, everything around you invisibly helps you.</p><p><br></p><p>We are aware now of radio waves; radio waves are always passing all
over you, although you cannot hear them. Just a mechanism, a receptive
mechanism is needed, a radio, and immediately you can</p><p>catch almost all the broadcasting stations in the world. Do you think
when the radio is tuned to a certain station, then the waves start
coming here? The waves are already passing by; it is just that there is
no receptive center for them, so you remain unaware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the last world war... A man was very badly damaged,
and as he regained consciousness he felt a strange thing: he felt as if
he were listening to some broadcast from a radio station. He could not
believe it. He looked all around... there was no radio. He finally told
the doctor. The doctor laughed and said, “You must have imagined
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is not imagination. The exact time is announced; the
broadcasts, the news...” At first nobody believed him, because how can
it be?</p><p>But finally they had to try in some way to figure out what was
happening. They put a radio in another room and told the man, “Whatever
you hear, go on writing down.” The man wrote down exactly everything
that was being broadcast!</p><p><br></p><p>But it was a very difficult situation. It opened a new door; it made
it clear that our ears are capable to receive radio waves. Perhaps one
day we may have some mechanism, just a small mechanism attached to the
ear. But that man was going mad, because he could not sleep – and as he
became more and more clear, it was not only one station that he was
hearing; he was receiving many stations simultaneously. He was going
mad. He told his doctor, “Stop your experiments and your findings;
otherwise I am going to commit suicide! You fix my ear back as it used
to be, normal.” An operation had to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>But an accident suddenly made it clear that we are capable; all that
we need is a switch to turn the radio on or off. Or just a small
mechanism so that we can fix which station we want to listen to. One day
it can be – it has to be. It has been delayed because radio has almost
become out of fashion. The television has taken its place.</p><p><br></p><p>But what has happened with radio waves could also happen with your
eyes. We may have to wait for some accident, but the possibility is
there, because those are also certain kinds of waves that are bringing
pictures to your television screen. Why couldn’t they bring them
directly to your eyes?</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say that our capacity to see is very limited. We can hear
only certain wavelengths, we can see only certain areas. For example the
owl can see more than we can see; its capacity of seeing is far bigger,
far stronger. That’s why it can see in the night when we can see only
darkness. But because of this, his eyes have become so delicate that he
cannot open them when the sun is there. He can catch only very delicate
rays; the sun is too much, too harsh. And we are perfectly aware that
when we think it is day, for the owl it is night. The owls have lived
for millions of years, perfectly capable of seeing in the darkest night.
The darker the night the more receptive the owl becomes, because his
eyes are so delicate.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other waves of which a few people become aware, and they
are thought to be a little crazy, nuts. But they are not nuts. They may
not be normal.…</p><p><br></p><p>For example in India, medical science developed in a totally
different way – ayurveda, the Indian medical science. Even its name is
indicative of its difference. “Medicine” simply means that you</p><p>have accepted the disease and you are trying to cure it. Medicine is
curative. “Ayurveda” means the science, or more accurately, the “wisdom
of life.” It has nothing to do with disease. Its emphasis is that life
should be made stronger so that disease cannot happen. It is not
curative, it is preventive.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago, one Japanese sannyasin, Masashi Murakoshi, was
here. He is a great scientist, particularly about atomic radiation. He
has been working for twenty years in Hiroshima, and he has discovered...
He has brought a few things and he is going to bring more. He discovered
these things by chance, because for twenty years he has been working in
Hiroshima, where the radiation is becoming less and less.</p><p><br></p><p>The bomb was thrown on Hiroshima forty years ago. In forty years’
time, the intensity of radiation has become very much lower. And he was
surprised: when he came back from Hiroshima after twenty years, his
colleagues in the university could not believe it. He had gone there
when he was forty-five and when he came back again he was still
forty-five! His colleagues were already retired.</p><p><br></p><p>That made him aware that a small amount of radioactivity, atomic
radiation, can be not destructive to life, but on the contrary can be
immensely protective to life. So he has created a few things. He has
created belts – you can wear the belt twenty-four hours a day. The belt
is filled with radioactive material, and it goes on radiating into your
body. A few of the sannyasins here have used it and they all say it
feels just great. One feels younger, one feels more energetic. He has
made small plates to put in your bathtub while you just rest in the
bath. And that radioactive material will make the water radioactive
around you.</p><p><br></p><p>His understanding is that life can be prolonged, many diseases can be
prevented; those which have already happened can be cured. And he is
making many different kinds of things. He has been reading me, and he
was very much interested when he heard that I have been poisoned by the
American government. That was the reason for his coming, to bring a few
things which according to him can take the poison out of the body. Those
things he has made for the emperor of Japan, Hirohito. A special tea
with radioactive material.…</p><p><br></p><p>Those small belts... One belt costs two thousand dollars, but they
look just like a belt not worth more than five rupees. The real material
is inside; it can be simply anything that has been exposed to radiation.
It can be earth, it can be any rubbish, but because it is still
radiating, it is costly.</p><p><br></p><p>This scientist was told by America’s biggest manufacturer of nuclear
bombs that they wanted to purchase – whatever the cost – all his
inventions and their patents. He refused because he knew: the idea must
be not to let those inventions reach the market for everyone to use.
Because if everybody is using radioactivity and radiation, he will
become less and less receptive to any dangerous amount. He will create a
certain wall within himself; he can survive any atomic explosion. He
will have enough atomic energy in himself to resist it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other spheres of energy, and particularly you can try some
small experiments. You can plant a few rose bushes of the same height,
in the same soil, using the same fertilizers, taking the same care, but
do one thing: with one bush, be very loving. Just talk to it, sit by its
side. And you will see a strange phenomenon: they are all receiving the
same nourishment, same food, same soil, same water, but because this
bush is receiving something which the others are not receiving, this
bush will become bigger, with more foliage, greener, and it will bring
bigger flowers than the others.</p><p>You have created a certain energy field of love around the bush.
Neither can you see it, nor are there scientific instruments available
to judge, but your eyes can see the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>If for thousands of years a country has been producing meditators it
is filled with invisible vibrations. It is not a coincidence that for
centuries, seekers of the inner have come towards the East. A certain
pull, a certain magnetic energy has accumulated, and it is still
functioning. Although the East has fallen into dark days of poverty and
slavery, of hunger, famine, not even water to drink – but still the
vibrations of Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Gautam Buddha, Bodhidharma,
continue to reach those who are ready to receive them.</p><p><br></p><p>It all depends on you. If you have an honest search, then the East is
the place for you. Here you can blossom more easily, more spontaneously,
more effortlessly. This may not be possible anywhere else – you will
have to fight for it, you will have to struggle against forces that you
cannot see.</p><p><br></p><p>An Englishman, an American and a Frenchman are on a sea cruise, when
the ship hits a rock and begins to sink. “Women and children first!”
cries the Englishman. “Women and children first!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Fuck the women and children!” shouts the American. “Oo la la!” says
the Frenchman. “Do we have time?”</p><p>An Englishman goes to visit his doctor. “Doc,” he says, “I’m madly in
love with this Polish girl. You’ve got to help me become a Polack.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure?” says the doctor. “In order to do that, we’ve got to
surgically remove half your brain.” The man says that it doesn’t matter
what it takes, he wants the operation anyway.</p><p>Afterwards, when he wakes up, he finds the doctor standing beside his
bed. “I’m terribly sorry,” says the doctor, “we made a bad mistake. We
removed three quarters of your brain.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man slaps his forehead and cries, “Ah, mama mia!” Okay,
Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN.\nTHE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS. THEREFORE THE SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT SEEING, ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.\nReligion is not knowledge, it is knowing. Knowledge is of the mind, knowing is of the being, and the difference and the distance, is tremendously vast.\nThe difference is not only quantitative, it is also qualitative.\nKnowledge and knowing – they are as different as heaven and hell, earth and the sky, so the first thing to understand is the difference between knowledge and knowing.\nKnowledge is never of the present, it is always of the past. The moment you say you know it is already a dead thing, it has already left its marks on the memory, it is like dust clinging to you. You have already moved away from that.\nKnowing is always immediate, knowing is here and now. You cannot say anything about it, you can only be it. The moment you speak of it, even knowing becomes knowledge; that’s why all those who\n2\nhave known, they say it cannot be said. The moment you speak of it the very nature of it changes; it has become knowledge. It is no more the beautiful alive phenomenon of knowing.\nKnowing has no past, it has no future, it has only the present. And remember, present is not part of time.\nPeople ordinarily think that time is divided between past, future and present. They are absolutely wrong. Time is divided between past and future, present is not a part of time at all. You cannot catch hold of it in time. Pursue it and you will miss. Try to grasp it and it will always be out of your reach, because it is part of eternity not part of time.\nPresent is eternity crossing time. It is a meeting point where eternity and the temporal meet.\nIn the present is knowing, in the past is knowledge, Whenever you know, you start planning. The more you know, the more you plan. Knowing means the past, planning means the future – then you don’t allow the future freedom, you try to fix it into the pigeon holes of the past. You would like it to be just a repetition of the past, howsoever modified, decorated, but just a repetition of the past.\nA man of knowledge is a man of planning, and life is an unplanned flow. Life is freedom, you cannot pigeon hole it, you cannot categorize it, that’s why a man of knowledge misses life. He knows much, and he knows nothing. He knows too much and he is just empty and hollow. You cannot find more shallow a person than a man of knowledge. He is just surface and surface, he has no depth, because depth comes through eternity.\nTime is horizontal, it moves in a line on the horizon. Eternity is vertical, it moves into depth and height. That is the meaning of Jesus’ cross: time crossing eternity, or eternity crossing time. Jesus’ hands are time, they move into past and future, crucified in time, resurrected into eternity. His being is vertical – everybody’s being is vertical, only the body, the hands, the material part of you, is horizontal.\nKnowledge creates future, future creates worry. The more you know, the more worried, the more uneasy you are, never at ease, at home, a deep trembling inside. It is a pathology. A man of knowing is totally different – he lives here. This moment is all, as if tomorrow exists not – and really it exists not, it has never existed, it is part of the game of the mind. It is a dream of the man of knowledge.\nThis moment is all, and the total. Knowing moves into this moment vertically, goes deeper and deeper and deeper. A man of knowing has depth, even his surface is nothing but part of depth. He has no superficial surface, his surface is also part of depth. And a man of knowledge? He has no depth, his depth is also part of his surface.\nAnd this is the paradox: that a man of knowing knows and a man of knowledge does not know, cannot know, because knowledge cannot meet life – that is the barrier, on the contrary, the only barrier, the hindrance. It is just like this: a mother knows that the child is hers, the father has knowledge that the child is his. The father has only a belief. Deep down he does not know. Only a mother knows!\nIt happened, Mulla Nasrudin was working as a vizier to a small kingdom. The king was very generous; not very rich (the kingdom was small) but still very generous. Every year Nasrudin would\ncome and tell him that his wife had given birth to a child, and the king would give valuable presents to him, to the child, to the mother, but then it became too much because it was every year.\nWhen the twelfth child was born and Nasrudin came, the king said, Now Mulla, it is too much, and the world is suffering too much from over population, what are you doing? If you go at this speed you will create a small nation. You go on, every year – stop it! Let this child be the last! And if you cannot stop, if you are unable to stop, then it is better to commit suicide rather than to overburden the earth.\nNasrudin was very depressed. Then the thirteenth child was born – what to do? So he thought, it is better now not to go to the king – go to the forest and commit suicide, as the king has said. So he went to the forest, he prepared everything to hang himself, just a split second and he would have been hanging under the tree dead – suddenly he said, Nasrudin! Beware! You may be hanging the wrong man!\nA father simply believes, a mother knows. Knowing is like a mother, knowledge is like a father.\nAll knowledge is belief. Knowing is not belief, it is KNOWING. It is your perception it is your vision it is your growth. It is just like the mother – the child grows in her womb, she knows, the child is HER PART, her own extension, her own being, blood and bone. A father is extrinsic, he is not intrinsic. He simply believes that the child is his.\nA man of knowledge believes that he knows. A man of knowing knows.\nKnowing is a transformation in your being, it is like a pregnancy, you have to carry it, you have to give birth to yourself, a resurrection into eternity, a turning away from time and a moving in no time, a conversion from mind to no mind, but something so tremendous that you know it is happening in you.\nA man of knowledge goes on collecting dust from Buddhas. Those who have known, he believes in them. Whatsoever he believes in is dead. He has not given birth to himself. He has collected knowledge from others, everything is borrowed, and how can knowledge be borrowed? How can being be borrowed? If knowledge is going to be true it is going to be of the nature of being.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to ask people – seekers who would come to him – the first thing he used to ask is: Are you interested in knowledge or being? Because here we give being and we are not concerned about knowledge, so you decide well. If you are concerned with knowledge, go somewhere else. If you are concerned with being, remain here. But make a very very clear decision.\nWhat is the difference between being and knowledge? The same as the difference between knowledge and knowing. Knowing IS being.\nIt is not something that is being added to you, it is something you grow into. Knowledge is something which is added to you. You don’t grow through it, rather, you carry it as a burden. So you will always find a man of knowledge burdened, heavily burdened, mountains of knowledge he is carrying on his shoulders. You will see his face very serious, deadly serious, and his heart completely crushed under the burden.\nA man of knowing is weightless. He has nothing to carry. He can fly into the sky. The gravitation of the earth does not affect him. He is not pulled towards the earth because the earth can pull only that which is heavy. He remains on the earth but he is not of the earth. That is the meaning of Jesus’ saying – he says again and again: My kingdom is not of this world.It is of some other world, the\nworld of being, of eternity.\nIf you understand the distinction well, then remember never to move on the path of knowledge. Move on the path of knowing, being, because only then you gain something: not that you have more information, but you become more, and that is the crucial point to be understood – you have to become more.\nYour poverty is not of information, your poverty is of being. You are poor and you go on hiding that poverty through accumulating things. And knowledge is also a thing: words, theories, philosophies, systems, theologies – all things; subtle, abstract, but still things. You are not growing, you remain the same, and you create a delusion around you that you have come to know.\nThese sutras of Lao Tzu have to be understood in this light.\nWITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD.\nBecause deep down you are the world. World is nothing but you are large. In fact there is no need to go anywhere to know anything; if you know yourself you have known the whole humanity, if you know your anger you have known all anger, if you know your violence you have known all wars; there is no need to go to Viet Nam, no need to go to Korea, no need to go to Palestine, or anywhere, if you know your violence you have known all violence. If you know your love you have known all – the whole history of love; the never written, the never known, even THAT you have known because you are the seed!\nIt is just like taking a drop of water from the ocean; you analyze that drop; you have known the whole ocean if you know that drop because in the small drop the whole ocean is condensed, it is a miniature ocean. If you analyze the drop and come to know that it consists of H20, you know that the whole ocean consists of H20. Now there is no need to go on and on and on, one drop is enough. If you know the taste of one drop, that it is salty, you know that the whole ocean is salty – and that drop is YOU.\nWITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE\nWORLD... Because you are the world, an atomic world, and everything is happening in you. It may be happening on a vaster scale in the world, the quantity may be more, but the quality is the same.\nUnderstanding oneself one understands all.\nThere is a beautiful story in the Upanishads: A young man, Swetaketu, came back from his guru’s house, from his GURUKUL, the family of his guru, learned, and of course, as young men are bound to be, very proud of his learning. Haughty. Egoistic. His father, the seer Uddalak, watched him coming – he was coming, entering the village, and his father watched him from the window. The father became sad: This is not learning! He has become a man of knowledge. This is not knowing!\nUddalak said to his own heart: I had not sent him for this. He missed the point! He wasted his time! Because knowing is humble – not humble in the sense that it is opposite to ego, it is not related to ego at all, not even as an opposite, because even the opposite carries something of it.\nNot feeling that his son is humble, the father became very very sad. He is getting old, and here comes this boy having wasted many years of his life – why does he look so PROUD? Knowing always makes you humble.\nThis word humble is beautiful. It comes from the root HUMUS, the root really means earthy, of the earth, non.pretentious, and the same root is the base of the words HUMAN and HUMANITY. You become human only when you become humble, you become humble only when you are of the earth – of the earth in the sense: unpretentious, simple, unconditioned, earthy.\nHere comes the son so proud and haughty, he must have become a man of knowledge – and he had become one. He came, he touched his father’s feet, but it was just a formality. How can a man who has become so egoistic bow down?\nThe father said, Swetaketu, I see your body bent, but not you. And what misfortune has happened to you? Why do you look so haughty? A man of knowing becomes humble, Swetaketu. Have you heard anything about that One, knowing which, one knows all?\nSwetaketu said: What are you talking about? How can one know all by knowing one? Absurd! I have known all that could be known in the university, I have become as profound as one can become in all the subjects that are taught there. I have exhausted the whole possibility of learning. When my master said to me: Now you know all and you can go back home, then only I came back – but of what you are speaking, that ‘one’ – never heard of it. Nobody talked about it in the university. Grammar we learnt, language, history, myth, philosophy, theology, religion, poetry – everything that is known to man I have learnt, and I have become proficient, and I have attained to the highest degree that the university can confer, but we never heard about that ‘one’ – what are you talking about? Have you gone mad? How can one know all by knowing one?\nUddalak said, Yes, that One is you. Swetaketu, TAT TWAM ASI, that art thou. If you know this One you will know all, and all that you have known is just rot. You have wasted your energy. Go back! Never come again unless you know that One by knowing which all is known. Because, said Uddalak to his son, in our family no one has been a brahmin just by name. We have called ourselves brahmins because we have known the Brahma. You don’t belong to our family if you don’t know that One, go back!\nThat One are you, that art thou. A very small seed, almost invisible to yourself. Unless you search deep, and search long, with perseverance and patience, you will not encounter it.\nThat seed is within you, that is your within ness, and the whole vast world is nothing but you written on a large canvas. Man is humanity. You are the world.\nSAYS LAO TZU:\nWITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S ,WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN.\nThere is no need to look out of the windows – windows are your senses: eyes, ears, nose – these are the windows, there is no need to look from these windows.\nWITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN. You can\nsee the ultimate within.\nHave you seen Buddha images, sitting silently with closed eyes, unmoving?\nThere are stories in India about people remaining in meditation for so long that birds settled on their bodies, they made their nests in their hair, and ants crawled for so long on them that these ants forgot completely that ‘here sits a man.’ They started living there.\nWhat were these men doing? Creepers crawled on their body thinking it was a good support. So unmoving, what were they doing there? They were not doing anything. Closing all their windows they were looking at the splendour of splendours, they were looking at themselves – and it is such a tremendous mystery and such a beautiful phenomenon that nothing like it can ever be encountered anywhere else, because wherever you go and whatsoever you see the report will be second-hand.\nI can see your face but my eyes will be the mediators, they will report, I will never be able to see your face directly, it will be always indirect. I can go to the rosebush and look at the beautiful flowers, but that beauty is second-hand because my eyes will report. There is an agency. I cannot come in direct contact with the rose, the eyes will always be there. The smell will come through the nose. I can listen to the singing birds but that song will always be secondhand, and unless you know firsthand how can you know the Tao of heaven? How can you know the ultimate? The very ground of being? There is only one possibility of coming in contact with the ultimate directly, immediately, without any mediators, and that is – inside yourself. Close all the doors and windows and move within.\nIt happened – One of the most wise women ever born was Rabia Al-Adawia. She was a Sufi, a great mystic, incomparable; she was sitting inside her hut with closed eyes doing something – nobody knows what. Another mystic of the name of Hassan was staying with her, and it was morning, and the sun started coming up, and it was tremendously beautiful, with the birds singing and the trees happy again to see the light and the whole world celebrating the morn. Hassan stood there, then he called Rabia saying: Rabia, come out! See the glory of God! What a beautiful morning! Rabia said: Hassan, rather on the contrary, you come in and see God himself. THERE I know is beauty, the beauty of creation, but it is nothing compared to the beauty of the Creator. So rather, YOU come in!\nI don’t know whether Hassan understood or not, but this is the whole thing. Knowledge goes out. When you go out you can know many things but it will be information second-hand.\nThat’s what science is; science is always second-hand, it can never be first-hand. It can never have that freshness which religion can have.\nHowsoever deep an Einstein goes the depth will be of the outside. He cannot come fresh out of it.\nAnd Albert Einstein felt it in his last days – somebody asked him just two or three days before he died: What would you like to be if there is another opportunity given by God to you to come to\nthe earth, what would you like to become? He said, Next time rather than becoming a scientist, I would prefer to become a plumber. I would like to live a simple and ordinary life. I would tike to live absolutely unknown to the outer world. I would like to live anonymously, nobody knowing about me, so that nobody disturbs me.\nHe is groping in the right direction. He is groping in the same direction where he can become a Buddha any day.\nWhen one gets fed up with the outside one turns in. Then one would like to close all the doors and all the windows and just rest within.\nWITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN.\nScience goes on discovering laws and laws and laws but it will never discover THE law, and THE LAW is the meaning of the word Tao.\nScience will go on discovering gods and gods and gods but will never discover THE GOD, and THE GOD IS the meaning of the word Tao: the very ultimate, beyond which nothing exists, beyond which nothing is possible.\nScience goes on discovering – and every day the more science discovers, the more old theories are discarded and thrown into the rubbish bin. And this is going to happen to every scientific theory one day or other. All scientific theories are doomed to be thrown into the rubbish heap because they don’t know THE LAW. They are only reflections in the lake not the real moon. The real moon is within and the who]e world functions as a mirror.\nWhen you see beauty in a rose flower, have you ever pondered over the fact whether the beauty is there in the rose flower or the beauty is poured by you? Because there are moments when you pass the same rose-bush but nothing happens, nothing special, nothing extraordinary, just an ordinary rose, but in another moment, in another mood, in another state of mind, suddenly it takes on a beauty, a flavour, it becomes a new dimension; doors open, mysteries are revealed. What is happening is that the rose is just a mirror. Whatsoever you pour into it you see.\nYou come before a mirror, you look in the mirror, the mirror simply mirrors YOU, it is YOU. If you are ugly the mirror reports an ugly figure, if you are beautiful the mirror reports beauty.\nThere are moments when you are ugly then all roses become ugly, there are moments when you are sad then all moons become sad, there are moments when you are in hell then the earth becomes hell. You create reality around you, you project reality around you. You have within you the creator, the one by knowing which all is known.\nThat’s why in aesthetics for centuries thinkers have been trying to define what beauty is and have not been able to define it. They cannot because it does not exist there outside, it is a pouring from the within. The rose flower is not beautiful, you create the beauty around it. It is just like a peg; you hang beauty on it, it becomes beautiful. That’s why when a poet passes the rose flower is so beautiful, you cannot conceive! And then passes a scientist absolutely oblivious of the fact that the rose is blooming, that the rose exists. Then passes a businessman; he looks at the rose and thinks\nhow much he can earn out of it if he sells it. Then comes a child, plucks the rose, plays with it for a few moments, forgets about it, goes on his way...\nThe rose is nothing. It is you who brings the meaning to it.\nPeople come to me every day and they ask again and again in a thousand and one ways: What is the meaning of life? It has no meaning. You bring meaning to it. You create meaning. Meaning is not an objective fact, so don’t look for meaning and don’t search for meaning. If you go on searching you are bound to come to the truth that life is meaningless.\nThat’s how existentialists in the West have come to discover that life is meaningless; and they have stopped there, which is very unfortunate. In the East we have come to know it but we have never stopped there. Buddha also came to know that life is meaningless but he never stopped there. This is stopping half-way! Life IS meaningless, but that doesn’t mean that your life needs to be meaningless, no; life is meaningless if you don’t bring meaning to it. There is no meaning IN it, the meaning has to be given to it. You pour down your being into life, it becomes vibrant with meaning. Then it sings, it dances, it becomes divine.\nPeople ask me, Where is God? Can you show us? I cannot show you God, nobody can show you because God has to be found within. Then you can see him anywhere. Then in a rose you will see him – the rose will become the mirror and you will see God. Then a bird is singing in the morning, and suddenly the note takes on a flavour which was never there – you contributed it, it becomes divine.\nOnce God is discovered within everything becomes divine. If you have not discovered it within and you go on asking: Where is God? and you go on asking about his address, you will never reach. And all addresses are false because he lives within you, he needs no address.\nThere is a beautiful story, very ancient. It is said that God created the world, everything was beautiful, then he created man and everything became horrible. With man entered hell. And man started complaining and became almost impossible for God to sleep or to do anything – so many people, and they went on knocking at his door day and night, and it became a nightmare. He must have thought many times to destroy man so that the peace of the world could be regained.\nBut then some wise counsellor said, There is no need to destroy man, you simply change your abode. You don’t live here on this earth. (He used to live here, because of you he had to change his abode.) So God said, Where should I go?\nOne counsellor said: It is good that you go to Everest. God said, You don’t know. Sooner or later there will come a man named Hillary, and he will reach there, and the whole thing will start again. Then somebody said: Go to the moon. God said: You don’t know; these things won’t help much. Sooner or later man is going to reach everywhere. Suggest somewhere to me where he will not even suspect I am. Then an old counsellor came near to him, said something into his ear, and he nodded; he said, Yes, you are right. The old man suggested: Then you hide within man. He will never suspect that. He will search and seek everywhere except in his own inner world.\nThe story is beautiful. Almost factual. Not a story but a truth.\nWITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN. THE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS.\nLooks paradoxical, but only looks paradoxical. It is not. It is a simple fact. The more one pursues knowledge the less one knows. Go to the pundits; they know so much, but look into their eyes – not even a glimmer, watch them – not even a gesture of knowing; be with them, and there is nothing, they are hollow, absolutely false, nothing inside, just a painted hollowness, a decorated hollowness, decorated by many scriptures, the words of those who have known, but all borrowed, all dead, and surrounded by these dead words they have almost become dead themselves.\nGo to a man of knowledge and you will taste dust around him. He may look very very old and ancient, almost in the grave, but you will not find the freshness that is part of life. You will not see a living river in him, flowing, moving always into the unknown. Knowledge is a limitation, howsoever vast, a limitation still. That’s why Socrates says that: When I was young I thought I knew all. When I became a little mature I started suspecting, and then I came to realize, that I don’t know that much. When I really became old I realized that I don’t know at all.\nIt happened, the oracle at Delphi declared that: Socrates is the wisest man on earth today. People who heard this came to Socrates and they said: This is a paradox! And we are puzzled! Then who is right? If the oracle is right then you are wrong, if you are right then the oracle is wrong, and neither can be wrong. We believe in you, we have known you, we have been around you, we have felt you that you must be true; whatsoever you say cannot be a lie. But the oracle, the divine oracle, it has never been found telling lies. All that has been predicted by the Delphic oracle has always been found true; so we are in a fix, you help us. You say you don’t know anything, in fact you say that you know only one thing – that you know nothing, and then comes this oracle and says that Socrates is the wisest man on earth.\nSocrates said: There must have been some misunderstanding because I know more about myself than anybody can know about me and I tell you again that I know nothing; at the most this much I can permit – that I know that I know nothing. Nothing more. You go and ask the oracle again, there has been some misunderstanding. Either you have not interpreted it rightly or something else... go again! They went again and they asked the oracle and the oracle laughed and said, That’s why we say he is the wisest man on earth, because he knows only that he knows nothing.\nThere is no paradox. This is the indication of a wise man, that he has come to realize that knowledge is futile that knowledge knows nothing that knowledge is rubbish that knowledge is nonsense howsoever logical it pretends to be – those are all pretensions.\nTHE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS.\nWhy does it happen? Because the further you pursue knowledge, the further you are going away from yourself. The more you try to find the truth somewhere outside of you, the further away you are moving, the further away from the Whole in search of the Whole, the further away from yourself in search of your authentic being, the further away from consciousness in your search.\nWhat are you searching for? That which you are searching for is already within you. Religion is the search for that which is already the case. Religion is the search for that which is already the reality.\nIf you go further away from yourself you will know less and less and you will think you are knowing more and more. Scriptures you will know, words you will know, theories, and you can go on spinning and you can go on weaving more and more out of these words and you can make palaces in the air, but they cannot be more than airy, abstract – they don’t exist, they are made of the same stuff as dreams. Thoughts and dreams are made of the same stuff – they are ripples on the surface of an ocean; they have nothing substantial in them. If you want to know the truth come back home.\nI always say seek and you will miss, don’t seek – and find, because the very effort to seek means that you have taken it for granted that it is not with you already. From the very beginning your search is doomed. One day, seeking, searching, accumulating knowledge, the fact will strike home that you are a fool, that it would have been better before going into the vast world to seek, to have looked inside.\nAgain a small parable of Rabia Al.Adawia. One evening, the sun was setting and the neighbourhood found her searching for something on the street – an old woman, everybody loved her; of course everybody thought her a little crazy, but she was a beautiful person – so they all rushed to help her and they asked, What has been lost? What are you searching for? She said: My needle. I was doing some needlework and I have lost my needle. Help me! You are so kind! So they all engaged in the search.\nThen one man, seeing the fact that the street was so big and the needle was such a small tiny thing and that unless they exactly knew where it had been dropped it would be almost impossible to find it, came to Rabia and said: Tell us exactly the spot. Rabia said: Don’t ask that because in fact I have not lost it outside my house, I lost it inside.\nThey all stopped searching and said: Crazy woman! Then why are you searching here outside in the street when you have lost it inside the house? Rabia said: THERE is much darkness. Here is a little light, how can you seek when there is darkness? And you know I am poor, not even a lamp with me. How can you seek when there is darkness? So I am seeking here because still a little sunlight is left, and still something can be done to search.\nThe people started laughing. They said: You are really crazy! We know that in darkness it is difficult to search, but then the only way is to borrow a lamp from somebody and search for it there. Rabia said: I never thought you people were so wise. Then why do you always SEEK outside? I was just following your ways. If you are so understanding why don’t you borrow a lamp from me and search inside? I know there is darkness...\nThis parable is meaningful. You search outside: there is a reason – because inside everything is so dark. You close your eyes and there is dark night, you cannot see anything; even if something is seen it is nothing but a part of the outside reflected in the inner lake – thoughts floating which you have gathered in the marketplace, faces coming and going, but they belong to the outside world. Just reflections of the outside, and vast darkness One becomes afraid. Then one thinks it is better to seek outside, there at least there is light.\nBut that is not the point. Where have you lost your truth? Where have you lost your being? Where have you lost your God? Where have you lost your happiness, your bliss? Better it will be before you go to the infinte maze of the outside world, better it will be to first look within. If you cannot find\nthere then it is all right – you go and search outside. But that has never happened. Whoever has looked within has always found – because it is already there – only a look is needed, a conversion, a returning of consciousness. Just a deep look.\nTHE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS. THEREFORE THE SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT...\nIn the running you are missing, wasting life, energy, opportunity. Don’t go on running about and about and about. Stop running, that’s what all meditation is about: stop running, sit quietly with closed windows and doors, settle inside, rest inside, relax inside, let the turmoil settle a little, then start looking.\nIt will be like groping in the beginning, in the beginning the darkness will be too much, but as you become accustomed to it the darkness starts changing its quality.\nIt is just like when you come from the outside and it has been a hot day and the sun has been too cruel and you come inside the room of your house, you cannot see; everything looks dark because the eyes are focussed with the sun, the eyes are accustomed to too much light. A sudden change – the eyes will take a little time to settle, that’s all. Patience is needed. When you move inwards nothing will be seen – don’t be impatient, don’t say just after a minute that all the Buddhas are false, they say inside is bliss but I don’t see anything.\nIt happened to one of the most penetrating thinkers the West has ever produced, it happened to David Hume. Again and again coming across the Eastern teachings – Go within; Close your eyes; See – one day he thought: Let us try, knowing well that there is nothing. These Eastern people are mad, illogical, irrational, introverts, fooling themselves and nobody else. He said, Better at least to try. He closed his eyes just a single minute – then he opened them and wrote down in his diary: There is nothing except darkness, a few thoughts floating, a few sensations, and nothing else...\nDon’t be so impatient. Wait. Let things settle inside, it takes time. You have been unsettling them for so many lives, settling will take a little time, a little patience – and nothing else is needed. You need not try to settle them because that will disturb them again, you will stir them up more; you simply don’t do anything. because that will disturb them again, That is the meaning of Lao Tzu’s beautiful phrase WU – WEI, do by not doing. You simply don’t do anything and it happens; that is doing by not doing. Just close your eyes and wait and wait and wait and you see layers of disturbance falling, settling, things falling into their places, and silence; and by and by darkness becomes light, and that One is known by knowing which all is known. Because that One is the seed. That art thou, Swetaketu.\nTHEREFORE THE SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT, UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT SEEING, ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.\nAnd that is the greatest accomplishment, that which is accomplished without doing anything at all. Remember, whatsoever YOU can do cannot go beyond you, how can it go? If you do it, it will remain lower than you, it cannot go higher than you. Whatsoever you do will be part of your mind, it cannot be transcendental. Whatsoever you do will be done by the ego, it cannot be your being. So non-doing is the only way to do it.\nSitting still, sitting quietly, not doing anything, and the grass grows by itself. And then the effort, the doing, is still. Such a tremendous and vast silence descends on you... was reading a Japanese poem just a few days before; line of it penetrated me very deeply, came part of my heart. says:\nWITH NO BIRD SINGING HE MOUNTAIN IS YET MORE STILL.\nWhen there is no doing, even the birds are no more singing, nothing is there, everything is calm and quiet, suddenly you become aware nat nothing has been lacking from the very beginning; :hat which you are seeking – you have always been that. Suddenly you realize :hat the Master of Masters is sitting there on the throne. And you start laughing.\nBokuju became enlightened – enlightened? Don’t take the word very seriously, is nothing serious, it is the ultimate in fun, it is the last joke – Bokuju became enlightened and he started laughing, a belly laugh, he became crazy. People gathered, and they started asking, What is the matter? Please tell us, what has happened? He said, Nothing has happened, and I was mad, searching and seeking for that which is already there in me.\nWhenever people used to ask Bokuju: What did you do when you became enlightened? he said: I laughed, and I laughed loudly. And he said: I have still not stopped laughing. Whether you hear it or not, that is not the point, I have still not stopped laughing. What a joke! You have it already and you have been searching and seeking and you could not find it, not because it was not there but because it was so much there and so close to you that you could not see it.\nEyes can see that which is far away, eyes can see that which is distant because eyes need a perspective, hands can touch that which is different and distant, ears can hear that which is outside – that’s why Lao Tzu says he understands without seeing, because how can you see yourself? Who will see whom? The seer and the seen are one there, no eyes are needed. Who will do? Who will make the effort? It will be just like a dog chasing its own tail, it will be simply foolish.…\nAnd this is what you are doing, chasing your own tail. Stop and see it is your own tail, there is no need to chase it, and by chasing you are not going to get it ever. By chasing you miss, by non chasing you accomplish.\n... ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.\nAnd then time disappears. Then knowing disappears, because knowing is there to know something, knowing is a faculty to KNOW; once you have known, there is no point in the faculty remaining, it simply disappears.\nTime disappears because time is there because you are frustrated, it is created out of your frustration so that you can hope for the future and somehow bear the frustration and tolerate it, and console yourself.\nMind and time are not two things but aspects of one thing. When both disappear for the first time YOU ARE in your absolute glory. Say it this way – you have become a god, a Buddha.\nAnd ask the awakened ones: they all say the same thing, that it has to be accomplished without any effort on your part. It is the effort that has created the whole mess.\nDropping all effort, just sitting silently looking within – WU-WEI.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6926","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_3/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_3/>Tao.

IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO
OF HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS. THEREFORE THE
SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT SEEING,
ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is not knowledge, it is knowing. Knowledge is of the mind,
knowing is of the being, and the difference and the distance, is
tremendously vast.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is not only quantitative, it is also qualitative.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge and knowing – they are as different as heaven and hell,
earth and the sky, so the first thing to understand is the difference
between knowledge and knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is never of the present, it is always of the past. The
moment you say you know it is already a dead thing, it has already left
its marks on the memory, it is like dust clinging to you. You have
already moved away from that.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing is always immediate, knowing is here and now. You cannot say
anything about it, you can only be it. The moment you speak of it, even
knowing becomes knowledge; that’s why all those who</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>have known, they say it cannot be said. The moment you speak of it
the very nature of it changes; it has become knowledge. It is no more
the beautiful alive phenomenon of knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing has no past, it has no future, it has only the present. And
remember, present is not part of time.</p><p><br></p><p>People ordinarily think that time is divided between past, future and
present. They are absolutely wrong. Time is divided between past and
future, present is not a part of time at all. You cannot catch hold of
it in time. Pursue it and you will miss. Try to grasp it and it will
always be out of your reach, because it is part of eternity not part of
time.</p><p><br></p><p>Present is eternity crossing time. It is a meeting point where
eternity and the temporal meet.</p><p><br></p><p>In the present is knowing, in the past is knowledge, Whenever you
know, you start planning. The more you know, the more you plan. Knowing
means the past, planning means the future – then you don’t allow the
future freedom, you try to fix it into the pigeon holes of the past. You
would like it to be just a repetition of the past, howsoever modified,
decorated, but just a repetition of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of knowledge is a man of planning, and life is an unplanned
flow. Life is freedom, you cannot pigeon hole it, you cannot categorize
it, that’s why a man of knowledge misses life. He knows much, and he
knows nothing. He knows too much and he is just empty and hollow. You
cannot find more shallow a person than a man of knowledge. He is just
surface and surface, he has no depth, because depth comes through
eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is horizontal, it moves in a line on the horizon. Eternity is
vertical, it moves into depth and height. That is the meaning of Jesus’
cross: time crossing eternity, or eternity crossing time. Jesus’ hands
are time, they move into past and future, crucified in time, resurrected
into eternity. His being is vertical – everybody’s being is vertical,
only the body, the hands, the material part of you, is horizontal.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge creates future, future creates worry. The more you know,
the more worried, the more uneasy you are, never at ease, at home, a
deep trembling inside. It is a pathology. A man of knowing is totally
different – he lives here. This moment is all, as if tomorrow exists not
– and really it exists not, it has never existed, it is part of the game
of the mind. It is a dream of the man of knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment is all, and the total. Knowing moves into this moment
vertically, goes deeper and deeper and deeper. A man of knowing has
depth, even his surface is nothing but part of depth. He has no
superficial surface, his surface is also part of depth. And a man of
knowledge? He has no depth, his depth is also part of his surface.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the paradox: that a man of knowing knows and a man of
knowledge does not know, cannot know, because knowledge cannot meet life
– that is the barrier, on the contrary, the only barrier, the hindrance.
It is just like this: a mother knows that the child is hers, the father
has knowledge that the child is his. The father has only a belief. Deep
down he does not know. Only a mother knows!</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, Mulla Nasrudin was working as a vizier to a small
kingdom. The king was very generous; not very rich (the kingdom was
small) but still very generous. Every year Nasrudin would</p><p>come and tell him that his wife had given birth to a child, and the
king would give valuable presents to him, to the child, to the mother,
but then it became too much because it was every year.</p><p><br></p><p>When the twelfth child was born and Nasrudin came, the king said, Now
Mulla, it is too much, and the world is suffering too much from over
population, what are you doing? If you go at this speed you will create
a small nation. You go on, every year – stop it! Let this child be the
last! And if you cannot stop, if you are unable to stop, then it is
better to commit suicide rather than to overburden the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasrudin was very depressed. Then the thirteenth child was born –
what to do? So he thought, it is better now not to go to the king – go
to the forest and commit suicide, as the king has said. So he went to
the forest, he prepared everything to hang himself, just a split second
and he would have been hanging under the tree dead – suddenly he said,
Nasrudin! Beware! You may be hanging the wrong man!</p><p><br></p><p>A father simply believes, a mother knows. Knowing is like a mother,
knowledge is like a father.</p><p><br></p><p>All knowledge is belief. Knowing is not belief, it is KNOWING. It is
your perception it is your vision it is your growth. It is just like the
mother – the child grows in her womb, she knows, the child is HER PART,
her own extension, her own being, blood and bone. A father is extrinsic,
he is not intrinsic. He simply believes that the child is his.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of knowledge believes that he knows. A man of knowing
knows.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing is a transformation in your being, it is like a pregnancy,
you have to carry it, you have to give birth to yourself, a resurrection
into eternity, a turning away from time and a moving in no time, a
conversion from mind to no mind, but something so tremendous that you
know it is happening in you.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of knowledge goes on collecting dust from Buddhas. Those who
have known, he believes in them. Whatsoever he believes in is dead. He
has not given birth to himself. He has collected knowledge from others,
everything is borrowed, and how can knowledge be borrowed? How can being
be borrowed? If knowledge is going to be true it is going to be of the
nature of being.</p><p><br></p><p>George Gurdjieff used to ask people – seekers who would come to him –
the first thing he used to ask is: Are you interested in knowledge or
being? Because here we give being and we are not concerned about
knowledge, so you decide well. If you are concerned with knowledge, go
somewhere else. If you are concerned with being, remain here. But make a
very very clear decision.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the difference between being and knowledge? The same as the
difference between knowledge and knowing. Knowing IS being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not something that is being added to you, it is something you
grow into. Knowledge is something which is added to you. You don’t grow
through it, rather, you carry it as a burden. So you will always find a
man of knowledge burdened, heavily burdened, mountains of knowledge he
is carrying on his shoulders. You will see his face very serious, deadly
serious, and his heart completely crushed under the burden.</p><p>A man of knowing is weightless. He has nothing to carry. He can fly
into the sky. The gravitation of the earth does not affect him. He is
not pulled towards the earth because the earth can pull only that which
is heavy. He remains on the earth but he is not of the earth. That is
the meaning of Jesus’ saying – he says again and again: My kingdom is
not of this world.<span class=s4></span>It is of some other world,
the</p><p>world of being, of eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand the distinction well, then remember never to move
on the path of knowledge. Move on the path of knowing, being, because
only then you gain something: not that you have more information, but
you become more, and that is the crucial point to be understood – you
have to become more.</p><p><br></p><p>Your poverty is not of information, your poverty is of being. You are
poor and you go on hiding that poverty through accumulating things. And
knowledge is also a thing: words, theories, philosophies, systems,
theologies – all things; subtle, abstract, but still things. You are not
growing, you remain the same, and you create a delusion around you that
you have come to know.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras of Lao Tzu have to be understood in this light.</p><p><br></p><p>WITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE WORLD.</p><p><br></p><p>Because deep down you are the world. World is nothing but you are
large. In fact there is no need to go anywhere to know anything; if you
know yourself you have known the whole humanity, if you know your anger
you have known all anger, if you know your violence you have known all
wars; there is no need to go to Viet Nam, no need to go to Korea, no
need to go to Palestine, or anywhere, if you know your violence you have
known all violence. If you know your love you have known all – the whole
history of love; the never written, the never known, even THAT you have
known because you are the seed!</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like taking a drop of water from the ocean; you analyze
that drop; you have known the whole ocean if you know that drop because
in the small drop the whole ocean is condensed, it is a miniature ocean.
If you analyze the drop and come to know that it consists of H20, you
know that the whole ocean consists of H20. Now there is no need to go on
and on and on, one drop is enough. If you know the taste of one drop,
that it is salty, you know that the whole ocean is salty – and that drop
is YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>WITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE</p><p>WORLD... Because you are the world, an atomic world, and everything
is happening in you. It may be happening on a vaster scale in the world,
the quantity may be more, but the quality is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Understanding oneself one understands all.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story in the Upanishads: A young man, Swetaketu,
came back from his guru’s house, from his GURUKUL, the family of his
guru, learned, and of course, as young men are bound to be, very proud
of his learning. Haughty. Egoistic. His father, the seer Uddalak,
watched him coming – he was coming, entering the village, and his father
watched him from the window. The father became sad: This is not
learning! He has become a man of knowledge. This is not knowing!</p><p>Uddalak said to his own heart: I had not sent him for this. He missed
the point! He wasted his time! Because knowing is humble – not humble in
the sense that it is opposite to ego, it is not related to ego at all,
not even as an opposite, because even the opposite carries something of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Not feeling that his son is humble, the father became very very sad.
He is getting old, and here comes this boy having wasted many years of
his life – why does he look so PROUD? Knowing always makes you
humble.</p><p><br></p><p>This word humble is beautiful. It comes from the root HUMUS, the root
really means earthy, of the earth, non.pretentious, and the same root is
the base of the words HUMAN and HUMANITY. You become human only when you
become humble, you become humble only when you are of the earth – of the
earth in the sense: unpretentious, simple, unconditioned, earthy.</p><p><br></p><p>Here comes the son so proud and haughty, he must have become a man of
knowledge – and he had become one. He came, he touched his father’s
feet, but it was just a formality. How can a man who has become so
egoistic bow down?</p><p><br></p><p>The father said, Swetaketu, I see your body bent, but not you. And
what misfortune has happened to you? Why do you look so haughty? A man
of knowing becomes humble, Swetaketu. Have you heard anything about that
One, knowing which, one knows all?</p><p><br></p><p>Swetaketu said: What are you talking about? How can one know all by
knowing one? Absurd! I have known all that could be known in the
university, I have become as profound as one can become in all the
subjects that are taught there. I have exhausted the whole possibility
of learning. When my master said to me: Now you know all and you can go
back home, then only I came back – but of what you are speaking, that
‘one’ – never heard of it. Nobody talked about it in the university.
Grammar we learnt, language, history, myth, philosophy, theology,
religion, poetry – everything that is known to man I have learnt, and I
have become proficient, and I have attained to the highest degree that
the university can confer, but we never heard about that ‘one’ – what
are you talking about? Have you gone mad? How can one know all by
knowing one?</p><p><br></p><p>Uddalak said, Yes, that One is you. Swetaketu, TAT TWAM ASI, that art
thou. If you know this One you will know all, and all that you have
known is just rot. You have wasted your energy. Go back! Never come
again unless you know that One by knowing which all is known. Because,
said Uddalak to his son, in our family no one has been a brahmin just by
name. We have called ourselves brahmins because we have known the
Brahma. You don’t belong to our family if you don’t know that One, go
back!</p><p><br></p><p>That One are you, that art thou. A very small seed, almost invisible
to yourself. Unless you search deep, and search long, with perseverance
and patience, you will not encounter it.</p><p><br></p><p>That seed is within you, that is your within ness, and the whole vast
world is nothing but you written on a large canvas. Man is humanity. You
are the world.</p><p><br></p><p>SAYS LAO TZU:</p><p><br></p><p>WITHOUT STEPPING OUTSIDE ONE’S DOORS ONE CAN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S ,WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO
OF HEAVEN.</p><p>There is no need to look out of the windows – windows are your
senses: eyes, ears, nose – these are the windows, there is no need to
look from these windows.</p><p><br></p><p>WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN.
You can</p><p>see the ultimate within.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen Buddha images, sitting silently with closed eyes,
unmoving?</p><p><br></p><p>There are stories in India about people remaining in meditation for
so long that birds settled on their bodies, they made their nests in
their hair, and ants crawled for so long on them that these ants forgot
completely that ‘here sits a man.’ They started living there.</p><p><br></p><p>What were these men doing? Creepers crawled on their body thinking it
was a good support. So unmoving, what were they doing there? They were
not doing anything. Closing all their windows they were looking at the
splendour of splendours, they were looking at themselves – and it is
such a tremendous mystery and such a beautiful phenomenon that nothing
like it can ever be encountered anywhere else, because wherever you go
and whatsoever you see the report will be second-hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I can see your face but my eyes will be the mediators, they will
report, I will never be able to see your face directly, it will be
always indirect. I can go to the rosebush and look at the beautiful
flowers, but that beauty is second-hand because my eyes will report.
There is an agency. I cannot come in direct contact with the rose, the
eyes will always be there. The smell will come through the nose. I can
listen to the singing birds but that song will always be secondhand, and
unless you know firsthand how can you know the Tao of heaven? How can
you know the ultimate? The very ground of being? There is only one
possibility of coming in contact with the ultimate directly,
immediately, without any mediators, and that is – inside yourself. Close
all the doors and windows and move within.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened – One of the most wise women ever born was Rabia
Al-Adawia. She was a Sufi, a great mystic, incomparable; she was sitting
inside her hut with closed eyes doing something – nobody knows what.
Another mystic of the name of Hassan was staying with her, and it was
morning, and the sun started coming up, and it was tremendously
beautiful, with the birds singing and the trees happy again to see the
light and the whole world celebrating the morn. Hassan stood there, then
he called Rabia saying: Rabia, come out! See the glory of God! What a
beautiful morning! Rabia said: Hassan, rather on the contrary, you come
in and see God himself. THERE I know is beauty, the beauty of creation,
but it is nothing compared to the beauty of the Creator. So rather, YOU
come in!</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know whether Hassan understood or not, but this is the whole
thing. Knowledge goes out. When you go out you can know many things but
it will be information second-hand.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what science is; science is always second-hand, it can never
be first-hand. It can never have that freshness which religion can
have.</p><p><br></p><p>Howsoever deep an Einstein goes the depth will be of the outside. He
cannot come fresh out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>And Albert Einstein felt it in his last days – somebody asked him
just two or three days before he died: What would you like to be if
there is another opportunity given by God to you to come to</p><p>the earth, what would you like to become? He said, Next time rather
than becoming a scientist, I would prefer to become a plumber. I would
like to live a simple and ordinary life. I would tike to live absolutely
unknown to the outer world. I would like to live anonymously, nobody
knowing about me, so that nobody disturbs me.</p><p><br></p><p>He is groping in the right direction. He is groping in the same
direction where he can become a Buddha any day.</p><p><br></p><p>When one gets fed up with the outside one turns in. Then one would
like to close all the doors and all the windows and just rest
within.</p><p><br></p><p>WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF
HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Science goes on discovering laws and laws and laws but it will never
discover THE law, and THE LAW is the meaning of the word Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>Science will go on discovering gods and gods and gods but will never
discover THE GOD, and THE GOD IS the meaning of the word Tao: the very
ultimate, beyond which nothing exists, beyond which nothing is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Science goes on discovering – and every day the more science
discovers, the more old theories are discarded and thrown into the
rubbish bin. And this is going to happen to every scientific theory one
day or other. All scientific theories are doomed to be thrown into the
rubbish heap because they don’t know THE LAW. They are only reflections
in the lake not the real moon. The real moon is within and the who]e
world functions as a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>When you see beauty in a rose flower, have you ever pondered over the
fact whether the beauty is there in the rose flower or the beauty is
poured by you? Because there are moments when you pass the same
rose-bush but nothing happens, nothing special, nothing extraordinary,
just an ordinary rose, but in another moment, in another mood, in
another state of mind, suddenly it takes on a beauty, a flavour, it
becomes a new dimension; doors open, mysteries are revealed. What is
happening is that the rose is just a mirror. Whatsoever you pour into it
you see.</p><p><br></p><p>You come before a mirror, you look in the mirror, the mirror simply
mirrors YOU, it is YOU. If you are ugly the mirror reports an ugly
figure, if you are beautiful the mirror reports beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>There are moments when you are ugly then all roses become ugly, there
are moments when you are sad then all moons become sad, there are
moments when you are in hell then the earth becomes hell. You create
reality around you, you project reality around you. You have within you
the creator, the one by knowing which all is known.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in aesthetics for centuries thinkers have been trying to
define what beauty is and have not been able to define it. They cannot
because it does not exist there outside, it is a pouring from the
within. The rose flower is not beautiful, you create the beauty around
it. It is just like a peg; you hang beauty on it, it becomes beautiful.
That’s why when a poet passes the rose flower is so beautiful, you
cannot conceive! And then passes a scientist absolutely oblivious of the
fact that the rose is blooming, that the rose exists. Then passes a
businessman; he looks at the rose and thinks</p><p>how much he can earn out of it if he sells it. Then comes a child,
plucks the rose, plays with it for a few moments, forgets about it, goes
on his way...</p><p><br></p><p>The rose is nothing. It is you who brings the meaning to it.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me every day and they ask again and again in a
thousand and one ways: What is the meaning of life? It has no meaning.
You bring meaning to it. You create meaning. Meaning is not an objective
fact, so don’t look for meaning and don’t search for meaning. If you go
on searching you are bound to come to the truth that life is
meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how existentialists in the West have come to discover that
life is meaningless; and they have stopped there, which is very
unfortunate. In the East we have come to know it but we have never
stopped there. Buddha also came to know that life is meaningless but he
never stopped there. This is stopping half-way! Life IS meaningless, but
that doesn’t mean that your life needs to be meaningless, no; life is
meaningless if you don’t bring meaning to it. There is no meaning IN it,
the meaning has to be given to it. You pour down your being into life,
it becomes vibrant with meaning. Then it sings, it dances, it becomes
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask me, Where is God? Can you show us? I cannot show you God,
nobody can show you because God has to be found within. Then you can see
him anywhere. Then in a rose you will see him – the rose will become the
mirror and you will see God. Then a bird is singing in the morning, and
suddenly the note takes on a flavour which was never there – you
contributed it, it becomes divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Once God is discovered within everything becomes divine. If you have
not discovered it within and you go on asking: Where is God? and you go
on asking about his address, you will never reach. And all addresses are
false because he lives within you, he needs no address.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story, very ancient. It is said that God created
the world, everything was beautiful, then he created man and everything
became horrible. With man entered hell. And man started complaining and
became almost impossible for God to sleep or to do anything – so many
people, and they went on knocking at his door day and night, and it
became a nightmare. He must have thought many times to destroy man so
that the peace of the world could be regained.</p><p><br></p><p>But then some wise counsellor said, There is no need to destroy man,
you simply change your abode. You don’t live here on this earth. (He
used to live here, because of you he had to change his abode.) So God
said, Where should I go?</p><p><br></p><p>One counsellor said: It is good that you go to Everest. God said, You
don’t know. Sooner or later there will come a man named Hillary, and he
will reach there, and the whole thing will start again. Then somebody
said: Go to the moon. God said: You don’t know; these things won’t help
much. Sooner or later man is going to reach everywhere. Suggest
somewhere to me where he will not even suspect I am. Then an old
counsellor came near to him, said something into his ear, and he nodded;
he said, Yes, you are right. The old man suggested: Then you hide within
man. He will never suspect that. He will search and seek everywhere
except in his own inner world.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is beautiful. Almost factual. Not a story but a truth.</p><p>WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF ONE’S WINDOWS ONE CAN SEE THE TAO OF HEAVEN.
THE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS.</p><p>Looks paradoxical, but only looks paradoxical. It is not. It is a
simple fact. The more one pursues knowledge the less one knows. Go to
the pundits; they know so much, but look into their eyes – not even a
glimmer, watch them – not even a gesture of knowing; be with them, and
there is nothing, they are hollow, absolutely false, nothing inside,
just a painted hollowness, a decorated hollowness, decorated by many
scriptures, the words of those who have known, but all borrowed, all
dead, and surrounded by these dead words they have almost become dead
themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Go to a man of knowledge and you will taste dust around him. He may
look very very old and ancient, almost in the grave, but you will not
find the freshness that is part of life. You will not see a living river
in him, flowing, moving always into the unknown. Knowledge is a
limitation, howsoever vast, a limitation still. That’s why Socrates says
that: When I was young I thought I knew all. When I became a little
mature I started suspecting, and then I came to realize, that I don’t
know that much. When I really became old I realized that I don’t know at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, the oracle at Delphi declared that: Socrates is the
wisest man on earth today. People who heard this came to Socrates and
they said: This is a paradox! And we are puzzled! Then who is right? If
the oracle is right then you are wrong, if you are right then the oracle
is wrong, and neither can be wrong. We believe in you, we have known
you, we have been around you, we have felt you that you must be true;
whatsoever you say cannot be a lie. But the oracle, the divine oracle,
it has never been found telling lies. All that has been predicted by the
Delphic oracle has always been found true; so we are in a fix, you help
us. You say you don’t know anything, in fact you say that you know only
one thing – that you know nothing, and then comes this oracle and says
that Socrates is the wisest man on earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said: There must have been some misunderstanding because I
know more about myself than anybody can know about me and I tell you
again that I know nothing; at the most this much I can permit – that I
know that I know nothing. Nothing more. You go and ask the oracle again,
there has been some misunderstanding. Either you have not interpreted it
rightly or something else... go again! They went again and they asked
the oracle and the oracle laughed and said, That’s why we say he is the
wisest man on earth, because he knows only that he knows nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no paradox. This is the indication of a wise man, that he
has come to realize that knowledge is futile that knowledge knows
nothing that knowledge is rubbish that knowledge is nonsense howsoever
logical it pretends to be – those are all pretensions.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does it happen? Because the further you pursue knowledge, the
further you are going away from yourself. The more you try to find the
truth somewhere outside of you, the further away you are moving, the
further away from the Whole in search of the Whole, the further away
from yourself in search of your authentic being, the further away from
consciousness in your search.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you searching for? That which you are searching for is
already within you. Religion is the search for that which is already the
case. Religion is the search for that which is already the reality.</p><p>If you go further away from yourself you will know less and less and
you will think you are knowing more and more. Scriptures you will know,
words you will know, theories, and you can go on spinning and you can go
on weaving more and more out of these words and you can make palaces in
the air, but they cannot be more than airy, abstract – they don’t exist,
they are made of the same stuff as dreams. Thoughts and dreams are made
of the same stuff – they are ripples on the surface of an ocean; they
have nothing substantial in them. If you want to know the truth come
back home.</p><p><br></p><p>I always say seek and you will miss, don’t seek – and find, because
the very effort to seek means that you have taken it for granted that it
is not with you already. From the very beginning your search is doomed.
One day, seeking, searching, accumulating knowledge, the fact will
strike home that you are a fool, that it would have been better before
going into the vast world to seek, to have looked inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Again a small parable of Rabia Al.Adawia. One evening, the sun was
setting and the neighbourhood found her searching for something on the
street – an old woman, everybody loved her; of course everybody thought
her a little crazy, but she was a beautiful person – so they all rushed
to help her and they asked, What has been lost? What are you searching
for? She said: My needle. I was doing some needlework and I have lost my
needle. Help me! You are so kind! So they all engaged in the search.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one man, seeing the fact that the street was so big and the
needle was such a small tiny thing and that unless they exactly knew
where it had been dropped it would be almost impossible to find it, came
to Rabia and said: Tell us exactly the spot. Rabia said: Don’t ask that
because in fact I have not lost it outside my house, I lost it
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>They all stopped searching and said: Crazy woman! Then why are you
searching here outside in the street when you have lost it inside the
house? Rabia said: THERE is much darkness. Here is a little light, how
can you seek when there is darkness? And you know I am poor, not even a
lamp with me. How can you seek when there is darkness? So I am seeking
here because still a little sunlight is left, and still something can be
done to search.</p><p><br></p><p>The people started laughing. They said: You are really crazy! We know
that in darkness it is difficult to search, but then the only way is to
borrow a lamp from somebody and search for it there. Rabia said: I never
thought you people were so wise. Then why do you always SEEK outside? I
was just following your ways. If you are so understanding why don’t you
borrow a lamp from me and search inside? I know there is darkness...</p><p><br></p><p>This parable is meaningful. You search outside: there is a reason –
because inside everything is so dark. You close your eyes and there is
dark night, you cannot see anything; even if something is seen it is
nothing but a part of the outside reflected in the inner lake – thoughts
floating which you have gathered in the marketplace, faces coming and
going, but they belong to the outside world. Just reflections of the
outside, and vast darkness One becomes afraid. Then one thinks it is
better to seek outside, there at least there is light.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not the point. Where have you lost your truth? Where have
you lost your being? Where have you lost your God? Where have you lost
your happiness, your bliss? Better it will be before you go to the
infinte maze of the outside world, better it will be to first look
within. If you cannot find</p><p>there then it is all right – you go and search outside. But that has
never happened. Whoever has looked within has always found – because it
is already there – only a look is needed, a conversion, a returning of
consciousness. Just a deep look.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FURTHER ONE PURSUES KNOWLEDGE THE LESS ONE KNOWS. THEREFORE THE
SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT...</p><p><br></p><p>In the running you are missing, wasting life, energy, opportunity.
Don’t go on running about and about and about. Stop running, that’s what
all meditation is about: stop running, sit quietly with closed windows
and doors, settle inside, rest inside, relax inside, let the turmoil
settle a little, then start looking.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be like groping in the beginning, in the beginning the
darkness will be too much, but as you become accustomed to it the
darkness starts changing its quality.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like when you come from the outside and it has been a hot
day and the sun has been too cruel and you come inside the room of your
house, you cannot see; everything looks dark because the eyes are
focussed with the sun, the eyes are accustomed to too much light. A
sudden change – the eyes will take a little time to settle, that’s all.
Patience is needed. When you move inwards nothing will be seen – don’t
be impatient, don’t say just after a minute that all the Buddhas are
false, they say inside is bliss but I don’t see anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to one of the most penetrating thinkers the West has ever
produced, it happened to David Hume. Again and again coming across the
Eastern teachings – Go within; Close your eyes; See – one day he
thought: Let us try, knowing well that there is nothing. These Eastern
people are mad, illogical, irrational, introverts, fooling themselves
and nobody else. He said, Better at least to try. He closed his eyes
just a single minute – then he opened them and wrote down in his diary:
There is nothing except darkness, a few thoughts floating, a few
sensations, and nothing else...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be so impatient. Wait. Let things settle inside, it takes time.
You have been unsettling them for so many lives, settling will take a
little time, a little patience – and nothing else is needed. You need
not try to settle them because that will disturb them again, you will
stir them up more; you simply don’t do anything. because that will
disturb them again, That is the meaning of Lao Tzu’s beautiful phrase WU
– WEI, do by not doing. You simply don’t do anything and it happens;
that is doing by not doing. Just close your eyes and wait and wait and
wait and you see layers of disturbance falling, settling, things falling
into their places, and silence; and by and by darkness becomes light,
and that One is known by knowing which all is known. Because that One is
the seed. That art thou, Swetaketu.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE THE SAGE KNOWS WITHOUT RUNNING ABOUT, UNDERSTANDS WITHOUT
SEEING, ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the greatest accomplishment, that which is accomplished
without doing anything at all. Remember, whatsoever YOU can do cannot go
beyond you, how can it go? If you do it, it will remain lower than you,
it cannot go higher than you. Whatsoever you do will be part of your
mind, it cannot be transcendental. Whatsoever you do will be done by the
ego, it cannot be your being. So non-doing is the only way to do it.</p><p>Sitting still, sitting quietly, not doing anything, and the grass
grows by itself. And then the effort, the doing, is still. Such a
tremendous and vast silence descends on you... was reading a Japanese
poem just a few days before; line of it penetrated me very deeply, came
part of my heart. says:</p><p><br></p><p>WITH NO BIRD SINGING HE MOUNTAIN IS YET MORE STILL.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is no doing, even the birds are no more singing, nothing
is there, everything is calm and quiet, suddenly you become aware nat
nothing has been lacking from the very beginning; :hat which you are
seeking – you have always been that. Suddenly you realize :hat the
Master of Masters is sitting there on the throne. And you start
laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Bokuju became enlightened – enlightened? Don’t take the word very
seriously, is nothing serious, it is the ultimate in fun, it is the last
joke – Bokuju became enlightened and he started laughing, a belly laugh,
he became crazy. People gathered, and they started asking, What is the
matter? Please tell us, what has happened? He said, Nothing has
happened, and I was mad, searching and seeking for that which is already
there in me.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever people used to ask Bokuju: What did you do when you became
enlightened? he said: I laughed, and I laughed loudly. And he said: I
have still not stopped laughing. Whether you hear it or not, that is not
the point, I have still not stopped laughing. What a joke! You have it
already and you have been searching and seeking and you could not find
it, not because it was not there but because it was so much there and so
close to you that you could not see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Eyes can see that which is far away, eyes can see that which is
distant because eyes need a perspective, hands can touch that which is
different and distant, ears can hear that which is outside – that’s why
Lao Tzu says he understands without seeing, because how can you see
yourself? Who will see whom? The seer and the seen are one there, no
eyes are needed. Who will do? Who will make the effort? It will be just
like a dog chasing its own tail, it will be simply foolish.…</p><p><br></p><p>And this is what you are doing, chasing your own tail. Stop and see
it is your own tail, there is no need to chase it, and by chasing you
are not going to get it ever. By chasing you miss, by non chasing you
accomplish.</p><p><br></p><p>... ACCOMPLISHES WITHOUT DOING.</p><p><br></p><p>And then time disappears. Then knowing disappears, because knowing is
there to know something, knowing is a faculty to KNOW; once you have
known, there is no point in the faculty remaining, it simply
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Time disappears because time is there because you are frustrated, it
is created out of your frustration so that you can hope for the future
and somehow bear the frustration and tolerate it, and console
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind and time are not two things but aspects of one thing. When both
disappear for the first time YOU ARE in your absolute glory. Say it this
way – you have become a god, a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>And ask the awakened ones: they all say the same thing, that it has
to be accomplished without any effort on your part. It is the effort
that has created the whole mess.</p><p>Dropping all effort, just sitting silently looking within –
WU-WEI.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

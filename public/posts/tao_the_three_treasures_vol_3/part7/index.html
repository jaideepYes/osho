ATTEND TO NO-AFFAIRS. TASTE THE FLAVOURLESS. WHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE. DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY; DEAL WITH THE BIG WHILE YET IT IS SMALL. THE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY ARE YET EASY; THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY ARE YET SMALL; THEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH GREAT PROBLEMS ACCOMPLISHES GREATNESS.\nHE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS FAITH. HE WHO MAKES LIGHT OF MANY THINGS WILL ENCOUNTER MANY DIFFICULTIES. HENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT, AND FOR THAT REASON NEVER MEETS WITH DIFFICULTIES.\nLIFE is not a problem. Rather, it is a mystery to be lived not a problem to be solved. But it becomes a problem; and it becomes a problem because you go on postponing things, postponing them for tomorrow. That which can be done today, that which should be done today, cannot be done tomorrow. That which would have been a beautiful phenomenon today, a mystery to be lived, tomorrow will become a very very hard and cold problem to be solved.\nLife in itself, if lived here and now, is not a problem. Postponement creates problems, and then you go on piling up. Then so much gathers around you that it becomes almost impossible to live – you\nare paralyzed, crippled, in a straitjacket, imprisoned. First try to understand this, then it will be easy to enter into the sutra.\nI was saying, just a few days before, that even a genius, a very talented person – he may be a Nobel Prize winner, a great intellectual, world-known – still may behave in a childish way.\nIf he finds in the morning when he wakes that his slippers are not in the right place, he is angry, irritated.\nIf he could pay attention to his anger that very moment he would laugh, because this is so foolish! ridiculous! But he does not pay attention to it.\nHe goes to the bathroom, irritated, in a bad mood, starts shaving his beard, but he is almost unconscious that a problem has not been dealt with, that a problem is there, poking its nose again and again into his being. And it is growing all the time, because in life nothing is non growing. Everything alive is growing, and when you are alive your anger is alive, it grows! It never remains the same. Moment to moment it is gathering more momentum and force.\nHe goes on shaving but irritated, he is not enjoying the act, the freshness of it, the beautiful moment when one feels unburdened, no, he is not in an enjoying mood. Unconscious, he lets the razor slip from his hand, fall to the floor. Now he is even more angry. If he can deal with it right now he will laugh. It is foolish to be angry because a razor is not a being; a razor is never responsible for anything; how can you be angry at a razor? But now he is more irritated. His hands are moving now more foolishly, unconsciously; it again slips, strikes the old ancient antique mirror which he loves so much; the mirror is broken.\nNow he is sane no more. He comes out, bumps against the furniture, slams the door, slaps the child because he has not done his homework, starts arguing, becomes quarrelsome with his wife – and only for a small thing which was nothing! Because the slippers were not found in the right place.\nNow our so-called genius takes his car and goes to the office, but never reaches it because there is an accident. It was always going to be so. And just because of the slippers, because they were not found in the right place.\nNow he drives like a maniac, his whole anger moves to his feet, he goes on pressing the accelerator; he is a drunkard! Drunk with his anger. There is an accident. After twelve hours or fifteen hours, when he opens his eyes, he is in hospital. And he will never be able to connect the whole thing.\nAnd the story can go on and on – he falls in love with the nurse – and you can go on! Just because the slippers were not found in the right place! The whole family disturbed; divorce; and the whole world will not be the same again – just because his slippers were not found in the right place.\nDeal with things moment to moment, don’t let them pile up within you. Don’t accumulate. Life is really beautiful. It becomes ugly. It is not a problem. Every problem is SO SMALL that it is foolish to call life a problem. It is not a problem for the trees, it is not a problem for the birds, it is not a problem for the earth, for the sky, it is only a problem for man, because only man has learned a trick – the trick of postponement. Then small things become bigger. Then a moment comes when you cannot\ncope with them. Then YOU become so small and the problem is so big, it is almost impossible to cope with it, then you always carry its burden on your head. And with that much burden, how can you enjoy? how can you delight? how can you celebrate? how can you dance?\nAnd then somebody says, There is a God. You hear the words but you cannot believe. Maybe there is a devil who is running the whole world, but not a God. Your whole life has become so crippled, so paralyzed, so burdensome, you would like to commit suicide. It is rare to find a man who has not contemplated some time or other committing suicide.\nPsychoanalysts say that each man, each woman, in the long run of life thinks almost ten times of committing suicide. You don’t commit it because you are cowards; there is nothing in it to take credit for, that you don’t commit it. You contemplate it – that’s enough! That means life has become so unlivable that rather than being dragged more and more into it, you would like to drop it; you would like to become a drop out.\nHow can you love God? How can you pray? Because prayer comes out of great gratitude; prayer comes out of gratefulness. A life lived well becomes a life of prayer. It has nothing to do with churches and temples and mosques, it has something to do with the quality of your life. A life lived well, moment to moment, aware, alert, not postponed, becomes a prayerful life; and prayer by and by turns into meditation. Then you don’t even pray, because the words disturb. Then your prayer becomes silent. When prayer is silent it is meditation.\nSo to understand that existence is beautiful, sacred, that existence is a benediction, a blessing, you will have to live a different type of life, a life which is not one of postponement. This is the meaning of living moment to moment.\nUnburden yourself from the past. It is there no more, it has already flown away, it exists not; you are unnecessarily burdened by ghosts – they are no more. And don’t burden yourself with the future – it is not yet. When it comes, YOU will be there to meet it. Why plan about it right now? Because the way you are going to plan it, it is never going to happen. Your planning is bound to create a greater problem, because when you plan beforehand you want to impose your plan on existence.\nExistence is not to follow you, you can follow existence and feel grateful. But existence cannot follow you, you don’t know the whole. You don’t know the desire of the whole, the destiny of the whole. And you make private plans; they are bound to be against the whole, and they are bound to be broken. Then your heart is broken.\nDrop the past. And don’t bring the future in. THIS MOMENT IS ALL. If you live this moment alert, then things, small things, will be dealt with, and, those small things dealt with, you will grow, and there will be no great problems.\nLao Tzu says that for a great man there are no great problems. Ordinarily you must be thinking the other way round, that great men exist because they tackle great problems. And Lao Tzu says there are no great problems for a great man because he never allows the problems to become great; he always deals with them when they are small, within his hands; then something can be done. And when you deal with problems moment to moment you are always fresh, unburdened; dust never collects on your being. Next moment you slip, fresh, young and virgin you slip into the next moment\nas a snake slips out of its old skin; the old left behind – the fresh and younger skin comes. Then life is a mystery, it is not a problem to be solved. It has to be lived and lived totally. Then you feel grateful. Then it has been a blessing.\nRemember this, and then try to understand Lao Tzu’s sutras.\nACCOMPLISH DO-NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO AFFAIRS. TASTE THE FLAVOURLESS.\nIn action, do nothing – this is the very deepest secret of Lao Tzu. He says when things can be done by non-doing, why do you bother to do? When things can be done by non-doing, if you do, if you try to do, you will create only troubles for yourself.\nLet me give you a few examples. You must have heard the name of Archimedes; his story is famous. He was trying to solve a scientific problem. He tried hard, tried his best, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t do anything else. The king had given him a problem to be solved and it had to be solved immediately. And he was the first man to tackle that problem, so there was no precedent, no history, nothing in the past which could be of any help. The problem had never before been raised, that was the first time.\nHe worked hard, became tense, as tense as one can be. Then what can you do? If you cannot solve you cannot solve! One feels helpless, he felt the helplessness.\nOne day, while he was taking his bath, lying in the bathtub, relaxed – he had dropped the idea of solving the problem, it could not be solved – suddenly, it was solved! And he became so ecstatic that he forgot that he was naked in the bath, he ran into the streets crying loud, Eureka! Eureka! which means ‘I have found it! I have found it!’\nThe king thought that he had gone mad, the whole town thought that he had gone mad. He had not gone mad, he had found the solution. And’ when the king asked, How? He said: By non-doing. I was not doing anything, I was not even trying to solve it, in fact I had dropped it. I had stopped completely all activity about it, I was relaxing.\nWhat happened then? When you relax you become one with the whole. When you relax you are no more the ego. When you relax you are no more the individual. When you relax you become the whole. When you are tense you become individual. The more you are tense, the more you are a concentrated ego.\nEgo is very small, how can it solve anything? it can fuss around, but it cannot solve anything. When the ego is not there, you are relaxing in a tub bath – suddenly the problem is solved! It happened to Buddha.\nFor six years he was doing – and doing really too much; nobody has been in search of the innermost meaning of life as deeply as Gautam Buddha. For six years he did whatsoever could be done, whatsoever is humanly possible. He went to teachers, all the known teachers of those days, and the teachers became helpless because whatsoever they said, Buddha did – and did so perfectly that they couldn’t say: You are not doing enough, that’s why you are not achieving. He was doing so well, better than his own Masters, that they said: Now, forgive us, you go somewhere else. It is not\nhappening, and we cannot help you in any way any more. You find some other teacher. Then he became fed up with all teachers, fed up with all systems, philosophies, fed up with all techniques, methods; he started doing things on his own – but then too nothing happened.\nSix years passed, six years of a nightmarish existence; he lived in deepest anguish. Then one day while passing the River Niranjana near Bodh-Gaya, he had become so weak, because of a long fast – somebody had suggested that he go on a long fast, that would help – he had become so weak he couldn’t cross the river.\nThe River Niranjana is not a very big river, but he was really weak. He remained clinging to the roots of a tree, otherwise the current would have taken him. There, clinging to the roots of a tree, he started thinking, What have I been doing? I have simply destroyed myself, I have reached nowhere. The world is finished, THAT I have left behind; now this moksha, salvation, God, truth, whatsoever you call it, that too is finished, I don’t care. I drop that too. That moment he became unburdened.\nWhen you search and seek there is a tension. That very tension becomes the barrier. When there was no search, no seeking, everything relaxed – the same happened to Buddha in the River Niranjana as had happened to Archimedes in his tub bath. He was relaxed, and when he was relaxed he felt an upsurge of energy.\nNow this energy is not his, this energy is of the whole. He is no more there. You exist because of your seeking, greed, desire. When there is no greed, no desire, nothing to be attained, this moment is enough, an end unto itself – then you are not. The ego disappears.\nThen Buddha got out, relaxed under the Bodhi tree. For years he had not relaxed. That night he slept perfectly. For the first time really he slept without dreams – because dreams are part of desires. In the day you dream, inside in your thinking; in daydreaming desires continue – a thousand and one desires, unfulfilled.\nDreams create some consolation for the mind: that which has not been fulfilled in the life is fulfilled in the dream. Dreams are consolations. But when you are not desiring, dreams disappear. And when dreams disappear, for the first time you sleep. For the first time you are so relaxed you disappear into the whole.\nHe slept well; for the first time he really slept. Early in the morning, when the last star was going to disappear he opened his eyes; fresh, as fresh as a newly born child, with no attitude, no mind to look through, no desire – what Buddha calls TRISHNA – no TRISHNA, no desire.\nThat moment was eternity, because when you desire you ate always moving into the future. That moment was eternity, no movement in the future, that moment was all. At that time Buddha became like a flower. A flower flowers here and now. A bird sings here and now. A man thinks always somewhere else, goes moving in the mind somewhere else. A man is never where he is. You can find him anywhere else, but you cannot find him where he is. Never!\nBuddha that time was really in THAT moment – under the Bodhi tree. Physically he was there, mentally he was there, spiritually he was there, that’s why that tree became the tree of enlightenment.\nNot a single thought, not a ripple in the lake of his consciousness, everything silent, no desire disturbing, no turmoil. He looked at the last disappearing star and he became enlightened. And when people used to ask later on, How did you attain? he said, When I stopped searching, seeking. When I stopped being active – then, in deep inaction it happened. k always happens so.\nSometimes you also may have observed – not Buddha-like, not like Archimedes – but sometimes you try to remember a name, it is just on the tip of the tongue, you say, It is just on the tip of my tongue, and it is not coming; and you feel suffocated and very tense, but what can you do? If it is not coming it is not coming! The more you try, the more it seems impossible. Then you drop it! Then you take a cigarette and you smoke, or you go outside in the garden for a small walk; you just engage yourself somewhere else; you put on the rad;o, or you sip tea, or do something else and forget about it – and suddenly it POPS up, it is there.\nA very small enlightenment, but it is of the same quality. A very very small satori, very tiny, nothing much to brag about – but of the same nature.\nIf you can understand the process you have understood what Lao Tzu means by inaction. There are things you cannot attain by action.\nThis is the criterion: If there is something which you can attain by action, that belongs to THIS world; anything that can be attained by action belongs to the world of matter, and anything that belongs to the world of spirit cannot be attained by action. That can be attained only through inaction, relaxation, total let go.\nACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING – accomplish total let go; – accomplish relaxation. Relax in your search for truth. When you come to seek truth you come with the worldly mind. There ambition is needed, effort is needed, because the competition is very hard, you are not alone there: millions of people struggling, fighting with each other, a constant war goes on.\nThe world is a constant war, and everybody is fighting with everybody else; the son fighting with the father – he may not be aware, the father fighting with the son – he may not be aware, the mother fighting with the child, the child fighting with the mother, brothers fighting brothers, nations fighting nations, families fighting other families, everybody is in a deep conflict and fight.\nThere, if you relax, you cannot become a prime minister. There, if you relax, you cannot become a president of a country. There, if you relax, you cannot become a Rockefeller or a Ford. No, that’s not possible. If there you relax you will be a beggar like Buddha or Lao Tzu. There, fight is needed, the world belongs to violence, and the world belongs to the egos, and the world belongs to those who are more aggressive than others.\nYou come from the world trained completely for violence, action; do something! People come to me and they say: Tell us to do and we can do, but you say – just relax, don’t do. That is impossible. Even for a single moment not to do anything seems impossible. Because of old habit, an old deep rooted pattern, always it is: Do something! Lao Tzu says, Do nothing.\nIn the world of being doing is not needed. That is the meaning of being – where doing is not needed. There you flower in your profoundest depth; there you flower in your greatest height.\nBut no effort is needed. Says a Zen Master: Sitting quietly, doing nothing, the grass grows by itself. He is talking about the innermost core of your being where doing nothing, sitting quietly, is the only way to do something. The grass grows by itself. There is no need to pull the grass, there is no need to pull the plants up, they grow by themselves. You simply wait by the side. While you are waiting the grass is growing.\nOnce you understand that no effort is needed for the innermost being, suddenly, a new dimension has opened for you.\nThere is no strain. A religious man is without strain. In fact a religious man is not trying to achieve anything. If you see that a religious man is trying to achieve something he is not religious, he is as worldly as others. He has only changed the name of his god, that’s all. Before he used to call it money, now he calls it meditation. Before he used to call it material, now he calls it something else – God. But, the achieving mind is there, and an achieving mind is the hindrance, the only barrier.\nACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING.\nEnjoy not doing anything. Simple – but it looks difficult. It looks difficult because of you, otherwise it is simple. Find time to do nothing. Whenever you can find some time just close your eyes and do nothing. Soon you will have the taste of the flavourless. Soon you will enter into a different kind of existence where Jesus lives, Krishna lives, Lao Tzu lives.\nACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO-AFFAIRS.\nConstantly attending to affairs creates anxiety. Sometimes, attend to no affairs; not doing anything.\nIn my childhood my grandfather was worried very much about me. He was a very loving man, and very clever, old and wise. Whenever he would see me sitting – because that’s how my whole childhood was: doing nothing, just sitting silently – he would say: Get up! Do something! Otherwise you will not accomplish anything in life; you will be a failure.\nAnd he was right! Perfectly right. Out of deep compassion he was saying that. He would say: At least go and play! Don’t sit like that, you create anxiety for me.\nSo I would move from that room to another, and sit there. Because once you taste the flavourless then there is nothing to compare with it, it is incomparable.\nOnce you know that attending to no-affairs is the greatest affair in the world, then all things seem to be so small, so juvenile, childish; foolish!\nBut in the West particularly, there has never been a teacher who has said: Do nothing.\nJesus tried, but they killed him – and Jesus also tried very guardedly, because he would not have been understood at all. If he had talked like Lao Tzu nobody would have understood him.\nJews are great doers. They accomplish many things. It is difficult to defeat Jews, in anything; never compete with a Jew, he will defeat you. They are great doers. The whole world has been against\nthem. Many Hitlers come and go. They try to destroy the Jews but – nothing; they are standing again stronger than before. Jews are the most worldly race in the world. They believe in doing. They would not have understood Jesus, but still he was talking something like Lao Tzu in a guarded way, in a masked language – but no other teacher has even tried. On the contrary the proverb goes: When you do nothing you become a workshop for the devil. And Lao Tzu says when you do nothing then only you become the workshop for God, not for the devil.\nThe devil takes possession of you when you want to do something, then you are in the hands of the devil, then he can possess you, he can tempt you, he can force you, he can make you run towards things, towards achievements. But a man who does not want to do anything, who pays attention to no affairs – the devil simply cannot come near him, it is impossible, because the devil is the doer.\nI would like to tell you again, from a different standpoint, the story of why Adam was expelled from the Garden of Eden, from paradise.\nAdam lived a life like animals, trees and birds, doing nothing. It was sheer delight, just enjoying – as children do; doing nothing, they enjoy, just playing. And God had said: Don’t go and eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge – because the moment you eat the fruit of knowledge, immediately you become a doer, because knowledge is useless unless it functions as a means to do something. Knowledge means know how. Knowledge is a technical help to do things more skilfully. Knowledge makes you more efficient doers.\nBut the serpent, the devil, seduced them.\nFirst he seduced Eve. That too is meaningful, because wherever you go, you will always find Eves pushing their husbands towards doing something: Go and do something! We have to build a bigger house, and purchase a bigger car! And more diamonds are needed. Go and do something, don’t sit in the house! Women go on pushing their husbands.\nThe parable is meaningful. If man is allowed to, he will relax, he will become a bum. He will just relax. He will just play on the flute under a tree, have a flask of wine with him, and that will do! He will not bother about the world.\nThe parable says: The serpent first convinced Eve, This tree, the tree of knowledge, has been prohibited because God does not want you to become like God. If you eat the fruit of knowledge you will become like gods!\nAll advertisers appeal to women, not to men. The serpent was the first advertising agency. He was the pioneer. He approached the right source. If you want to catch the husband, catch the wife. If once a new car enters in her mind then it will be difficult – she is going to put the new car in the husband’s mind.\nAnd once Eve tasted the fruit of knowledge she seduced poor Adam also. They were expelled. They were thrown out of paradise.\nThe meaning is that after that they became such cunning knowing doers, they lost the innocence of being that they used to delight in – there was NO TIME before.\nThe parable says that God, when he was expelling them, said to them, Now there will be death for you. There was no time before, so death could not exist. Not that Adam was not going to die, but death could not exist. Birds die, but they don’t know anything about death; they simply live and they simply die. Not for a single moment are they worried about death. Animals live and die, but death is not a problem to them, they don’t sit and brood about what death is and whether one survives after death or not; death is not a problem. When time enters, death enters. Knowledge enters, time comes in, then death comes in – and the whole mess of problems.…\nMan has to become innocent again. He has to drop knowledge. But you can drop knowledge only when you come to know that all that is beautiful, true and good can happen without doing, otherwise you will not be able to drop knowledge.\nLao Tzu is trying to make you understanding. He is trying to give you a vision that knowledge has to be dropped. But then you will immediately ask, If knowledge is dropped, how will we be able then to do so many things? He says: Those ‘so many things’ are not needed. The innermost being can flower in non doing.\nACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO AFFAIRS. TASTE THE FLAVOURLESS.\nLao Tzu never uses the name GOD. He consistently remains with indications, he never uses any direct expressions: the flavourless. God has no flavour, because flavour can exist only in duality. If something is sweet, then something has to be bitter. If something is good, then something else has to be bad. If something is divine, then something else has to be evil. Flavourless means the non dual, what Hindus call ADWAIT: not two. Flavourless is a poetic expression, it just gives a hint, not a direct instruction.\nWHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE.\nThis is a very revolutionary concept. It has to be understood very very delicately.\nYou have heard the famous dictum of Jesus: Love your enemies. Lao Tzu goes deeper than that. He says: Requite hatred with virtue, not with love. It would have been easier to say: Respond with love, when somebody hates you. Love the enemy. But why is he not saying love?\nThere are very profound reasons. First: when Jesus says ‘love your enemy’ he is accepting the duality of love and hate, he accepts the dual phenomenon. And deep down you already love your enemy otherwise how can you hate? Unless you have loved the enemy you cannot hate him. You love the enemy already in your deep unconscious, that’s why you hate. Love and hate exist together. When you love a person, you forget that you hate him also. If you become aware, you will become aware of the fact that if you love a person, then you hate him also, and if you hate a person then you love him also. Enemies and friends are not very different. You love the friend consciously, you hate him unconsciously; you hate the enemy consciously, you love him unconsciously – because they cannot exist separately; they are two aspects of the same coin: love/hate.\nSometimes you become worried that you want to kill; sometimes you start thinking of killing your wife, or your husband; or of murdering your mother or your father, and you feel much guilt, because – why? Don’t feel guilty. It is natural. In each love, hate is hidden. And think about your enemy, go\ndeeper into your hatred. You will find that you love him. Maybe it is a negative way of loving; hate is a negative way of loving.\nIt happened, Mahatma Gandhi and Mohammed Jinna, two great politicians of India, were long- standing enemies – and of course when you are enemies for so long you become very much attached to each other. When Gandhi was murdered and Jinna heard the news, the man who brought the news to Jinna was thinking that he would be happy, but he became sad – because without Gandhi where would Jinna be? The enemy is dead – you are almost dead.\nYou don’t miss your friends only, you miss your enemies also. They have become part of your being.\nWhen Jesus says: Love your enemies, he is not saying a very very revolutionary thing, it just appears revolutionary – you already love them in fact; the love is hidden and he wants to bring it up, that’s all.\nLao Tzu says:... REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE.\nWhat is virtue? Virtue is balance. Virtue is compassion not love. The distinction is subtle, but great. When you love a person the emotion is hot. When you hate a person then too the emotion is hot. One thing is the same, that you are in a HOT relationship.\nIf you are indifferent to a person you are cold, no heat in you either way. You are simply unrelated; you don’t love, you don’t hate; you don’t bother, you don’t care. You are indifferent, you go on your own way. That’s why nothing hurts people more than indifference.\nIf you hate a person it is not so much of a problem to him. He knows you are paying him attention – maybe negative, but you are paying attention. But if you are indifferent it hurts deeply. If people simply do not bother about you, you pass, and they don’t pay any attention this way or that, then you feel that you are almost dead!\nIndifference kills, not hate. Hate brings energy. Love brings energy. Love is a pleasant feeling, hate is unpleasant, but if you have to choose between hate and indifference, you will certainly choose hate. You will never choose indifference. Indifference is absolutely cold, killing.\nCompassion is not cold, compassion is cool. Cold means dead, cool means balanced.\nLet me tell you in another way. Compassion is cool, indifference is cold; if you compare compassion with love and hate, it is cool; if you compare compassion with indifference, it is warm. It is warm in comparison to indifference and its coldness. It is cool in comparison to love and hate and their heat.\nVirtue is compassion. It is not love, it is not hate, it is a balance between the two. It is not indifference either. It is life-giving. But if you don’t know, compassion will look like indifference.\nThe distinction is very subtle. Coolness will look like coldness, but coolness is alive, fresh. Coldness is simply dead. Virtue is compassion.\nREQUITE HATRED WITH COMPASSION.\nDEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY;\nEverything difficult has a phase when it is easy, if you are alert you will know it. It is very easy to destroy a seed, it is very difficult to destroy a big tree.\nAnd everything has a seed form. When anger arises it is just like a seed. If you want to drop it at that moment there is no problem, but if you allow it to take root within you, to spread within your being, to overwhelm you, then, destroying anger will be very very difficult; it will look like destroying yourself, it will have become such a deep part of you.\nWHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE. DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY; DEAL WITH THE BIG WHILE YET IT IS SMALL.\nAnd everything is small and easy in the present. If you don’t postpone everything is easy and small. You are powerful enough to change it, to transform it. But if you say: I will see to it tomorrow; if you say: There is no hurry; if you take it easy and you say: Some day when I have enough time I will see to the problem; then the problem will meanwhile grow and take root.\nDon’t postpone it, because then you will not be able to do much about it. That’s what you have been doing up to now. You have been postponing FOR LIVES. And then you come to me and you say: We would like to be silent. We would like to be peaceful – and for many lives you have been postponing problems which are boiling within you. They have to be tackled. A great surgery is needed.\nBut you are in such a hurry again. A few days people meditate, four or five days, and then they come to me and they say: Nothing is happening yet. Can’t you see the ridiculousness of it? What are you asking?\nFor many lives you postpone. Then your being becomes like a ruin. Your garden is there no more. Everything is destroyed, only weeds subsist. And suddenly one day you want to have a beautiful lawn. It will take time. The weeds have to be thrown out. Their roots and seeds have to be thrown out. The soil has to be changed. It is not easy now.\nBut you can do at least one thing: you can start living moment to moment, so at least you are not gathering more nonsense around you, more rubbish around you; at least you can clean one part of the garden and start working moment to moment. And once you know how problems have become difficult, and once you come to understand that they ARE easy if you tackle them in the beginning, everything will become easy again. But that feeling, that nuance, that knack, has to be learnt.\nTHE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY ARE YET EASY; THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY ARE YET SMALL. THEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH GREAT PROBLEMS ACCOMPLISHES GREATNESS.\nThese things look like paradoxes – they are not. They are simple statements with no contradiction in them.\nTHEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH GREAT PROBLEMS...\nbecause he has no great problems. He never deals with great problems that’s why he is great.\nIn your understanding just the opposite is the case. You think some man is so great because he has dealt with such great problems. Such great challenges! And he has conquered them. This is foolish! A great man has nothing to conquer. The greater he is, the less there is to conquer, if he is really great there is nothing to conquer. The greatest man has no problems to solve, neither great nor small. Because he never allows them to accumulate. They become problems only when postponed. Right now – lived, they are not problems, they are part of life, and beautiful!\nJust start being alert. Whenever you see some problem is arising, drop all activity. Look to it, pay attention to it; just look within, at what it is. Sometimes just a smile will be enough to change it, just laughter will do, and you will be out of the vicious circle. Sometimes nothing will be needed, not even a smile and a laugh, just the very attention, that you looked into it, and it will disappear, as dewdrops disappear in the morning when the sun rises.\nJust look. Bring the sun of consciousness to it, it will disappear – it is so small and you are so big and so vast! Just the very encounter, that you look at it – and it changes its quality. It is a problem no more. You can delight in it, you can enjoy it. Then life becomes a drama.\nHE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS FAITH.\nIf you understand life you will never make promises, because a promise is a postponement. You must either do it now or you must say, I don’t know, I will see tomorrow.\nIn MAHABHARATA there is a beautiful anecdote. Pandavas, the five brothers, are hiding in the forest. One day a beggar comes. Udhishthir is sitting outside the hut and the beggar asks for nothing much, just some bread, a few chapattis.\nUdhishthir is brooding – and as it happens always whenever there is a beggar, you would like to postpone. You say, Come tomorrow, just to avoid. He may not come again tomorrow. You don’t want to be so rude as to say, I will not give anything; also, you want to protect your image that you are a great giver. So you say, Come tomorrow. Don’t disturb me now. Udhishthir did the same; he said, Come tomorrow.\nBhima, another brother – who is not known much for his wisdom or intelligence, but sometimes it happens that people who are not very intelligent flare up – he suddenly started laughing and he ran out of the house with laughter, towards the town. Udhishthir asked: Where are you going? He said, I am going to tell the people in the town that my brother has conquered time! He has promised something to a beggar if he comes tomorrow!\nSuddenly Udhishthir became aware. Because how can you say, Come tomorrow? You may not be here tomorrow. The beggar may not be here tomorrow. Udhishthir ran off, caught hold of the beggar, gave him whatsoever he could give him, and dropped the habit of promising.\nBecause a promise is possible only if tomorrow is certain. But who knows anything about tomorrow?\nThere is a great old Chinese story. A king was very angry with his prime minister. He had done something or other, so the king ordered him to be sentenced to death. It was the tradition that if somebody was to be executed by the king’s order, the king had to visit him one day before, to ask\nif he had some desire to be fulfilled. The last desire of the condemned man had to be fulfilled. And this man was no ordinary man – he had served the king for many years as his prime minister; he had been an intimate. But something went wrong, he did something and the king was angry so the next morning he was to be executed, hanged. The king came to see him twenty four hours before.\nThe prime minister was a brave man. He had been to many wars as a general. When the king came the prime minister started weeping and crying – tears rolling down. The king said: I would never have imagined that you, a man of such bravery, would be weeping and crying because you are going to be hanged tomorrow. Are you afraid of death?\nThe prime minister said, That is not the point. Death I have never been afraid of, it is something else but – leave it aside, now there is no time to do it.\nThe king became curious. He said, What is the matter? You tell me. I am here to fulfil your last desire. I promise you to fulfil it, you tell me. You have served the kingdom long, and I would like to fulfil it whatsoever it is; you just tell me.\nThe prime minister said, If you insist, then I will tell you. This is a long story. When I was young I was with a great Master, and he was an enlightened being, and he had many secrets with him. One secret I learnt. And that secret was that there is a rare type of horse which can be taught to fly, and my whole life I have been searching for that type of horse that can be taught to fly, but I couldn’t find one – and look at the irony of fate; the horse that you have come on is the right horse, and tomorrow morning I will be dead! And the whole science will go dead with me. The secret will be lost to humanity – that’s why I am crying.\nThe king said, The horse can fly? How much time will you take to teach it? – because the king became interested. If this horse can fly in the sky this will be something superb, incomparable, that no other king in the world can claim. He said, You forget about your sentence; you tell me how much time you will take.\nThe man said, It will take one year. The king said, Okay. There is no harm in it. For one year you try. If the horse flies, then not only will you not be hanged, but you will get married to my daughter and you will share my kingdom: half-half. But if the horse cannot fly, then you will be executed. So there is no harm in it; you come out – take the horse.\nThe man took the horse, went home – there his wife and children were crying and weeping because this was the last day, the next morning the husband, the father, would be dead. They could not believe their eyes – that he was coming back riding on a horse. They thought they must be dreaming. They wiped their eyes and they asked: What is the matter? How could you manage to come?\nHe told them the whole story. The wife again started crying and said, You are a fool, because I know very well you don’t know anything like that. You invented a lie. If you were going to lie then why say one year? You should have asked for fifty years, twenty years at least! The one year will pass so soon, and this will be a nightmare, because the whole year we will be trembling, because soon again you have to die.\nThe man said, Don’t be afraid, one year is too long! The king can die, I can die, at least the horse can die – you don’t be worried! Don’t you be worried, one year is long enough.\nLAO TZU SAYS:\nHE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS FAITH. HE WHO MAKES LIGHT OF MANY THINGS WILL ENCOUNTER MANY DIFFICULTIES. HENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT, AND FOR THAT REASON NEVER MEETS WITH DIFFICULTIES.\nLao Tzu is saying: Don’t promise, otherwise you will lose faith – because time goes on changing things. Don’t say anything certain about the future, because future itself is not certain. At the most for this moment you can be certain, that’s all. And one who lives in this moment without promising, postponing, thinking, planning about the future, who lives such a simple life, such an innocent life, that his faith grows, his trust grows, his gratefulness grows – he becomes a vehicle for the ultimate grace to flow from him. He becomes a passage for the divine, for Tao.\nBut one who lightly gives promises, who lightly postpones things, who never thinks that things are difficult.…\nTry to understand this. Lao Tzu says: Everything is simple if you take it rightly in the beginning. But don’t think that it is simple, and don’t think that it is easy, because if you think that it is easy there will be a tendency to postpone – such an easy thing, why bother now? It can be done tomorrow. Things are easy, but you think they are very difficult; tackle them immediately otherwise they will become difficult.\nHENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT...\nknowing well that they are easy. But he regards them as difficult so that the inner tendency to postponement is curbed.\nSmall things, very ordinary things – they can be done very easily, but the sage regards them as difficult, AND FOR THAT REASON NEVER MEETS WITH DIFFICULTIES, because then he goes on solving everything. Things never accumulate, they are never too much. He moves from moment to moment, completely unburdened from the past, completely unburdened for the future. He moves like a mirror, empty.\n‘The empty mirror’ is the right word for the sage. You come before it, it mirrors you. When you move, the reflection has gone. The mirror is again empty, again ready to reflect something if it comes.\nThe mirror never says, I will reflect tomorrow. If the mirror could say, I will reflect tomorrow – there would be such a crowd, nothing would be reflected. That is the state of your mind.\nYou have been postponing. Now, stop postponing. Look into the problems. By the very look they are almost solved. And the small things that remain? – they can be tackled.\nEverybody is capable of solving his problems. Everybody HAS to be capable. When you are capable of creating problems who else is going to be capable of solving them? You create, you can solve. These sutras of Lao Tzu are very significant. Pay attention to them. Meditate over them. Let your being be soaked with them.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7876","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_3/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_3/>Tao.

WHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE.
DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY; DEAL WITH THE BIG WHILE
YET IT IS SMALL. THE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH
WHILE THEY ARE YET EASY; THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT
WITH WHILE THEY ARE YET SMALL; THEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH
GREAT PROBLEMS ACCOMPLISHES GREATNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS
FAITH. HE WHO MAKES LIGHT OF MANY THINGS WILL ENCOUNTER MANY
DIFFICULTIES. HENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT, AND FOR
THAT REASON NEVER MEETS WITH DIFFICULTIES.</p><p><br></p><p>LIFE is not a problem. Rather, it is a mystery to be lived not a
problem to be solved. But it becomes a problem; and it becomes a problem
because you go on postponing things, postponing them for tomorrow. That
which can be done today, that which should be done today, cannot be done
tomorrow. That which would have been a beautiful phenomenon today, a
mystery to be lived, tomorrow will become a very very hard and cold
problem to be solved.</p><p><br></p><p>Life in itself, if lived here and now, is not a problem. Postponement
creates problems, and then you go on piling up. Then so much gathers
around you that it becomes almost impossible to live – you</p><p>are paralyzed, crippled, in a straitjacket, imprisoned. First try to
understand this, then it will be easy to enter into the sutra.</p><p><br></p><p>I was saying, just a few days before, that even a genius, a very
talented person – he may be a Nobel Prize winner, a great intellectual,
world-known – still may behave in a childish way.</p><p><br></p><p>If he finds in the morning when he wakes that his slippers are not in
the right place, he is angry, irritated.</p><p><br></p><p>If he could pay attention to his anger that very moment he would
laugh, because this is so foolish! ridiculous! But he does not pay
attention to it.</p><p><br></p><p>He goes to the bathroom, irritated, in a bad mood, starts shaving his
beard, but he is almost unconscious that a problem has not been dealt
with, that a problem is there, poking its nose again and again into his
being. And it is growing all the time, because in life nothing is non
growing. Everything alive is growing, and when you are alive your anger
is alive, it grows! It never remains the same. Moment to moment it is
gathering more momentum and force.</p><p><br></p><p>He goes on shaving but irritated, he is not enjoying the act, the
freshness of it, the beautiful moment when one feels unburdened, no, he
is not in an enjoying mood. Unconscious, he lets the razor slip from his
hand, fall to the floor. Now he is even more angry. If he can deal with
it right now he will laugh. It is foolish to be angry because a razor is
not a being; a razor is never responsible for anything; how can you be
angry at a razor? But now he is more irritated. His hands are moving now
more foolishly, unconsciously; it again slips, strikes the old ancient
antique mirror which he loves so much; the mirror is broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he is sane no more. He comes out, bumps against the furniture,
slams the door, slaps the child because he has not done his homework,
starts arguing, becomes quarrelsome with his wife – and only for a small
thing which was nothing! Because the slippers were not found in the
right place.</p><p><br></p><p>Now our so-called genius takes his car and goes to the office, but
never reaches it because there is an accident. It was always going to be
so. And just because of the slippers, because they were not found in the
right place.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he drives like a maniac, his whole anger moves to his feet, he
goes on pressing the accelerator; he is a drunkard! Drunk with his
anger. There is an accident. After twelve hours or fifteen hours, when
he opens his eyes, he is in hospital. And he will never be able to
connect the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And the story can go on and on – he falls in love with the nurse –
and you can go on! Just because the slippers were not found in the right
place! The whole family disturbed; divorce; and the whole world will not
be the same again – just because his slippers were not found in the
right place.</p><p><br></p><p>Deal with things moment to moment, don’t let them pile up within you.
Don’t accumulate. Life is really beautiful. It becomes ugly. It is not a
problem. Every problem is SO SMALL that it is foolish to call life a
problem. It is not a problem for the trees, it is not a problem for the
birds, it is not a problem for the earth, for the sky, it is only a
problem for man, because only man has learned a trick – the trick of
postponement. Then small things become bigger. Then a moment comes when
you cannot</p><p>cope with them. Then YOU become so small and the problem is so big,
it is almost impossible to cope with it, then you always carry its
burden on your head. And with that much burden, how can you enjoy? how
can you delight? how can you celebrate? how can you dance?</p><p><br></p><p>And then somebody says, There is a God. You hear the words but you
cannot believe. Maybe there is a devil who is running the whole world,
but not a God. Your whole life has become so crippled, so paralyzed, so
burdensome, you would like to commit suicide. It is rare to find a man
who has not contemplated some time or other committing suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysts say that each man, each woman, in the long run of life
thinks almost ten times of committing suicide. You don’t commit it
because you are cowards; there is nothing in it to take credit for, that
you don’t commit it. You contemplate it – that’s enough! That means life
has become so unlivable that rather than being dragged more and more
into it, you would like to drop it; you would like to become a drop
out.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you love God? How can you pray? Because prayer comes out of
great gratitude; prayer comes out of gratefulness. A life lived well
becomes a life of prayer. It has nothing to do with churches and temples
and mosques, it has something to do with the quality of your life. A
life lived well, moment to moment, aware, alert, not postponed, becomes
a prayerful life; and prayer by and by turns into meditation. Then you
don’t even pray, because the words disturb. Then your prayer becomes
silent. When prayer is silent it is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>So to understand that existence is beautiful, sacred, that existence
is a benediction, a blessing, you will have to live a different type of
life, a life which is not one of postponement. This is the meaning of
living moment to moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Unburden yourself from the past. It is there no more, it has already
flown away, it exists not; you are unnecessarily burdened by ghosts –
they are no more. And don’t burden yourself with the future – it is not
yet. When it comes, YOU will be there to meet it. Why plan about it
right now? Because the way you are going to plan it, it is never going
to happen. Your planning is bound to create a greater problem, because
when you plan beforehand you want to impose your plan on existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is not to follow you, you can follow existence and feel
grateful. But existence cannot follow you, you don’t know the whole. You
don’t know the desire of the whole, the destiny of the whole. And you
make private plans; they are bound to be against the whole, and they are
bound to be broken. Then your heart is broken.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the past. And don’t bring the future in. THIS MOMENT IS ALL. If
you live this moment alert, then things, small things, will be dealt
with, and, those small things dealt with, you will grow, and there will
be no great problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says that for a great man there are no great problems.
Ordinarily you must be thinking the other way round, that great men
exist because they tackle great problems. And Lao Tzu says there are no
great problems for a great man because he never allows the problems to
become great; he always deals with them when they are small, within his
hands; then something can be done. And when you deal with problems
moment to moment you are always fresh, unburdened; dust never collects
on your being. Next moment you slip, fresh, young and virgin you slip
into the next moment</p><p>as a snake slips out of its old skin; the old left behind – the fresh
and younger skin comes. Then life is a mystery, it is not a problem to
be solved. It has to be lived and lived totally. Then you feel grateful.
Then it has been a blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this, and then try to understand Lao Tzu’s sutras.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCOMPLISH DO-NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO AFFAIRS. TASTE THE
FLAVOURLESS.</p><p><br></p><p>In action, do nothing – this is the very deepest secret of Lao Tzu.
He says when things can be done by non-doing, why do you bother to do?
When things can be done by non-doing, if you do, if you try to do, you
will create only troubles for yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me give you a few examples. You must have heard the name of
Archimedes; his story is famous. He was trying to solve a scientific
problem. He tried hard, tried his best, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t do
anything else. The king had given him a problem to be solved and it had
to be solved immediately. And he was the first man to tackle that
problem, so there was no precedent, no history, nothing in the past
which could be of any help. The problem had never before been raised,
that was the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>He worked hard, became tense, as tense as one can be. Then what can
you do? If you cannot solve you cannot solve! One feels helpless, he
felt the helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>One day, while he was taking his bath, lying in the bathtub, relaxed
– he had dropped the idea of solving the problem, it could not be solved
– suddenly, it was solved! And he became so ecstatic that he forgot that
he was naked in the bath, he ran into the streets crying loud, Eureka!
Eureka! which means ‘I have found it! I have found it!’</p><p><br></p><p>The king thought that he had gone mad, the whole town thought that he
had gone mad. He had not gone mad, he had found the solution. And’ when
the king asked, How? He said: By non-doing. I was not doing anything, I
was not even trying to solve it, in fact I had dropped it. I had stopped
completely all activity about it, I was relaxing.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened then? When you relax you become one with the whole.
When you relax you are no more the ego. When you relax you are no more
the individual. When you relax you become the whole. When you are tense
you become individual. The more you are tense, the more you are a
concentrated ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is very small, how can it solve anything? it can fuss around, but
it cannot solve anything. When the ego is not there, you are relaxing in
a tub bath – suddenly the problem is solved! It happened to Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>For six years he was doing – and doing really too much; nobody has
been in search of the innermost meaning of life as deeply as Gautam
Buddha. For six years he did whatsoever could be done, whatsoever is
humanly possible. He went to teachers, all the known teachers of those
days, and the teachers became helpless because whatsoever they said,
Buddha did – and did so perfectly that they couldn’t say: You are not
doing enough, that’s why you are not achieving. He was doing so well,
better than his own Masters, that they said: Now, forgive us, you go
somewhere else. It is not</p><p>happening, and we cannot help you in any way any more. You find some
other teacher. Then he became fed up with all teachers, fed up with all
systems, philosophies, fed up with all techniques, methods; he started
doing things on his own – but then too nothing happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Six years passed, six years of a nightmarish existence; he lived in
deepest anguish. Then one day while passing the River Niranjana near
Bodh-Gaya, he had become so weak, because of a long fast – somebody had
suggested that he go on a long fast, that would help – he had become so
weak he couldn’t cross the river.</p><p><br></p><p>The River Niranjana is not a very big river, but he was really weak.
He remained clinging to the roots of a tree, otherwise the current would
have taken him. There, clinging to the roots of a tree, he started
thinking, What have I been doing? I have simply destroyed myself, I have
reached nowhere. The world is finished, THAT I have left behind; now
this moksha, salvation, God, truth, whatsoever you call it, that too is
finished, I don’t care. I drop that too. That moment he became
unburdened.</p><p><br></p><p>When you search and seek there is a tension. That very tension
becomes the barrier. When there was no search, no seeking, everything
relaxed – the same happened to Buddha in the River Niranjana as had
happened to Archimedes in his tub bath. He was relaxed, and when he was
relaxed he felt an upsurge of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this energy is not his, this energy is of the whole. He is no
more there. You exist because of your seeking, greed, desire. When there
is no greed, no desire, nothing to be attained, this moment is enough,
an end unto itself – then you are not. The ego disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Buddha got out, relaxed under the Bodhi tree. For years he had
not relaxed. That night he slept perfectly. For the first time really he
slept without dreams – because dreams are part of desires. In the day
you dream, inside in your thinking; in daydreaming desires continue – a
thousand and one desires, unfulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams create some consolation for the mind: that which has not been
fulfilled in the life is fulfilled in the dream. Dreams are
consolations. But when you are not desiring, dreams disappear. And when
dreams disappear, for the first time you sleep. For the first time you
are so relaxed you disappear into the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>He slept well; for the first time he really slept. Early in the
morning, when the last star was going to disappear he opened his eyes;
fresh, as fresh as a newly born child, with no attitude, no mind to look
through, no desire – what Buddha calls TRISHNA – no TRISHNA, no
desire.</p><p><br></p><p>That moment was eternity, because when you desire you ate always
moving into the future. That moment was eternity, no movement in the
future, that moment was all. At that time Buddha became like a flower. A
flower flowers here and now. A bird sings here and now. A man thinks
always somewhere else, goes moving in the mind somewhere else. A man is
never where he is. You can find him anywhere else, but you cannot find
him where he is. Never!</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha that time was really in THAT moment – under the Bodhi tree.
Physically he was there, mentally he was there, spiritually he was
there, that’s why that tree became the tree of enlightenment.</p><p>Not a single thought, not a ripple in the lake of his consciousness,
everything silent, no desire disturbing, no turmoil. He looked at the
last disappearing star and he became enlightened. And when people used
to ask later on, How did you attain? he said, When I stopped searching,
seeking. When I stopped being active – then, in deep inaction it
happened. k always happens so.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you also may have observed – not Buddha-like, not like
Archimedes – but sometimes you try to remember a name, it is just on the
tip of the tongue, you say, It is just on the tip of my tongue, and it
is not coming; and you feel suffocated and very tense, but what can you
do? If it is not coming it is not coming! The more you try, the more it
seems impossible. Then you drop it! Then you take a cigarette and you
smoke, or you go outside in the garden for a small walk; you just engage
yourself somewhere else; you put on the rad;o, or you sip tea, or do
something else and forget about it – and suddenly it POPS up, it is
there.</p><p><br></p><p>A very small enlightenment, but it is of the same quality. A very
very small satori, very tiny, nothing much to brag about – but of the
same nature.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can understand the process you have understood what Lao Tzu
means by inaction. There are things you cannot attain by action.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the criterion: If there is something which you can attain by
action, that belongs to THIS world; anything that can be attained by
action belongs to the world of matter, and anything that belongs to the
world of spirit cannot be attained by action. That can be attained only
through inaction, relaxation, total let go.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING – accomplish total let go; – accomplish
relaxation. Relax in your search for truth. When you come to seek truth
you come with the worldly mind. There ambition is needed, effort is
needed, because the competition is very hard, you are not alone there:
millions of people struggling, fighting with each other, a constant war
goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>The world is a constant war, and everybody is fighting with everybody
else; the son fighting with the father – he may not be aware, the father
fighting with the son – he may not be aware, the mother fighting with
the child, the child fighting with the mother, brothers fighting
brothers, nations fighting nations, families fighting other families,
everybody is in a deep conflict and fight.</p><p><br></p><p>There, if you relax, you cannot become a prime minister. There, if
you relax, you cannot become a president of a country. There, if you
relax, you cannot become a Rockefeller or a Ford. No, that’s not
possible. If there you relax you will be a beggar like Buddha or Lao
Tzu. There, fight is needed, the world belongs to violence, and the
world belongs to the egos, and the world belongs to those who are more
aggressive than others.</p><p><br></p><p>You come from the world trained completely for violence, action; do
something! People come to me and they say: Tell us to do and we can do,
but you say – just relax, don’t do. That is impossible. Even for a
single moment not to do anything seems impossible. Because of old habit,
an old deep rooted pattern, always it is: Do something! Lao Tzu says, Do
nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world of being doing is not needed. That is the meaning of
being – where doing is not needed. There you flower in your profoundest
depth; there you flower in your greatest height.</p><p>But no effort is needed. Says a Zen Master: Sitting quietly, doing
nothing, the grass grows by itself. He is talking about the innermost
core of your being where doing nothing, sitting quietly, is the only way
to do something. The grass grows by itself. There is no need to pull the
grass, there is no need to pull the plants up, they grow by themselves.
You simply wait by the side. While you are waiting the grass is
growing.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand that no effort is needed for the innermost being,
suddenly, a new dimension has opened for you.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no strain. A religious man is without strain. In fact a
religious man is not trying to achieve anything. If you see that a
religious man is trying to achieve something he is not religious, he is
as worldly as others. He has only changed the name of his god, that’s
all. Before he used to call it money, now he calls it meditation. Before
he used to call it material, now he calls it something else – God. But,
the achieving mind is there, and an achieving mind is the hindrance, the
only barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy not doing anything. Simple – but it looks difficult. It looks
difficult because of you, otherwise it is simple. Find time to do
nothing. Whenever you can find some time just close your eyes and do
nothing. Soon you will have the taste of the flavourless. Soon you will
enter into a different kind of existence where Jesus lives, Krishna
lives, Lao Tzu lives.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO-AFFAIRS.</p><p><br></p><p>Constantly attending to affairs creates anxiety. Sometimes, attend to
no affairs; not doing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood my grandfather was worried very much about me. He was
a very loving man, and very clever, old and wise. Whenever he would see
me sitting – because that’s how my whole childhood was: doing nothing,
just sitting silently – he would say: Get up! Do something! Otherwise
you will not accomplish anything in life; you will be a failure.</p><p><br></p><p>And he was right! Perfectly right. Out of deep compassion he was
saying that. He would say: At least go and play! Don’t sit like that,
you create anxiety for me.</p><p><br></p><p>So I would move from that room to another, and sit there. Because
once you taste the flavourless then there is nothing to compare with it,
it is incomparable.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know that attending to no-affairs is the greatest affair in
the world, then all things seem to be so small, so juvenile, childish;
foolish!</p><p><br></p><p>But in the West particularly, there has never been a teacher who has
said: Do nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus tried, but they killed him – and Jesus also tried very
guardedly, because he would not have been understood at all. If he had
talked like Lao Tzu nobody would have understood him.</p><p><br></p><p>Jews are great doers. They accomplish many things. It is difficult to
defeat Jews, in anything; never compete with a Jew, he will defeat you.
They are great doers. The whole world has been against</p><p>them. Many Hitlers come and go. They try to destroy the Jews but –
nothing; they are standing again stronger than before. Jews are the most
worldly race in the world. They believe in doing. They would not have
understood Jesus, but still he was talking something like Lao Tzu in a
guarded way, in a masked language – but no other teacher has even tried.
On the contrary the proverb goes: When you do nothing you become a
workshop for the devil. And Lao Tzu says when you do nothing then only
you become the workshop for God, not for the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The devil takes possession of you when you want to do something, then
you are in the hands of the devil, then he can possess you, he can tempt
you, he can force you, he can make you run towards things, towards
achievements. But a man who does not want to do anything, who pays
attention to no affairs – the devil simply cannot come near him, it is
impossible, because the devil is the doer.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you again, from a different standpoint, the
story of why Adam was expelled from the Garden of Eden, from
paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam lived a life like animals, trees and birds, doing nothing. It
was sheer delight, just enjoying – as children do; doing nothing, they
enjoy, just playing. And God had said: Don’t go and eat the fruit of the
tree of knowledge – because the moment you eat the fruit of knowledge,
immediately you become a doer, because knowledge is useless unless it
functions as a means to do something. Knowledge means know how.
Knowledge is a technical help to do things more skilfully. Knowledge
makes you more efficient doers.</p><p><br></p><p>But the serpent, the devil, seduced them.</p><p><br></p><p>First he seduced Eve. That too is meaningful, because wherever you
go, you will always find Eves pushing their husbands towards doing
something: Go and do something! We have to build a bigger house, and
purchase a bigger car! And more diamonds are needed. Go and do
something, don’t sit in the house! Women go on pushing their
husbands.</p><p><br></p><p>The parable is meaningful. If man is allowed to, he will relax, he
will become a bum. He will just relax. He will just play on the flute
under a tree, have a flask of wine with him, and that will do! He will
not bother about the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The parable says: The serpent first convinced Eve, This tree, the
tree of knowledge, has been prohibited because God does not want you to
become like God. If you eat the fruit of knowledge you will become like
gods!</p><p><br></p><p>All advertisers appeal to women, not to men. The serpent was the
first advertising agency. He was the pioneer. He approached the right
source. If you want to catch the husband, catch the wife. If once a new
car enters in her mind then it will be difficult – she is going to put
the new car in the husband’s mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And once Eve tasted the fruit of knowledge she seduced poor Adam
also. They were expelled. They were thrown out of paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning is that after that they became such cunning knowing
doers, they lost the innocence of being that they used to delight in –
there was NO TIME before.</p><p>The parable says that God, when he was expelling them, said to them,
Now there will be death for you. There was no time before, so death
could not exist. Not that Adam was not going to die, but death could not
exist. Birds die, but they don’t know anything about death; they simply
live and they simply die. Not for a single moment are they worried about
death. Animals live and die, but death is not a problem to them, they
don’t sit and brood about what death is and whether one survives after
death or not; death is not a problem. When time enters, death enters.
Knowledge enters, time comes in, then death comes in – and the whole
mess of problems.…</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to become innocent again. He has to drop knowledge. But you
can drop knowledge only when you come to know that all that is
beautiful, true and good can happen without doing, otherwise you will
not be able to drop knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu is trying to make you understanding. He is trying to give you
a vision that knowledge has to be dropped. But then you will immediately
ask, If knowledge is dropped, how will we be able then to do so many
things? He says: Those ‘so many things’ are not needed. The innermost
being can flower in non doing.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCOMPLISH DO NOTHING. ATTEND TO NO AFFAIRS. TASTE THE
FLAVOURLESS.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu never uses the name GOD. He consistently remains with
indications, he never uses any direct expressions: the flavourless. God
has no flavour, because flavour can exist only in duality. If something
is sweet, then something has to be bitter. If something is good, then
something else has to be bad. If something is divine, then something
else has to be evil. Flavourless means the non dual, what Hindus call
ADWAIT: not two. Flavourless is a poetic expression, it just gives a
hint, not a direct instruction.</p><p><br></p><p>WHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH
VIRTUE.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very revolutionary concept. It has to be understood very
very delicately.</p><p><br></p><p>You have heard the famous dictum of Jesus: Love your enemies. Lao Tzu
goes deeper than that. He says: Requite hatred with virtue, not with
love. It would have been easier to say: Respond with love, when somebody
hates you. Love the enemy. But why is he not saying love?</p><p><br></p><p>There are very profound reasons. First: when Jesus says ‘love your
enemy’ he is accepting the duality of love and hate, he accepts the dual
phenomenon. And deep down you already love your enemy otherwise how can
you hate? Unless you have loved the enemy you cannot hate him. You love
the enemy already in your deep unconscious, that’s why you hate. Love
and hate exist together. When you love a person, you forget that you
hate him also. If you become aware, you will become aware of the fact
that if you love a person, then you hate him also, and if you hate a
person then you love him also. Enemies and friends are not very
different. You love the friend consciously, you hate him unconsciously;
you hate the enemy consciously, you love him unconsciously – because
they cannot exist separately; they are two aspects of the same coin:
love/hate.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you become worried that you want to kill; sometimes you
start thinking of killing your wife, or your husband; or of murdering
your mother or your father, and you feel much guilt, because – why?
Don’t feel guilty. It is natural. In each love, hate is hidden. And
think about your enemy, go</p><p>deeper into your hatred. You will find that you love him. Maybe it is
a negative way of loving; hate is a negative way of loving.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, Mahatma Gandhi and Mohammed Jinna, two great politicians
of India, were long- standing enemies – and of course when you are
enemies for so long you become very much attached to each other. When
Gandhi was murdered and Jinna heard the news, the man who brought the
news to Jinna was thinking that he would be happy, but he became sad –
because without Gandhi where would Jinna be? The enemy is dead – you are
almost dead.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t miss your friends only, you miss your enemies also. They
have become part of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus says: Love your enemies, he is not saying a very very
revolutionary thing, it just appears revolutionary – you already love
them in fact; the love is hidden and he wants to bring it up, that’s
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says:... REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE.</p><p><br></p><p>What is virtue? Virtue is balance. Virtue is compassion not love. The
distinction is subtle, but great. When you love a person the emotion is
hot. When you hate a person then too the emotion is hot. One thing is
the same, that you are in a HOT relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are indifferent to a person you are cold, no heat in you
either way. You are simply unrelated; you don’t love, you don’t hate;
you don’t bother, you don’t care. You are indifferent, you go on your
own way. That’s why nothing hurts people more than indifference.</p><p><br></p><p>If you hate a person it is not so much of a problem to him. He knows
you are paying him attention – maybe negative, but you are paying
attention. But if you are indifferent it hurts deeply. If people simply
do not bother about you, you pass, and they don’t pay any attention this
way or that, then you feel that you are almost dead!</p><p><br></p><p>Indifference kills, not hate. Hate brings energy. Love brings energy.
Love is a pleasant feeling, hate is unpleasant, but if you have to
choose between hate and indifference, you will certainly choose hate.
You will never choose indifference. Indifference is absolutely cold,
killing.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion is not cold, compassion is cool. Cold means dead, cool
means balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you in another way. Compassion is cool, indifference is
cold; if you compare compassion with love and hate, it is cool; if you
compare compassion with indifference, it is warm. It is warm in
comparison to indifference and its coldness. It is cool in comparison to
love and hate and their heat.</p><p><br></p><p>Virtue is compassion. It is not love, it is not hate, it is a balance
between the two. It is not indifference either. It is life-giving. But
if you don’t know, compassion will look like indifference.</p><p><br></p><p>The distinction is very subtle. Coolness will look like coldness, but
coolness is alive, fresh. Coldness is simply dead. Virtue is
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>REQUITE HATRED WITH COMPASSION.</p><p><br></p><p>DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY;</p><p>Everything difficult has a phase when it is easy, if you are alert
you will know it. It is very easy to destroy a seed, it is very
difficult to destroy a big tree.</p><p><br></p><p>And everything has a seed form. When anger arises it is just like a
seed. If you want to drop it at that moment there is no problem, but if
you allow it to take root within you, to spread within your being, to
overwhelm you, then, destroying anger will be very very difficult; it
will look like destroying yourself, it will have become such a deep part
of you.</p><p><br></p><p>WHETHER IT IS BIG OR SMALL, MANY OR FEW, REQUITE HATRED WITH VIRTUE.
DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT WHILE YET IT IS EASY; DEAL WITH THE BIG WHILE
YET IT IS SMALL.</p><p><br></p><p>And everything is small and easy in the present. If you don’t
postpone everything is easy and small. You are powerful enough to change
it, to transform it. But if you say: I will see to it tomorrow; if you
say: There is no hurry; if you take it easy and you say: Some day when I
have enough time I will see to the problem; then the problem will
meanwhile grow and take root.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t postpone it, because then you will not be able to do much about
it. That’s what you have been doing up to now. You have been postponing
FOR LIVES. And then you come to me and you say: We would like to be
silent. We would like to be peaceful – and for many lives you have been
postponing problems which are boiling within you. They have to be
tackled. A great surgery is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are in such a hurry again. A few days people meditate, four
or five days, and then they come to me and they say: Nothing is
happening yet. Can’t you see the ridiculousness of it? What are you
asking?</p><p><br></p><p>For many lives you postpone. Then your being becomes like a ruin.
Your garden is there no more. Everything is destroyed, only weeds
subsist. And suddenly one day you want to have a beautiful lawn. It will
take time. The weeds have to be thrown out. Their roots and seeds have
to be thrown out. The soil has to be changed. It is not easy now.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can do at least one thing: you can start living moment to
moment, so at least you are not gathering more nonsense around you, more
rubbish around you; at least you can clean one part of the garden and
start working moment to moment. And once you know how problems have
become difficult, and once you come to understand that they ARE easy if
you tackle them in the beginning, everything will become easy again. But
that feeling, that nuance, that knack, has to be learnt.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY ARE
YET EASY; THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD MUST BE DEALT WITH WHILE THEY
ARE YET SMALL. THEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH GREAT PROBLEMS
ACCOMPLISHES GREATNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>These things look like paradoxes – they are not. They are simple
statements with no contradiction in them.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE THE SAGE BY NEVER DEALING WITH GREAT PROBLEMS...</p><p><br></p><p>because he has no great problems. He never deals with great problems
that’s why he is great.</p><p>In your understanding just the opposite is the case. You think some
man is so great because he has dealt with such great problems. Such
great challenges! And he has conquered them. This is foolish! A great
man has nothing to conquer. The greater he is, the less there is to
conquer, if he is really great there is nothing to conquer. The greatest
man has no problems to solve, neither great nor small. Because he never
allows them to accumulate. They become problems only when postponed.
Right now – lived, they are not problems, they are part of life, and
beautiful!</p><p><br></p><p>Just start being alert. Whenever you see some problem is arising,
drop all activity. Look to it, pay attention to it; just look within, at
what it is. Sometimes just a smile will be enough to change it, just
laughter will do, and you will be out of the vicious circle. Sometimes
nothing will be needed, not even a smile and a laugh, just the very
attention, that you looked into it, and it will disappear, as dewdrops
disappear in the morning when the sun rises.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look. Bring the sun of consciousness to it, it will disappear –
it is so small and you are so big and so vast! Just the very encounter,
that you look at it – and it changes its quality. It is a problem no
more. You can delight in it, you can enjoy it. Then life becomes a
drama.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS
FAITH.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand life you will never make promises, because a
promise is a postponement. You must either do it now or you must say, I
don’t know, I will see tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>In MAHABHARATA there is a beautiful anecdote. Pandavas, the five
brothers, are hiding in the forest. One day a beggar comes. Udhishthir
is sitting outside the hut and the beggar asks for nothing much, just
some bread, a few chapattis.</p><p><br></p><p>Udhishthir is brooding – and as it happens always whenever there is a
beggar, you would like to postpone. You say, Come tomorrow, just to
avoid. He may not come again tomorrow. You don’t want to be so rude as
to say, I will not give anything; also, you want to protect your image
that you are a great giver. So you say, Come tomorrow. Don’t disturb me
now. Udhishthir did the same; he said, Come tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Bhima, another brother – who is not known much for his wisdom or
intelligence, but sometimes it happens that people who are not very
intelligent flare up – he suddenly started laughing and he ran out of
the house with laughter, towards the town. Udhishthir asked: Where are
you going? He said, I am going to tell the people in the town that my
brother has conquered time! He has promised something to a beggar if he
comes tomorrow!</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Udhishthir became aware. Because how can you say, Come
tomorrow? You may not be here tomorrow. The beggar may not be here
tomorrow. Udhishthir ran off, caught hold of the beggar, gave him
whatsoever he could give him, and dropped the habit of promising.</p><p><br></p><p>Because a promise is possible only if tomorrow is certain. But who
knows anything about tomorrow?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great old Chinese story. A king was very angry with his
prime minister. He had done something or other, so the king ordered him
to be sentenced to death. It was the tradition that if somebody was to
be executed by the king’s order, the king had to visit him one day
before, to ask</p><p>if he had some desire to be fulfilled. The last desire of the
condemned man had to be fulfilled. And this man was no ordinary man – he
had served the king for many years as his prime minister; he had been an
intimate. But something went wrong, he did something and the king was
angry so the next morning he was to be executed, hanged. The king came
to see him twenty four hours before.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister was a brave man. He had been to many wars as a
general. When the king came the prime minister started weeping and
crying – tears rolling down. The king said: I would never have imagined
that you, a man of such bravery, would be weeping and crying because you
are going to be hanged tomorrow. Are you afraid of death?</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, That is not the point. Death I have never
been afraid of, it is something else but – leave it aside, now there is
no time to do it.</p><p><br></p><p>The king became curious. He said, What is the matter? You tell me. I
am here to fulfil your last desire. I promise you to fulfil it, you tell
me. You have served the kingdom long, and I would like to fulfil it
whatsoever it is; you just tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, If you insist, then I will tell you. This is
a long story. When I was young I was with a great Master, and he was an
enlightened being, and he had many secrets with him. One secret I
learnt. And that secret was that there is a rare type of horse which can
be taught to fly, and my whole life I have been searching for that type
of horse that can be taught to fly, but I couldn’t find one – and look
at the irony of fate; the horse that you have come on is the right
horse, and tomorrow morning I will be dead! And the whole science will
go dead with me. The secret will be lost to humanity – that’s why I am
crying.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, The horse can fly? How much time will you take to
teach it? – because the king became interested. If this horse can fly in
the sky this will be something superb, incomparable, that no other king
in the world can claim. He said, You forget about your sentence; you
tell me how much time you will take.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, It will take one year. The king said, Okay. There is no
harm in it. For one year you try. If the horse flies, then not only will
you not be hanged, but you will get married to my daughter and you will
share my kingdom: half-half. But if the horse cannot fly, then you will
be executed. So there is no harm in it; you come out – take the
horse.</p><p><br></p><p>The man took the horse, went home – there his wife and children were
crying and weeping because this was the last day, the next morning the
husband, the father, would be dead. They could not believe their eyes –
that he was coming back riding on a horse. They thought they must be
dreaming. They wiped their eyes and they asked: What is the matter? How
could you manage to come?</p><p><br></p><p>He told them the whole story. The wife again started crying and said,
You are a fool, because I know very well you don’t know anything like
that. You invented a lie. If you were going to lie then why say one
year? You should have asked for fifty years, twenty years at least! The
one year will pass so soon, and this will be a nightmare, because the
whole year we will be trembling, because soon again you have to die.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, Don’t be afraid, one year is too long! The king can
die, I can die, at least the horse can die – you don’t be worried! Don’t
you be worried, one year is long enough.</p><p>LAO TZU SAYS:</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO LIGHTLY MAKES A PROMISE WILL FIND IT OFTEN HARD TO KEEP HIS
FAITH. HE WHO MAKES LIGHT OF MANY THINGS WILL ENCOUNTER MANY
DIFFICULTIES. HENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT, AND FOR
THAT REASON NEVER MEETS WITH DIFFICULTIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu is saying: Don’t promise, otherwise you will lose faith –
because time goes on changing things. Don’t say anything certain about
the future, because future itself is not certain. At the most for this
moment you can be certain, that’s all. And one who lives in this moment
without promising, postponing, thinking, planning about the future, who
lives such a simple life, such an innocent life, that his faith grows,
his trust grows, his gratefulness grows – he becomes a vehicle for the
ultimate grace to flow from him. He becomes a passage for the divine,
for Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>But one who lightly gives promises, who lightly postpones things, who
never thinks that things are difficult.…</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand this. Lao Tzu says: Everything is simple if you
take it rightly in the beginning. But don’t think that it is simple, and
don’t think that it is easy, because if you think that it is easy there
will be a tendency to postpone – such an easy thing, why bother now? It
can be done tomorrow. Things are easy, but you think they are very
difficult; tackle them immediately otherwise they will become
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>HENCE EVEN THE SAGE REGARDS THINGS AS DIFFICULT...</p><p><br></p><p>knowing well that they are easy. But he regards them as difficult so
that the inner tendency to postponement is curbed.</p><p><br></p><p>Small things, very ordinary things – they can be done very easily,
but the sage regards them as difficult, AND FOR THAT REASON NEVER MEETS
WITH DIFFICULTIES, because then he goes on solving everything. Things
never accumulate, they are never too much. He moves from moment to
moment, completely unburdened from the past, completely unburdened for
the future. He moves like a mirror, empty.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The empty mirror’ is the right word for the sage. You come before
it, it mirrors you. When you move, the reflection has gone. The mirror
is again empty, again ready to reflect something if it comes.</p><p><br></p><p>The mirror never says, I will reflect tomorrow. If the mirror could
say, I will reflect tomorrow – there would be such a crowd, nothing
would be reflected. That is the state of your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been postponing. Now, stop postponing. Look into the
problems. By the very look they are almost solved. And the small things
that remain? – they can be tackled.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is capable of solving his problems. Everybody HAS to be
capable. When you are capable of creating problems who else is going to
be capable of solving them? You create, you can solve. These sutras of
Lao Tzu are very significant. Pay attention to them. Meditate over them.
Let your being be soaked with them.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

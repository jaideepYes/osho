‌CHAPTER 1
When the Disciple is Ready
21 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
A CERTAIN MAN DECIDED THAT HE WOULD SEEK THE PERFECT MASTER.
HE READ MANY BOOKS, VISITED SAGE AFTER SAGE, LISTENED, DISCUSSED AND PRACTISED, BUT HE ALWAYS FOUND HIMSELF DOUBTING OR UNSURE.
AFTER TWENTY YEARS HE MET A MAN WHOSE EVERY WORD AND ACTION CORRESPONDED WITH HIS IDEA OF THE TOTALLY REALIZED MAN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Buddha and the Beast
30 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT EXACTLY IS MAN?
MAN IS A MERE PERHAPS, A POSSIBILITY, A POTENTIAL, a becoming, a longing. Man is not yet. Man has to be. That’s the agony of man, and the ecstasy too. The beast is – there is no growth possible. It is a finished product. There is no possibility to seek and search and be.</description>

There is Communion
22 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, YESTERDAY YOU MENTIONED THAT TO BE A DISCIPLE ONE NEEDS TO BE IN PRAYER – BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS PRAYER?
PRAYER IS AN EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION, A REBIRTH, the birth of a new vision, a new dimension, a new way of looking at things, and a new way of being.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
A Rolling Stone
23 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
A WANDERING SEEKER SAW A DERVISH IN A REST-HOUSE AND SAID TO HIM, “I HAVE BEEN IN A HUNDRED CLIMES AND HAVE HEARD THE TEACHINGS OF A MULTITUDE OF MENTORS. I HAVE LEARNT HOW TO DECIDE WHEN A TEACHER IS NOT A SPIRITUAL MAN. I CANNOT TELL A GENUINE GUIDE, OR HOW TO FIND ONE, BUT HALF THE WORK COMPLETED IS BETTER THAN NOTHING.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Via Confusiva
24 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, WHATEVER YOU SAY SEEMS TO BE RIGHT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AT THAT MOMENT. BUT IT MAY BE CONTRADICTORY. YOU DRAW THE LISTENERS IN ONE DIRECTION CONFIRMING A PARTICULAR POINT, AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU GO VIA THE BACK DOOR TO THE OPPOSITE POINT.</description>

THE SUFI SAID, “HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF THE MONGOL HALAKU KHAN AND HIS INVASION OF SYRIA?</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Only One Ecstasy
26 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
HOW DOES THE INTERNAL WORLD OF EXPERIENCE RELATE TO EXTERNAL REALITY?
ANURAG, THERE ARE NOT TWO REALITIES. All duality is only in conceptualization. Reality is one. It is mind that divides: the lower and the higher, the good and the bad, the internal and the external, heaven and hell.</description>

The Grass Grows By Itself
28 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOWL MEAN BY ‘CONSCIOUS IGNORANCE’? IS IT THE RECOGNITION THAT ONE IS ULTIMATELY, FUNDAMENTALLY IGNORANT? OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?
Ashoka, conscious ignorance is not ignorance at all. It is the ultimate state of consciousness – how can it be ignorant?</description>

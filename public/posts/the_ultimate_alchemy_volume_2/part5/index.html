Reality exists through polar opposites – through the positive and the negative, through the male and the female, through yin and yang.\nReality is a dialectical process, and when I say “dialectical process” I mean it is not a simple process: it is very complex. A simple process means one element working; a dialectical process means two polar opposites working in one direction. And though they appear as opposites, they create a symphony – they create a musical harmony. And that harmony is reality.\nMan and woman. they mean humanity. Man alone is not humanity, nor is woman alone humanity. Humanity – the music, the synthesis we call humanity – is a dialectical phenomenon. Man and woman both work to create humanity, they both help to create humanity. And the way of their creating it is dialectical: they exist as polar opposites. and the inner tension between the two creates the energy for movement, for a process of further growth.\nIt is the same on every plane. If we go deep down with the physicist to the atom’s inner structure, then again we find two polar opposites working there: the negative electricity and the positive electricity. Because of these two polar opposites, matter is created. If there were only positive electricity, the\nworld would disappear immediately. If there were only negative electricity, there would be nothing. But negative electricity and positive electricity create an inner tension, and because of that inner tension matter exists.\nThe same is the case with the inner being of man also. This sutra is concerned with that. We discussed how awareness creates an inner sun. But this sutra talks about the creation of an inner moon. The sun is symbolic of the inner positivity and the moon is symbolic of the inner negativity. The sun is the inner male and the moon is the inner female. These words are symbolic, and for Indian yoga particularly they are very meaningful. By “sun” the outer sun is not what is meant, nor by “moon” the outer moon These two words “sun” and “moon” are used for the inner universe.\nIndian yoga divides man into two parts: the sun part and the moon part. Even one breath is known as the sun breath and another breath is known as the moon breath. And, really, this is one of the deepest findings. If you stop the moon breath and just breathe from the sun breath, your body will become hot. And such a great heat can be created simply by using only one kind of breath that it seems inconceivable in physiological terms. Among Tibetans there exists a heat yoga in which breathing is done only through this sun breath. not using the moon breath at all.\nOrdinarily the breath is continuously changing, but Western medical science has not yet taken note of it. Breathing is not a simple process. It is a dialectical process. You are changing your nostrils within each hour. Between forty and sixty minutes, approximately, your nostrils change, and you begin to take your breath from the other nostril; then again it changes. When you need more heat in the body – for example, if suddenly you become angry – your sun breath starts.\nYoga says that when you are angry, if you use your moon breath and stop the sun breath, you cannot be angry at all, because the moon breath creates a deep coolness inside. The whole body is divided between the sun and the moon, and the mind is also divided between the sun and the moon\nSo look at man not as one, because nothing can exist as just one. Everything exists through duality. You are divided into two: you have a negative part and you have a positive part. The positive is known as the sun in Indian symbology and the negative as moon. The negative is cool, silent, still. The positive is hot, vibrant with energy, active. The sun is the active part in you and the moon the inactive part, and if the active and the inactive both come to a deep equilibrium you are suddenly Enlightened. If one is more emphatic: you have an imbalance, but if both are of equal force, then they balance each other, negate each other, and the moment both are of equal force, your inner balance is regained and you reach to a different reality – the reality of the non-dual. That one non- dual reality can be felt only when both of these dualities in you are balanced. Then you transcend them.\nIn the world we exist as duality. Beyond the world we exist as non-duality – as one. Think of yourself as a triangle; two angles exist in the world and the third angle beyond the world. Two angles belong to this world and one angle belongs to that world – the world of the Brahman. But if these two are in an imbalance, you cannot go beyond them. You go beyond them only when they regain balance. This balancing is Nirvana, this balancing is moksha, this balancing is the centering. Awareness works to balance this duality. And the moment this duality is balanced, you cannot be reborn again – you disappear from the world.\nYou can be born again and again only if there is an imbalance. If the balance comes to a totality, if the balance becomes total, it is impossible to be born again. You disappear from the world; the body cannot exist any more. Then you cannot re-enter a body again. So first we will try to understand what this inner sun is and what this inner moon is, and how they are balanced.\nThis sutra says, “ACCUMULATION OF THE NECTAR OF THE INNER FULL MOON IS NAIVEDYA,\nTHE FOOD OFFERING.” You need a full moon in you to offer to the Divine as a food. That only can be the food for the Divine – a full moon inside.\nAwareness works in a double way. It creates a sun and it also creates a moon. We talked about how it creates a sun inside. When you become aware of whatsoever is happening in you, of the innermost unconscious activities, you become Enlightened. The very cells of your body become conscious; you become light. Your consciousness reaches to the very pores of your body. Just like the rays of the sun reach into the earth, your inner awareness, once awakened, begins to work in every cell of the body and every fibre, every nerve of the body. Your whole body is filled with light. But this is only one part of awareness, this is only one process of awareness. Rays from your center also go to your periphery, to the circumference. The more your rays go to the circumference, the cooler your center becomes.\nI do not know whether you have heard of a particular theory about the sun – the outer sun; I do not know whether it is right or not, but it is meaningful in helping to understand the inner reality. They say the sun at its deepest center is the coolest spot in the solar system; it is not hot at all. The heat is only on The periphery, on the circumference, not in the inner center of the sun. Because of helium gas around the sun, heat is created; because of the helium and its chain explosion of atoms, heat is created, and then the heat spreads to the solar family.\nThe sun has a body and it is the center. The solar family is the body and the earth belongs to the body as a cell. The heat goes to the solar family, it spreads. But the sun in itself is a cold thing, absolutely cold, and at its deepest center, it is the coldest spot in existence. It should be so because reality exists in polarities. If the sun is the hottest thing, it must have something inside it which balances the heat. Take a wheel that is just moving on the street: the wheel moves, but in the center the hub on which it moves remains still. The movement must have something non-moving in the center, otherwise movement will not be possible.\nIn this world of manifestations, everything exists within polar opposites. You are alive because you have death inside. If you had no death inside, you could not be alive. So do not think that one day it suddenly happens that death comes to you. It is an inner growth. It is not something that you meet, that you encounter – no! It is something toward which you are daily growing. One day the growth is complete, and you are dead. It is an inner phenomenon. You are alive with a death center. You cannot be alive without a death center.\nNothing exists without its polar opposite. Life and death are just two positive and negative realities. So it looks logical, dialectical also, but it is not yet proved that the sun has at its center a cold spot, an absolutely cold spot, the polar opposite to the heat on its circumference. It may be true, it may not be true: that is irrelevant. But inside it is absolutely true. When you become aware, the heat begins to travel toward your circumference. Each cell of your body will become heated, warm, because of the awareness penetrating. The second counterpart will be that your center of being will become\ncooler and cooler and cooler. That is the moon working. The sun is the warmth spreading, the light spreading.\nAnd you must know that light has two qualities – light and warmth. Heat is just concentrated light; light is nothing but dispersed heat. So when light travels to your body, every cell will become warm, enlightened, aware. Sleep is a cold thing, night is a cold thing. That is why we sleep in the night: it is a cold time. And in the morning, with the rising sun, everything becomes warm, alive. Then it is difficult to sleep and easy to be awake.\nWhen your circumference is cold, when each body cell is cold. asleep, your center will be a hot spot. Because of that hot spot in the center you will be sexual, you will be angry, you will be greedy, you will be everything. Your center will be in a fever This heat begins to travel. Of course, when heat leaves your center it spreads; and the more it spreads, the less it is heat and the more it is light.\nThe sunrays on the earth are life-giving. They have travelled much. If you go nearer and nearer to them they will become death-giving, because then they will not be warm: then they will be just pure fire.\nAs it is, the whole body structure is just cold. You feel heat only in anger, in sex, in desire, in passion. That is not light, but simply a feverish phenomenon. Because of this, sex is felt as a release – because you lose a certain quantity of heat, and you are relieved; you lose a certain quantity of fever, and you are released.\nBecause of this, militaries have not allowed their soldiers any sexual freedom – because if you allow sexual freedom to soldiers. they cannot fight. Then inner fever is released. If you do not allow them sexual freedom, their inner fever is accumulated. That accumulated fever begins to be violent automatically.\nThat is why a certain very deep phenomenon, a great riddle of history, can be solved whenever a society is affluent: when the problem of food and hunger is solved, a society begins to be sexually free. Only poor societies can be sexually suppressive. Whenever a society is affluent, rich you cannot suppress sex – because the food problem has become solved. Much energy is released, so what to do with it? So an affluent society will become sexually free.\nAn affluent society means a society which has progressed much technologically. And whenever any civilization comes to a point of affluence, sexual freedom is bound to be there, and then any less developed society can win over this higher civilized society. So this has always been the history: a greater civilization will always be defeated by a barbaric, uncivilized society.\nIndia was defeated continuously because of its affluence. Tartars, Berbers, Huns, Moghuls, Turks, they were all uncivilized societies – poor, poverty-stricken, sexually suppressed. They had much violence in them. You can see this in a modern phenomenon: in Vietnam. Americans can never win. Their youth is sexually free, and they are less violent. Thus, they cannot win in Vietnam. No affluent society can really win over any poor society. They may fight for longer periods, but they cannot win. They can kill a whole country, but they cannot win because the very fighting spirit is not there.\nAmerica is today one of the most sexually free societies in all history. America cannot fight; fighting is part of a suppressed sex. The inner fever must be accumulated in such quantities that you begin\nto be violent. Suppress sex, and you will be violent. That is why so-called saints are very violent in their behaviour. They are angry, violent, because of suppressed sex. That fever has to be released in some way.\nIn sex you are releasing a particular amount of energy. They say that in one sex act you release 120 calories of heat – 120 calories! It is the same if you run fast for one mile. Then you will release the same amount of calories – 120. That is why there is much talk about whether sex can help heart disease. It can help! It releases energy. For persons who are well fed, it helps to delay heart disease. It releases energy, but it is not a solution. It is just a temporary arrangement. It just creates a leakage in your system from which energy is released.\nAny day that you are angry your whole body is heated. It becomes feverish. The center releases anger: energy comes to the periphery. Ordinarily it is cold. The periphery is cold ordinarily, and the center is hot. The reverse will be the case when awareness happens to you. When you meditate and go deep within, when you become aware of every activity, everything will take a turn – an about- turn. Your periphery will not go into anger, not go into sex, not go into greed, not go into passion. It will lose its coldness – its sleepy coldness. It will become warm, alive and aware. And because this energy is released to the periphery every twenty-four hours continuously, you will not need any anger or any sex.\nA Buddha doesn’t need anger. It is absolutely useless for him because the very energy system has changed. He is using his heat for light and you are using your light for heat. The same fuel can be used to burn your house and the same fuel can be used to light it. The fuel is the same, but the direction changes. The inner fuel, the inner energy, becomes fire – suicidal. It burns you down, and ultimately you are just ashes. In the end, when death comes near you, you are just ashes. Everything is burnt out because you used your energy not as a light, but as a fire.\nIt becomes fire if it is concentrated in the center and is released only temporarily, whenever it is overflowing. In a sudden shock it comes to the periphery and is released. This is a very chaotic state. You go on accumulating it inside. Then one day it is overflowing and you have to throw it.\nWe go on rationalizing our actions. When you Get angry you say that someone has made you angry. No, really, it is that you were ready: you were overflowing inside. You do not know this because you were not aware. You were overflowing with a certain amount of energy which was waiting to be released. When someone abuses you, insults you, and you become angry, you think that this person is creating anger in you.\nNo, this person is simply giving you a situation and opportunity to release the overflowing energy. In a way, he is your friend, a helper. If he is not there you will be in a very difficult situation. If no one is giving you any opportunity to throw your energy, you will project, you will imagine something, and you will get angry with anything at all.\nPeople get angry with their shoes; they will throw them. They can get angry with the door; they become violent with it. They can be angry with everything. When no opportunity is given, they can even become angry with themselves. They will begin to harm themselves or they will create some substitutes.\nWe have created many. Someone is just smoking: we think it is a simple thing. It is not! Now psychologists say it is a deep violence You take the smoke in and then throw it out, you take the smoke in and then throw it out: it helps to release hunger, violence, sex. We have many, many devices. Persons who are violent will eat more. Just by destroying the food they are releasing violence.\nYou may not have observed it, but when you are loving you cannot eat much, when you are happy you cannot eat much, when you feel blissful, you cannot eat too much. Ordinarily it should not be so. It looks opposite to what we think should be the case. We think that when one is happy he should eat more. No, a happy person will not eat more. He cannot eat more because eating is part of violence. A happy person is not violent; hence. when you are in love you cannot eat very much.\nTwo persons, when in love, unmarried, will not eat much. But when married they will begin to eat more because love has disappeared. Now it is a violence, and it is related with many deep things. In animals violence is expressed through teeth, and we are related to animals. When one animal is violent, angry, the energy comes to the teeth and to the nails. These are the instruments for being violent for an animal.\nBut, still, the same happens with us. When you are violent, your teeth, your fingers, your nails, are filled with heat, with energy. Now you have to release it. You can eat, you can use gum, you can smoke, you can take PAN (a leaf preparation in India which is chewed), because you need something to crush. So there are people who are the whole day crushing pan. Their violence is thus released.\nEven by continuously talking, violence is released. Women talk more than men because men can be violent in other ways while women cannot be. That is the only reason. They talk more! They talk continuously, they talk madly, because man has other possibilities for expressing violence – in the office, with the car, etc. Have you observed a man who is angry driving his car? He is releasing his anger through the accelerator. The car will speed up He is releasing anger, and the car is just a medium. Fifty percent of car accidents are not because of cars but because of drivers. not because of traffic but because of mental tension.\nBut women cannot release anger in so many ways. They have only one: going on talking. By their doing something with the teeth and the lips, much is released. A woman who is angry will break more saucers, more cups, unknowingly. She will be surprised why today everything is just breaking. It is the unconscious mind. Energy is in the hands. The energy wants to destroy something. So it is good to have breakable things in the house. It helps! Then before the husband is back, the wife is released. If you make everything unbreakable, it will break families. Breakable things help families to continue. Now these are proven facts.\nIf you have energy in the center which is feverish, not transferred to the periphery, not used as light for the whole body and for your whole being, this is bound to happen. Every day you will accumulate energy, and then you will have to throw it. And this is nonsense! For the whole life you are doing this: accumulating. throwing; accumulating, throwing. What are you doing twenty-four hours a day? Just accumulating energy to throw it. Then when energy is there, the only problem is how to throw it. So we throw it in sex, in anger, in greed. When energy is thrown, then the only problem is how to accumulate it\nWhat sort of life is this? A vicious circle! With awareness the whole mechanism changes. With awareness, every moment your inner center is sending its energy to every pore of your body. And your body is not a small thing. It is a miniature universe: as above, so below. Everybody is a small universe. And when I say “small”, I feel guilty – because, really, it is not small. It is as vast as the universe. But because of our language, there are problems. The universe appears vast and your body appears small.\nWhat is the difference between the two? They say that if we can throw out all space from the earth, if we can compress it and throw out the space, if the vacant space in it is thrown out, our earth will be just like a small ball. If we can throw out all the empty space from the Himalayas, they can be put into a match box. The material is not much, the matter is not much. The matter is very small, only the emptiness in it is vast.\nSo how to judge whether a thing is big or small? A very small thing can be blown up to any bigness if we put space in it. If we put as much space into your body as there is in the earth, you will be like the earth. So all the differences are of spaces – empty spaces. No difference is there really.\nBut when I say “a small universe”, I mean only this: that everything that exists in the universe exists in you also. Whatsoever may be the measure, exactly everything exists in you also. So when your solar center, your sun, releases energy, it releases it in two ways. Either you are unconscious: then it releases it into sex, anger. greed and other diseases. Or if you are conscious, through this consciousness heat is transformed into light: then it is released as light. Then you are under a shower of light continuously. Your every pore, your every cell, is bathed. There is a continuous shower of light. When this happens, your inner center begins to become cooler and cooler and cooler, and ultimately it becomes the coldest spot.\nHindus have a myth that Shankara lives on Kailash. Kailash is the coldest mythological spot – the coldest peak, the highest peak – and it is always covered with snow. This is just a symbolic way of saying that you have the coldest spot – a Kailash – in you. But you can know it only when the heat is transformed into light – never before. And the more you become aware, the more heat is transformed into light, and you begin to feel a moon inside. You begin to feel a cool, silent pool.\nThis sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner full moon...” In the beginning, of course, you will feel it and miss it. It is just like the first day’s moon. Then there is the second-day moon, the third-day moon. You feel it and it is gone; then it grows :again; then comes the full-moon night. Just like this, this inner spot of coolness grows. As your consciousness grows, your heat is transformed into light. As your periphery becomes enlightened, as your each and every cell is filled with light and becomes aware and awake, this inner moon grows. Sometimes you feel it and sometimes you miss it. Sometimes there is an inner cool breeze, and you know something has happened inside. You feel it, but then you miss it again. Then it goes on growing. Ultimately, when there is no unconsciousness left and your total energy has become light. you come to know the full moon.\nBuddha has talked about this full moon in negative terms because it is the negative pole. So Buddha says that when this inner silence is achieved, it is Nirvana. The word is very meaningful in reference to this sutra. Nirvana means “cessation of the flame”: a lamp is burning and then the flame disappears.\nWhen your heat is totally transformed into light, there is no flame. That is why the moon symbol is used. The moon has light. but no flame. That is why its light is cool. It is without flame, without fire. Light is there without any flame. The flame has disappeared.\nWhen one first becomes acquainted with the sun, the light becomes like a flame, burning. hot. So if you analyze the life, the inner life. of a Buddha or of a Jesus or of a Mahavir, many things will become apparent which are ordinarily hidden. For example, whenever a person like Buddha is born, the early life will be very revolutionary – because the moment one enters the inside, the first experience is a fiery flame. The more Buddha grows older, the more the inner coolness is felt, the more the moon becomes perfect. Revolution is lost. Then Buddha’s words are not revolutionary.\nJesus couldn’t get this opportunity. He was killed when he was still a revolutionary. That is why, if you compare Buddha’s sayings with Jesus’ sayings, there is a clear-cut distinction and difference. Jesus’ sayings look like that of a young mall – hot! Buddha’s early sayings are also like that, but he lived to be eighty. He was not killed.\nThere are reasons. And one reason is this: India always knew that this happens: whenever a person goes in, the first expression is fiery, revolutionary, rebellious. That is why India never killed anyone. That is why India could never behave as Greeks behaved with Socrates and Jews behaved with Jesus. India knew much. It has known many, many such persons. India knows it is natural that whenever a Buddha enters into himself the first experience will be revolutionary. He will burst open, explode into a fiery flame. But then the flame will disappear, and ultimately there will be only a moon – silent. cool, with no fire but only light.\nJesus was killed. That is why Christianity has still remained incomplete. Christianity was based on early Jesus – on Jesus when he was just a flame. That is why Christianity has remained incomplete. Buddhism is complete. It has known Buddha in all stages. It has known Buddha’s moon in all stages – from the first day to the full-moon light. This crucifixion has been unfortunate for the West. It has proved one of the greatest misfortunes in history that Jesus was killed when he was only thirty-three, just a flame. The flame would have turned into moonlight, but the opportunity was not given. And the reason was only this: that the Jews were not aware of the inner phenomenon.\nIndia knew many, many Buddhas, and it is always the case that whenever someone enters in, he first sees the fire, the flame, and the revolutionary spirit comes up. But if one goes on in and in, it dissolves, and then there is only silence – a moonlight silence.\nThis sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner full moon...” This silence. this cool silence of the moon, Hindus have called nectar, the amrit, the elixir. It is not to be found somewhere else. It is in you. This nectar is in you! Once you are established m this nectar, once you are in this pool of cool moonlight, then you are a full moon inside. Then you have known both the polarities: you have known life, you have known death, you have known the sun, you have known the moon. You have known both the polarities – life and death. And once you have known both you have transcended both. That is why it is called the nectar amrit.\nNow you will not die. Now you are drunk with elixir; you cannot die. But you will not be alive in the old sense either. You have died in the old sense; you are reborn in a new moon. Now death will not be a death and life will not be a life. Now you will be beyond both.\nI have heard about Tanka. the Zen Master, who one day declared before his disciples that Buddha was never born. He said, “This whole story is just false; this whole Buddha legend is just false. He was never born.” His disciples were just perplexed. What did he mean? It seemed he had gone mad. Every day he had himself been teaching the life of Buddha, his birth and everything, and suddenly one day he said, “This whole thing is nonsense. He was Never born.” Then he left the platform and went into his hut.\nThe disciples gathered around his hut and asked, “What are you saying? What about that which you were always teaching us for your whole life?”\nTanka said, “Tanka is no more. He was never born, so the whole legend is false. The teaching of Tanka and your listening to Tanka is just false. Someone has created a fiction. Do not be deceived.”\nThen they were even more perplexed. It may be that Buddha was not born, but Tanka was already there standing beside them. Tanka laughed and said, “That which is born, that which was born. was not Buddha.”\nIn India we have two names: “Gautam Siddharth” is the name given by the parents. Then one day he became Enlightened: his consciousness flowered, bloomed. Then he used another name – “Gautam the Buddha”: “Buddha” means the Enlightened One. This second name doesn’t belong to Gautam at all. Gautam is just a situation. In his place Buddha happened, and this Buddha did not really happen on the day of his Enlightenment. He had been always there, but it had been recognized only on this day. Gautam had come to recognize on that day something which was always there – the Buddha.\nThis inner phenomenon is beyond birth and death. It is never born and never will it die, because that which is born can die and that which is not born cannot die. Death needs birth as a prerequisite, as a necessary prerequisite. You cannot die if you are not born. With this inner phenomenon – when sun and moon are balanced, when the dialectical process is finished, when the synthesis is complete – you come to feel in yourself something which is eternal.\nThat is why this sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner full moon is NAIVEDYA.” Now you have become food yourself. Now you can offer yourself to the Divine. Now you are food. Now you are eternal. And why is it called “food”, NAIVEDYA? Because when you are eternal, you can become food for the eternal. And by “food” the ordinary meaning is also implied. When you take food in, it becomes one with you. It becomes your blood, it becomes your bones, it becomes you: you are your food! So when you have come to know this inner reality, the eternal reality, you can offer it as food to the universe, to the Existence.\nBy this is meant that now you can become the bones of the universe, you can become the blood of the universe. Now you carl be one with it just like food becomes one with you. The meeting is complete because you have become food for the Divine. Then you are naivedya. Then the offering can be accepted.\nBut you cannot offer your body as the food. It will be food, but for the vultures, not for the Divine. This cannot be offered as food for the Divine. Your body comes out of the earth and goes back to the earth. It can only be eaten by the earth again: “Dust unto dust.’It can only return to dust, so this body cannot be offered to the Divine.\nOne young seeker came to Gautam Buddha. He said, “I have come to offer myself to you. Accept me”\nBuddha asked him, “What are you offering – your body? But that is already offered and the earth will claim it, so how can you offer it to me? What are you offering? Tell me exactly!”\nThe man was confused. He said, “Whatsoever I have I offer to you”\nBuddha asked him, “What do you have? What is it that belongs to you? Do your thoughts belong to you? They belong to the society; your mind belongs to the society. Your body belongs to your parents, to the earth, to the sky, to water, to fire, to many things to the five elements. What do you have that you can offer to me?”\nThe man could not answer because he had nothing else. He could not think of anything else, so Buddha said, “Do not offer now. First find out what you are. And the moment you find it, it is already offered. Then there is no need to offer.”\nWhen you find the inner balance that is known from finding the sun and finding the moon, only when you know both, they balance each other, and in that balance you escape from duality. And then the third angle of the triangle is touched. For the first time you are above yourself: you are the inner self. Now you can look down at yourself – at your sun, your moon, your body, your soul, your positivity, your negativity, your male, your female. Now you can look down at yourself – at the whole world of duality, at multidimensional duality – and now you can become naivedya, the food offering.\nBut now there is no need even to offer: you have already offered. Now there is no need to ask to be accepted: you are already accepted. You are one. Just as food becomes one with you, you become one with the Divine. And by “Divine” I mean the Whole, the Totality, everything – the very Existence.\nSo what to do? Transform heat into light: that is the mantra\nTransform heat into light! Do not use heat as heat: use it as light. When you think anger is coming to you, close your eyes and meditate on what anger is. Dig deep inside and find out the source from where it is coming. What we are doing ordinarily is just the opposite. When we get angry we begin to think about the object of anger. about who has created it, and not of the source of anger, from where it is coming. When you get angry, close your eyes. This is the right moment to meditate. Close your eyes, go in, and find out from where this anger is coming. Follow it to the very source. Go deep, and you will come to the source of heat from where the accumulated energy is bursting forth to go out.\nObserve it; do not indulge in it – because if you indulge in it, it will be thrown out without being transformed. And do not suppress it – because if you suppress it, it will be thrown back to the original source which is overflowing. It cannot absorb it. It will be thrown back again with a more forceful movement. So do not suppress it and do not indulge in it. Just be conscious. Move inward to the source. This very movement slows down the process; this very observation transforms the quality of anger, because this calm observation is an antidote.\nAnger and calm observation are different phenomena. When this calm observation enters into anger, it changes the energy, the very chemical composition of it, and the heat becomes light. That\nis the change: heat becomes light! Then the anger is neither thrown back to the original source which cannot contain it because it is overflowing, nor is it thrown to the object in a wastage, a foolish wastage. Then this energy neither moves out to the object of anger, nor is It suppressed back to the original source. With observation this energy becomes diffused. It moves to the periphery of your body as light. When diffused, it moves as light, and the very anger becomes ojas, the very anger becomes a light, an inner light.\nSo do not be disturbed and disappointed if you have much anger. That only shows you have much energy. A person born without anger cannot be transformed. He has no energy. So be happy that you have energy, but do not misuse it. Energy can be misused, it can be transformed. Energy in itself is neutral. It will not tell you what to do with it – you have to decide. This is the secret science of inner alchemy – to change heat into light, to change coal into diamond, to change baser elements into gold.\nThese are just symbols. Alchemists were not really concerned with changing baser metals into higher metals, but they had to hide and they had to make an esoteric, secret symbology, because it was very difficult in past ages to tank about the inner science and not be murdered or killed. Jesus was killed: he was an alchemist. And the Christianity that developed, that followed Jesus, went quite against him. The Christian Church began to kill and murder those who were again trying alchemy.\nThis word “alchemy” is very beautiful. Our “chemistry” is born out of alchemy. The word “chemistry” comes from “alchemy”, but “alchemy” itself is a very deep and significant word. The word “alchemy” comes from Egypt. The old name of Egypt was “Khem” and “Al Khem” means “the secret science of Egypt”. The Egyptians were deep in the alchemy of inner transformation, in how to transform the inner chemistry.\nMany Egyptian mummies are preserved. They are the oldest, most ancient mummies, and still scientists are not able to probe into how they were preserved, why and how they were preserved. But that “why” we can guess, and our so-called history is nothing but a guess. But about esoteric things it is always a fallacious guess.\nWhy they were preserved is difficult to understand, but more problematic is the “how”, by what chemical process they were preserved. They are still as fresh as if they had just died. If there had been any outer chemical process, our chemistry could know it; we are more chemically developed than old Egypt. The real thing is that these bodies were preserved not by any outer chemical process, but by inner alchemy.\nIf your sex energy, which is the source of life, can be transformed inwardly, then your body can be preserved for any length of time very easily. If your sex energy is transformed, then your body can be preserved even for a million years. If the cells of your body lose sex then the body can be preserved, because birth comes through sex and death comes through sex. Your freshness, the youngness of the body, comes through sex, and then deterioration comes through sex.\nThese mummies were preserved not just as historians say or as Egyptologists say, that man has always been thinking in terms of ego to preserve himself. With the kings, the emperors, for example, that is not the case. Totally different is the secret. They were preserved only so that they would be recognized when their souls would be born again. When a man is born again in another body, if his old body is preserved it helps to further his inner progress.\nBut the old body will be useful only if it was transformed by alchemy; otherwise it is of no use. If you change your body inwardly, your body then becomes a laboratory. It is a lab; it is not just a body. If you have been working inside, experimenting inside, then you know this body from the inside, not only from the outside.\nWe know our bodies only from the outside. Whatsoever the mirror tells is our only knowledge – it is from the outside.Our knowledge is as if someone goes around a house and looks at it, and then says, “I know it.” He has never come in; he has never looked from the inside. We look at our bodies from the outside, never from the inside.\nIf you begin to transform your anger, your sex, you will begin to look at your body from the inside. Then your body is a great experiment, a great laboratory, very complex, and then you will want to preserve it for further growth. When one enters another body, one can learn much from the old body. It was a great experiment in old Egypt, and many things were done with the body. They were successful in some things, failures in some things.\nIf you have again a new body, a new laboratory, then if the old is preserved you will not have to begin again from ABC. If the old is preserved, this is a record. Death had interrupted, but now you can proceed. You are not to proceed from the beginning again; you can proceed from the point where death interrupted in the last life.\nSo only Egyptians and Tibetans have preserved bodies for this reason, but only those bodies which were undergoing deep inner experiments. Otherwise it is useless to preserve your old body. Other vise you will not even be able to recognize it.\nLenin’s body is preserved in Moscow, but he would not even recognize it. If he were born again, he would not even recognize it! His body was never used as a laboratory; he never knew it. He was just acquainted with it in the mirror, never with the body itself.\nThis process is alchemical: observe anger, and anger is transformed into light; observe sex, and sex is transformed into light. Observe any inner phenomenon which creates heat. Observe it, and through observation it becomes light. And if your every heat phenomenon is transformed into light, you will come to feel the inner moon. And when there is no heat left, then you have accumulated the nectar of the full moon.\nAnd through this nectar you become immortal. Not in this body, not with this body: you become immortal because you transcend life and death both.\nThen you are naivedya: then you are a food offering to the Divine – to the Total.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7251","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_ultimate_alchemy_volume_2/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_ultimate_alchemy_volume_2/>The Ultimate Alchemy Volume 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 The Ultimate Alchemy</h1><div class=post-meta>35 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7251 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Ultimate_Alchemy_Volume_2/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

FOOD OFFERING.”</p><p><br></p><p>YOU MUST have heard about the Taoist concept of yin and yang – the
concept of polar opposites into one reality. Reality exists through
polar opposites – through the positive and the negative, through the
male and the female, through yin and yang.</p><p><br></p><p>Reality is a dialectical process, and when I say “dialectical
process” I mean it is not a simple process: it is very complex. A simple
process means one element working; a dialectical process means two polar
opposites working in one direction. And though they appear as opposites,
they create a symphony – they create a musical harmony. And that harmony
is reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Man and woman. they mean humanity. Man alone is not humanity, nor is
woman alone humanity. Humanity – the music, the synthesis we call
humanity – is a dialectical phenomenon. Man and woman both work to
create humanity, they both help to create humanity. And the way of their
creating it is dialectical: they exist as polar opposites. and the inner
tension between the two creates the energy for movement, for a process
of further growth.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same on every plane. If we go deep down with the physicist
to the atom’s inner structure, then again we find two polar opposites
working there: the negative electricity and the positive electricity.
Because of these two polar opposites, matter is created. If there were
only positive electricity, the</p><p>world would disappear immediately. If there were only negative
electricity, there would be nothing. But negative electricity and
positive electricity create an inner tension, and because of that inner
tension matter exists.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the case with the inner being of man also. This sutra is
concerned with that. We discussed how awareness creates an inner sun.
But this sutra talks about the creation of an inner moon. The sun is
symbolic of the inner positivity and the moon is symbolic of the inner
negativity. The sun is the inner male and the moon is the inner female.
These words are symbolic, and for Indian yoga particularly they are very
meaningful. By “sun” the outer sun is not what is meant, nor by “moon”
the outer moon These two words “sun” and “moon” are used for the inner
universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Indian yoga divides man into two parts: the sun part and the moon
part. Even one breath is known as the sun breath and another breath is
known as the moon breath. And, really, this is one of the deepest
findings. If you stop the moon breath and just breathe from the sun
breath, your body will become hot. And such a great heat can be created
simply by using only one kind of breath that it seems inconceivable in
physiological terms. Among Tibetans there exists a heat yoga in which
breathing is done only through this sun breath. not using the moon
breath at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily the breath is continuously changing, but Western medical
science has not yet taken note of it. Breathing is not a simple process.
It is a dialectical process. You are changing your nostrils within each
hour. Between forty and sixty minutes, approximately, your nostrils
change, and you begin to take your breath from the other nostril; then
again it changes. When you need more heat in the body – for example, if
suddenly you become angry – your sun breath starts.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga says that when you are angry, if you use your moon breath and
stop the sun breath, you cannot be angry at all, because the moon breath
creates a deep coolness inside. The whole body is divided between the
sun and the moon, and the mind is also divided between the sun and the
moon</p><p><br></p><p>So look at man not as one, because nothing can exist as just one.
Everything exists through duality. You are divided into two: you have a
negative part and you have a positive part. The positive is known as the
sun in Indian symbology and the negative as moon. The negative is cool,
silent, still. The positive is hot, vibrant with energy, active. The sun
is the active part in you and the moon the inactive part, and if the
active and the inactive both come to a deep equilibrium you are suddenly
Enlightened. If one is more emphatic: you have an imbalance, but if both
are of equal force, then they balance each other, negate each other, and
the moment both are of equal force, your inner balance is regained and
you reach to a different reality – the reality of the non-dual. That one
non- dual reality can be felt only when both of these dualities in you
are balanced. Then you transcend them.</p><p><br></p><p>In the world we exist as duality. Beyond the world we exist as
non-duality – as one. Think of yourself as a triangle; two angles exist
in the world and the third angle beyond the world. Two angles belong to
this world and one angle belongs to that world – the world of the
Brahman. But if these two are in an imbalance, you cannot go beyond
them. You go beyond them only when they regain balance. This balancing
is Nirvana, this balancing is moksha, this balancing is the centering.
Awareness works to balance this duality. And the moment this duality is
balanced, you cannot be reborn again – you disappear from the world.</p><p>You can be born again and again only if there is an imbalance. If the
balance comes to a totality, if the balance becomes total, it is
impossible to be born again. You disappear from the world; the body
cannot exist any more. Then you cannot re-enter a body again. So first
we will try to understand what this inner sun is and what this inner
moon is, and how they are balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says, “ACCUMULATION OF THE NECTAR OF THE INNER FULL MOON
IS NAIVEDYA,</p><p>THE FOOD OFFERING.” You need a full moon in you to offer to the
Divine as a food. That only can be the food for the Divine – a full moon
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness works in a double way. It creates a sun and it also creates
a moon. We talked about how it creates a sun inside. When you become
aware of whatsoever is happening in you, of the innermost unconscious
activities, you become Enlightened. The very cells of your body become
conscious; you become light. Your consciousness reaches to the very
pores of your body. Just like the rays of the sun reach into the earth,
your inner awareness, once awakened, begins to work in every cell of the
body and every fibre, every nerve of the body. Your whole body is filled
with light. But this is only one part of awareness, this is only one
process of awareness. Rays from your center also go to your periphery,
to the circumference. The more your rays go to the circumference, the
cooler your center becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not know whether you have heard of a particular theory about the
sun – the outer sun; I do not know whether it is right or not, but it is
meaningful in helping to understand the inner reality. They say the sun
at its deepest center is the coolest spot in the solar system; it is not
hot at all. The heat is only on The periphery, on the circumference, not
in the inner center of the sun. Because of helium gas around the sun,
heat is created; because of the helium and its chain explosion of atoms,
heat is created, and then the heat spreads to the solar family.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun has a body and it is the center. The solar family is the body
and the earth belongs to the body as a cell. The heat goes to the solar
family, it spreads. But the sun in itself is a cold thing, absolutely
cold, and at its deepest center, it is the coldest spot in existence. It
should be so because reality exists in polarities. If the sun is the
hottest thing, it must have something inside it which balances the heat.
Take a wheel that is just moving on the street: the wheel moves, but in
the center the hub on which it moves remains still. The movement must
have something non-moving in the center, otherwise movement will not be
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world of manifestations, everything exists within polar
opposites. You are alive because you have death inside. If you had no
death inside, you could not be alive. So do not think that one day it
suddenly happens that death comes to you. It is an inner growth. It is
not something that you meet, that you encounter – no! It is something
toward which you are daily growing. One day the growth is complete, and
you are dead. It is an inner phenomenon. You are alive with a death
center. You cannot be alive without a death center.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing exists without its polar opposite. Life and death are just
two positive and negative realities. So it looks logical, dialectical
also, but it is not yet proved that the sun has at its center a cold
spot, an absolutely cold spot, the polar opposite to the heat on its
circumference. It may be true, it may not be true: that is irrelevant.
But inside it is absolutely true. When you become aware, the heat begins
to travel toward your circumference. Each cell of your body will become
heated, warm, because of the awareness penetrating. The second
counterpart will be that your center of being will become</p><p>cooler and cooler and cooler. That is the moon working. The sun is
the warmth spreading, the light spreading.</p><p><br></p><p>And you must know that light has two qualities – light and warmth.
Heat is just concentrated light; light is nothing but dispersed heat. So
when light travels to your body, every cell will become warm,
enlightened, aware. Sleep is a cold thing, night is a cold thing. That
is why we sleep in the night: it is a cold time. And in the morning,
with the rising sun, everything becomes warm, alive. Then it is
difficult to sleep and easy to be awake.</p><p><br></p><p>When your circumference is cold, when each body cell is cold. asleep,
your center will be a hot spot. Because of that hot spot in the center
you will be sexual, you will be angry, you will be greedy, you will be
everything. Your center will be in a fever This heat begins to travel.
Of course, when heat leaves your center it spreads; and the more it
spreads, the less it is heat and the more it is light.</p><p><br></p><p>The sunrays on the earth are life-giving. They have travelled much.
If you go nearer and nearer to them they will become death-giving,
because then they will not be warm: then they will be just pure
fire.</p><p><br></p><p>As it is, the whole body structure is just cold. You feel heat only
in anger, in sex, in desire, in passion. That is not light, but simply a
feverish phenomenon. Because of this, sex is felt as a release – because
you lose a certain quantity of heat, and you are relieved; you lose a
certain quantity of fever, and you are released.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this, militaries have not allowed their soldiers any
sexual freedom – because if you allow sexual freedom to soldiers. they
cannot fight. Then inner fever is released. If you do not allow them
sexual freedom, their inner fever is accumulated. That accumulated fever
begins to be violent automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why a certain very deep phenomenon, a great riddle of
history, can be solved whenever a society is affluent: when the problem
of food and hunger is solved, a society begins to be sexually free. Only
poor societies can be sexually suppressive. Whenever a society is
affluent, rich you cannot suppress sex – because the food problem has
become solved. Much energy is released, so what to do with it? So an
affluent society will become sexually free.</p><p><br></p><p>An affluent society means a society which has progressed much
technologically. And whenever any civilization comes to a point of
affluence, sexual freedom is bound to be there, and then any less
developed society can win over this higher civilized society. So this
has always been the history: a greater civilization will always be
defeated by a barbaric, uncivilized society.</p><p><br></p><p>India was defeated continuously because of its affluence. Tartars,
Berbers, Huns, Moghuls, Turks, they were all uncivilized societies –
poor, poverty-stricken, sexually suppressed. They had much violence in
them. You can see this in a modern phenomenon: in Vietnam. Americans can
never win. Their youth is sexually free, and they are less violent.
Thus, they cannot win in Vietnam. No affluent society can really win
over any poor society. They may fight for longer periods, but they
cannot win. They can kill a whole country, but they cannot win because
the very fighting spirit is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>America is today one of the most sexually free societies in all
history. America cannot fight; fighting is part of a suppressed sex. The
inner fever must be accumulated in such quantities that you begin</p><p>to be violent. Suppress sex, and you will be violent. That is why
so-called saints are very violent in their behaviour. They are angry,
violent, because of suppressed sex. That fever has to be released in
some way.</p><p><br></p><p>In sex you are releasing a particular amount of energy. They say that
in one sex act you release 120 calories of heat – 120 calories! It is
the same if you run fast for one mile. Then you will release the same
amount of calories – 120. That is why there is much talk about whether
sex can help heart disease. It can help! It releases energy. For persons
who are well fed, it helps to delay heart disease. It releases energy,
but it is not a solution. It is just a temporary arrangement. It just
creates a leakage in your system from which energy is released.</p><p><br></p><p>Any day that you are angry your whole body is heated. It becomes
feverish. The center releases anger: energy comes to the periphery.
Ordinarily it is cold. The periphery is cold ordinarily, and the center
is hot. The reverse will be the case when awareness happens to you. When
you meditate and go deep within, when you become aware of every
activity, everything will take a turn – an about- turn. Your periphery
will not go into anger, not go into sex, not go into greed, not go into
passion. It will lose its coldness – its sleepy coldness. It will become
warm, alive and aware. And because this energy is released to the
periphery every twenty-four hours continuously, you will not need any
anger or any sex.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha doesn’t need anger. It is absolutely useless for him because
the very energy system has changed. He is using his heat for light and
you are using your light for heat. The same fuel can be used to burn
your house and the same fuel can be used to light it. The fuel is the
same, but the direction changes. The inner fuel, the inner energy,
becomes fire – suicidal. It burns you down, and ultimately you are just
ashes. In the end, when death comes near you, you are just ashes.
Everything is burnt out because you used your energy not as a light, but
as a fire.</p><p><br></p><p>It becomes fire if it is concentrated in the center and is released
only temporarily, whenever it is overflowing. In a sudden shock it comes
to the periphery and is released. This is a very chaotic state. You go
on accumulating it inside. Then one day it is overflowing and you have
to throw it.</p><p><br></p><p>We go on rationalizing our actions. When you Get angry you say that
someone has made you angry. No, really, it is that you were ready: you
were overflowing inside. You do not know this because you were not
aware. You were overflowing with a certain amount of energy which was
waiting to be released. When someone abuses you, insults you, and you
become angry, you think that this person is creating anger in you.</p><p><br></p><p>No, this person is simply giving you a situation and opportunity to
release the overflowing energy. In a way, he is your friend, a helper.
If he is not there you will be in a very difficult situation. If no one
is giving you any opportunity to throw your energy, you will project,
you will imagine something, and you will get angry with anything at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>People get angry with their shoes; they will throw them. They can get
angry with the door; they become violent with it. They can be angry with
everything. When no opportunity is given, they can even become angry
with themselves. They will begin to harm themselves or they will create
some substitutes.</p><p>We have created many. Someone is just smoking: we think it is a
simple thing. It is not! Now psychologists say it is a deep violence You
take the smoke in and then throw it out, you take the smoke in and then
throw it out: it helps to release hunger, violence, sex. We have many,
many devices. Persons who are violent will eat more. Just by destroying
the food they are releasing violence.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not have observed it, but when you are loving you cannot eat
much, when you are happy you cannot eat much, when you feel blissful,
you cannot eat too much. Ordinarily it should not be so. It looks
opposite to what we think should be the case. We think that when one is
happy he should eat more. No, a happy person will not eat more. He
cannot eat more because eating is part of violence. A happy person is
not violent; hence. when you are in love you cannot eat very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Two persons, when in love, unmarried, will not eat much. But when
married they will begin to eat more because love has disappeared. Now it
is a violence, and it is related with many deep things. In animals
violence is expressed through teeth, and we are related to animals. When
one animal is violent, angry, the energy comes to the teeth and to the
nails. These are the instruments for being violent for an animal.</p><p><br></p><p>But, still, the same happens with us. When you are violent, your
teeth, your fingers, your nails, are filled with heat, with energy. Now
you have to release it. You can eat, you can use gum, you can smoke, you
can take PAN (a leaf preparation in India which is chewed), because you
need something to crush. So there are people who are the whole day
crushing pan. Their violence is thus released.</p><p><br></p><p>Even by continuously talking, violence is released. Women talk more
than men because men can be violent in other ways while women cannot be.
That is the only reason. They talk more! They talk continuously, they
talk madly, because man has other possibilities for expressing violence
– in the office, with the car, etc. Have you observed a man who is angry
driving his car? He is releasing his anger through the accelerator. The
car will speed up He is releasing anger, and the car is just a medium.
Fifty percent of car accidents are not because of cars but because of
drivers. not because of traffic but because of mental tension.</p><p><br></p><p>But women cannot release anger in so many ways. They have only one:
going on talking. By their doing something with the teeth and the lips,
much is released. A woman who is angry will break more saucers, more
cups, unknowingly. She will be surprised why today everything is just
breaking. It is the unconscious mind. Energy is in the hands. The energy
wants to destroy something. So it is good to have breakable things in
the house. It helps! Then before the husband is back, the wife is
released. If you make everything unbreakable, it will break families.
Breakable things help families to continue. Now these are proven
facts.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have energy in the center which is feverish, not transferred
to the periphery, not used as light for the whole body and for your
whole being, this is bound to happen. Every day you will accumulate
energy, and then you will have to throw it. And this is nonsense! For
the whole life you are doing this: accumulating. throwing; accumulating,
throwing. What are you doing twenty-four hours a day? Just accumulating
energy to throw it. Then when energy is there, the only problem is how
to throw it. So we throw it in sex, in anger, in greed. When energy is
thrown, then the only problem is how to accumulate it</p><p>What sort of life is this? A vicious circle! With awareness the whole
mechanism changes. With awareness, every moment your inner center is
sending its energy to every pore of your body. And your body is not a
small thing. It is a miniature universe: as above, so below. Everybody
is a small universe. And when I say “small”, I feel guilty – because,
really, it is not small. It is as vast as the universe. But because of
our language, there are problems. The universe appears vast and your
body appears small.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the difference between the two? They say that if we can throw
out all space from the earth, if we can compress it and throw out the
space, if the vacant space in it is thrown out, our earth will be just
like a small ball. If we can throw out all the empty space from the
Himalayas, they can be put into a match box. The material is not much,
the matter is not much. The matter is very small, only the emptiness in
it is vast.</p><p><br></p><p>So how to judge whether a thing is big or small? A very small thing
can be blown up to any bigness if we put space in it. If we put as much
space into your body as there is in the earth, you will be like the
earth. So all the differences are of spaces – empty spaces. No
difference is there really.</p><p><br></p><p>But when I say “a small universe”, I mean only this: that everything
that exists in the universe exists in you also. Whatsoever may be the
measure, exactly everything exists in you also. So when your solar
center, your sun, releases energy, it releases it in two ways. Either
you are unconscious: then it releases it into sex, anger. greed and
other diseases. Or if you are conscious, through this consciousness heat
is transformed into light: then it is released as light. Then you are
under a shower of light continuously. Your every pore, your every cell,
is bathed. There is a continuous shower of light. When this happens,
your inner center begins to become cooler and cooler and cooler, and
ultimately it becomes the coldest spot.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus have a myth that Shankara lives on Kailash. Kailash is the
coldest mythological spot – the coldest peak, the highest peak – and it
is always covered with snow. This is just a symbolic way of saying that
you have the coldest spot – a Kailash – in you. But you can know it only
when the heat is transformed into light – never before. And the more you
become aware, the more heat is transformed into light, and you begin to
feel a moon inside. You begin to feel a cool, silent pool.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner full
moon...” In the beginning, of course, you will feel it and miss it. It
is just like the first day’s moon. Then there is the second-day moon,
the third-day moon. You feel it and it is gone; then it grows :again;
then comes the full-moon night. Just like this, this inner spot of
coolness grows. As your consciousness grows, your heat is transformed
into light. As your periphery becomes enlightened, as your each and
every cell is filled with light and becomes aware and awake, this inner
moon grows. Sometimes you feel it and sometimes you miss it. Sometimes
there is an inner cool breeze, and you know something has happened
inside. You feel it, but then you miss it again. Then it goes on
growing. Ultimately, when there is no unconsciousness left and your
total energy has become light. you come to know the full moon.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has talked about this full moon in negative terms because it
is the negative pole. So Buddha says that when this inner silence is
achieved, it is Nirvana. The word is very meaningful in reference to
this sutra. Nirvana means “cessation of the flame”: a lamp is burning
and then the flame disappears.</p><p>When your heat is totally transformed into light, there is no flame.
That is why the moon symbol is used. The moon has light. but no flame.
That is why its light is cool. It is without flame, without fire. Light
is there without any flame. The flame has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>When one first becomes acquainted with the sun, the light becomes
like a flame, burning. hot. So if you analyze the life, the inner life.
of a Buddha or of a Jesus or of a Mahavir, many things will become
apparent which are ordinarily hidden. For example, whenever a person
like Buddha is born, the early life will be very revolutionary – because
the moment one enters the inside, the first experience is a fiery flame.
The more Buddha grows older, the more the inner coolness is felt, the
more the moon becomes perfect. Revolution is lost. Then Buddha’s words
are not revolutionary.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus couldn’t get this opportunity. He was killed when he was still
a revolutionary. That is why, if you compare Buddha’s sayings with
Jesus’ sayings, there is a clear-cut distinction and difference. Jesus’
sayings look like that of a young mall – hot! Buddha’s early sayings are
also like that, but he lived to be eighty. He was not killed.</p><p><br></p><p>There are reasons. And one reason is this: India always knew that
this happens: whenever a person goes in, the first expression is fiery,
revolutionary, rebellious. That is why India never killed anyone. That
is why India could never behave as Greeks behaved with Socrates and Jews
behaved with Jesus. India knew much. It has known many, many such
persons. India knows it is natural that whenever a Buddha enters into
himself the first experience will be revolutionary. He will burst open,
explode into a fiery flame. But then the flame will disappear, and
ultimately there will be only a moon – silent. cool, with no fire but
only light.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was killed. That is why Christianity has still remained
incomplete. Christianity was based on early Jesus – on Jesus when he was
just a flame. That is why Christianity has remained incomplete. Buddhism
is complete. It has known Buddha in all stages. It has known Buddha’s
moon in all stages – from the first day to the full-moon light. This
crucifixion has been unfortunate for the West. It has proved one of the
greatest misfortunes in history that Jesus was killed when he was only
thirty-three, just a flame. The flame would have turned into moonlight,
but the opportunity was not given. And the reason was only this: that
the Jews were not aware of the inner phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>India knew many, many Buddhas, and it is always the case that
whenever someone enters in, he first sees the fire, the flame, and the
revolutionary spirit comes up. But if one goes on in and in, it
dissolves, and then there is only silence – a moonlight silence.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner full
moon...” This silence. this cool silence of the moon, Hindus have called
nectar, the amrit, the elixir. It is not to be found somewhere else. It
is in you. This nectar is in you! Once you are established m this
nectar, once you are in this pool of cool moonlight, then you are a full
moon inside. Then you have known both the polarities: you have known
life, you have known death, you have known the sun, you have known the
moon. You have known both the polarities – life and death. And once you
have known both you have transcended both. That is why it is called the
nectar amrit.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you will not die. Now you are drunk with elixir; you cannot die.
But you will not be alive in the old sense either. You have died in the
old sense; you are reborn in a new moon. Now death will not be a death
and life will not be a life. Now you will be beyond both.</p><p>I have heard about Tanka. the Zen Master, who one day declared before
his disciples that Buddha was never born. He said, “This whole story is
just false; this whole Buddha legend is just false. He was never born.”
His disciples were just perplexed. What did he mean? It seemed he had
gone mad. Every day he had himself been teaching the life of Buddha, his
birth and everything, and suddenly one day he said, “This whole thing is
nonsense. He was Never born.” Then he left the platform and went into
his hut.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples gathered around his hut and asked, “What are you
saying? What about that which you were always teaching us for your whole
life?”</p><p><br></p><p>Tanka said, “Tanka is no more. He was never born, so the whole legend
is false. The teaching of Tanka and your listening to Tanka is just
false. Someone has created a fiction. Do not be deceived.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then they were even more perplexed. It may be that Buddha was not
born, but Tanka was already there standing beside them. Tanka laughed
and said, “That which is born, that which was born. was not Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have two names: “Gautam Siddharth” is the name given by
the parents. Then one day he became Enlightened: his consciousness
flowered, bloomed. Then he used another name – “Gautam the Buddha”:
“Buddha” means the Enlightened One. This second name doesn’t belong to
Gautam at all. Gautam is just a situation. In his place Buddha happened,
and this Buddha did not really happen on the day of his Enlightenment.
He had been always there, but it had been recognized only on this day.
Gautam had come to recognize on that day something which was always
there – the Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>This inner phenomenon is beyond birth and death. It is never born and
never will it die, because that which is born can die and that which is
not born cannot die. Death needs birth as a prerequisite, as a necessary
prerequisite. You cannot die if you are not born. With this inner
phenomenon – when sun and moon are balanced, when the dialectical
process is finished, when the synthesis is complete – you come to feel
in yourself something which is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why this sutra says, “Accumulation of the nectar of the inner
full moon is NAIVEDYA.” Now you have become food yourself. Now you can
offer yourself to the Divine. Now you are food. Now you are eternal. And
why is it called “food”, NAIVEDYA? Because when you are eternal, you can
become food for the eternal. And by “food” the ordinary meaning is also
implied. When you take food in, it becomes one with you. It becomes your
blood, it becomes your bones, it becomes you: you are your food! So when
you have come to know this inner reality, the eternal reality, you can
offer it as food to the universe, to the Existence.</p><p><br></p><p>By this is meant that now you can become the bones of the universe,
you can become the blood of the universe. Now you carl be one with it
just like food becomes one with you. The meeting is complete because you
have become food for the Divine. Then you are naivedya. Then the
offering can be accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot offer your body as the food. It will be food, but for
the vultures, not for the Divine. This cannot be offered as food for the
Divine. Your body comes out of the earth and goes back to the earth. It
can only be eaten by the earth again: “Dust unto dust.’It can only
return to dust, so this body cannot be offered to the Divine.</p><p>One young seeker came to Gautam Buddha. He said, “I have come to
offer myself to you. Accept me”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha asked him, “What are you offering – your body? But that is
already offered and the earth will claim it, so how can you offer it to
me? What are you offering? Tell me exactly!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was confused. He said, “Whatsoever I have I offer to you”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha asked him, “What do you have? What is it that belongs to you?
Do your thoughts belong to you? They belong to the society; your mind
belongs to the society. Your body belongs to your parents, to the earth,
to the sky, to water, to fire, to many things to the five elements. What
do you have that you can offer to me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man could not answer because he had nothing else. He could not
think of anything else, so Buddha said, “Do not offer now. First find
out what you are. And the moment you find it, it is already offered.
Then there is no need to offer.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you find the inner balance that is known from finding the sun
and finding the moon, only when you know both, they balance each other,
and in that balance you escape from duality. And then the third angle of
the triangle is touched. For the first time you are above yourself: you
are the inner self. Now you can look down at yourself – at your sun,
your moon, your body, your soul, your positivity, your negativity, your
male, your female. Now you can look down at yourself – at the whole
world of duality, at multidimensional duality – and now you can become
naivedya, the food offering.</p><p><br></p><p>But now there is no need even to offer: you have already offered. Now
there is no need to ask to be accepted: you are already accepted. You
are one. Just as food becomes one with you, you become one with the
Divine. And by “Divine” I mean the Whole, the Totality, everything – the
very Existence.</p><p><br></p><p>So what to do? Transform heat into light: that is the mantra</p><p><br></p><p>Transform heat into light! Do not use heat as heat: use it as light.
When you think anger is coming to you, close your eyes and meditate on
what anger is. Dig deep inside and find out the source from where it is
coming. What we are doing ordinarily is just the opposite. When we get
angry we begin to think about the object of anger. about who has created
it, and not of the source of anger, from where it is coming. When you
get angry, close your eyes. This is the right moment to meditate. Close
your eyes, go in, and find out from where this anger is coming. Follow
it to the very source. Go deep, and you will come to the source of heat
from where the accumulated energy is bursting forth to go out.</p><p><br></p><p>Observe it; do not indulge in it – because if you indulge in it, it
will be thrown out without being transformed. And do not suppress it –
because if you suppress it, it will be thrown back to the original
source which is overflowing. It cannot absorb it. It will be thrown back
again with a more forceful movement. So do not suppress it and do not
indulge in it. Just be conscious. Move inward to the source. This very
movement slows down the process; this very observation transforms the
quality of anger, because this calm observation is an antidote.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger and calm observation are different phenomena. When this calm
observation enters into anger, it changes the energy, the very chemical
composition of it, and the heat becomes light. That</p><p>is the change: heat becomes light! Then the anger is neither thrown
back to the original source which cannot contain it because it is
overflowing, nor is it thrown to the object in a wastage, a foolish
wastage. Then this energy neither moves out to the object of anger, nor
is It suppressed back to the original source. With observation this
energy becomes diffused. It moves to the periphery of your body as
light. When diffused, it moves as light, and the very anger becomes
ojas, the very anger becomes a light, an inner light.</p><p><br></p><p>So do not be disturbed and disappointed if you have much anger. That
only shows you have much energy. A person born without anger cannot be
transformed. He has no energy. So be happy that you have energy, but do
not misuse it. Energy can be misused, it can be transformed. Energy in
itself is neutral. It will not tell you what to do with it – you have to
decide. This is the secret science of inner alchemy – to change heat
into light, to change coal into diamond, to change baser elements into
gold.</p><p><br></p><p>These are just symbols. Alchemists were not really concerned with
changing baser metals into higher metals, but they had to hide and they
had to make an esoteric, secret symbology, because it was very difficult
in past ages to tank about the inner science and not be murdered or
killed. Jesus was killed: he was an alchemist. And the Christianity that
developed, that followed Jesus, went quite against him. The Christian
Church began to kill and murder those who were again trying alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>This word “alchemy” is very beautiful. Our “chemistry” is born out of
alchemy. The word “chemistry” comes from “alchemy”, but “alchemy” itself
is a very deep and significant word. The word “alchemy” comes from
Egypt. The old name of Egypt was “Khem” and “Al Khem” means “the secret
science of Egypt”. The Egyptians were deep in the alchemy of inner
transformation, in how to transform the inner chemistry.</p><p><br></p><p>Many Egyptian mummies are preserved. They are the oldest, most
ancient mummies, and still scientists are not able to probe into how
they were preserved, why and how they were preserved. But that “why” we
can guess, and our so-called history is nothing but a guess. But about
esoteric things it is always a fallacious guess.</p><p><br></p><p>Why they were preserved is difficult to understand, but more
problematic is the “how”, by what chemical process they were preserved.
They are still as fresh as if they had just died. If there had been any
outer chemical process, our chemistry could know it; we are more
chemically developed than old Egypt. The real thing is that these bodies
were preserved not by any outer chemical process, but by inner
alchemy.</p><p><br></p><p>If your sex energy, which is the source of life, can be transformed
inwardly, then your body can be preserved for any length of time very
easily. If your sex energy is transformed, then your body can be
preserved even for a million years. If the cells of your body lose sex
then the body can be preserved, because birth comes through sex and
death comes through sex. Your freshness, the youngness of the body,
comes through sex, and then deterioration comes through sex.</p><p><br></p><p>These mummies were preserved not just as historians say or as
Egyptologists say, that man has always been thinking in terms of ego to
preserve himself. With the kings, the emperors, for example, that is not
the case. Totally different is the secret. They were preserved only so
that they would be recognized when their souls would be born again. When
a man is born again in another body, if his old body is preserved it
helps to further his inner progress.</p><p>But the old body will be useful only if it was transformed by
alchemy; otherwise it is of no use. If you change your body inwardly,
your body then becomes a laboratory. It is a lab; it is not just a body.
If you have been working inside, experimenting inside, then you know
this body from the inside, not only from the outside.</p><p><br></p><p>We know our bodies only from the outside. Whatsoever the mirror tells
is our only knowledge – it is from the outside.Our knowledge is as if
someone goes around a house and looks at it, and then says, “I know it.”
He has never come in; he has never looked from the inside. We look at
our bodies from the outside, never from the inside.</p><p><br></p><p>If you begin to transform your anger, your sex, you will begin to
look at your body from the inside. Then your body is a great experiment,
a great laboratory, very complex, and then you will want to preserve it
for further growth. When one enters another body, one can learn much
from the old body. It was a great experiment in old Egypt, and many
things were done with the body. They were successful in some things,
failures in some things.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have again a new body, a new laboratory, then if the old is
preserved you will not have to begin again from ABC. If the old is
preserved, this is a record. Death had interrupted, but now you can
proceed. You are not to proceed from the beginning again; you can
proceed from the point where death interrupted in the last life.</p><p><br></p><p>So only Egyptians and Tibetans have preserved bodies for this reason,
but only those bodies which were undergoing deep inner experiments.
Otherwise it is useless to preserve your old body. Other vise you will
not even be able to recognize it.</p><p><br></p><p>Lenin’s body is preserved in Moscow, but he would not even recognize
it. If he were born again, he would not even recognize it! His body was
never used as a laboratory; he never knew it. He was just acquainted
with it in the mirror, never with the body itself.</p><p><br></p><p>This process is alchemical: observe anger, and anger is transformed
into light; observe sex, and sex is transformed into light. Observe any
inner phenomenon which creates heat. Observe it, and through observation
it becomes light. And if your every heat phenomenon is transformed into
light, you will come to feel the inner moon. And when there is no heat
left, then you have accumulated the nectar of the full moon.</p><p><br></p><p>And through this nectar you become immortal. Not in this body, not
with this body: you become immortal because you transcend life and death
both.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are naivedya: then you are a food offering to the Divine –
to the Total.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

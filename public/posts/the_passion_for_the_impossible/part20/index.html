Always remember that he has come through you. He has chosen you as a passage, but he has his own destiny.\nSo giving him sannyas does not mean that you have to structure him. You are not to force anything on him. Sannyas is freedom, so give him freedom to be himself, and be alert not to impose anything. Love him as much as you can, but don’t give your thoughts to him. When you meditate, just persuade him to be with you. Sometimes dance with him.\nAnd children can go into meditation very easily – one just has to know how to help them towards it. They cannot be coerced; that’s impossible. Nobody can ever be coerced into meditation, because coercion is violence. How can one coerce meditation? It comes when it comes. But you can persuade.\nYou can just invite him with tremendous respect. Dance with him, sing with him, sit in silence with him. By and by he will start imbibing it. By and by he will start enjoying the play of it. It cannot be a work for him. It cannot be a serious thing for him – it should not be for anybody. It can only be a play. So help him to play meditation... Let it be a game. Make it a game with him, and by and by he will start loving it. He will start asking you ‘When are we going to play meditation?’ And once he starts learning some ways of silence, then meditation has started working on him, and one day you will see that he is deeper in meditation than you had ever expected. So you have to make a meditative atmosphere.\nTo make somebody a Christian is easy. You have just to impose a certain ideology, a catechism. You have to teach him that God is a trinity, and that Jesus is God’s son and things like that, which\ncan be learnt very easily, and which are very destructive, because the person will never be free to explore. These prejudices will always be there.\nSo when I give sannyas to a child, it is not that you have to impose an ideology on him. You have just to persuade him towards meditativeness. It has nothing to do with any ideology – christian, hindu, mohammedan; they are all irrelevant. It is more like love... it is a feeling. And if he can learn something of it, then it starts growing on its own. One day he will be grateful for it – that you helped him. Right now he cannot understand, so the whole responsibility is yours.\nAnd this is my observation – that if grownups are a little more meditative, children imbibe the spirit very easily. They are so sensitive. They learn whatsoever is there in the atmosphere; they learn the vibe of it. They never bother about what you say. What you are – they always respect that. And they have a very deep perceptivity, a clarity, an intuitiveness. You may be smiling but they will immediately know that it is false, because your eyes will be saying something else – and even more than that, your whole body will be saying something else, your gesture will be saying something else – that you are angry, that you are just pretending, that it is just a policy.\nThey may not be able to formulate it in so many words, but they immediately feel it. So never be untrue with children because they will immediately know it. And once a child comes to know that his parents are untrue, his whole trust is lost. That is his first trust in life, his very base, and if that is lost he will become a sceptic. Then he cannot trust anybody. He cannot trust life, he cannot trust God, because those are very far away things. Even the father deceived, even the mother deceived; even they were not reliable, so what to say of anything else now?\nOnce a child learns... and every child is going to learn; it is impossible to deceive a child. There is no method discovered up to now on how to deceive a child. He simply knows where you are, who you are. It is intuitive – it has nothing to do with his intellect. In fact, the more intellectual he will become, the more he will lose this intuitiveness, and he will not be able to see things as they are. Right now a child is immediate. He simply looks through and through. He looks at you and you are transparent. So never be deceptive.\n[Osho went on to reiterate what he had said to a sannyasin at a previous darshan (see Dance Your Way to God, August 29th, 1976) – that one should not pretend to be a god, but should express anger if that’s what one was feeling; even to hit if necessary, but to hit warmly.]\nLove him and allow him to be a little meditative, and much is possible.\nThat’s why I say it is a great responsibility you have taken upon yourself. I cannot give him sannyas directly. It is through you, via you. So now you have to take care of two sannyasins – yourself and him.\nDeva means divine and koorvita means skill – divine skill. And that’s how I see every human being – as having a deep skill to be divine. One may refine it or not: one may become a great artist in it, or one may leave it undeveloped and crude. It is like a rock, but a little work and it can become a beautiful statue. That skill is everybodys potentiality, but very few people develop it, and it cannot be developed on its own.\nEverybody is born with it, but millions of people never use it, so the faculty goes on shrinking; it remains a seed and never sprouts. Just a little work towards it and much is the payoff, tremendous is the benefit. And there is no greater skill than that. One may be a poet, but then there are only a few seconds in the life of a poet which are beautiful, otherwise he crawls on the earth like everybody else. One can be a painter, but only a few moments are there – rare and far apart – where there are glimpses of the un-known. They come and go; they don’t last. The painter is back on the earth again – and more miserable than ever.\nThat is the misery of great artists, because they have something to compare. They have known a few moments when they were no more of this earth. They have known a few moments when they were part of the stars. They have known a few moments when there was depth and height and they were expansive... when everything was totally different, was a benediction. Then they are thrown back again and again. They don’t know what to do. Back on earth they are more miserable, and the darkness is far darker.\nWhen you know a few moments of happiness, your unhappiness becomes very very penetrating; you can compare. So all great artists have a few moments of what I call the divine. They live in misery, they live in a nightmare; they are almost on the verge of becoming mad.\nSo all other talents are just partial talents. There is only one talent which is total and whole – and that is the talent to become divine. And if you develop it a little, it remains with you. Then whatsoever you do it is there, silently, like a shadow surrounding you, engulfing you... like a glow following you. It becomes your golden aura.\nAnd I can see that you can develop it very easily. The effort is not going to be arduous. But daring and courage will be needed because it is like death. To be in the divine, one has to die – die to the past, die to all that you have been. Become as empty as possible, because only in emptiness is that benediction. Only when you are empty, suddenly you become full. On one side you are empty, on another side something is penetrating you and filling you. It is a death and a resurrection.\nMuch is possible, but one has to be an adventurer.\n[A visitor says: The meditations are going very deep.]\nVery good! You have been getting ready for many lives. This will be your nameForget the past\nas if it were never there, and begin anew from ABC as if you are born today. It is a rebirth. You don’t have any history from now onwards. And count your life as from today. Next year you will be only one year. Move that way, and also feel like a small child. Soon you will start feeling a tremendous blessing.\nYour energy is just vibrating, ready to explode. It can explode any moment, so get ready for it. When it explodes, for the first time you will know what life is. People ordinarily cannot even dream what life is. They cannot even imagine it, because they live in dead shells – windowless, dosed, monads.\nWhen one starts living in innocenceand that’s what sannyas is – to live innocently, to live non-\ncleverly, to live non-calculatingly, to live without mathematics, without logic. Sannyas means saying goodbye to Aristotleto live like a madman, and to live intensely and passionately. And the first\nstep is to drop out of the past.\nPeople drop out of the society – that is not much of a help, because even if you drop out of the society, you carry your past which has been made, cultivated, conditioned by the society. You can go against the society but you are part of the society, sol don’t say drop out of the society – I say drop out of your past. That is the real dropping out of the society.\nAnd the change of your name is just indicative that you disown your past – that now you are no more continuous with the past. Of course you cannot erase it. It is there, but more and more you will see that it belonged to somebody else, that it is as if you had dreamt about it or you had seen a movie or read a novel. But you are totally separate from it.\nThis new name will help – Swami Prem Shreyas.\nPrem means love and shreyas means blessedness – blessedness that comes through love, the blessing that comes through love.\n[Shreyas said he would be leaving for a time to undertake a course in Vipassana. Osho encouraged him to do the course – either here in the ashram or elsewhere as Shreyas had planned, saying it was a beautiful form of meditation.]\nDoing Vipassana there, do it as totally as possible. Put your whole energy into it. Don’t do it lukewarm, because then it is meaningless; you are wasting time. Whatsoever you want to do, do it totally. If you don’t want to do it, or if you want to do it half-heartedly, never do it. It is better not to do a thing than to do it half-heartedly, because half-hearted, it is useless. One starts feeling that one has done it and one has not done it at all.\nSo do it totally. And your sannyas is going to help – half of the work is done already. Go into it headlong. Even if you feel very uncomfortable sometimesIt will be in the beginning, because our\nminds have been conditioned not to relax. We have been trained to be tense. Our whole education is nothing but a training in tension. We have been cultivated to be sceptical, doubtful, suspicious – and all deep meditation needs trust. So just be trusting and go into it.\nDon’t leave any stone unturned; put your whole energy into it. Don’t hold anything. The more energy you put, the more energy will be coming. Man is an infinite source of energy; you cannot exhaust it. You will be given as much energy as you need. Just give a challenge to your life and you will be given energy. It is not there already given. It comes only when you accept a challenge.\nIf you want to become a runner, you will have enough energy to run. You can become the greatest runner in the world, because the potentiality is there. You may never try it – that’s another thing. Whatsoever one wants to do, never think about it in terms of whether one has enough energy to do it or not; never bother about it. If you want to do it, your very passion will create energy.\nPassion is creative; it creates energy. So man can do whatsoever he wants to do, is authentically passionate about. If you feel an urgency, the energy will be there and you will not be tired. You will not feel spent, bored. You will not feel ‘What am I doing here – sitting the whole day? Is it intelligent to do this or am I just a fool?’\nMany times in Vipassana that idea comes to people, and thoughts rush around as they have never rushed before, and the mind becomes very muddled. All the dust of the ages is stirred. The more\nyou try to be silent, the more you feel you are distracted. The more effort you make to keep the mind silent, the more mad and crazier it seems to become – rushing in all directions. But don’t be worried; go on making your effort.\n[Osho said, as he has said before to sannyasins doing Vipassana here, that after seven days the turmoil will pass. The second week will be beautiful, and in the third week problems will rise again because by now one will have become greedy for more]\nSo in the third week you have to remember not to ask, not to expect. Don’t carry the experience that has happened. Live through whatsoever happens, and then drop it. Don’t accumulate it.\nOrdinarily the mind tends to accumulate. The mind is additive; it goes on adding and adding. Whatsoever comes, it goes on collecting, and then whatsoever is beautiful it wants again and again and again; it wants to repeat it. Remember that after the second week, you will want many things to be repeated. And the more you want them, the more distant they will be. The more you hanker, the more you will feel that you are in a wasteland; no sign of any oasis anywhere.\nSo don’t expect. Whatsoever has happened, enjoy it and then say goodbye. When it happens, good. When it is not happening, that too is good. When it happens, move with it, dance with it, delight in it. When it is not happening, don’t think about it. Don’t look back, don’t look ahead. Wait.wait without\nhope, because whatsoever the mind can hope, is going to be wrong.’ And come back. I will be with you .…\n[To a sannyasin who is leaving.]\nVery good. This time has been beautiful. Now start working for me there. Now you are caught completely, catch others!\nJesus says to the fishermen, ‘What are you doing here? How Long are you going to catch fish? Come with me, follow me. I will make you catchers of man.’ And that’s exactly what I am trying to do. First I catch you and then I make you catchers of man. Now you have the net, so and throw it as wide as possible.\nItaly needs much work. And people there are very sensitive – Italy is one of the most sensitive countries to me. So you have to work there.\nThis time your work will have a magic touch – just start working!\n[The girlfriend of the above sannyasin, who is also leaving said she is too small to contain so much happiness.]\nThat’s right! I will make you big! I’m just afraid of [your boyfriend]. If you become too big, he will be crushed [laughter]. But good.very good.\nIn fact it is so. When happiness comes, it is so big – one cannot contain it. There is no way to contain it. It is always extravagant. It is so much it hurts. One cannot contain it – that’s why it becomes a celebration. One has to dance, otherwise one will die!\nHappiness can be so much that it can kill. Love can be so much that it kills. And when it comes, it comes as a tidal wave. It is wild, and you cannot prevent it – it does not listen. You have simply to go with it. It takes you away from yourself. It uproots you from yourself. It is very shattering, but it is tremendously blissful also. It is destructive and creative. It destroys you and it creates you again.\nWhen happiness is there, God is around you. It is like an arrow which goes into the heart and penetrates deeper and deeper and deeper. It is painful, but that pain is sweet. So allow it – don’t try to escape from it. People are afraid of being happy, because of this – that it is so much and they cannot manage it, they cannot control it; it is uncontrollable. It is immeasurable; you cannot measure it. All measurements are of the mind – and it is not of the mind. All measurements are in time and space, and it is beyond time and space. Your body is in space, your mind is in time, and happiness is beyond both. That’s why you cannot contain it and you feel, ‘What to do? It is too much.’\nDance it, sing it... go mad with it! Mm? Good,\n[A sannyasin, who had done the Hypnotherapy group which was present tonight, said she was feeling confused – one moment feeling very good, another feeling that she hadn’t opened up at all during the group.]\nYou may be expecting too much. Nothing is going to happen – that is my promise. Be certain about it [she laughs] and then everything will be good. Hope for the best and expect the worst. Nothing is going to happen, because why should anything happen? What is wrong with things as they are? It is perfectly good. There is no need for anything to happen at all. All that has to happen has happened. It is a perfect world – every moment of it. It is so tremendously perfect that there is no way to improve it. And as I see you all, you are just unnecessarily chasing your tails.\nEnjoy rather than waiting for the result. The very process is beautiful – not the goal. The way is beautiful. Who bothers about the goal? The way is so lovelyLook at the trees by the side of the\nroad and the birds singing and the sunrays, and the hills and the rivers. The road is so beautiful who bothers about the result and the goal, and whether it comes or not? The journey is so beautiful that one would like it to be eternally so – journeying and journeying and journeying.\nBecause people are not daring, they start thinking about the goal. A goal means that they want to stop. That’s exactly what the goal means – that they want to stop. They are fed up with the journey. They want to sit somewhere in darkness – that’s what their goal is.\nThe process is beautiful. God is not a goal. God is the way, the very journey, the very process. God is not the creator – He is the creativity, the very process of it.\nSo remember this, otherwise you will be frustrated again and again. That’s what is happening. One moment you feel good, beautiful, flowing. Suddenly the mind comes in, the achiever’s mind that says, ‘Much more should happen – this is nothing.’ It immediately judges, condemns it, compares and says, ‘Much more should happen. You are not putting your whole heart into it. Go deeper, go higher. Do something. Much more is possible.’ Again frustration settles in. Sometimes you forget your achiever’s mind. You relax, and then you have moments of joy. Then again the mind jumps in and crushes the beauty of that moment.\nThe mind is poisonous. The mind is ambition. The mind is jealousy, envy, comparison. The mind is a constant source of misery. So whenever some flower is there, it jumps on it, crushes and destroys it. It tears apart the petals and starts analysing it. It says ‘This is nothing. A bigger flower was needed.’ It is all nonsense! A flower is a flower. Big or small, enjoy it. The bigger will come out of the enjoyment of the smaller – not by analysing it, destroying it. Then even the smaller will disappear.\nThe next moment is going to be born out of this moment. Live this moment as beautifully as possible, and then the next moment is going to be automatically more beautiful. It will be based on this moment. From where is it going to come? It is going to come out of this moment. The tomorrow will be born out of today. Today is going to parent tomorrow, so why bother about tomorrow?\nBut you must have a very deeply ambitious mind, an achiever’s mind, a result-oriented mind. You cannot love the process – you are always thinking about the result. While painting, you cannot enjoy the painting. You are thinking whether art critics are going to enjoy it or not, whether you are going to sell it at a high price or not, whether it is going to become famous like Picasso’s, Van Gogh’s, or not. While writing a poem you are not enjoying the process of it, the birth of it, the beauty of it, the benediction of it. You are thinking whether you are going to get a nobel prize or not. The result makes everything ugly.\nDrop this and allow more and more moments where you simply enjoy the very process of life. It is a dynamic phenomenon, always flowing – always reaching but never arriving. That is the whole beauty of it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3790","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/>The Passion for the Impossible</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">20</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3790 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Passion_for_the_Impossible/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

much as you can, but don’t give your thoughts to him. When you meditate,
just persuade him to be with you. Sometimes dance with him.</p><p><br></p><p>And children can go into meditation very easily – one just has to
know how to help them towards it. They cannot be coerced; that’s
impossible. Nobody can ever be coerced into meditation, because coercion
is violence. How can one coerce meditation? It comes when it comes. But
you can persuade.</p><p><br></p><p>You can just invite him with tremendous respect. Dance with him, sing
with him, sit in silence with him. By and by he will start imbibing it.
By and by he will start enjoying the play of it. It cannot be a work for
him. It cannot be a serious thing for him – it should not be for
anybody. It can only be a play. So help him to play meditation... Let it
be a game. Make it a game with him, and by and by he will start loving
it. He will start asking you ‘When are we going to play meditation?’ And
once he starts learning some ways of silence, then meditation has
started working on him, and one day you will see that he is deeper in
meditation than you had ever expected. So you have to make a meditative
atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>To make somebody a Christian is easy. You have just to impose a
certain ideology, a catechism. You have to teach him that God is a
trinity, and that Jesus is God’s son and things like that, which</p><p><br></p><p>can be learnt very easily, and which are very destructive, because
the person will never be free to explore. These prejudices will always
be there.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I give sannyas to a child, it is not that you have to impose
an ideology on him. You have just to persuade him towards
meditativeness. It has nothing to do with any ideology – christian,
hindu, mohammedan; they are all irrelevant. It is more like love... it
is a feeling. And if he can learn something of it, then it starts
growing on its own. One day he will be grateful for it – that you helped
him. Right now he cannot understand, so the whole responsibility is
yours.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is my observation – that if grownups are a little more
meditative, children imbibe the spirit very easily. They are so
sensitive. They learn whatsoever is there in the atmosphere; they learn
the vibe of it. They never bother about what you say. What you are –
they always respect that. And they have a very deep perceptivity, a
clarity, an intuitiveness. You may be smiling but they will immediately
know that it is false, because your eyes will be saying something else –
and even more than that, your whole body will be saying something else,
your gesture will be saying something else – that you are angry, that
you are just pretending, that it is just a policy.</p><p><br></p><p>They may not be able to formulate it in so many words, but they
immediately feel it. So never be untrue with children because they will
immediately know it. And once a child comes to know that his parents are
untrue, his whole trust is lost. That is his first trust in life, his
very base, and if that is lost he will become a sceptic. Then he cannot
trust anybody. He cannot trust life, he cannot trust God, because those
are very far away things. Even the father deceived, even the mother
deceived; even they were not reliable, so what to say of anything else
now?</p><p><br></p><p>Once a child learns... and every child is going to learn; it is
impossible to deceive a child. There is no method discovered up to now
on how to deceive a child. He simply knows where you are, who you are.
It is intuitive – it has nothing to do with his intellect. In fact, the
more intellectual he will become, the more he will lose this
intuitiveness, and he will not be able to see things as they are. Right
now a child is immediate. He simply looks through and through. He looks
at you and you are transparent. So never be deceptive.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho went on to reiterate what he had said to a sannyasin at a
previous darshan (see Dance Your Way to God, August 29th, 1976) – that
one should not pretend to be a god, but should express anger if that’s
what one was feeling; even to hit if necessary, but to hit warmly.]</p><p><br></p><p>Love him and allow him to be a little meditative, and much is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say it is a great responsibility you have taken upon
yourself. I cannot give him sannyas directly. It is through you, via
you. So now you have to take care of two sannyasins – yourself and
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and koorvita means skill – divine skill. And that’s
how I see every human being – as having a deep skill to be divine. One
may refine it or not: one may become a great artist in it, or one may
leave it undeveloped and crude. It is like a rock, but a little work and
it can become a beautiful statue. That skill is everybodys potentiality,
but very few people develop it, and it cannot be developed on its
own.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is born with it, but millions of people never use it, so
the faculty goes on shrinking; it remains a seed and never sprouts. Just
a little work towards it and much is the payoff, tremendous is the
benefit. And there is no greater skill than that. One may be a poet, but
then there are only a few seconds in the life of a poet which are
beautiful, otherwise he crawls on the earth like everybody else. One can
be a painter, but only a few moments are there – rare and far apart –
where there are glimpses of the un-known. They come and go; they don’t
last. The painter is back on the earth again – and more miserable than
ever.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the misery of great artists, because they have something to
compare. They have known a few moments when they were no more of this
earth. They have known a few moments when they were part of the stars.
They have known a few moments when there was depth and height and they
were expansive... when everything was totally different, was a
benediction. Then they are thrown back again and again. They don’t know
what to do. Back on earth they are more miserable, and the darkness is
far darker.</p><p><br></p><p>When you know a few moments of happiness, your unhappiness becomes
very very penetrating; you can compare. So all great artists have a few
moments of what I call the divine. They live in misery, they live in a
nightmare; they are almost on the verge of becoming mad.</p><p><br></p><p>So all other talents are just partial talents. There is only one
talent which is total and whole – and that is the talent to become
divine. And if you develop it a little, it remains with you. Then
whatsoever you do it is there, silently, like a shadow surrounding you,
engulfing you... like a glow following you. It becomes your golden
aura.</p><p><br></p><p>And I can see that you can develop it very easily. The effort is not
going to be arduous. But daring and courage will be needed because it is
like death. To be in the divine, one has to die – die to the past, die
to all that you have been. Become as empty as possible, because only in
emptiness is that benediction. Only when you are empty, suddenly you
become full. On one side you are empty, on another side something is
penetrating you and filling you. It is a death and a resurrection.</p><p><br></p><p>Much is possible, but one has to be an adventurer.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: The meditations are going very deep.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good! You have been getting ready for many lives. This will be
your name<span class=s4></span>Forget the past</p><p>as if it were never there, and begin anew from ABC as if you are born
today. It is a rebirth. You don’t have any history from now onwards. And
count your life as from today. Next year you will be only one year. Move
that way, and also feel like a small child. Soon you will start feeling
a tremendous blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Your energy is just vibrating, ready to explode. It can explode any
moment, so get ready for it. When it explodes, for the first time you
will know what life is. People ordinarily cannot even dream what life
is. They cannot even imagine it, because they live in dead shells –
windowless, dosed, monads.</p><p><br></p><p>When one starts living in innocence<span class=s4></span>and that’s
what sannyas is – to live innocently, to live non-</p><p>cleverly, to live non-calculatingly, to live without mathematics,
without logic. Sannyas means saying goodbye to Aristotle<span class=s4></span>to live like a madman, and to live intensely and
passionately. And the first</p><p>step is to drop out of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>People drop out of the society – that is not much of a help, because
even if you drop out of the society, you carry your past which has been
made, cultivated, conditioned by the society. You can go against the
society but you are part of the society, sol don’t say drop out of the
society – I say drop out of your past. That is the real dropping out of
the society.</p><p><br></p><p>And the change of your name is just indicative that you disown your
past – that now you are no more continuous with the past. Of course you
cannot erase it. It is there, but more and more you will see that it
belonged to somebody else, that it is as if you had dreamt about it or
you had seen a movie or read a novel. But you are totally separate from
it.</p><p><br></p><p>This new name will help – Swami Prem Shreyas.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love and shreyas means blessedness – blessedness that
comes through love, the blessing that comes through love.</p><p><br></p><p>[Shreyas said he would be leaving for a time to undertake a course in
Vipassana. Osho encouraged him to do the course – either here in the
ashram or elsewhere as Shreyas had planned, saying it was a beautiful
form of meditation.]</p><p><br></p><p>Doing Vipassana there, do it as totally as possible. Put your whole
energy into it. Don’t do it lukewarm, because then it is meaningless;
you are wasting time. Whatsoever you want to do, do it totally. If you
don’t want to do it, or if you want to do it half-heartedly, never do
it. It is better not to do a thing than to do it half-heartedly, because
half-hearted, it is useless. One starts feeling that one has done it and
one has not done it at all.</p><p><br></p><p>So do it totally. And your sannyas is going to help – half of the
work is done already. Go into it headlong. Even if you feel very
uncomfortable sometimes<span class=s4></span>It will be in the
beginning, because our</p><p>minds have been conditioned not to relax. We have been trained to be
tense. Our whole education is nothing but a training in tension. We have
been cultivated to be sceptical, doubtful, suspicious – and all deep
meditation needs trust. So just be trusting and go into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t leave any stone unturned; put your whole energy into it. Don’t
hold anything. The more energy you put, the more energy will be coming.
Man is an infinite source of energy; you cannot exhaust it. You will be
given as much energy as you need. Just give a challenge to your life and
you will be given energy. It is not there already given. It comes only
when you accept a challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to become a runner, you will have enough energy to run.
You can become the greatest runner in the world, because the
potentiality is there. You may never try it – that’s another thing.
Whatsoever one wants to do, never think about it in terms of whether one
has enough energy to do it or not; never bother about it. If you want to
do it, your very passion will create energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Passion is creative; it creates energy. So man can do whatsoever he
wants to do, is authentically passionate about. If you feel an urgency,
the energy will be there and you will not be tired. You will not feel
spent, bored. You will not feel ‘What am I doing here – sitting the
whole day? Is it intelligent to do this or am I just a fool?’</p><p><br></p><p>Many times in Vipassana that idea comes to people, and thoughts rush
around as they have never rushed before, and the mind becomes very
muddled. All the dust of the ages is stirred. The more</p><p><br></p><p>you try to be silent, the more you feel you are distracted. The more
effort you make to keep the mind silent, the more mad and crazier it
seems to become – rushing in all directions. But don’t be worried; go on
making your effort.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho said, as he has said before to sannyasins doing Vipassana here,
that after seven days the turmoil will pass. The second week will be
beautiful, and in the third week problems will rise again because by now
one will have become greedy for more<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>So in the third week you have to remember not to ask, not to expect.
Don’t carry the experience that has happened. Live through whatsoever
happens, and then drop it. Don’t accumulate it.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily the mind tends to accumulate. The mind is additive; it
goes on adding and adding. Whatsoever comes, it goes on collecting, and
then whatsoever is beautiful it wants again and again and again; it
wants to repeat it. Remember that after the second week, you will want
many things to be repeated. And the more you want them, the more distant
they will be. The more you hanker, the more you will feel that you are
in a wasteland; no sign of any oasis anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t expect. Whatsoever has happened, enjoy it and then say
goodbye. When it happens, good. When it is not happening, that too is
good. When it happens, move with it, dance with it, delight in it. When
it is not happening, don’t think about it. Don’t look back, don’t look
ahead. Wait.<span class=s4></span>wait without</p><p>hope, because whatsoever the mind can hope, is going to be wrong.’
And come back. I will be with you .…</p><p>[To a sannyasin who is leaving.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good. This time has been beautiful. Now start working for me
there. Now you are caught completely, catch others!</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says to the fishermen, ‘What are you doing here? How Long are
you going to catch fish? Come with me, follow me. I will make you
catchers of man.’ And that’s exactly what I am trying to do. First I
catch you and then I make you catchers of man. Now you have the net, so
and throw it as wide as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Italy needs much work. And people there are very sensitive – Italy is
one of the most sensitive countries to me. So you have to work
there.</p><p><br></p><p>This time your work will have a magic touch – just start working!</p><p><br></p><p>[The girlfriend of the above sannyasin, who is also leaving said she
is too small to contain so much happiness.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s right! I will make you big! I’m just afraid of [your
boyfriend]. If you become too big, he will be crushed [laughter]. But
good.<span class=s4></span>very good.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it is so. When happiness comes, it is so big – one cannot
contain it. There is no way to contain it. It is always extravagant. It
is so much it hurts. One cannot contain it – that’s why it becomes a
celebration. One has to dance, otherwise one will die!</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness can be so much that it can kill. Love can be so much that
it kills. And when it comes, it comes as a tidal wave. It is wild, and
you cannot prevent it – it does not listen. You have simply to go with
it. It takes you away from yourself. It uproots you from yourself. It is
very shattering, but it is tremendously blissful also. It is destructive
and creative. It destroys you and it creates you again.</p><p><br></p><p>When happiness is there, God is around you. It is like an arrow which
goes into the heart and penetrates deeper and deeper and deeper. It is
painful, but that pain is sweet. So allow it – don’t try to escape from
it. People are afraid of being happy, because of this – that it is so
much and they cannot manage it, they cannot control it; it is
uncontrollable. It is immeasurable; you cannot measure it. All
measurements are of the mind – and it is not of the mind. All
measurements are in time and space, and it is beyond time and space.
Your body is in space, your mind is in time, and happiness is beyond
both. That’s why you cannot contain it and you feel, ‘What to do? It is
too much.’</p><p><br></p><p>Dance it, sing it... go mad with it! Mm? Good,</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who had done the Hypnotherapy group which was present
tonight, said she was feeling confused – one moment feeling very good,
another feeling that she hadn’t opened up at all during the group.]</p><p><br></p><p>You may be expecting too much. Nothing is going to happen – that is
my promise. Be certain about it [she laughs] and then everything will be
good. Hope for the best and expect the worst. Nothing is going to
happen, because why should anything happen? What is wrong with things as
they are? It is perfectly good. There is no need for anything to happen
at all. All that has to happen has happened. It is a perfect world –
every moment of it. It is so tremendously perfect that there is no way
to improve it. And as I see you all, you are just unnecessarily chasing
your tails.</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy rather than waiting for the result. The very process is
beautiful – not the goal. The way is beautiful. Who bothers about the
goal? The way is so lovely<span class=s4></span>Look at the trees by
the side of the</p><p>road and the birds singing and the sunrays, and the hills and the
rivers. The road is so beautiful who bothers about the result and the
goal, and whether it comes or not? The journey is so beautiful that one
would like it to be eternally so – journeying and journeying and
journeying.</p><p><br></p><p>Because people are not daring, they start thinking about the goal. A
goal means that they want to stop. That’s exactly what the goal means –
that they want to stop. They are fed up with the journey. They want to
sit somewhere in darkness – that’s what their goal is.</p><p><br></p><p>The process is beautiful. God is not a goal. God is the way, the very
journey, the very process. God is not the creator – He is the
creativity, the very process of it.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember this, otherwise you will be frustrated again and again.
That’s what is happening. One moment you feel good, beautiful, flowing.
Suddenly the mind comes in, the achiever’s mind that says, ‘Much more
should happen – this is nothing.’ It immediately judges, condemns it,
compares and says, ‘Much more should happen. You are not putting your
whole heart into it. Go deeper, go higher. Do something. Much more is
possible.’ Again frustration settles in. Sometimes you forget your
achiever’s mind. You relax, and then you have moments of joy. Then again
the mind jumps in and crushes the beauty of that moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is poisonous. The mind is ambition. The mind is jealousy,
envy, comparison. The mind is a constant source of misery. So whenever
some flower is there, it jumps on it, crushes and destroys it. It tears
apart the petals and starts analysing it. It says ‘This is nothing. A
bigger flower was needed.’ It is all nonsense! A flower is a flower. Big
or small, enjoy it. The bigger will come out of the enjoyment of the
smaller – not by analysing it, destroying it. Then even the smaller will
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The next moment is going to be born out of this moment. Live this
moment as beautifully as possible, and then the next moment is going to
be automatically more beautiful. It will be based on this moment. From
where is it going to come? It is going to come out of this moment. The
tomorrow will be born out of today. Today is going to parent tomorrow,
so why bother about tomorrow?</p><p><br></p><p>But you must have a very deeply ambitious mind, an achiever’s mind, a
result-oriented mind. You cannot love the process – you are always
thinking about the result. While painting, you cannot enjoy the
painting. You are thinking whether art critics are going to enjoy it or
not, whether you are going to sell it at a high price or not, whether it
is going to become famous like Picasso’s, Van Gogh’s, or not. While
writing a poem you are not enjoying the process of it, the birth of it,
the beauty of it, the benediction of it. You are thinking whether you
are going to get a nobel prize or not. The result makes everything
ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this and allow more and more moments where you simply enjoy the
very process of life. It is a dynamic phenomenon, always flowing –
always reaching but never arriving. That is the whole beauty of it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

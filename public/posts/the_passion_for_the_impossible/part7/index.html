Divinity is our essence. We may have forgotten it, but we cannot lose it. We may have become completely oblivious of it, but there is no way to get away from it. It is not accidental, it is essential. Anything accidental can be taken away from you. You may have it, you may not have it – it depends. But the essential is that which cannot be taken away from you. You have to have it. At the most you can become forgetful about it, or you can remember it. And that is the only difference between an enlightened person and an unenlightened person.\nThe difference is not in their nature. The difference is in their remembrance. One remembers, recognises oneself and who one is – and the other is in a stupor. Of course he is also that because there is no other way to be. God is the commonmost thing, the universal essence of everybody and everything. Not only persons but things are also divine. That is the meaning of Deva Navaneet. Navaneet has another meaning also.\nIt means as out of milk you can ,create curd, out of curd you can create butter, and out of butter, in India we create ghee, but out of ghee you cannot create anything – that is the last flowering – so navaneet means also ghee, the last flowering of being. There is no beyond to it. It is the beyond. And there is nowhere to fall back. Out of milk you can create curd, but out of curd you cannot create milk. Out of curd you can create butter, but out of butter you cannot create curd. There is no way to fall back. You are always going ahead. Whatsoever is learned, is learned.\nThere is no way to unlearn it. And whatsoever you have become, you have become.\nOnly evolution exists. There is nothing like devolution. That too is also the meaning, and both the meanings are beautiful.\n[The new sannyasin says he is a doctor but trailing for group-leading bio-energetics.]\nBio-energetics? Very good. That’s a good combination. You can bring all your understanding about the human body and physiology into your bio-energetic training, and it will be a beautiful combination. It is always good to bring two branches of knowledge together; then something new happens. It is like cross-breeding. Original insights come only when two branches of knowledge come together.\nFor example, if a poet becomes a mathematician, something new is going to happen. Or if a mathematician becomes a physicist, then something new is going to happen. If a chemist becomes a poet, it is bound to impress his poetry, and there will be something new which no other poet can do. If you know two branches of knowledge, then deep in your heart, a synthesis arises. There is no need to work it out. It happens on its own.\nIn the beginning sometimes it may look like chaos, because when you are moving in two directions, they have very different gestalts. Their working patterns are different, their structure is different, their world views are different. So sometimes it is very chaotic – that’s why people don’t want to jump from one line to another. They stick to one line – that is convenient. But if you can take the chaos with ease, something new will be born in you.\nAll new insights have happened down the ages only because a few people moved into different branches for which they were not really trained. All pioneers are amateurs. They were trained for something else; they were meant to be something else. Then they entered into something for which they had no training, so their old training and their new direction combined together makes something beautiful flower. So, very good.\nBut I would suggest that you don’t stop practising medicine. Continue. Practise medicine also by the side, otherwise you will lose contact. Medical science is such a growing science that if you lose contact, you lose contact. It is not something very static, very stable. Each six months things are going so fast. Keep in contact and go on learning bio-energetics, and something beautiful will come out of it.\nAnd I’m going to be there also, inside you. You have invited danger from now on!\n[An eight-year-old sannyasin asks through the translator: He would like to know what you are doing here... what thing in particular.]\nDestroying people! – because that is the only way to create them. I am a murderer – I kill people! But then one has to revive them.\nWould you like to become a murderer? Next time you come I will teach you some tricks!\n[A sannyasin newly-arrived back from the States to live here permanently says: I’m glad to be here.]\nMm, this is your home. You were searching for it, and you have found it. Forget the whole world – now this is going to be your world. It is a small world, but very deep. If you allow, it will transform you. Just be at home... relax and become part of the ashram.\n[A visitor says: I just came to see you and now I am afraid.]\nAfraid? That I can see. Come a little closer! Fear is natural...\nYou are ready, that’s why you are afraid. People become afraid only when they are ready, when they feel that something can happen – that they can be transformed. Ordinarily people don’t become afraid. So take the jump – become a sannyasin. Why are you...? It will help.\nWhenever you are afraid of something, do it [laughter]. That’s the only way to get rid of it. Otherwise I will haunt you in Germany, and you will be in trouble! Close your eyes and become a sannyasin. You don’t have to be afraid. Now you are going to become mad, so...\nNow there will be no fear – I will be with you. This will be your name: Ma Prem Kadambari.\nPrem means love and kadambari means wine – wine of love. It is one of the most beautiful names in India, and that’s what is your potentiality. Right now you are just grapes, but soon you will become wine. And love is going to transform you.\nPeople who are afraid are the people who are capable of tremendous love. Fear is a negative aspect of love. If love is not allowed to flow, it becomes fear. If love is allowed to flow, fear disappears. That’s why only in moments of love there is no fear. If you love a person, suddenly fear disappears. Lovers are the only people who are fearless. Even death makes no problem. Only lovers can die in tremendous silence and fearlessness.\nBut it always happens that the more you love, the more you feel fear. That’s why women feel more fear than men, because they have more potentiality for love. In this world there are very few possibilities to actualise your love, so it remains hanging around you. And if any potentiality remains hanging, it turns to its opposite. It can become jealousy; that too is part of fear. It can become possessiveness; that too is part of fear. It can become even hatred; that too is part of fear. So be more and more loving. Love unconditionally, and love in as many ways as possible. One can love in millions of ways.\nOne can just love a stranger passing on the road. One can just feel love for him, and go on one s way. There is no need to even talk. There is no need to communicate it. One can simply feel and go on one’s own way. One can love a rock. One can love the trees, one can love the sky, the stars. One can love the friend, the husband, the children, the father, the mother. One can love in millions of ways.\nOnce your whole energy is functioning as a love, the wine will start dripping out of it. And when love is flowing, prayer arises. Prayer is the wine. Love is like grapes.\n[The new sannyasin says she is a doctor.]\nYou will become capable. You just need a little more love flowing. It works more than any medicine. Up to now medical science has not been able to find anything more potent than love. If you can be\nloving to the patient, you will be tremendously successful, because medicines are secondary. They are still not primary. Therapy is a function of love. Love is therapeutic.\nYou can even sometimes just give water to the patient with deep love, deep compassion, and it will function. There have been many experiments in which the proportion is almost the same. You give the medicine; it works. You give water; it works the same way – what you call a placebo. But if it is given with love and the patient trusts, it functions. When you love, you create trust.\nAnd it is one of the most beautiful professions to choose because it allows you to be loving. It becomes ugly, it has become ugly, because it has become a sort of exploitation. You are exploiting people’s diseases, illnesses. That’s why one feels it is a little heavy. Otherwise it is one of the most beautiful professions – if you love. You may not become very rich if you love, but you will feel tremendously enriched inside.\nSo if you don’t bother about money too much, there is no problem. Then you can help many people to be healthy and whole. Their prayers will be for you,. and their hearts will be for you and you will be tremendously fulfilled. But if you make money the consideration, then it is one of the worst professions. In a better world, money should not be a relationship at all between the doctor and the patient because it destroys love. Money is the most anti-love thing in the world. And when you are treating a patient for money, of course the patient becomes irrelevant. He is just a number; he has no being in him. Because he pays you, you treat him, but you become impersonal, indifferent.\nIn fact, deep down, if the patient is very rich, in your unconscious you want him to remain ill a little longer. It creates guilt also, because if a rich patient is cured easily, he will not be paying too much. So if the patient is rich, the unconscious desire remains in the doctor to let him linger a little. This is very dangerous, but it is so.\nSo make it more meditative, make it more loving. Whatsoever time you are here for, meditate as deeply as possible. Your meditation has started. I have started working on you. Forget everything, and let your love grow. By the time you go back, you will be able to have a totally different outlook about your profession. I cannot guarantee that that will help you to earn much money, but money is not a consideration. You can always get enough for your needs, but that’s all... more than enough. But make it a function of your loving heart. Let it be a service, and then you will see that it is helping you. It will help you to grow.\nWhat more can you expect? If you are serving human beings, you are doing one of the best things that can be done. Somebody is painting on the canvas, somebody is writing a poem, and somebody is playing on a musical instrument – you are playing on human beings, you are painting on a human canvas. You are doing something with the most evolved phenomenon in the world. One should be happy. But a different vision is needed, that’s all. It will come.…\n[A sannyasin, said through an interpreter that she was concerned that by having relationships with women, she was running away from men. She asked for Osho’s help.\nOsho checked her energy.]\nNothing is wrong. You can continue. Don’t have any condemnatory attitude about it. You are not trying to escape from men – your energy simply fits with women. And if any day you are going to\nmake any relationship with a man, it will be possible only when you have passed through and grown up from this relationship. So it is not against men. It is just a growth situation for you. Simply go into it as deeply as possible and drop all negative attitudes; they are very ingrained.\nLove is always beautiful, whatsoever the form. And don’t bother too much about what the society says. Your energy fits completely with the feminine energy, so continue. Later on I can see that you may grow out of it, and then you will be able to be related to a man; not before it. But there is no hurry. Don’t be worried about it.\n[The Encounter group was present tonight. The group leader says: It hasn’t come together as a group. They are more like many individuals – but it’s working. It’s going well.]\nMm, mm, that too happens sometimes, but that has its own beauty. Sometimes a group becomes an orchestra and gathers a collective soul. That has its own beauty. Sometimes the group remains very individualistic, all solo players. Each may be doing perfectly well on his own, but there is no group soul. That too is good. And one should never try to force anything. If it is growing into a group soul, good. If it is going separate ways, everybody is growing separately, that too is good. That’s what their need is.\nTwo types of people can fall into a group unity. One, very childish people, who don’t have much of the ego in them, who don’t have much intellectual scepticism in them... simple, innocent people, a little childish. They immediately form a group soul. There are people who have got completely fed up with their intellect, with their egos – super-intellectuals. Then too they drop their egos and become part of a group soul. And all who are in between will remain individuals. They are not childish, they are not yet so fed up with their intellect and their ego. They will remain individuals. But that’s what their need is at the moment. So your work is just to help them be whatsoever they can be. Whatsoever is there, you have to help it to come up. Mm? Good.\n[A group member said she felt she was holding on to something but she did not know what it was. Osho checked her energy.]\nYou continue to play games – that is the real problem. But it comes only when something really penetrates and touches the problem. You can go on playing games of being open, flowing. You can act – and you have been doing that. You enjoyed doing that, but this time you failed in acting – and that’s very good.\nNow you have become aware of something, a stagnant energy, but now something can be done. Once we know where the problem is, things become easy.\n[Osho then gives her sannyas.]\nAnand means bliss, blissful, and alka in indian mythology is the city of gods. In heaven where the gods live, that city is called alka. The name will mean blissful city of gods.\nSo forget the old and become blissful. There is no problem – just a small something blocking the way. It will go. By tomorrow morning you will feel totally different.…\n[A group member says he feels stuck: In my head. I think before I do.]\nSo start doing a few things without thinking. That is the only way to break the habit. Just anything will be helpful! You may be sitting – just give yourself a jerk, and then think later. Let the jerk happen first and then see afterwards. You are going somewhere; turn around. Do a few crazy things, because nothing puts the mind into its place like crazy things. You will enjoy it very much, because if the mind gets into the habit of always thinking before doing, then you miss life. Then nothing is spontaneous because the mind always comes before you can act. It gives you a rehearsal.\nYou think pro and con, and by the time you decide, the moment is lost, the moment is gone. Then you are never spontaneous. You always miss the real time for anything to happen. You will always be late. You will decide, ‘Now I should do it,’ but then it is too late. Life is going so fast – thinkers never accomplish anything; they only think. I am not against thinking, but doing is more primary. When you have a luxurious moment and nothing to do, sit in a chair and enjoy thinking; nothing is wrong in it. But life should not be decided by thinking.\nIf you come across a beautiful woman and you start thinking about whether to fall in love or not, you will miss. By the time you will be able to decide, you will be old and the woman will be gone, dead, or may have four children. Life needs decisiveness each moment.\nSo just try. Anything will do just to get out of the habit. Otherwise you will get more and more into thinking. And getting more and more into the head is like getting more and more into the grave. But nothing to be worried about – the head will disappear.\n[To a sannyasin who had returned from the West.]\nJust be here – and to be here without any questions is more helpful. The questioning mind is concerned too much with its questions, and goes on missing many things. When there is no questioning in the mind, you cannot miss anything; you are simply okay.\nA question closes you, allows you a small slit of opening through the question, but otherwise it closes you. It is like a keyhole. Without any question, you are just under the sky. And that is the difference between philosophical enquiry and religious enquiry.\nA philosophical enquiry is with questions. It is based on curiosity. Some questions are haunting you. You are restless because of them; you want some answer so you can rest. And those questions won’t allow you to rest unless you find the answer. Of course answers are never found. Whatsoever we call an answer is only a temporary thing. Again out of one answer, ten questions arise. And it goes on that way. So each answer simply proves that there are more questions to be asked, nothing else. It never solves any question – it only creates more questions. This is the difference between religious enquiry and philosophical enquiry.\nA religious enquiry is a non-questioning attitude. In India we call it satsang – just being in the presence of the master... nothing to ask. Just being in the presence... just drinking and soaking in the presence. Then one starts growing towards the answer.\nIf you ask questions you will get many answers, but never the answer. And unless the answer is arrived at, everything is futile. When you don’t ask, in that non-questioning attitude, in that trust, in that non-doubting, something starts happening which by and by becomes the answer.\nSo this is the paradox. If you ask the questions, you will never come to the answer. If you don’t ask the questions, you are certain to come to the answer.\nSo this is very good. Just be here... be as you are. Just enjoy me, delight in me. Celebrate me and be happy for no reason at all.\nLife is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3324","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/>The Passion for the Impossible</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3324 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Passion_for_the_Impossible/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

world views are different. So sometimes it is very chaotic – that’s why
people don’t want to jump from one line to another. They stick to one
line – that is convenient. But if you can take the chaos with ease,
something new will be born in you.</p><p><br></p><p>All new insights have happened down the ages only because a few
people moved into different branches for which they were not really
trained. All pioneers are amateurs. They were trained for something
else; they were meant to be something else. Then they entered into
something for which they had no training, so their old training and
their new direction combined together makes something beautiful flower.
So, very good.</p><p><br></p><p>But I would suggest that you don’t stop practising medicine.
Continue. Practise medicine also by the side, otherwise you will lose
contact. Medical science is such a growing science that if you lose
contact, you lose contact. It is not something very static, very stable.
Each six months things are going so fast. Keep in contact and go on
learning bio-energetics, and something beautiful will come out of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>And I’m going to be there also, inside you. You have invited danger
from now on!</p><p><br></p><p>[An eight-year-old sannyasin asks through the translator: He would
like to know what you are doing here... what thing in particular.]</p><p><br></p><p>Destroying people! – because that is the only way to create them. I
am a murderer – I kill people! But then one has to revive them.</p><p><br></p><p>Would you like to become a murderer? Next time you come I will teach
you some tricks!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin newly-arrived back from the States to live here
permanently says: I’m glad to be here.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, this is your home. You were searching for it, and you have found
it. Forget the whole world – now this is going to be your world. It is a
small world, but very deep. If you allow, it will transform you. Just be
at home... relax and become part of the ashram.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: I just came to see you and now I am afraid.]</p><p><br></p><p>Afraid? That I can see. Come a little closer! Fear is natural...</p><p>You are ready, that’s why you are afraid. People become afraid only
when they are ready, when they feel that something can happen – that
they can be transformed. Ordinarily people don’t become afraid. So take
the jump – become a sannyasin. Why are you...? It will help.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are afraid of something, do it [laughter]. That’s the
only way to get rid of it. Otherwise I will haunt you in Germany, and
you will be in trouble! Close your eyes and become a sannyasin. You
don’t have to be afraid. Now you are going to become mad, so...</p><p><br></p><p>Now there will be no fear – I will be with you. This will be your
name: Ma Prem Kadambari.</p><p>Prem means love and kadambari means wine – wine of love. It is one of
the most beautiful names in India, and that’s what is your potentiality.
Right now you are just grapes, but soon you will become wine. And love
is going to transform you.</p><p><br></p><p>People who are afraid are the people who are capable of tremendous
love. Fear is a negative aspect of love. If love is not allowed to flow,
it becomes fear. If love is allowed to flow, fear disappears. That’s why
only in moments of love there is no fear. If you love a person, suddenly
fear disappears. Lovers are the only people who are fearless. Even death
makes no problem. Only lovers can die in tremendous silence and
fearlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>But it always happens that the more you love, the more you feel fear.
That’s why women feel more fear than men, because they have more
potentiality for love. In this world there are very few possibilities to
actualise your love, so it remains hanging around you. And if any
potentiality remains hanging, it turns to its opposite. It can become
jealousy; that too is part of fear. It can become possessiveness; that
too is part of fear. It can become even hatred; that too is part of
fear. So be more and more loving. Love unconditionally, and love in as
many ways as possible. One can love in millions of ways.</p><p><br></p><p>One can just love a stranger passing on the road. One can just feel
love for him, and go on one s way. There is no need to even talk. There
is no need to communicate it. One can simply feel and go on one’s own
way. One can love a rock. One can love the trees, one can love the sky,
the stars. One can love the friend, the husband, the children, the
father, the mother. One can love in millions of ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Once your whole energy is functioning as a love, the wine will start
dripping out of it. And when love is flowing, prayer arises. Prayer is
the wine. Love is like grapes.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says she is a doctor.]</p><p><br></p><p>You will become capable. You just need a little more love flowing. It
works more than any medicine. Up to now medical science has not been
able to find anything more potent than love. If you can be</p><p><br></p><p>loving to the patient, you will be tremendously successful, because
medicines are secondary. They are still not primary. Therapy is a
function of love. Love is therapeutic.</p><p><br></p><p>You can even sometimes just give water to the patient with deep love,
deep compassion, and it will function. There have been many experiments
in which the proportion is almost the same. You give the medicine; it
works. You give water; it works the same way – what you call a placebo.
But if it is given with love and the patient trusts, it functions. When
you love, you create trust.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is one of the most beautiful professions to choose because it
allows you to be loving. It becomes ugly, it has become ugly, because it
has become a sort of exploitation. You are exploiting people’s diseases,
illnesses. That’s why one feels it is a little heavy. Otherwise it is
one of the most beautiful professions – if you love. You may not become
very rich if you love, but you will feel tremendously enriched
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you don’t bother about money too much, there is no problem.
Then you can help many people to be healthy and whole. Their prayers
will be for you,. and their hearts will be for you and you will be
tremendously fulfilled. But if you make money the consideration, then it
is one of the worst professions. In a better world, money should not be
a relationship at all between the doctor and the patient because it
destroys love. Money is the most anti-love thing in the world. And when
you are treating a patient for money, of course the patient becomes
irrelevant. He is just a number; he has no being in him. Because he pays
you, you treat him, but you become impersonal, indifferent.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, deep down, if the patient is very rich, in your unconscious
you want him to remain ill a little longer. It creates guilt also,
because if a rich patient is cured easily, he will not be paying too
much. So if the patient is rich, the unconscious desire remains in the
doctor to let him linger a little. This is very dangerous, but it is
so.</p><p><br></p><p>So make it more meditative, make it more loving. Whatsoever time you
are here for, meditate as deeply as possible. Your meditation has
started. I have started working on you. Forget everything, and let your
love grow. By the time you go back, you will be able to have a totally
different outlook about your profession. I cannot guarantee that that
will help you to earn much money, but money is not a consideration. You
can always get enough for your needs, but that’s all... more than
enough. But make it a function of your loving heart. Let it be a
service, and then you will see that it is helping you. It will help you
to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>What more can you expect? If you are serving human beings, you are
doing one of the best things that can be done. Somebody is painting on
the canvas, somebody is writing a poem, and somebody is playing on a
musical instrument – you are playing on human beings, you are painting
on a human canvas. You are doing something with the most evolved
phenomenon in the world. One should be happy. But a different vision is
needed, that’s all. It will come.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, said through an interpreter that she was concerned that
by having relationships with women, she was running away from men. She
asked for Osho’s help.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checked her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is wrong. You can continue. Don’t have any condemnatory
attitude about it. You are not trying to escape from men – your energy
simply fits with women. And if any day you are going to</p><p><br></p><p>make any relationship with a man, it will be possible only when you
have passed through and grown up from this relationship. So it is not
against men. It is just a growth situation for you. Simply go into it as
deeply as possible and drop all negative attitudes; they are very
ingrained.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is always beautiful, whatsoever the form. And don’t bother too
much about what the society says. Your energy fits completely with the
feminine energy, so continue. Later on I can see that you may grow out
of it, and then you will be able to be related to a man; not before it.
But there is no hurry. Don’t be worried about it.</p><p><br></p><p>[The Encounter group was present tonight. The group leader says: It
hasn’t come together as a group. They are more like many individuals –
but it’s working. It’s going well.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm, mm, that too happens sometimes, but that has its own beauty.
Sometimes a group becomes an orchestra and gathers a collective soul.
That has its own beauty. Sometimes the group remains very
individualistic, all solo players. Each may be doing perfectly well on
his own, but there is no group soul. That too is good. And one should
never try to force anything. If it is growing into a group soul, good.
If it is going separate ways, everybody is growing separately, that too
is good. That’s what their need is.</p><p><br></p><p>Two types of people can fall into a group unity. One, very childish
people, who don’t have much of the ego in them, who don’t have much
intellectual scepticism in them... simple, innocent people, a little
childish. They immediately form a group soul. There are people who have
got completely fed up with their intellect, with their egos –
super-intellectuals. Then too they drop their egos and become part of a
group soul. And all who are in between will remain individuals. They are
not childish, they are not yet so fed up with their intellect and their
ego. They will remain individuals. But that’s what their need is at the
moment. So your work is just to help them be whatsoever they can be.
Whatsoever is there, you have to help it to come up. Mm? Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A group member said she felt she was holding on to something but she
did not know what it was. Osho checked her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>You continue to play games – that is the real problem. But it comes
only when something really penetrates and touches the problem. You can
go on playing games of being open, flowing. You can act – and you have
been doing that. You enjoyed doing that, but this time you failed in
acting – and that’s very good.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you have become aware of something, a stagnant energy, but now
something can be done. Once we know where the problem is, things become
easy.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho then gives her sannyas.]</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, blissful, and alka in indian mythology is the city
of gods. In heaven where the gods live, that city is called alka. The
name will mean blissful city of gods.</p><p><br></p><p>So forget the old and become blissful. There is no problem – just a
small something blocking the way. It will go. By tomorrow morning you
will feel totally different.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A group member says he feels stuck: In my head. I think before I
do.]</p><p><br></p><p>So start doing a few things without thinking. That is the only way to
break the habit. Just anything will be helpful! You may be sitting –
just give yourself a jerk, and then think later. Let the jerk happen
first and then see afterwards. You are going somewhere; turn around. Do
a few crazy things, because nothing puts the mind into its place like
crazy things. You will enjoy it very much, because if the mind gets into
the habit of always thinking before doing, then you miss life. Then
nothing is spontaneous because the mind always comes before you can act.
It gives you a rehearsal.</p><p><br></p><p>You think pro and con, and by the time you decide, the moment is
lost, the moment is gone. Then you are never spontaneous. You always
miss the real time for anything to happen. You will always be late. You
will decide, ‘Now I should do it,’ but then it is too late. Life is
going so fast – thinkers never accomplish anything; they only think. I
am not against thinking, but doing is more primary. When you have a
luxurious moment and nothing to do, sit in a chair and enjoy thinking;
nothing is wrong in it. But life should not be decided by thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>If you come across a beautiful woman and you start thinking about
whether to fall in love or not, you will miss. By the time you will be
able to decide, you will be old and the woman will be gone, dead, or may
have four children. Life needs decisiveness each moment.</p><p><br></p><p>So just try. Anything will do just to get out of the habit. Otherwise
you will get more and more into thinking. And getting more and more into
the head is like getting more and more into the grave. But nothing to be
worried about – the head will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>[To a sannyasin who had returned from the West.]</p><p><br></p><p>Just be here – and to be here without any questions is more helpful.
The questioning mind is concerned too much with its questions, and goes
on missing many things. When there is no questioning in the mind, you
cannot miss anything; you are simply okay.</p><p><br></p><p>A question closes you, allows you a small slit of opening through the
question, but otherwise it closes you. It is like a keyhole. Without any
question, you are just under the sky. And that is the difference between
philosophical enquiry and religious enquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>A philosophical enquiry is with questions. It is based on curiosity.
Some questions are haunting you. You are restless because of them; you
want some answer so you can rest. And those questions won’t allow you to
rest unless you find the answer. Of course answers are never found.
Whatsoever we call an answer is only a temporary thing. Again out of one
answer, ten questions arise. And it goes on that way. So each answer
simply proves that there are more questions to be asked, nothing else.
It never solves any question – it only creates more questions. This is
the difference between religious enquiry and philosophical enquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious enquiry is a non-questioning attitude. In India we call
it satsang – just being in the presence of the master... nothing to ask.
Just being in the presence... just drinking and soaking in the presence.
Then one starts growing towards the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask questions you will get many answers, but never the answer.
And unless the answer is arrived at, everything is futile. When you
don’t ask, in that non-questioning attitude, in that trust, in that
non-doubting, something starts happening which by and by becomes the
answer.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the paradox. If you ask the questions, you will never come
to the answer. If you don’t ask the questions, you are certain to come
to the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is very good. Just be here... be as you are. Just enjoy me,
delight in me. Celebrate me and be happy for no reason at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

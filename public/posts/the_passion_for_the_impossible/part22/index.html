Deva means divine, and tarpana means sacrifice – divine sacrifice, or sacrifice to the divine. And that’s what life really is. Unless it becomes a sacrifice, an offering, you go on missing it. Unless you give your life totally, you miss it. And there is no way ordinarily to give it totally except to give it to God, because only the total can become the receptor of a total gift."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/part22/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/part22/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="22"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

And that’s what life really is. Unless it becomes a sacrifice, an offering, you go on missing it. Unless you give your life totally, you miss it. And there is no way ordinarily to give it totally except to give it to God, because only the total can become the receptor of a total gift.\nIf you give your life to a woman, it cannot be total because she is not total; she cannot contain that much. And you cannot give that much because human limitations are always there. If you give your life to ambition, it can never be total. There is only one way to be total, and that is to give to the totality. That’s what God is. By giving, we get;. by sharing, we get – not by possessing. That is the meaning of sacrifice – that by possession we miss, we lose. The more you possess, the poorer you are. The more you give, the more rich you are. If one can give totally, unconditionally, then richness is tremendous, immense. Then it knows no limitations of time and space. It is immeasurable.\nThe word sacrifice is very beautiful. It has become ugly by wrong associations. People have tried to sacrifice everything except themselves. Sometimes it is an animal they have sacrificed to God, sometimes something else, but they go on avoiding the real sacrifice – and that is the sacrifice of one’s own being.\nThat means that after the sacrifice you are no more there and only God is... that He exists in you... that you become just a vehicle, a passage, an expression, a song sung by Him. You become a flute, a hollow bamboo, nothing else.\nI give you this name Tarpana so that you can remember to give more and more, to love more and more. Never ask for anything, and a thousand-fold will be coming.\nJesus says, ‘Ask, and it shall be given.’ And I say to you, ‘Don’t ask, and it shall be given.’ Ask, and you have already become a beggar. Ask, and already you have desired. Ask, and you have\nalready expected something – and whatsoever you can expect will bring misery, because you are misery. The very idea of ‘I am’ is miserable. Then I expect. This ‘I’ goes on creating new desires, new projects, and it goes on asking.\nDrop asking. Just be and everything will be given to you.\n[A sannyasin said he had done a nine-month encounter course in the London centre but still felt unfinished.]\nIn fact, no group can be felt as finished because a group is artificial. The real is only in life. A group has to begin and end. The beginning is arbitrary; the end is also arbitrary. It is a created situation. It cannot be complete. In the very nature of things it cannot be complete. And one should not ask for completion because that is asking for the impossible. Only life is complete because it is an eternally ongoing process. It knows no beginning and knows no end. It never started and it is never going to end.\nEach moment, it is complete. Each moment, as it is, is complete... it is perfect. Life moves from one perfection to another perfection. It is not from imperfection to perfection. It is just from perfection to another perfection, from one grandeur to another grandeur, from one richness to another richness. In \u0026ct it is not a growth – it is a play. The very idea that one is growing from one point to another and becoming more perfect, is linear. We are moving in a circle; we are not going anywhere. We are simply going because we are energies and energy has to go – not that there is a goal, but that energy has to dance.\nSo rather than going somewhere, it is more like a dance. When somebody is dancing, you never ask ‘Where are you going? Why are you making so much fuss? What is the goal?’\nWhen a person is dancing you know that he is not going anywhere – simply enjoying. Energy is there and overpouring, overflowing. What to do with energy? God is extravagant – hence so many flowers. Extravagant for no purpose at all. It is just that the energy is there, so what to do? – flower! So many millions of birds and insects and men.\nDarwin created a very linear concept in the western mind – that of evolution. Nothing is evolving. It is not that the monkey becomes the man. The monkey is perfect; there is nothing to become. He is as perfect as man, it is a different kind of Perfection, and man is another kind of perfection. There is no hierarchy – that man is higher than the monkey, and the monkey is higher than the donkey – all nonsense. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower. All are performing their own game. The donkey has chosen to be a donkey; that’s his will. And the monkey has chosen to be a monkey.\nNothing is going anywhere – that is the eastern concept. And everything is a play, a dance, leela. Hence everything is as it should be. There is no need to be discontented – unless you decide to play the game of discontent; then it’s okay.\nIt is said about a very great sufi mystic that he was talking to a few people... he was talking about the same thing that I am talking about to you. He was saying that everything is perfect because how can it be otherwise? God is perfect. Out of His energy comes everything, so everything is bound to be perfect.\nA man stood up – he was a hunchback – and he said ‘What about me?’ It was very painful for him to even stand. His body was very unshapely and ugly. He said ‘What about me? What do you say about me? You say everything is perfect.’\nThe mystic said ‘I have never seen such a perfect hunchback. You are the most perfect hunchback I have ever seen!’ Everything is perfect.\nIt is very difficult to drop the idea of evolution because with evolution there is a possibility for the mind to exist. You have to hanker, desire, seek; then ambition is open. If nothing is happening, and everything is as it has always been – just forms change and the content remains the same; everything appears to be changing and nothing changes; it is just an overflowing energy, a waterfall, for no purpose at all, going nowhere, moving round and round, a merry-go-round – then it is difficult, but if you can understand that, suddenly one relaxes. Then there is no tension.\nAll growth groups are a by-product of the evolutionary concept that one has to grow. One has to do nothing! One has just to be. One has just to delight. All is available – one has just to dance. The orchestra is there and people are ready, just waiting for you to participate. Everything is ready – just start dancing.\nSo this time here don’t seek anything. If you want to do a few groups, you can, but just for enjoyment. And that is a totally different dimension – of doing them for sheer joy. You would like to have a few communications, a few encounter people playing roles and games, and this and that. Enjoy, but don’t be a seeker. Seeking creates suffering. Non-seeking is bliss. You cannot seek bliss because that is impossible. Whatsoever you seek is bound to be suffering. Seeking is suffering. Don’t seek – just be. For these six months here, just be.\nI’m not saying not to do anything. I’m saying to do as many things as you like, but this time just let them be plays and games. Enjoy the very thing; don’t hanker for the result. That’s why you are feeling incomplete. If you had enjoyed it moment to moment, this feeling would not have been there. That the total result of nine months’ work is a feeling of incompletion, is not good. Something basic was missed. And it is not only that you missed all participants would have missed because that’s how the contemporary mind is missing everything.\nEven if you tell people not to do anything, not to seek anything, they say ‘Okay, we will not seek, but then what will happen?’ Look at the absurdity. They say ‘Okay, we will not seek. But then will it happen or not?’ The seeking continues. Now it goes a little deeper, more underground, but they are again asking whether something will happen or not. If you tell them to just sit and enjoy.…\nMan has become incapable of being in the present – and that incapacity is what hell is. So this timeYou have been doing .well, but now the moment has come when seeking has to be dropped;\nplaying has to be started. So do whatsoever groups you want to, do whatsoever meditations you want to. Don’t misinterpret me because there are people who, when I say that there is no need to do anything, say ‘Why do meditations? Why do a group?’ Then they become sad, they become depressed, because their energy gets suffocated. I’m not saying that.\nI am saying to do as many things as you can, because even God cannot contain energy – that’s why existence is. To contain energy is to become ill. To contain energy is to become neurotic, because\nthe energy wants to explode, it wants to express itself. It wants to move. It wants to go on an adventure. It wants to remain alive, fresh and flowing. So if you don’t do anything, you are stuck.\nI’m not saying don’t do anything. I’m saying don’t be a doer any more. Become a player... just for the delight of it. And much is going to happen.…\n[A sannyasin says: I feel guilty because I always miss the morning meditation and the lecture. I always feel lazy in the morning.\nOsho checks her energy.]\nSimply allow it. It is just natural to your body energy. Different people have different times for their body. Each person, in twenty-four hours, has two types of extremes.\nFor two hours in the night the body temperature falls by two degrees; sometimes even by three and four degrees. Those two hours are the best for sleep. In the same way, in the daytime the body temperature rises by two degrees, or sometimes even three. Those are the best hours for work. One is absolutely full of energy. But these periods are different for each, and even different for each person in different times.\nFor example if a person’s temperature falls in the night between three and five, then those will be the hours of the best sleep for the person. If he gets up at that time he will suffer the whole day. It has nothing to do with laziness. It is a wrong concept. I’m not saying that there are not lazy people, but many people are just thought to be lazy – they are not. For example if somebody’s temperature falls between five and seven, he will be thought lazy. At least in the East he will be thought lazy; in the West, not so much.\nIf that person’s temperature falls between five and seven, and he gets up between five and seven, for the whole day he will feel tired, as if something is missing. He will not feel vital. He will feel sleepy. You can sleep for eight hours – that won’t help. These two hours are a must. If somebody sleeps only for those two hours, that is enough. But if you don’t sleep those two hours, you can sleep for ten; that won’t do.\nSo as I feel your energy, your temperature must be falling near six to eight in the morning. So that is the time – you just sleep. There is no need to feel guilty. You can do the evening meditation – don’t be worried about it.\nBy and by we can change it. Rather than forcing and getting up against your body, the temperature fall can be changed. So in the night when you go to sleep, make it a point just to tell your bodyJust\ntalk to your body. You should learn how to talk with the body. Ten your body, ‘Let the temperature fall between three and five.’ And trust it; don’t force. After three weeks you will find it easier and easier to get up. By and by the shift will happen, and your body temperature will start falling between three and five. Then you can get up at five completely fresh and with no problem. But don’t force it. Forcing is just absurd; it cannot work.\nYou need deep auto-suggestion to change the body energy – its flow, its timings.\n... So there is nothing to be worried about. Simply go on suggesting. And another thing – make it a point to go to bed regularly every night. Drop this habit. This is very disturbing; it creates confusion in the body. The body is a very simple mechanism. You put it into trouble unnecessarily. One day you go at eight o’clock and the next day the body expects that you will go at eight o’clock again, and that day you go at.eleven. The body is confused – what is the matter? – because after twenty-four hours it gets ready; it expects. It is just like food. If you eat every day at eleven, then at eleven the body expects food. The juices start flowing, the appetite arises. But if you frustrate the body every day, by and by it loses contact with you. Then it becomes muddle-headed. It does not know what is going on. It loses sensitivity.\n[Osho said that he did not mean that she had to be absolutely strict about what time she retired. If occasionally it was later than, for example ten, that was alright, but irregularity should not become a regularity. He said that with this, plus the suggestion to the body about the temperature fall, soon she would find that she woke at five and felt like getting up.]\nWhat I am meaning to point out is, never be violent with the body. It is a very simple, subtle, delicate mechanism. Persuade it... it will come.\n[The Enlightenment Group is present. One group member said her body felt divided between the left and right sides, and this was more when she meditated.]\nDo one thing. In the morning when you get up, sit in your bed, left hand this way [Osho holds his left hand up-turned], with the right hand on top of it. Start pouring energy from the right hand into the left. Just feel, visualise energy falling like a waterfall, and that the left is receiving it, absorbing it. Don’t touch the hand; keep at least two or three inches away. You will start feeling the tingling sensation in the left, and you will feel warmth flowing.\nIf the left is receptive, there is no problem. The right has too much – give it to the left. Feel the whole left side of the body being energised, vitalised. Do this for just five to seven minutes, and you will feel a balance coming. Whenever during the day you feel again that the imbalance is there, just pour it. In the night before you go to sleep, pour it again and go to sleep.\nIn the morning it will help the left side to be awake, alert, vital. In the night it will help the right side to relax. So before going to sleep, pour it, to help the right side – otherwise it will be too active and you will not be able to go to sleep; and in the morning to help the left side – otherwise it will be too inactive and you will not be able to get up, or you will not be fully alert. In the daytime, whenever you feel to, you can simply try to pour the energy.\nYou will become balanced. There is nothing to be worried about.\n[A visitor says: I came here to go through most of the groups, to see you, to hear you. I would like, I want you to love me, but I don’t want to take sannyas.\nEvery day in the ashram I am being asked, ‘Why don’t you take sannyas? When will you take sannyas?’ – and it disturbs me. I feel that all my life I have been running after a father I didn’t get.\nI have been a catholic priest already, and I have had enough of this kind of clothes and so on.\nBut I just wanted to say that I want to be loved by you. And I am asking you if you can love me, even if I don’t take sannyas?]\nNo, I love you! [laughter] That is not the point. For that sannyas is not needed at all. But your disturbance shows that you want to take sannyas, otherwise your disturbance would not be there; nobody could disturb you by asking. If people ask and you get disturbed, that simply shows that deep down you want to take sannyas, and they bring it to your consciousness again and again. If you don’t want to take sannyas, nobody can disturb you.\nAnd the second thing – sannyas has nothing to do with being a catholic priest. It has nothing to do with it. And it is an absolutely radical phenomenon. It is not a regimentation. It is not any outer discipline imposed upon you. The clothes and things like that are simply gestures – and they help tremendously.\nMy love is there about that you can be absolutely fearless; drop your fear – but you will never feel at home here unless you are in orange. That is your problem – it is not a problem for me. You will never feel at home here. Amidst so many sannyasins, you will always feel that you are an outsider, and that will be a disturbance to you.\nIt is tremendously beautiful to become a part; things start flowing more easily. You are more of the family. You not only belong to me – you belong to my family too. Not only will you be receiving my love, you will be receiving the love of all my sannyasins. I can love you without your being a sannyasin, but my sannyasins won’t be able to love you – and you will miss much love. You will be with them for twenty-four hours, and you will always be standing a little far away, a little distant, and that distance will be unnecessary; there is no need for it.\nWith my sannyas there is no reason to be afraid that you are getting into some regimentation, some discipline. There is no discipline. And if you are Still seeking a father figure, you are Still a Catholic. That is the whole base of Catholicism. If the father figure is not available, then in heaven there is the father. And if you cannot get him, the. father, at least you can approach the son, and through the son you can approach the father. But that is the whole christian ideology. It is father-oriented.\nSo you may have dropped out of it, but deep down in the unconscious you are Still a Christian. My feeling – if you ask me to be true about you – is that you are not afraid of the regimentation and the dress. Your Catholic is afraid of the orange. Your Christian is afraid. That Christian is there and he will feel that you are betraying him or something. You may not be conscious of it at all. Consciously you may be thinking that you are a free person and that you have left all that; now you don’t want to get into it again. That may be your conscious idea, but that has nothing to do with your reality.\nAs I can see it right now, it is your Christian afraid of the East, afraid of the eastern, afraid of the orange, the ochre. It is the Christian. And it will be helpful to drop that Christian completely. You will be freed and you will feel very weightless. But think about it; there is no hurry.\nIf you love me and you want my love, you will have to listen to what I am saying. You will have to try to absorb it. Unless you start trying to understand my standpoint also, that love will be meaningless. Love itself won’t do. A transmission of understanding will also be needed, will be very basically needed.\nSo love is there; don’t be worried about it. In fact I love you – that’s why I give you sannyas. Love is a priori; it precedes sannyas. It doesn’t succeed sannyas. It is not that you become a sannyasin and then I love you. In fact I love you – that’s why you become a sannyasin. And whether you remain a sannyasin or not, is not the question, but out of the love you take the jump with me. I’m not promising you any heaven or paradise or anything. I’m simply promising you a delightful journey to nowhere.\nI’m not saying that you will arrive. I’m simply saying that there is no place to arrive at. But wherever you are, you will be moving. I promise you movement, I promise you process, I promise you a dynamism. And wherever you are, whatsoever the situation, I prepare you to be happy there, to be celebrating there.\nThese clothes are just symbolic. They are not in any way serious affairs as it is with Christianity. They are very symbolic, and symbols of non-seriousness. It is just a non-serious gesture. I want you to become a little foolish, that’s all. And these clothes will make you a little foolish. With these clothes you will look a little wiser. With these clothes... just look around [indicating the group]\n... Not in this ashram, but outside the ashram you will be a fool!\n... You do whatsoever you want to – and be honest to yourself. Very good!\n[A sannyasin says: I leave tomorrow. I have a problem – I have no self-confidence. I am very unsure of myself, and I feel much anger sometimes.]\nAbout your problem.… Whenever a person feels the lack of self-confidence, he becomes easily angry. In fact anger is always an indication that you are not self-confident. A person who is confident about himself is not easily angry. It is very difficult for him to get into anger. It is our weakness that leads us into anger. The stronger you are, the less anger will be there. The strongest person goes beyond anger. Anger is weakness.\nSo don’t be worried about anger; it is a byproduct. Rather be concerned how to become stronger. Do three things. One is, meditate regularly. Within six months you will feel a burst of energy and a confidence arising in you. But don’t be bothered about whether any result is coming or not. Continue for six months. And choose any meditation you like, but stick to that; don’t change – one day Kundalini, another day Dynamic.\nOne day it will suddenly happen that you will be full of energy, and suddenly you will see that all unconfidence has gone. You have become sure about yourself, centred.\nThe second thing. Before going to sleep, just stand in the room and feel that you are a pillar of energy from the ceiling to the floor – just the shape of a pillar. Close your eyes and feel that you are a pillar of energy, and that you are melting. Visualise that the energy is falling and you are underneath it, as if taking a shower of energy – just for seven minutes. And feel completely cleansed, purified, bathed, and then go to sleep.\nAnd the third thing. Whenever you feel angry, don’t throw it on persons. Rather, beat a pillow. [For details of the pillow meditation see Hammer On The Rock, Sunday, December 21st, 1975.]\n[The sannyasin then asks if he should finish psychoanalysis which he has been in for seven years.]\nNo, continue. Now I give you a project. Continue, and convert the psychoanalyst to sannyas [laughter]. That is the real work to be done now. He has helped you; now you have to help him – otherwise if he commits suicide, you will be responsible!\nSo continue. He will be in the illusion that you are being psychoanalysed – you start analysing him! That will bring you more confidence than anything else – if you can convert your psychoanalyst. That will bring you much self-confidence. So sabo-tage...! When he says, ‘Talk,’ tank about meditation. Talk about the ecstasy and bliss that comes – whether it has come or not, don’t be worried [much laughter]. And feel very happy. Soon he will become your follower. Once you can make a follower out of him, you will be so confident that there will be no need for psychoanalysis.\nYou don’t see many psychoanalysts here, but there are many. All psychoanalysts are bound to come by and by. They need help. So continue analysis because it will be needed – not for you, but for the analyst.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4295","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_passion_for_the_impossible/>The Passion for the Impossible</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">22</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4295 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Passion_for_the_Impossible/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

sacrifice to the divine. And that’s what life really is. Unless it
becomes a sacrifice, an offering, you go on missing it. Unless you give
your life totally, you miss it. And there is no way ordinarily to give
it totally except to give it to God, because only the total can become
the receptor of a total gift.</p><p><br></p><p>If you give your life to a woman, it cannot be total because she is
not total; she cannot contain that much. And you cannot give that much
because human limitations are always there. If you give your life to
ambition, it can never be total. There is only one way to be total, and
that is to give to the totality. That’s what God is. By giving, we get;.
by sharing, we get – not by possessing. That is the meaning of sacrifice
– that by possession we miss, we lose. The more you possess, the poorer
you are. The more you give, the more rich you are. If one can give
totally, unconditionally, then richness is tremendous, immense. Then it
knows no limitations of time and space. It is immeasurable.</p><p><br></p><p>The word sacrifice is very beautiful. It has become ugly by wrong
associations. People have tried to sacrifice everything except
themselves. Sometimes it is an animal they have sacrificed to God,
sometimes something else, but they go on avoiding the real sacrifice –
and that is the sacrifice of one’s own being.</p><p><br></p><p>That means that after the sacrifice you are no more there and only
God is... that He exists in you... that you become just a vehicle, a
passage, an expression, a song sung by Him. You become a flute, a hollow
bamboo, nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>I give you this name Tarpana so that you can remember to give more
and more, to love more and more. Never ask for anything, and a
thousand-fold will be coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, ‘Ask, and it shall be given.’ And I say to you, ‘Don’t
ask, and it shall be given.’ Ask, and you have already become a beggar.
Ask, and already you have desired. Ask, and you have</p><p><br></p><p>already expected something – and whatsoever you can expect will bring
misery, because you are misery. The very idea of ‘I am’ is miserable.
Then I expect. This ‘I’ goes on creating new desires, new projects, and
it goes on asking.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop asking. Just be and everything will be given to you.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said he had done a nine-month encounter course in the
London centre but still felt unfinished.]</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, no group can be felt as finished because a group is
artificial. The real is only in life. A group has to begin and end. The
beginning is arbitrary; the end is also arbitrary. It is a created
situation. It cannot be complete. In the very nature of things it cannot
be complete. And one should not ask for completion because that is
asking for the impossible. Only life is complete because it is an
eternally ongoing process. It knows no beginning and knows no end. It
never started and it is never going to end.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment, it is complete. Each moment, as it is, is complete... it
is perfect. Life moves from one perfection to another perfection. It is
not from imperfection to perfection. It is just from perfection to
another perfection, from one grandeur to another grandeur, from one
richness to another richness. In &amp;ct it is not a growth – it is a
play. The very idea that one is growing from one point to another and
becoming more perfect, is linear. We are moving in a circle; we are not
going anywhere. We are simply going because we are energies and energy
has to go – not that there is a goal, but that energy has to dance.</p><p><br></p><p>So rather than going somewhere, it is more like a dance. When
somebody is dancing, you never ask ‘Where are you going? Why are you
making so much fuss? What is the goal?’</p><p><br></p><p>When a person is dancing you know that he is not going anywhere –
simply enjoying. Energy is there and overpouring, overflowing. What to
do with energy? God is extravagant – hence so many flowers. Extravagant
for no purpose at all. It is just that the energy is there, so what to
do? – flower! So many millions of birds and insects and men.</p><p><br></p><p>Darwin created a very linear concept in the western mind – that of
evolution. Nothing is evolving. It is not that the monkey becomes the
man. The monkey is perfect; there is nothing to become. He is as perfect
as man, it is a different kind of Perfection, and man is another kind of
perfection. There is no hierarchy – that man is higher than the monkey,
and the monkey is higher than the donkey – all nonsense. Nobody is
higher, nobody is lower. All are performing their own game. The donkey
has chosen to be a donkey; that’s his will. And the monkey has chosen to
be a monkey.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is going anywhere – that is the eastern concept. And
everything is a play, a dance, leela. Hence everything is as it should
be. There is no need to be discontented – unless you decide to play the
game of discontent; then it’s okay.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about a very great sufi mystic that he was talking to a
few people... he was talking about the same thing that I am talking
about to you. He was saying that everything is perfect because how can
it be otherwise? God is perfect. Out of His energy comes everything, so
everything is bound to be perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>A man stood up – he was a hunchback – and he said ‘What about me?’ It
was very painful for him to even stand. His body was very unshapely and
ugly. He said ‘What about me? What do you say about me? You say
everything is perfect.’</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said ‘I have never seen such a perfect hunchback. You are
the most perfect hunchback I have ever seen!’ Everything is perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult to drop the idea of evolution because with
evolution there is a possibility for the mind to exist. You have to
hanker, desire, seek; then ambition is open. If nothing is happening,
and everything is as it has always been – just forms change and the
content remains the same; everything appears to be changing and nothing
changes; it is just an overflowing energy, a waterfall, for no purpose
at all, going nowhere, moving round and round, a merry-go-round – then
it is difficult, but if you can understand that, suddenly one relaxes.
Then there is no tension.</p><p><br></p><p>All growth groups are a by-product of the evolutionary concept that
one has to grow. One has to do nothing! One has just to be. One has just
to delight. All is available – one has just to dance. The orchestra is
there and people are ready, just waiting for you to participate.
Everything is ready – just start dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>So this time here don’t seek anything. If you want to do a few
groups, you can, but just for enjoyment. And that is a totally different
dimension – of doing them for sheer joy. You would like to have a few
communications, a few encounter people playing roles and games, and this
and that. Enjoy, but don’t be a seeker. Seeking creates suffering.
Non-seeking is bliss. You cannot seek bliss because that is impossible.
Whatsoever you seek is bound to be suffering. Seeking is suffering.
Don’t seek – just be. For these six months here, just be.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m not saying not to do anything. I’m saying to do as many things as
you like, but this time just let them be plays and games. Enjoy the very
thing; don’t hanker for the result. That’s why you are feeling
incomplete. If you had enjoyed it moment to moment, this feeling would
not have been there. That the total result of nine months’ work is a
feeling of incompletion, is not good. Something basic was missed. And it
is not only that you missed all participants would have missed because
that’s how the contemporary mind is missing everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you tell people not to do anything, not to seek anything,
they say ‘Okay, we will not seek, but then what will happen?’ Look at
the absurdity. They say ‘Okay, we will not seek. But then will it happen
or not?’ The seeking continues. Now it goes a little deeper, more
underground, but they are again asking whether something will happen or
not. If you tell them to just sit and enjoy.…</p><p><br></p><p>Man has become incapable of being in the present – and that
incapacity is what hell is. So this time<span class=s4></span>You have
been doing .well, but now the moment has come when seeking has to be
dropped;</p><p>playing has to be started. So do whatsoever groups you want to, do
whatsoever meditations you want to. Don’t misinterpret me because there
are people who, when I say that there is no need to do anything, say
‘Why do meditations? Why do a group?’ Then they become sad, they become
depressed, because their energy gets suffocated. I’m not saying
that.</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying to do as many things as you can, because even God cannot
contain energy – that’s why existence is. To contain energy is to become
ill. To contain energy is to become neurotic, because</p><p><br></p><p>the energy wants to explode, it wants to express itself. It wants to
move. It wants to go on an adventure. It wants to remain alive, fresh
and flowing. So if you don’t do anything, you are stuck.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m not saying don’t do anything. I’m saying don’t be a doer any
more. Become a player... just for the delight of it. And much is going
to happen.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I feel guilty because I always miss the morning
meditation and the lecture. I always feel lazy in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Simply allow it. It is just natural to your body energy. Different
people have different times for their body. Each person, in twenty-four
hours, has two types of extremes.</p><p><br></p><p>For two hours in the night the body temperature falls by two degrees;
sometimes even by three and four degrees. Those two hours are the best
for sleep. In the same way, in the daytime the body temperature rises by
two degrees, or sometimes even three. Those are the best hours for work.
One is absolutely full of energy. But these periods are different for
each, and even different for each person in different times.</p><p><br></p><p>For example if a person’s temperature falls in the night between
three and five, then those will be the hours of the best sleep for the
person. If he gets up at that time he will suffer the whole day. It has
nothing to do with laziness. It is a wrong concept. I’m not saying that
there are not lazy people, but many people are just thought to be lazy –
they are not. For example if somebody’s temperature falls between five
and seven, he will be thought lazy. At least in the East he will be
thought lazy; in the West, not so much.</p><p><br></p><p>If that person’s temperature falls between five and seven, and he
gets up between five and seven, for the whole day he will feel tired, as
if something is missing. He will not feel vital. He will feel sleepy.
You can sleep for eight hours – that won’t help. These two hours are a
must. If somebody sleeps only for those two hours, that is enough. But
if you don’t sleep those two hours, you can sleep for ten; that won’t
do.</p><p><br></p><p>So as I feel your energy, your temperature must be falling near six
to eight in the morning. So that is the time – you just sleep. There is
no need to feel guilty. You can do the evening meditation – don’t be
worried about it.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by we can change it. Rather than forcing and getting up
against your body, the temperature fall can be changed. So in the night
when you go to sleep, make it a point just to tell your body<span class=s4></span>Just</p><p>talk to your body. You should learn how to talk with the body. Ten
your body, ‘Let the temperature fall between three and five.’ And trust
it; don’t force. After three weeks you will find it easier and easier to
get up. By and by the shift will happen, and your body temperature will
start falling between three and five. Then you can get up at five
completely fresh and with no problem. But don’t force it. Forcing is
just absurd; it cannot work.</p><p><br></p><p>You need deep auto-suggestion to change the body energy – its flow,
its timings.</p><p><br></p><p>... So there is nothing to be worried about. Simply go on suggesting.
And another thing – make it a point to go to bed regularly every night.
Drop this habit. This is very disturbing; it creates confusion in the
body. The body is a very simple mechanism. You put it into trouble
unnecessarily. One day you go at eight o’clock and the next day the body
expects that you will go at eight o’clock again, and that day you go
at.eleven. The body is confused – what is the matter? – because after
twenty-four hours it gets ready; it expects. It is just like food. If
you eat every day at eleven, then at eleven the body expects food. The
juices start flowing, the appetite arises. But if you frustrate the body
every day, by and by it loses contact with you. Then it becomes
muddle-headed. It does not know what is going on. It loses
sensitivity.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho said that he did not mean that she had to be absolutely strict
about what time she retired. If occasionally it was later than, for
example ten, that was alright, but irregularity should not become a
regularity. He said that with this, plus the suggestion to the body
about the temperature fall, soon she would find that she woke at five
and felt like getting up.]</p><p><br></p><p>What I am meaning to point out is, never be violent with the body. It
is a very simple, subtle, delicate mechanism. Persuade it... it will
come.</p><p><br></p><p>[The Enlightenment Group is present. One group member said her body
felt divided between the left and right sides, and this was more when
she meditated.]</p><p><br></p><p>Do one thing. In the morning when you get up, sit in your bed, left
hand this way [Osho holds his left hand up-turned], with the right hand
on top of it. Start pouring energy from the right hand into the left.
Just feel, visualise energy falling like a waterfall, and that the left
is receiving it, absorbing it. Don’t touch the hand; keep at least two
or three inches away. You will start feeling the tingling sensation in
the left, and you will feel warmth flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>If the left is receptive, there is no problem. The right has too much
– give it to the left. Feel the whole left side of the body being
energised, vitalised. Do this for just five to seven minutes, and you
will feel a balance coming. Whenever during the day you feel again that
the imbalance is there, just pour it. In the night before you go to
sleep, pour it again and go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning it will help the left side to be awake, alert, vital.
In the night it will help the right side to relax. So before going to
sleep, pour it, to help the right side – otherwise it will be too active
and you will not be able to go to sleep; and in the morning to help the
left side – otherwise it will be too inactive and you will not be able
to get up, or you will not be fully alert. In the daytime, whenever you
feel to, you can simply try to pour the energy.</p><p><br></p><p>You will become balanced. There is nothing to be worried about.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: I came here to go through most of the groups, to see
you, to hear you. I would like, I want you to love me, but I don’t want
to take sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day in the ashram I am being asked, ‘Why don’t you take
sannyas? When will you take sannyas?’ – and it disturbs me. I feel that
all my life I have been running after a father I didn’t get.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been a catholic priest already, and I have had enough of this
kind of clothes and so on.</p><p><br></p><p>But I just wanted to say that I want to be loved by you. And I am
asking you if you can love me, even if I don’t take sannyas?]</p><p><br></p><p>No, I love you! [laughter] That is not the point. For that sannyas is
not needed at all. But your disturbance shows that you want to take
sannyas, otherwise your disturbance would not be there; nobody could
disturb you by asking. If people ask and you get disturbed, that simply
shows that deep down you want to take sannyas, and they bring it to your
consciousness again and again. If you don’t want to take sannyas, nobody
can disturb you.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing – sannyas has nothing to do with being a
catholic priest. It has nothing to do with it. And it is an absolutely
radical phenomenon. It is not a regimentation. It is not any outer
discipline imposed upon you. The clothes and things like that are simply
gestures – and they help tremendously.</p><p><br></p><p>My love is there about that you can be absolutely fearless; drop your
fear – but you will never feel at home here unless you are in orange.
That is your problem – it is not a problem for me. You will never feel
at home here. Amidst so many sannyasins, you will always feel that you
are an outsider, and that will be a disturbance to you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is tremendously beautiful to become a part; things start flowing
more easily. You are more of the family. You not only belong to me – you
belong to my family too. Not only will you be receiving my love, you
will be receiving the love of all my sannyasins. I can love you without
your being a sannyasin, but my sannyasins won’t be able to love you –
and you will miss much love. You will be with them for twenty-four
hours, and you will always be standing a little far away, a little
distant, and that distance will be unnecessary; there is no need for
it.</p><p><br></p><p>With my sannyas there is no reason to be afraid that you are getting
into some regimentation, some discipline. There is no discipline. And if
you are Still seeking a father figure, you are Still a Catholic. That is
the whole base of Catholicism. If the father figure is not available,
then in heaven there is the father. And if you cannot get him, the.
father, at least you can approach the son, and through the son you can
approach the father. But that is the whole christian ideology. It is
father-oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>So you may have dropped out of it, but deep down in the unconscious
you are Still a Christian. My feeling – if you ask me to be true about
you – is that you are not afraid of the regimentation and the dress.
Your Catholic is afraid of the orange. Your Christian is afraid. That
Christian is there and he will feel that you are betraying him or
something. You may not be conscious of it at all. Consciously you may be
thinking that you are a free person and that you have left all that; now
you don’t want to get into it again. That may be your conscious idea,
but that has nothing to do with your reality.</p><p><br></p><p>As I can see it right now, it is your Christian afraid of the East,
afraid of the eastern, afraid of the orange, the ochre. It is the
Christian. And it will be helpful to drop that Christian completely. You
will be freed and you will feel very weightless. But think about it;
there is no hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love me and you want my love, you will have to listen to what
I am saying. You will have to try to absorb it. Unless you start trying
to understand my standpoint also, that love will be meaningless. Love
itself won’t do. A transmission of understanding will also be needed,
will be very basically needed.</p><p><br></p><p>So love is there; don’t be worried about it. In fact I love you –
that’s why I give you sannyas. Love is a priori; it precedes sannyas. It
doesn’t succeed sannyas. It is not that you become a sannyasin and then
I love you. In fact I love you – that’s why you become a sannyasin. And
whether you remain a sannyasin or not, is not the question, but out of
the love you take the jump with me. I’m not promising you any heaven or
paradise or anything. I’m simply promising you a delightful journey to
nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m not saying that you will arrive. I’m simply saying that there is
no place to arrive at. But wherever you are, you will be moving. I
promise you movement, I promise you process, I promise you a dynamism.
And wherever you are, whatsoever the situation, I prepare you to be
happy there, to be celebrating there.</p><p><br></p><p>These clothes are just symbolic. They are not in any way serious
affairs as it is with Christianity. They are very symbolic, and symbols
of non-seriousness. It is just a non-serious gesture. I want you to
become a little foolish, that’s all. And these clothes will make you a
little foolish. With these clothes you will look a little wiser. With
these clothes... just look around [indicating the group]</p><p><br></p><p>... Not in this ashram, but outside the ashram you will be a
fool!</p><p><br></p><p>... You do whatsoever you want to – and be honest to yourself. Very
good!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I leave tomorrow. I have a problem – I have no
self-confidence. I am very unsure of myself, and I feel much anger
sometimes.]</p><p><br></p><p>About your problem.… Whenever a person feels the lack of
self-confidence, he becomes easily angry. In fact anger is always an
indication that you are not self-confident. A person who is confident
about himself is not easily angry. It is very difficult for him to get
into anger. It is our weakness that leads us into anger. The stronger
you are, the less anger will be there. The strongest person goes beyond
anger. Anger is weakness.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried about anger; it is a byproduct. Rather be
concerned how to become stronger. Do three things. One is, meditate
regularly. Within six months you will feel a burst of energy and a
confidence arising in you. But don’t be bothered about whether any
result is coming or not. Continue for six months. And choose any
meditation you like, but stick to that; don’t change – one day
Kundalini, another day Dynamic.</p><p><br></p><p>One day it will suddenly happen that you will be full of energy, and
suddenly you will see that all unconfidence has gone. You have become
sure about yourself, centred.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing. Before going to sleep, just stand in the room and
feel that you are a pillar of energy from the ceiling to the floor –
just the shape of a pillar. Close your eyes and feel that you are a
pillar of energy, and that you are melting. Visualise that the energy is
falling and you are underneath it, as if taking a shower of energy –
just for seven minutes. And feel completely cleansed, purified, bathed,
and then go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing. Whenever you feel angry, don’t throw it on
persons. Rather, beat a pillow. [For details of the pillow meditation
see Hammer On The Rock, Sunday, December 21st, 1975.]</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin then asks if he should finish psychoanalysis which he
has been in for seven years.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, continue. Now I give you a project. Continue, and convert the
psychoanalyst to sannyas [laughter]. That is the real work to be done
now. He has helped you; now you have to help him – otherwise if he
commits suicide, you will be responsible!</p><p><br></p><p>So continue. He will be in the illusion that you are being
psychoanalysed – you start analysing him! That will bring you more
confidence than anything else – if you can convert your psychoanalyst.
That will bring you much self-confidence. So sabo-tage...! When he says,
‘Talk,’ tank about meditation. Talk about the ecstasy and bliss that
comes – whether it has come or not, don’t be worried [much laughter].
And feel very happy. Soon he will become your follower. Once you can
make a follower out of him, you will be so confident that there will be
no need for psychoanalysis.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t see many psychoanalysts here, but there are many. All
psychoanalysts are bound to come by and by. They need help. So continue
analysis because it will be needed – not for you, but for the

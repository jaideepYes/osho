NOW BODY AND MIND, FREE FROM ALL MOTIVATIONS, ALWAYS APPEAR AS
VOID AND ABSOLUTE SAMENESS, SHINING LIKE THE</p><p>BRIGHTNESS OF HEAVEN, AT THE CENTER OF THE VAST EXPANSE OF</p><p>PHENOMENAL THINGS, AND NEEDING NO POLISHING OR CLEANING. THIS</p><p>IS BEYOND ALL CONCEPTS, BEYOND BEING AND NON-BEING. LEAVE YOUR
INNUMERABLE KNOWINGS AND SEEINGS AND</p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS, AND GO TO THAT GREATNESS OF SPACE. WHEN YOU</p><p>COME TO THAT VASTNESS, THERE IS NO SPECK OF BUDDHISM IN YOUR</p><p>HEART, AND WHEN THERE IS NO SPECK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOU, YOU</p><p>WILL HAVE THE TRUE SIGHT OF BUDDHAS AND PATRIARCHS.</p><p>THE TRUE NATURE IS LIKE THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE WHICH CONTAINS</p><p>ALL THINGS. WHEN YOU CAN GO AND COME IN ALL REGIONS EQUALLY, WHEN
THERE IS NOTHING SPECIALLY YOURS, NO WITHIN AND NO</p><p>WITHOUT, WHEN YOU CONFORM TO HIGH AND CONFORM TO LOW,</p><p>CONFORM TO THE SQUARE AND CONFORM TO THE ROUND, THAT IS IT.</p><p>THE EMPTINESS OF THE SEA ALLOWS WAVES TO RISE; THE EMPTINESS OF</p><p>THE MOUNTAIN VALLEY MAKES THE VOICE ECHO; THE EMPTINESS OF THE</p><p>HEART MAKES THE BUDDHA. WHEN YOU EMPTY THE HEART, THINGS</p><p>APPEAR AS IN A MIRROR, SHINING THERE WITHOUT DIFFERENCES</p><p>BETWEEN THEM. LIFE AND DEATH AN ILLUSION, ALL THE BUDDHAS ARE</p><p>ONE'S OWN BODY.</p><p>ZEN IS NOT SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS; IT IS JUST HITTING AND PIERCING</p><p>THROUGH. IF YOU CUT OFF ALL DOUBTS, THE COURSE OF LIFE- AND-DEATH IS
CUT OFF NATURALLY. I ASK YOU ALL: DO YOU SEE IT OR DON'T</p><p>YOU? -- HOW IN JUNE THE SNOW MELTS FROM THE TOP OF MOUNT FUJI.</p><p>Maneesha, Bukko has come to the ultimate expression of the experience
of one's own being. Very rarely has a master succeeded to such a point
as Bukko has in his statements.</p><p>Listen carefully, because rarely will you meet a Bukko again.</p><p>BUKKO SAID:</p><p>TAKING THINGS EASILY AND WITHOUT FORCING, AFTER SOME TIME THE</p><p>RUSH OF THOUGHT, OUTWARD AND INWARD, SUBSIDES NATURALLY, AND</p><p>THE TRUE FACE SHOWS ITSELF.</p><p>That's what I have been telling you. To be a buddha is not a
difficult job. It is not some achievement for which you need a Nobel
Prize. It is the easiest thing in the world, because it has already
happened without your knowing.</p><p>The buddha is already breathing in you. Just a little recognition,
just a little turning inwards... and that has not to be done forcibly.
If you do it forcibly you will miss the point. It is very delicate. You
have to look inward playfully, not seriously. That's what he means by
"taking things easily." Don't take anything seriously.</p><p>Existence is very easy. You have got your life without any effort,
you are living your life without any effort. You are breathing perfectly
well without being reminded; your heartbeat continues even in your sleep
-- so easy is existence with you! But you are not so easy with
existence. You are very close-fisted. You want everything to be turned
into an achievement.</p><p>Enlightenment cannot be an achievement. That which you have already
-- how can it be an achievement? The authentic master simply takes away
things which you don't have and you believe you have, and he gives you
that which you already have. You are having many things which you don't
have at all, you just believe that you have them. The master's function
is that of a surgeon, to cut all that is not you and leave behind just
the essential core -- the eternal being.</p><p>It is a very easy phenomenon; you can do it on your own. There are no
problems and no risk in taking things easily, but people take things
very tensely. They take things very seriously, and that spoils the whole
game.</p><p>And remember, life is a game. Once you understand it as a game, a
deep playfulness arises on its own accord. The victory is not the point;
the point is to play totally, joyously, dancingly.</p><p>What is called playfulness is very essential in the inquiry of your
own being.</p><p>TAKING THINGS EASILY, SAYS BUKKO, AND WITHOUT FORCING, AFTER</p><p>SOME TIME THE RUSH OF THOUGHT, OUTWARD AND INWARD, SUBSIDES</p><p>NATURALLY, AND THE TRUE FACE SHOWS ITSELF.</p><p>When I say to you that meditation is nothing but thoughtlessness, you
can misunderstand me. You are not to do anything to become thoughtless,
because whatever you will do will be again a thought. You have to learn
to see the procession of thoughts, standing by the side of the road as
if it does not matter to you what is passing by. Just the ordinary
traffic</p><p>-- if you can take your thoughts in such a manner that they are not
of much concern, then easily, slowly, the caravan of thoughts which has
continued for thousands of years disappears.</p><p>You have to understand a simple thing, that giving attention is
giving nourishment. If you don't give any attention but remain
unconcerned, the thoughts start dying on their own.</p><p>They don't have any other way to get energy, any other source of
life. You are their energy, and because you go on giving them attention,
seriously, you think it is very difficult to be free from thought. It is
the easiest thing in the world, but it has to be done in the right
way.</p><p>The right way is just to stand by the side. The traffic goes on --
let it go. Don't make any judgment of good and bad; don't appreciate,
don't condemn. That is what is meant by being easy. It is all okay.</p><p>WITHOUT FORCING... and that is something that has to be remembered,
because our natural tendency is that if we have to become thoughtless,
why not force the thoughts?</p><p>Why not throw them out? But by the very act of forcing them, you are
giving them energy, you are giving them nourishment, you are taking note
of them and you are making them important -- so important that without
throwing them, you</p><p>cannot meditate.</p><p>Just try to throw out any single thought, and you will see how
difficult it is. The more you throw it the more it bounces back! It will
enjoy the game very much, and you are going to be defeated finally. You
have taken a wrong route.</p><p>I have always told an ancient Tibetan story.â¦</p><p>A young man was very much interested in the esoteric, in the
mysterious. He found a saint who was known to have many secrets, but it
was very difficult to get any secret from him. The young man said, "I
will see. I will devote my whole life to his service, and I will get the
secrets, the mysteries."</p><p>So he remained with the old saint. The old saint told him, "You are
unnecessarily wasting your time. I don't have anything, I am just a poor
old soul. Because I don't speak, people think I am keeping some secret.
But I don't have anything to say, so I remain silent."</p><p>But the man said, "I cannot be persuaded so easily. You will have to
give me the secret which opens the door of all the mysteries."</p><p>Tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was
there... the poor old saint had to arrange for his food, had to ask
somebody to take care for his clothes; the winter was coming and he
would need more clothes. It had become a burden. Finally the old man got
fed up. He told the young fellow, "Today I am going to tell you the
secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple."</p><p>In Tibet there is a common mantra which religious people repeat: Om
mani padme hum.</p><p>He said, "Everything is hidden in this."</p><p>But the young man said, "Don't befool me! Everybody knows this
mantra, it is not a secret. It is the most widely known mantra to the
Tibetans."</p><p>He said, "It is true, it is widely known. But the key is not known to
them for opening it.</p><p>Do you know the key for opening it?"</p><p>The young man said, "Key? I have never heard that there is a key to
open a mantra."</p><p>"That is the secret! The key is, while you are repeating the mantra
-- just for five minutes</p><p>-- just don't let any monkey pop into your head."</p><p>He said, "You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never
thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?"</p><p>He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived.
But strangely, even though he was not reciting the mantra, monkeys
started coming, giggling. He would close his eyes and they would be
there. He would run to this side and they would be there.</p><p>They were not outside, they were inside his head. And slowly slowly
the crowd was becoming bigger. As far as he could see, only monkeys and
monkeys, and doing all kinds of circus!</p><p>He said, "My god, this is the key? I am finished! I have not even
started the mantra."</p><p>Finally he said, "Let me take a good bath and get rid of all these
monkeys." But the more he pushed them away, the more they jumped towards
him. He took the bath, he burned incense, he sat in a religious lotus
posture, but whatever he was doing, monkeys were watching from every
side. He said, "It is strange -- monkeys have never visited this
house..." The whole night he tried, but he could not repeat this simple
mantra Om mani padme hum without monkeys jumping in.</p><p>By the morning he was so tired. He said, "This old saint, I will kill
him! What kind of key...?" In the morning he rushed to the old saint and
said, "Please take away your key. I am almost mad!"</p><p>The old man said, "That's why I was not telling anybody, because the
key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent?"</p><p>He said, "I don't want to listen to a single word from you. You just
take this key back and let me go home. And I don't want these monkeys to
follow me!"</p><p>The saint said, "If you give back the key, never repeat the mantra
again. The monkeys will come! I cannot help it, they are not in my
power."</p><p>The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He descended the same
steps and there was no monkey at all. He closed his eyes and there was
no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He said, "It is
strange..." He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he
says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming,
from all directions!</p><p>You cannot repress any thought. The very repressive process gives it
energy, life, strength. And it weakens you because you become a defeated
partner in the game. The easiest thing is not to force but to be just a
witness. If a monkey comes, let him come.</p><p>Just say "Hello!" and he will go. But don't tell him to go. Just be a
witness that a monkey has come, or a thousand monkeys have come. What
does it matter? It is none of your business. They may be going to some
gathering, some religious festival, so let them go. It is none of your
concern. And soon the crowd will disappear, seeing that "the man is not
interested."</p><p>All your thoughts are in the same category. Never force any thought
to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the
energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw
it away the more it will come back.</p><p>Hence, what Bukko is saying is the only way -- I say the only way --
to be thoughtless: don't pay any attention. Just remain silently
watching all kinds of things... monkeys and elephants, let them pass.
Soon you will find an empty road, and when you find an empty road, you
have found an empty mind -- naturally. Everything outward and inward
subsides and there is the tremendous silence which easiness brings.</p><p>NOW BODY AND MIND, FREE FROM ALL MOTIVATIONS, ALWAYS APPEAR</p><p>AS VOID AND ABSOLUTE SAMENESS.</p><p>When you are in the state of no-mind, which is equivalent to
thoughtlessness... when there is no thought cloud moving in your mind,
you attain to the clarity of no-mind.</p><p>Mind is simply a combination of all the thoughts, of all the clouds.
Mind has no independent nature of its own. When all the thoughts are
gone and the sky is clean and clear, you will see that everything that
you have paid so much attention to is nothing but emptiness. Your
thoughts were all empty. They contained nothing, they were void.</p><p>Whatever you thought they contained was your own energy. You have
withdrawn your energy -- just the empty shell of the thought falls down.
You have withdrawn your identity and immediately the thought is no
longer alive. It was your identity that was giving it life force.</p><p>And strangely enough, you thought that your thoughts were very strong
and it was difficult to get rid of them! You were making them strong,
you were cultivating them.</p><p>Just by forcing them, you were getting into a fix.</p><p>I agree with Bukko. I have agreed out of my own experience that you
can simply sit or lie down and let the thoughts pass by. They will not
leave even a trace. Just don't get interested... and don't be
DISinterested either, just be neutral. To be neutral is to be easy, and
to be neutral is to take back the very life force that you have given to
your thoughts.</p><p>Suddenly, a man of no thought becomes so full of energy -- energy
which he had spread into the thoughts unnecessarily. He was weak because
he was nourishing thoughts, which leads nowhere. They promise --
thoughts are politicians. They promise great things to come, but the
moment they have power, they forget all their promises. This has been
going on for centuries.</p><p>Those promises are just seductive. Your thoughts are promising you
many things: "You can be this, you can be that." And they drive you,
they give you motivation to become the greatest leader in the world, to
become the richest man in the world. They drive you into ambitions, they
become your masters. It is one of the weirdest phenomena that the
servants become masters, and the master becomes just a servant. The
moment you take your energy back you become a tremendous force, gathered
in your own being and center.</p><p>This is the first and the most important thing to understand: never
force anything, just let it go easily. If you ever want to find out what
the secret of your life is, then you have to go inwards. And thoughts
are always going outwards;</p><p>every thought takes you outwards.</p><p>When all thoughts cease, there is nowhere to go -- you simply are at
home. This at-homeness is meditation.</p><p>Utter silence and peace prevails.</p><p>In this silence every ambition seems to be stupid; the whole world of
objects seems to be nothing but a dream. And your own being shines in
its BRIGHTNESS OF HEAVEN, AT</p><p>THE CENTER OF THE VAST EXPANSE OF PHENOMENAL THINGS, AND NEEDING NO
POLISHING OR CLEANING.</p><p>Your own being is so pure, so unpolluted, not even a particle of dust
has ever reached there -- cannot reach. Only your consciousness can
reach there, and consciousness arises in you with no-mind. With no-mind
you become so wakeful, so watchful -- nowhere to go outside, because all
thoughts are gone. So you turn inwards, and for the first time face your
own original being.</p><p>THIS IS BEYOND ALL CONCEPTS...</p><p>What you are going to face in your meditation is beyond all concepts.
This is a very pregnant statement.</p><p>... BEYOND BEING AND NON-BEING. We are using the word `being' because
you will not be able to understand, while your thoughts are there, that
something beyond being and beyond non-being is in existence within you.
But when thoughts are gone, the first encounter is with a being, an
individual being, bright and clean. And as you enter this being, you
find yourself going beyond your individuality into the universal, which
is beyond being and non-being.</p><p>This is what ultimate enlightenment is. And Bukko has put it in the
simplest possible way.</p><p>LEAVE YOUR INNUMERABLE KNOWINGS AND SEEINGS AND</p><p>UNDERSTANDINGS, AND GO TO THAT GREATNESS OF SPACE. WHEN YOU</p><p>COME TO THAT VASTNESS, THERE IS NO SPECK OF BUDDHISM IN YOUR</p><p>HEART.</p><p>He is really a great master. His love towards Buddha is great, but
that does not mean that he is a follower of Buddha. He is saying that
when you enter into this great space, you will not find anything -- NO
SPECK OF BUDDHISM even in your heart. AND WHEN</p><p>THERE IS NO SPECK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOU -- you will not know</p><p>anything, even about yourself -- YOU WILL HAVE THE TRUE SIGHT OF
THE</p><p>BUDDHAS and the great masters.</p><p>Buddha himself had a great difficulty. Perhaps no man has had such a
great difficulty in explaining his experience. In this country, the
self, atma, has been considered to be the ultimate experience. The two
other religions of this country, Hinduism and Jainism, have both
emphasized that to know your self is all, there is nothing beyond it.
Now, Buddha was going against all of India's traditions by saying that
the self is only a door to no-self.</p><p>Don't stop at the door, it is a bridge to be passed. Don't make your
house on the bridge because a vaster universe is ready to welcome you if
you can leave this small idea of your self.</p><p>What is this self that you carry, that all the traditions of this
country and other countries think so much of? Hundreds of philosophers
came to Gautam Buddha, saying, "What you are saying goes against the
VEDAS, against the UPANISHADS."</p><p>He said, "What can I do? It is my own experience, I cannot deny it.
The self has to be transcended; only then you become one with the
universe. The dewdrop has to disappear into the ocean."</p><p>Why cling to the dewdrop?</p><p>What are you gaining by it?</p><p>Have you ever observed? -- all the religions teach that you should
liberate yourself from misery, from sin. You should earn virtue so that
you can make a place in paradise. "You"</p><p>are the center of all the religions -- but not of Zen.</p><p>All the religions say, "Liberate yourself from your attachments."
Only Zen has the strange courage to say, "Liberate yourself from
yourself!" Liberating yourself from your attachments is child's play.
The real, authentic seeker finally liberates himself not only from other
things but even from himself. He drops the very idea that Ã am'.</p><p>Existence is.</p><p>Looked at from this viewpoint, it can be said that you are the center
of all misery. And however you try, you will find you are only changing
misery, from one misery to another misery. Maybe in the gap you feel a
little light. From one marriage to another marriage --</p><p>just in the meantime, while you have to wait, you feel good. But this
goodness is not going to last, you are already filling in the form for
another marriage.</p><p>You are the problem.</p><p>All other problems are just your children -- a bus load of children,
and you are the driver.</p><p>Buddhism, particularly, introduced the idea that it is not a question
of dropping this greed, that anger, this passion, that possession. The
question is of dropping yourself completely, disappearing into the
universal energy from where we have arisen.</p><p>In India, Buddha was not understood. I am experiencing the same
thing. In India I am not understood, because India has, for ten thousand
years or more, believed in the self as the ultimate value.</p><p>Self is not the ultimate value. What are you going to do with the
self when you find it?</p><p>Just sitting stupidly, looking weird to everybody. Just for a moment
think: You have found your self, now what are you going to do? And
remember, once you have found it, you cannot escape from it. It clings
like German glue! It is not Indian glue.â¦</p><p>Buddha took a tremendous step in the world of consciousness when he
said, "The self is only a stepping stone. Step beyond it! And going
beyond it, you are just empty."</p><p>But this "empty" is not nothingness. The word that Buddha used has
been translated either as "emptiness" or as "nothingness," but in
English both words have a negative connotation. Buddha's word was
shunyata. It is not a negative phenomenon.</p><p>Bukko gives it perhaps the best expression I have come across: WHEN
YOU CAN GO AND COME IN ALL REGIONS EQUALLY, WHEN THERE</p><p>IS NOTHING SPECIALLY YOURS, NO WITHIN, NO WITHOUT, WHEN YOU</p><p>CONFORM TO HIGH AND CONFORM TO LOW, CONFORM TO THE SQUARE</p><p>AND CONFORM TO THE ROUND, THAT IS IT.</p><p>When you are simply available, with no self, you don't have any
boundaries anymore.</p><p>Without boundaries you can conform to anything.</p><p>THE EMPTINESS OF THE SEA ALLOWS WAVES TO RISE...</p><p>And your emptiness will also allow waves of blissfulness,
peacefulness, splendor and unknown glory. You are at the highest peak
available to any consciousness. But all these are still waves according
to Bukko. That's why I say he has made a great statement.</p><p>THE EMPTINESS OF THE SEA ALLOWS WAVES TO RISE; THE EMPTINESS OF</p><p>THE MOUNTAIN VALLEY MAKES THE VOICE ECHO...</p><p>It is empty; otherwise how can it echo the voice?</p><p>Just nearby in Matheran, there is an echo point. A very clear echo
point -- I have seen other echo points in other mountains also. Whatever
you say it simply repeats, the whole valley. If you bark like a dog, the
whole valley barks like a dog. If you sing a song, the whole valley
sings the song. Its emptiness allows it to conform to anything.</p><p>And Bukko is saying that when you are utterly empty of being and
no-being, of mind and no-mind... When you are just merged into the
universal it can be said from one side that you are empty, but from the
other side you are so full that now you can conform to anything. You can
be the moon, you can be the rose, you can be the clouds. Or you can just
remain the empty sky.</p><p>For the first time you are free to be anything you want. For the
first time your emptiness allows you to experience existence from
different angles.</p><p>It is a vast phenomenon. We know only small parts of it because our
self-ness creates a boundary. We cannot go beyond the boundary.</p><p>THE EMPTINESS OF THE HEART MAKES THE BUDDHA.</p><p>Once your heart is empty, you are the buddha -- serene, silent,
utterly blissful, at home.</p><p>When I say to you that you are a buddha, I mean it. It is just that
you have to recover from your dreams, afflictions, addictions. You just
have to penetrate deeply to the point where even the self starts
disappearing and the door opens to the vast, to the infinite. To be a
buddha is the ultimate experience of joy, of eternity, of immortality,
freedom and liberation.</p><p>And nobody else can do it for you. It is simple: you have to do it
yourself.</p><p>WHEN YOU EMPTY THE HEART, THINGS APPEAR AS IN A MIRROR, SHINING</p><p>THERE WITHOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM. LIFE AND DEATH AN</p><p>ILLUSION, ALL THE BUDDHAS ARE ONE'S OWN BODY.</p><p>ZEN IS NOT SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS; IT IS JUST HITTING AND PIERCING</p><p>THROUGH.</p><p>I am reminded... A great industrialist had imported a totally new,
sophisticated machine.</p><p>It worked so beautifully, a hundred times more productive than the
older one, but one day it stopped. Nobody knew what to do.</p><p>The manufacturers were informed, and they said, "We can send our man.
But his fee is ten thousand dollars plus all traveling expenses."</p><p>The industrialist was losing thousands of dollars every day. He
agreed; he said, "Send him immediately, right now." The man came from
the airport and without wasting a single moment, he took from his
handbag a small hammer and hit the machine at a certain point and it
started working.</p><p>The owner of the factory said, "But this is too much! Ten thousand
dollars just for hitting it with this little hammer?"</p><p>The expert said, "No, for hitting with the hammer just one dollar
will do. The real thing is knowing where to hit."</p><p>It is true, ZEN IS NOT SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS. IT IS JUST HITTING AND
PIERCING THROUGH.</p><p>But don't believe in Bukko. The point is where to hit. It is not
mysterious, but the problem is where to hit. Once you hit at the right
time, at the right place, it is really very simple; there is nothing
mysterious about it.</p><p>That's what I have been continuously trying to get you to experience,
because there is no way to tell you where to hit. Everybody has to find
the place by going deeper into himself, seeing where the light is coming
from, where the life is coming from, and then moving in that direction
without any fear. This is what he means by "hitting and piercing
through."</p><p>Then don't stop. It will be very beautiful. Even in the beginning,
the moment you see your light, your life source, it will have a
tremendous beauty and there will be a desire to stop, that you have
arrived. Don't do that. Much more lies ahead. Until you are finished
completely... when you look all around and you don't find yourself --
that is the goal.</p><p>This beyond is the buddha.</p><p>IF YOU CUT OFF ALL DOUBTS, THE COURSE OF LIFE-AND-DEATH IS CUT</p><p>OFF NATURALLY.</p><p>I ASK YOU ALL: DO YOU SEE IT OR DON'T YOU? -- HOW IN JUNE THE
SNOW</p><p>MELTS FROM THE TOP OF MOUNT FUJI.</p><p>He is saying that just as in June the snow starts melting from Mount
Fuji... so simply, without making any fuss. As June comes, the snow does
not say, "Wait a little, I am engaged in something else and I have to
wait a little." No -- no resistance, no delaying, no postponing. As June
comes, the snow starts melting.</p><p>So when you reach to the point where you feel, "this is my center,"
then start melting.</p><p>Your June has come. Then start melting and disappearing. Your very
disappearance is making you the whole universe.</p><p>Buddha has said, "When I disappeared, I saw stars within me, sun
rising, sunset, full-moon nights -- everything within me, not without
me. It was my boundary that had been keeping them out. Now the boundary
is no more; everything has fallen in. Now I am the whole."</p><p>At the time of his death the Zen monk, Guin, wrote: ALL DOCTRINES
SPLIT ASUNDER</p><p>ZEN TEACHING CAST AWAY --</p><p>FOURSCORE YEARS AND ONE.</p><p>THE SKY NOW CRACKS AND FALLS THE EARTH CLEAVES OPEN --</p><p>IN THE HEART OF THE FIRE LIES A HIDDEN SPRING.</p><p>When all is dropping and disappearing, in the heart of all this
disappearance is hidden your spring. From this point you will start
growing new flowers that you have never seen before.</p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IN THE WEST, THEY SAY THAT LOVE -- TWO FULL HEARTS -- MAKES THE</p><p>WORLD GO ROUND. JUDGING BY THE CASUALTY RATE, FULL HEARTS</p><p>DON'T SEEM TO BE THE ANSWER.</p><p>WHAT IS THE WORLD OF THE EMPTY HEART OF ZEN?</p><p>In the first place, whatever is said in the West, that "love -- two
full hearts -- makes the world go round" is all nonsense. Whether you
are here or not, the world will continue to go round.</p><p>And two hearts full of love... where are you going to find them?</p><p>The world would have stopped long ago if it were dependent on two
hearts full of love.</p><p>Even to find one heart is very difficult; two is too much! But those
are just mass- mind oriented proverbs, not statements of a man like
Bukko.</p><p>When Bukko says the empty heart is the buddha, he is talking about a
very authentic experience. And it does not depend on anybody else.</p><p>Love is both, a joy and a misery, because two are involved. Wherever
there is duality, there is going to be conflict. You can put the
conflict aside for a few days on the honeymoon, but after the honeymoon
the conflict arises on every point. What kind of curtains? -- and
immediately there are two voices. What kind of carpets, and what kind of
literature, what kind of furniture? On every point you will find that
those great lovers are in absolute disagreement! There is the beginning
of real love, which always ends in divorce.</p><p>The world of religion is not the world of duality. It is a world of
oneness. You have to find your own heart, utterly empty, empty of all
rubbish. And when your heart is empty of all rubbish, you are the
buddha. There is no other experience which goes beyond it.</p><p>Now before you become buddhas, a few laughs, because a few may come
back, a few may not come back. Those who come back will celebrate, but
for those who will not come back from this great inner journey, some
laughs as a goodbye.â¦</p><p>Kowalski and Olga are making love in the upstairs bedroom. Just as
Kowalski is about to start up his machinery, they hear a loud banging
noise downstairs.</p><p>"What's that?" asks Olga, jumping up in bed.</p><p>"Nothing," pants Kowalski. "Come on, let's get on with it!"</p><p>"No! No way!" demands Olga. "No lovemaking until you find out what is
going on downstairs."</p><p>Poor Kowalski stumbles downstairs with a very large erection, and
flips on the the lights.</p><p>Suddenly, the cat jumps out of the window. The dog dives under the
sofa. And the parrot, trapped in its cage, looks around frantically,
then tucks one leg under its wing and screams, "Wait! Wait, you silly
Polack... you wouldn't fuck a cripple would you?"</p><p>Terrence and Mrs.Â Tuber, the TV Couch Potatoes, are propped up on
their potato</p><p>couch, chewing peanuts and watching their favorite soap opera "The
Potato Family" on television.</p><p>When the doorbell rings, Chip the dog starts barking, and Terrence
looks around at it and accidentally pops a peanut into his ear. He is
still sitting on his potato couch with his head tipped to one side,
trying to get the peanut out, when his daughter and her boyfriend Frito
walk in.</p><p>Frito immediately sees the situation and offers to help Terrence to
get the peanut out.</p><p>"Look," says Frito, "I'll cover your mouth, stick my two fingers into
your nostrils and then blow into your other ear."</p><p>In desperation, Terrence agrees to give this a try. Frito stuffs his
fingers tightly into the couch potato's nose and blows into his ear.
Sure enough, the peanut pops out the other side.</p><p>Later that evening, Terrence and Mrs.Â Tuber are propped up in bed
watching a re-run of</p><p>"The Potato Family" on television, when Mrs.Â Tuber asks her husband,
"That Frito is such a nice boy, what do you think he will do when he
leaves school?"</p><p>"I don't know what his plans are," replies Terrence. "But from the
smell of his fingers, I think he will probably be our son-in-law."</p><p>"Hey man," says Swami Haridas to his friend, Stonehead Niskriya, "how
come you got home so early from your date with Papaya Pineapple last
night?"</p><p>"Well," explains Stonehead, "after dinner we went back to her
apartment. We sat on her bed listening to music, talked for a while, and
drank some herb tea. Then she slowly undressed, pulled back the bed
covers, lay down, reached over me, and turned out the light."</p><p>"So?" asks Haridas. "What happened?"</p><p>"Well, I can take a hint," replies Stonehead. "So I went home!"
Nivedano...</p><p>(Gibberish) Nivedano...</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be frozen; gather all
your life energy inwards and look in.</p><p>Deeper and deeper.</p><p>Find the center of your being.</p><p>Finding the center of your being is the door that leads you beyond
yourself, that makes you a buddha.</p><p>Be well acquainted with this new space you are in, because you have
to carry the buddha twenty-four hours -- in your gestures, in your
actions, in your words, in your silence, waking or sleeping.</p><p>If one can remain with this silence, then there is no need to follow
any discipline, any virtue. Everything will happen on its own accord,
spontaneously.</p><p>And when things happen spontaneously they have a beauty of their own.
It is a blissful moment.</p><p>You are dissolved</p><p>into an oceanic consciousness, you are at home,</p><p>realizing that which you have carried since the very beginning, for
thousands of lives, but have never looked into it...</p><p>never searched for it, have taken it for granted. It is the most
precious treasure in you.</p><p>It is the whole universe falling in you. Nivedano, to make it
clear...</p><p>Relax, and just watch the body, the mind. You remain a watcher.</p><p>Just a watcher.</p><p>Your body is born and dies.</p><p>Your mind every moment changes. Only this watcher is your eternity.
Remember it.</p><p>Remind yourself of it.</p><p>And slowly slowly make it your ordinary, simple life experience, just
like breathing. You don't have to make any effort.</p><p>When your buddha is that spontaneous, you have found the truth.</p><p>Nivedano...</p><p>Come back, and bring with you all the fragrance that you have
gathered. Sit down, slowly, gracefully as a buddha, for a few
seconds.</p><p>This is going to be your lifestyle. I don't want any followers.</p><p>I want everybody to be a buddha, a master unto himself.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p>Can we celebrate the buddhas? Yes!</p><p>The Buddha: The Emptiness of the Heart Chapter #2</p><p>Â </p><div class=toc><p><a href=part1 class=toc0>Chapter title: Twenty-four hours a

OUR BELOVED MASTER, DAIKAKU SAID:
ZEN PRACTICE IS NOT CLARIFYING CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTIONS, BUT
THROWING AWAY ONE'S PRECONCEIVED VIEWS AND NOTIONS AND THE
SACRED TEXTS AND ALL THE REST, AND PIERCING THROUGH THE
LAYERS
OF COVERINGS OVER THE SPRING OF SELF BEHIND THEM....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>230 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;48887 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Osho</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Chapter title: Twenty-four hours a day" href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_buddha__emptiness_of_the_heart/part1/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://osho.lol/>Osho - The complete works of Osho</a></span> Â·

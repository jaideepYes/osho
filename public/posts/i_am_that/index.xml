‌CHAPTER 1
Beyond the Changing
11 October 1980 am in Buddha Hall
AUM
THAT IS THE WHOLE.
THIS IS THE WHOLE.
FROM WHOLENESS EMERGES WHOLENESS. WHOLENESS COMING FROM WHOLENESS, WHOLENESS STILL REMAINS.
AT THE HEART OF THIS PHENOMENAL WORLD, WITHIN ALL ITS CHANGING FORMS,
DWELLS THE UNCHANGING LORD. SO, GO BEYOND THE CHANGING, AND, ENJOYING THE INNER, CEASE TO TAKE FOR YOURSELF

It is Already the Best
26 October 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I AM FEELING HELPLESS. I DON’T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO ANY MORE. IT IS AS IF EVERYTHING I DO WON’T CHANGE THIS, IT ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE. BUT ALSO DOING NOTHING DOES NOT MAKE THINGS BETTER. YOU SAY THAT EMPTINESS IS BLISS. FOR ME IT SEEMS TO BE DULL AND BORING; IT IS LIKE BEING DEAD.</description>

Living in your own Light

Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS GOD?

IT IS FAR, YET IT IS NEAR.</description>

Both and More
19 October 1980 am in Buddha Hall
INTO A BLINDING DARKNESS GO THEY WHO WORSHIP ACTION ALONE. INTO AN EVEN GREATER DARKNESS GO THEY WHO WORSHIP MEDITATION. FOR IT IS OTHER THAN MEDITATION,
IT IS OTHER THAN ACTION.
THIS WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE ENLIGHTENED ONES. MEDITATION AND ACTION –
HE WHO KNOWS THESE TWO TOGETHER, THROUGH ACTION LEAVES DEATH BEHIND AND THROUGH MEDITATION GAINS IMMORTALITY.</description>

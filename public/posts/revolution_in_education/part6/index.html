He was rushing downwards as if he had heard some very important news from down the hill. He reached the plains, running and panting for breath. He asked the people in the market, “Have you heard the news?”\nPeople asked, “What news?”\nZarathustra said, “Such a big event has happened and you do not know! Did you not know that the God has died?”\nPeople were very puzzled. Zarathustra then felt that perhaps he had come too early, because the news had not yet reached the people.\nI was reading this story and I felt no important news ever reaches us. Those who bring such news all feel that they have come before their time, too early.\nI would also like to ask you, “Have you have heard that India has died?” Perhaps you will be shocked at this news. You may not have known it. Thousands of years have passed since; perhaps that is why you don’t feel it. Perhaps the news is so old and so many events have occurred since, that you do not even remember having heard the news. But I want to tell you that India died long ago.\nIqbal has sung, “There is something about it (India), that its existence does not end.” While I was reading this song I felt that first its existence has to have been, to end. If existence has already\nended, what remains to be ended? If a man is living, he can die. If a man has intellect, he can be mad. If there is no intellect, man cannot go mad. If a man is healthy, he can fall ill. But if one has no health, how can there be illness?\nCould it be that the real reason for the non-ending of India’s existence is that it has long before ceased? Now nothing has remained with us to end! I begin my talk with this news.\nThis country has died thousands of years ago. It is necessary for this country to search for a new life, a new soul. Certainly the teacher could have been of help in the search, but so far he has not been. Up till now the teacher has not proved to be the torch-bearer of our life. Up till now he has remained the agent of the old dead society. The teacher has remained the instrument and the medium for pouring into the mind of the new generation the customs of the old, dead, rotten society of the past.\nThe teacher can become the medium and the instrument for the birth of a new world, a new life and a new man, but he has not become so far. Let us understand this truth about the teacher first.\nTill today what has been the work of a teacher? What work has the society taken from the teacher? Society says that we are taking the work of teaching and educating our children from the teacher. But on looking deeply it is found that the society also takes the work of passing on all the old diseases, blind beliefs and false knowledge into the minds of new generations, through the teacher. The society does not tolerate a teacher who is revolutionary, because the day the teachers become revolutionary a new society will be born. The teachers becoming revolutionaries can become the basic cause for the change of the whole society. That is why an attempt has always been made not to allow the teacher to become a reactionary and retrogressive. He is given a lot of respect, it is true, but society gives that respect to the teacher only while no ray of rebellion is seen in him. If a ray of rebellion is seen in him, the society begins to be strangle his throat.\nYou may be surprised to know that from the world of teachers, no revolutionary thoughts, no new vision, no new views have ever arisen. The society has always tried to keep the teacher from becoming a revolutionary because it is one of the largest and the most powerful groups of people, and in its hands are the minds and souls of the new generation. If the teacher becomes a revolutionary it will cause a break between the old and the new society, because it is the teacher who hands over the old society into the hands of new society. The teacher is the middle link through which the past enters into the future. The teacher can do a lot, but perhaps he does not even have any such idea as being the forerunner of a revolution.\nUp till now the teacher has put all his energies only into adjusting the mind of the new generation to that of the old generations. He has tried to implant the beliefs and attitudes of the old society into the minds of the new generation so that those old ideas reach into the bloodstream of the new generation. The old society respects and honors the teacher just because he is the basis for saving the past. The day the teacher would be rebellious, a new society can be born every day, and the new generation can raise its eyes towards a new life.\nBut the teacher is not rebellious. In my view, a teacher who is not rebellious is not a teacher at all, and he loses the right to be a teacher. How can a teacher be a teacher who is not rebellious? Without being rebellious, the eyes do not open in the direction of knowledge. Without being rebellious, the\nsoul of man does not come out of its shell. Without being rebellious, one cannot remain in step with life.\nCan an education, a knowledge which does not give birth to the independent soul of man ever be called an education, a knowledge? It can be a burden, it can be just information, it can be learning – but education, never. Education should become the discovery of the soul, but it has not happened like that. The teacher has not yet acquired the attitude of a rebel. That is why the old, rotten society continues to live. What has already died remains alive in some form or the other.\nIn India this has become the most unfortunate happening of all. India has not even changed its old clothes; the question of changing its soul is very remote. The whole history of India is the history of non-rebelliousness. No revolution has taken place, no transformation has happened. When a society does not pass through revolutions, its life remains no longer a flowing stream but becomes a closed puddle which rots and stinks. It is just full of mud and stink because of lack of flow. There is a life like a river running towards the unknown ocean, passing through hills and valleys and crossing unknown plains. One life is like that of a river flowing towards the ocean, and there is another life like that of a pond, closed within itself, not moving anywhere.\nThe life of the Indian society has become like that of a pond, not that of a river. In one way the life of a pond is very secure: nowhere to go, no problems of the road, no straying away on unknown paths; no crossing of the hills, no dreams of the unknown ocean about which there can be no certainty to reach. The life of the pond has its own happiness, having a well-enclosed, carefree, fixed space. India is enjoying the happiness of the pond, not facing the struggle of a river. We have become so accustomed to this happiness that for thousands of years we have stopped taking any risks. Remember, the society which ceases to take risks, will slowly diminish the lighted flame of its life. The inner flame remains powerful only in facing risks.\nNietzsche kept a signboard on his table. Only two words were written on it. Whenever anyone asked him what was the essence of his life, he would point out to that signboard on which was written “Live dangerously.” The reality is that it is in living dangerously that life is felt. Living a protected life, one never experiences life. That is why those who live in graves live very safe. There is no danger. The life of a pond is a life of avoiding all dangers, but it stinks, becomes dirty and dries up.\nIndia has been living a secured life for centuries; has created its own cocoon and lives within it. We do not want to enter the expanses of this world and we do not want to travel to the moon and stars. We are bound to our homes. We are more like trees whose roots are bound to the land, than like man. We do not move from our places. Every son takes over his father’s place, generation after generation. Repetition continues. Men continue to change, but the society remains the same.\nIf a man who lived a thousand years ago came to a village in India today, he would not find any difference; everything is the same as it was in his own time. We feel very happy about this, and we say, our leaders say, “Rome has died, the Greece and Egypt of old have died. Where is Assyria and where is Babylon? But we are still here.” We respect our static situation greatly. It is not something to be respected, it is very insulting. This staticness clearly tells that we have become incapable of any change. We have lost that capacity for change. We are like a stone lying near a roseflower. The roseflower blossoms in the morning, dances in the light of the sun, tries to rise towards the sky, withers by the evening and falls down. But the stone that was lying nearby in the morning is lying\nthe same in the evening as it was in the morning. The stone must be thinking to itself, “Look! the flower withered away, but I am the same as I was earlier. Many flowers have come and are gone, but I remain.” The stone must be admiring itself, but the stone does not know the joy of being a flower. The stone does not know the thrill of change. It does not know that living, flowering, withering and falling to the ground has its own meaning and mystery. The stone does not know that only those wither who flower; only those fall who rise. It also does not know that only those die who live. If you want to avoid dying, avoid living. If you want to avoid falling, never rise up. If you are afraid of withering, do not ever blossom. But what does the poor stone know?\nI have heard: One morning in a garden, a strange event happened. There were small grass flowers that had grown, well protected by the protruding stones of a stone wall. Sheltered by the wall, those flowers never knew storms nor the light of the sun. They were living a sheltered life, not knowing the rains, nor the stars that twinkled in the night, but they were very safe, there was no danger for them.\nOne of the grass flowers lost his head and one day peeped out. He saw a roseflower rising upwards towards the sky. A desire arose in that grass flower, “Can I not be a roseflower? Cannot I rise upwards?” In the night he prayed to God to make him a roseflower. God told him that he should not be mad, that he was so well-protected, that the roseflower blossoms in the morning and withers in the evening and falls, whereas when he blossoms he lives on for weeks on end, he does not wither easily.\nThe grass flower replied, “That I understood. We stay blossoming because we don’t really blossom in the first place. And the grass flower is not so juicy from the very beginning, so we don’t wither away easily. No, I want to blossom like a roseflower, I want to have velvety petals like the roseflower. I do not want to live under the shadow of this stone wall, I want to rise up in the open sky – even for a moment, but I want to rise.”\nThe grass flower was adamant. The neighboring grass flowers also tried to persuade it, saying, “Have you gone mad? Such a thing has never been done in our family and tradition. This is an old custom, we just live here, buried in the stones. Even our forefathers never thought of going out in the open sky, nor did their forefathers. It is not written in our scriptures. What madness! It seems you have gone crazy! You are spoiled by the company of others. Remain within your limits. It is dangerous to step out of this place. You will die. Don’t you see how much trouble roseflowers have to endure? The day before there was a storm and all the roseflowers were lying flat on the ground. One day when it was raining, all the rose petals were found weeping. If there are high-speed winds, the rosebush gets shaken to its very roots. We remain safe and happy.\nThe grass flower, however, did not agree. It said, “No, even for a day, but I want to be a roseflower.” And when one does not agree, what can God do? God can do something only when one agrees. If you don’t agree, he is helpless. So in the morning the grass flower became the roseflower. Soon the sun rose, the clouds gathered in the sky, and a strong wind began to blow. All those grass flowers began to shout at the new roseflower from below: “Oh you crazy flower! Now you will die! For a moment’s happiness you lost your permanent comfort. Just for a moment, just to be a roseflower, you gave up your safety!”\nSoon after, thundering rains came with very strong winds. The thin stems of the roseflower started moving this way and that, and the rose petals began to fall. Even the leaves fell off. After some\ntime the roots of the rosebush, wet and weak, became uprooted and it fell over. While it was dying, a grass flower bent down and said, “You fool! Now have you come to your senses or not? For the sake of a moment’s experience under the sky, how much didn’t you suffer!”\nThe dying roseflower replied, “Friends, what I have known during these few moments, I never knew during a long life under the shadow of the stones. Rising for a moment towards the sky, struggling against the storm... maybe for a moment, but to stand facing the sun under an open sky! That struggle with the storm with my delicate branches! A few moments of blossoming – but really blossoming! The joy I experienced, the juice I felt – I am full of gratitude to God! And shame on you that you will never know what life is and what it means to struggle and live during a storm! You will live behind your safety wall and die there. Your life is unlived.”\nI don’t know if this really happened or not, but it seems in the life of the people of India this has happened. We are living under the shadow of security. We have become so fond of security that any courage to move in dangers is absolutely destroyed. And then of course, whatever is old feels familiar and safe. Unfamiliar feels unsafe, unknown frightens. Unfamiliar paths create fear in us. So we have made a path and like a drudge we go round and round over it for thousands of years. Our teachers also initiate the new generation into the same old path on which our forefathers used to move.\nNo, that way the new India cannot take birth. The teachers of India will have to courageously take steps to break this situation and raise the consciousness of the people. Certainly there are dangers in dealing with the unknown, but why be afraid of danger? It is better to face the danger of the unknown rather than be secure with what is known, because in dealing with the unknown there is an interest in life; there arises energy to live and there is a challenge in life.\nIf the teachers of India decide to free the new generation from moving on the old fixed paths, it is possible for the soul of India to be born – otherwise not. They should decide to encourage the new generation to take up challenges and cut new paths, climb the mountains and cross the oceans and go into space. But we are in the habit of preventing children even from going into darkness, telling them that the night has come. We prevent them from jumping into the river which is flooded, from jumping into the sea. We say, “Where is the necessity to climb Everest?” Everest is the highest crest of the Indian Himalayas, which since the past one hundred years people from the West have been trying to climb. Many have died in the attempt, and we are laughing at them, sitting secure in our caves. We tell them, “Why do you climb? Are you mad? What is there on top except ice?”\nWe, however, do not know that the children of those communities that are prevented from climbing the hills, the very soul of those communities is prevented from rising to new heights, and it prevents their souls also from rising.\nThousands of children climb the Alps. Every year during their holidays many of them die in their attempt to climb the Alps. But knowing this full well, their parents and teachers do not stop them, just giving them the statistics of deaths last year. Where there is youth, there will be enterprise and climbing.\nHundreds of boys and girls cross the English Channel, whereas we have lost the courage to cross even a small rivulet. First we try to find how deep it is, whether our forefathers have ever crossed it\nor not. If our ancestors never crossed it, we are not going to do that because we only follow in their footprints. We cannot take any initiative. Why put our easy life in danger? Our personalities are so fearful that we cling to the corpses. There is no way the new can be born. If we get rid of the old, only then the new is born.\nThe most important task the teacher has to do is to make India free from its clinging to the old. The teacher should know that he is guilty if he ever tries to create infatuation for the old in children. He has to prepare the children for inviting the new, for being aware of the new, for embracing the new. Prepare the children to be attracted by the unknown and to listen to the call of the unknown.\nAmerican children are thinking of living on the moon, but Indian children do not do anything more than watch the drama of “Ramleela.” Rama was beautiful and Ramleela is also beautiful, but how long will we continue to watch it? Even Rama would be feeling very much harassed by now as to, “Why are these people after me year after year to enact the same drama?” There will be other Ramas in the future, don’t we need to care about that? Many other Ramleelas are going to be played, not only on this earth but on the moon and Mars, and other stars as well.\nBut for us everything has happened in the past. Nothing is to happen in future – all our work is over. The god of history has closed the doors and gone ahead. Now there is no more history. Now only one work remains to be done and that is to ruminate over past history. Just as the buffaloes go on ruminating while sitting chewing grass, we also go on ruminating over past history. Don’t we have to create anything new, don’t we have to give birth to the future, and don’t we have to be anything new? Don’t we have some dreams in our heart to create a new tomorrow? And don’t we want to create some place where none of our forefathers has even set foot? What is the purpose and meaning of our life if we only have to walk in the footsteps of our forefathers?\nWe have to decide to walk on the paths where our forefathers never set foot. We will see such visions which our forefathers never saw, we will undertake voyages which have never been undertaken, we will walk on virgin lands where so far nobody has ever walked.\nBut no, our very aspirations have died. We go on looking for the old trodden paths and continue to walk on them. Hence, in India the new is not taking birth. If the new is not born, life becomes sad. Life has become sad. Every man is sad, tired and defeated. Every man is praying to God for only one thing: to make him free from the chain of rebirth. Somehow one wants to get rid of this life: where is liberation? Every living man goes on asking where is salvation, where is emancipation? We have made life so wretched that except for praying to get rid of it, nothing else seems relevant.\nThe whole country has become very sad. It is bound to be sad. By staying in the old for long, the mind becomes sad. When a calendar is hanging in our house, we tear off the past date every day. Likewise, every day the old must be discarded so that the new that is hidden behind can appear. In the mind of India, a new date never appears. The calendar is thousands of years old. There are so many old dates in it that the new dates cannot be found, not even with great effort. We have never thrown away the old calendar. We have to do that, so that new dates can be seen.\nWhen we see the birth of the new, our soul dances with joy to welcome the new. A life of dance and cheer spreads all over, because there is great interest in knowing the unknown. The familiar becomes known, no interest remains for it. India has become interestless and hence it has died. Interest is a characteristic of life.\nIf we want India to revive, the teacher has to do a most important work. Perhaps there is no other more important work than this, and nobody else can do it either. No other section of the society can bring about this revolution. It is the teacher who has to be clear in his mind not to allow new children to be dominated by the old. Before that can happen, sow new seeds in them. Before their mind starts being burdened with the old, make them listen to the music of the new. Before their minds become dulled by old tunes, let the tunes of new songs reach them, so that they are stirred up and engaged in the search for the new.\nIt is necessary to save the children of India from their parents. It may sound peculiar but it is so. Who will do this? Parents go on casting their children in their own image. Till they complete this job they do not die. When the parents feel that their son has now reached the same development as they had, the parents pass on. Every generation is doing this. The old molds are ready for casting; every new child is being cast into the old molds. Who will prevent this? Who will protect children from their parents? If this is not done, this country cannot take a new birth.\nThe teacher can save the children from parents. But the teacher is not aware, the teacher is not conscious. He has become the agent of parents, he is working for them. Parents give him a salary so that he can cooperate in molding the children as they like. That is why this has become a vicious circle. How to break it? Someone should take the courage to do it. Difficulties will be there, because the society does not respect such a person, but somebody will have to bear the consequences; otherwise this country cannot take birth.\nExcepting the teacher, I do not see anyone else fit for the job. It is wrong to expect this from politicians; it is wrong to expect anything from them. For politicians, if good days arrive, mental treatment will have to be arranged; that much is alright, but nothing else can be expected from them. If the politicians from all the capital cities are arrested and they are sent away for treatment, the world will be different. But it is very unlikely that something can happen through them. Perhaps if people from the planet Mars arrive, something can be done. But there is no hope from our politicians, because they are the agents of all our diseases and they are exploiting our diseases. They have made our weaknesses stepping stones to climb into positions of power. Nothing good is to be expected from them. For them our weaknesses are their ladders, our diseases are their paths, and our ignorance, blind beliefs and foolishnesses are their stepping stones.\nWho else can help then? Sadhus and sannyasins? No. Once upon a time they were revolutionaries. That time is gone. Now sadhu-sannyasins are not revolutionaries. Once there was a time there were people like Buddha, Mahavira, Christ and Shankara. Those days are gone. Now sadhu-sannyasins are servants of the society. The society gives them meals and they go on praising the society. Their condition is no better than this. Nothing can be expected of them.\nThere is only one class of people which has not yet bothered to do anything. That is the educated class of teachers. It is quite a big class and has immense power. Its greatest power is that the new generation is in its hands. Before the new generation changes for the worse, the teachers can give a new direction, new awareness to the new generation. There is a tremendous power in their hands about which they are not aware. If the new principles of transforming life are brought to the minds of the students, the whole country can be transformed within twenty years, because in twenty years the old generation makes way for the new generation to come. The accumulated filth of thousands of years can be removed just within twenty years. But this can only be done by the teacher and no one else.\nSo first the teacher should become aware that he is committing a crime if he is communicating the old diseases into the new generations. Old generations were afflicted by Hindu-Muslim labels. If a teacher is teaching the children under his guidance that “You are a Hindu,” or “You are a Muslim,” he is committing a great offence. He must teach the new generation that “You are all human beings, not Muslims and not Hindus.” Then a new country will be born. If the old generation teaches that “You are a brahmin,” or “You are a sudra,” and if the teacher also confirms it, then he is the agent of the old generation. He will then continue the diseases, he cannot stop them.\nIt is enough to be a human being. If the new generation can understand this, the diseases of thousands of years can be destroyed within twenty years. Nothing can prevent this change. But the teacher is not aware and conscious about what he is doing.\nWe are infatuated with the old. The children should give up this infatuation with the old. In fact children are not interested in the old, they are very keen to know new things, but we are forcibly making them accept the old. Every day they must be taught the new. Courage, enterprise, risk- taking is the one virtue which, if it is inculcated into the minds of the future generations of India by the teachers – the work will be over.\nBut in the structure that is devised so far, the child becomes impotent because he is confused; he does not know what to do. The teacher does not know what to do and what not to do. The people in the society who are supposed to think of the subject also do not know what to do. There is restlessness, but no clear path is visible. It has to be properly thought out, what can be done, what is possible.\nI feel that we have a golden opportunity in our hands today, because there is more rebellious spirit in the minds of Indian children than any time before in the history so far. If the teacher can give proper direction to these rebellious children, the old rubbish can be put to the fire. From this energy of rebellion the new can take birth.\nBut the teacher is unable to understand even the potential of this rebellion that is born in children. He is not able to utilize this potential energy. In fact the teacher himself is afraid of it and he is trying to destroy this rebellion of the children from all sides. He does not know that he is committing a mistake.\nThe rebellion of the children is not to be destroyed, but it has to be given the right direction. This spirit of rebellion that has come in them, the soul that is born – which at present is throwing stones, breaking windows and chairs – this wonderful capacity to destroy that has arisen in them, can be directed to some worthy destruction. If we do not direct this energy properly, their anger will be wasted on destroying the wrong things. Breaking chairs and windows won’t help in any way, but this courage to break chairs is welcome. With that courage the Hindu-Muslim fanaticism can be broken, the brahmin-sudra stupidity can be stopped, the foolish walls created between man and woman can be removed. The rotten morality can be exposed and a new, more healthy, more scientific morality can be given birth.\nThe capacity to break has arrived – but the teacher is afraid of it. He thinks that this ability to destroy is bad. Furniture is being broken, windows are being broken – but I say to you that the children do not know what to break, that is why they are breaking chairs. If the teacher explains to them what\nis to be broken, then they will never break chairs; they will start breaking what needs to be broken. But the teacher is afraid. He says, “Do not break anything. Be disciplined.”\nHowever, you do not know that it is a great thing to break discipline. Discipline has a value, indiscipline has a value too. Discipline is valuable to maintain the society as it is. But when the society is to be changed, discipline is of no use, indiscipline becomes valuable. This is the time for change.\nUtilize the indiscipline that is there in children. Whatsoever is rotten can be destroyed with the help of these children. What has become a great burden like rock on the life of man should be changed. The teacher can do it because he is very near and intimate to them. But he too is unable to understand the children and does not know what is happening.\nIt is a good sign that this rebellious spirit is aroused in children. If the teacher can become aware of his revolutionary role and can understand that the burning torch of revolution is in his hands, perhaps these children will love their teacher as they have never loved before. The teacher then will be a collaborator in making a golden future for the children as he never was before.\nI have put before the teacher friends these few questions. What I am saying does not necessarily have to be right; it may all be wrong, so it is not necessary for you to believe it. But please think and meditate on whatsoever I have said.\nIt is necessary to give birth to a dialogue in the whole country, that the teachers begin to think, and they talk to the children, they try to understand them and then come to some decisions. Then I am very hopeful. A lot can be done. The situation is ripe, the opportunity is waiting, the whole climate is there; it is a God given opportunity and it is in our hands to utilize this great energy of transition. Or, would you rather just sit back and watch what is going on and condemn it as bad and not do anything? Would you rather be a spectator? Would you prove to be only a spectator in the life of the coming society? Then every day you will go to school and while you teach the children that two plus two is four, or teach them the ABC’s, the politicians will go on preparing atom bombs. While you teach them arithmetic and the geography of the earth, the politicians will continue the preparations for destroying the very earth itself.\nNo, this cannot be tolerated any more. Teach that two plus two makes four – but that is not the only work of a teacher. He should become the creator of a revolution too, then only does he become a teacher. He has to remain awake to everything that is happening around life. He has to be conscious of the new sprouts that have shot forth in children. He also has to be concerned about his own role in life.\nIndia has good teachers, but they are asleep. India has a very intelligent group of teachers, but they are not revolutionary. India has a long line of sincere teachers and teachers full of morality, but their sincerity and morality is retrogressive and reactionary. He is not a revolutionary and that is why he is watching helplessly. He feels there is nothing in his hands; he has only remained an instrument of the society.\nIn the whole world, India included, the politicians have cut off the teachers from the lifestream. Politicians tell the teachers that they should not worry about the quality of life and about politics;\nthey must do their work within the four walls of the school. The politician is very clever. He knows that if the teacher starts actively thinking about life, he has so much power in his hands that he will transform the whole society. So, cleverly and cunningly he has kept the teacher away from and separate from life as a whole.\nThe politicians have persuaded the teachers to feel that they are not concerned with life as such, that their great work is to teach the children that two plus two makes four and show them on the map where Timbuktu is, unmindful of whether Timbuktu actually exists! Now the possibility of saving humanity is becoming less and less, and if the teacher continues to watch silently this situation, I am not prepared to call him a teacher. The teacher has a great responsibility. The teacher is a midwife for the new generation.\nSocrates has defined the teacher as one who works as a midwife in giving birth to the new soul. Socrates has said it rightly. He was one of the most wonderful teachers of the world. He has rightly said that the teacher has to work just like a midwife and assist in giving birth to a new soul. If you are not becoming, we are not becoming that midwife, we have no right to call ourselves teachers.\nI have made a few humble suggestions here. I am grateful for your having heard me so silently and peacefully. Finally, I salute the divine residing within all of you. Accept my salutations.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6060","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/revolution_in_education/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/revolution_in_education/>Revolution in Education</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Fire of Rebellion</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6060 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Revolution_in_Education/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

of New India!</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra was coming down a hill. He was rushing downwards as if he
had heard some very important news from down the hill. He reached the
plains, running and panting for breath. He asked the people in the
market, “Have you heard the news?”</p><p><br></p><p>People asked, “What news?”</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra said, “Such a big event has happened and you do not know!
Did you not know that the God has died?”</p><p><br></p><p>People were very puzzled. Zarathustra then felt that perhaps he had
come too early, because the news had not yet reached the people.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading this story and I felt no important news ever reaches
us. Those who bring such news all feel that they have come before their
time, too early.</p><p><br></p><p>I would also like to ask you, “Have you have heard that India has
died?” Perhaps you will be shocked at this news. You may not have known
it. Thousands of years have passed since; perhaps that is why you don’t
feel it. Perhaps the news is so old and so many events have occurred
since, that you do not even remember having heard the news. But I want
to tell you that India died long ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Iqbal has sung, “There is something about it (India), that its
existence does not end.” While I was reading this song I felt that first
its existence has to have been, to end. If existence has already</p><p>ended, what remains to be ended? If a man is living, he can die. If a
man has intellect, he can be mad. If there is no intellect, man cannot
go mad. If a man is healthy, he can fall ill. But if one has no health,
how can there be illness?</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be that the real reason for the non-ending of India’s
existence is that it has long before ceased? Now nothing has remained
with us to end! I begin my talk with this news.</p><p><br></p><p>This country has died thousands of years ago. It is necessary for
this country to search for a new life, a new soul. Certainly the teacher
could have been of help in the search, but so far he has not been. Up
till now the teacher has not proved to be the torch-bearer of our life.
Up till now he has remained the agent of the old dead society. The
teacher has remained the instrument and the medium for pouring into the
mind of the new generation the customs of the old, dead, rotten society
of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher can become the medium and the instrument for the birth of
a new world, a new life and a new man, but he has not become so far. Let
us understand this truth about the teacher first.</p><p><br></p><p>Till today what has been the work of a teacher? What work has the
society taken from the teacher? Society says that we are taking the work
of teaching and educating our children from the teacher. But on looking
deeply it is found that the society also takes the work of passing on
all the old diseases, blind beliefs and false knowledge into the minds
of new generations, through the teacher. The society does not tolerate a
teacher who is revolutionary, because the day the teachers become
revolutionary a new society will be born. The teachers becoming
revolutionaries can become the basic cause for the change of the whole
society. That is why an attempt has always been made not to allow the
teacher to become a reactionary and retrogressive. He is given a lot of
respect, it is true, but society gives that respect to the teacher only
while no ray of rebellion is seen in him. If a ray of rebellion is seen
in him, the society begins to be strangle his throat.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be surprised to know that from the world of teachers, no
revolutionary thoughts, no new vision, no new views have ever arisen.
The society has always tried to keep the teacher from becoming a
revolutionary because it is one of the largest and the most powerful
groups of people, and in its hands are the minds and souls of the new
generation. If the teacher becomes a revolutionary it will cause a break
between the old and the new society, because it is the teacher who hands
over the old society into the hands of new society. The teacher is the
middle link through which the past enters into the future. The teacher
can do a lot, but perhaps he does not even have any such idea as being
the forerunner of a revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>Up till now the teacher has put all his energies only into adjusting
the mind of the new generation to that of the old generations. He has
tried to implant the beliefs and attitudes of the old society into the
minds of the new generation so that those old ideas reach into the
bloodstream of the new generation. The old society respects and honors
the teacher just because he is the basis for saving the past. The day
the teacher would be rebellious, a new society can be born every day,
and the new generation can raise its eyes towards a new life.</p><p><br></p><p>But the teacher is not rebellious. In my view, a teacher who is not
rebellious is not a teacher at all, and he loses the right to be a
teacher. How can a teacher be a teacher who is not rebellious? Without
being rebellious, the eyes do not open in the direction of knowledge.
Without being rebellious, the</p><p>soul of man does not come out of its shell. Without being rebellious,
one cannot remain in step with life.</p><p><br></p><p>Can an education, a knowledge which does not give birth to the
independent soul of man ever be called an education, a knowledge? It can
be a burden, it can be just information, it can be learning – but
education, never. Education should become the discovery of the soul, but
it has not happened like that. The teacher has not yet acquired the
attitude of a rebel. That is why the old, rotten society continues to
live. What has already died remains alive in some form or the other.</p><p><br></p><p>In India this has become the most unfortunate happening of all. India
has not even changed its old clothes; the question of changing its soul
is very remote. The whole history of India is the history of
non-rebelliousness. No revolution has taken place, no transformation has
happened. When a society does not pass through revolutions, its life
remains no longer a flowing stream but becomes a closed puddle which
rots and stinks. It is just full of mud and stink because of lack of
flow. There is a life like a river running towards the unknown ocean,
passing through hills and valleys and crossing unknown plains. One life
is like that of a river flowing towards the ocean, and there is another
life like that of a pond, closed within itself, not moving anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>The life of the Indian society has become like that of a pond, not
that of a river. In one way the life of a pond is very secure: nowhere
to go, no problems of the road, no straying away on unknown paths; no
crossing of the hills, no dreams of the unknown ocean about which there
can be no certainty to reach. The life of the pond has its own
happiness, having a well-enclosed, carefree, fixed space. India is
enjoying the happiness of the pond, not facing the struggle of a river.
We have become so accustomed to this happiness that for thousands of
years we have stopped taking any risks. Remember, the society which
ceases to take risks, will slowly diminish the lighted flame of its
life. The inner flame remains powerful only in facing risks.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche kept a signboard on his table. Only two words were written
on it. Whenever anyone asked him what was the essence of his life, he
would point out to that signboard on which was written “Live
dangerously.” The reality is that it is in living dangerously that life
is felt. Living a protected life, one never experiences life. That is
why those who live in graves live very safe. There is no danger. The
life of a pond is a life of avoiding all dangers, but it stinks, becomes
dirty and dries up.</p><p><br></p><p>India has been living a secured life for centuries; has created its
own cocoon and lives within it. We do not want to enter the expanses of
this world and we do not want to travel to the moon and stars. We are
bound to our homes. We are more like trees whose roots are bound to the
land, than like man. We do not move from our places. Every son takes
over his father’s place, generation after generation. Repetition
continues. Men continue to change, but the society remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man who lived a thousand years ago came to a village in India
today, he would not find any difference; everything is the same as it
was in his own time. We feel very happy about this, and we say, our
leaders say, “Rome has died, the Greece and Egypt of old have died.
Where is Assyria and where is Babylon? But we are still here.” We
respect our static situation greatly. It is not something to be
respected, it is very insulting. This staticness clearly tells that we
have become incapable of any change. We have lost that capacity for
change. We are like a stone lying near a roseflower. The roseflower
blossoms in the morning, dances in the light of the sun, tries to rise
towards the sky, withers by the evening and falls down. But the stone
that was lying nearby in the morning is lying</p><p>the same in the evening as it was in the morning. The stone must be
thinking to itself, “Look! the flower withered away, but I am the same
as I was earlier. Many flowers have come and are gone, but I remain.”
The stone must be admiring itself, but the stone does not know the joy
of being a flower. The stone does not know the thrill of change. It does
not know that living, flowering, withering and falling to the ground has
its own meaning and mystery. The stone does not know that only those
wither who flower; only those fall who rise. It also does not know that
only those die who live. If you want to avoid dying, avoid living. If
you want to avoid falling, never rise up. If you are afraid of
withering, do not ever blossom. But what does the poor stone know?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: One morning in a garden, a strange event happened.
There were small grass flowers that had grown, well protected by the
protruding stones of a stone wall. Sheltered by the wall, those flowers
never knew storms nor the light of the sun. They were living a sheltered
life, not knowing the rains, nor the stars that twinkled in the night,
but they were very safe, there was no danger for them.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the grass flowers lost his head and one day peeped out. He saw
a roseflower rising upwards towards the sky. A desire arose in that
grass flower, “Can I not be a roseflower? Cannot I rise upwards?” In the
night he prayed to God to make him a roseflower. God told him that he
should not be mad, that he was so well-protected, that the roseflower
blossoms in the morning and withers in the evening and falls, whereas
when he blossoms he lives on for weeks on end, he does not wither
easily.</p><p><br></p><p>The grass flower replied, “That I understood. We stay blossoming
because we don’t really blossom in the first place. And the grass flower
is not so juicy from the very beginning, so we don’t wither away easily.
No, I want to blossom like a roseflower, I want to have velvety petals
like the roseflower. I do not want to live under the shadow of this
stone wall, I want to rise up in the open sky – even for a moment, but I
want to rise.”</p><p><br></p><p>The grass flower was adamant. The neighboring grass flowers also
tried to persuade it, saying, “Have you gone mad? Such a thing has never
been done in our family and tradition. This is an old custom, we just
live here, buried in the stones. Even our forefathers never thought of
going out in the open sky, nor did their forefathers. It is not written
in our scriptures. What madness! It seems you have gone crazy! You are
spoiled by the company of others. Remain within your limits. It is
dangerous to step out of this place. You will die. Don’t you see how
much trouble roseflowers have to endure? The day before there was a
storm and all the roseflowers were lying flat on the ground. One day
when it was raining, all the rose petals were found weeping. If there
are high-speed winds, the rosebush gets shaken to its very roots. We
remain safe and happy.</p><p><br></p><p>The grass flower, however, did not agree. It said, “No, even for a
day, but I want to be a roseflower.” And when one does not agree, what
can God do? God can do something only when one agrees. If you don’t
agree, he is helpless. So in the morning the grass flower became the
roseflower. Soon the sun rose, the clouds gathered in the sky, and a
strong wind began to blow. All those grass flowers began to shout at the
new roseflower from below: “Oh you crazy flower! Now you will die! For a
moment’s happiness you lost your permanent comfort. Just for a moment,
just to be a roseflower, you gave up your safety!”</p><p><br></p><p>Soon after, thundering rains came with very strong winds. The thin
stems of the roseflower started moving this way and that, and the rose
petals began to fall. Even the leaves fell off. After some</p><p>time the roots of the rosebush, wet and weak, became uprooted and it
fell over. While it was dying, a grass flower bent down and said, “You
fool! Now have you come to your senses or not? For the sake of a
moment’s experience under the sky, how much didn’t you suffer!”</p><p><br></p><p>The dying roseflower replied, “Friends, what I have known during
these few moments, I never knew during a long life under the shadow of
the stones. Rising for a moment towards the sky, struggling against the
storm... maybe for a moment, but to stand facing the sun under an open
sky! That struggle with the storm with my delicate branches! A few
moments of blossoming – but really blossoming! The joy I experienced,
the juice I felt – I am full of gratitude to God! And shame on you that
you will never know what life is and what it means to struggle and live
during a storm! You will live behind your safety wall and die there.
Your life is unlived.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know if this really happened or not, but it seems in the life
of the people of India this has happened. We are living under the shadow
of security. We have become so fond of security that any courage to move
in dangers is absolutely destroyed. And then of course, whatever is old
feels familiar and safe. Unfamiliar feels unsafe, unknown frightens.
Unfamiliar paths create fear in us. So we have made a path and like a
drudge we go round and round over it for thousands of years. Our
teachers also initiate the new generation into the same old path on
which our forefathers used to move.</p><p><br></p><p>No, that way the new India cannot take birth. The teachers of India
will have to courageously take steps to break this situation and raise
the consciousness of the people. Certainly there are dangers in dealing
with the unknown, but why be afraid of danger? It is better to face the
danger of the unknown rather than be secure with what is known, because
in dealing with the unknown there is an interest in life; there arises
energy to live and there is a challenge in life.</p><p><br></p><p>If the teachers of India decide to free the new generation from
moving on the old fixed paths, it is possible for the soul of India to
be born – otherwise not. They should decide to encourage the new
generation to take up challenges and cut new paths, climb the mountains
and cross the oceans and go into space. But we are in the habit of
preventing children even from going into darkness, telling them that the
night has come. We prevent them from jumping into the river which is
flooded, from jumping into the sea. We say, “Where is the necessity to
climb Everest?” Everest is the highest crest of the Indian Himalayas,
which since the past one hundred years people from the West have been
trying to climb. Many have died in the attempt, and we are laughing at
them, sitting secure in our caves. We tell them, “Why do you climb? Are
you mad? What is there on top except ice?”</p><p><br></p><p>We, however, do not know that the children of those communities that
are prevented from climbing the hills, the very soul of those
communities is prevented from rising to new heights, and it prevents
their souls also from rising.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of children climb the Alps. Every year during their
holidays many of them die in their attempt to climb the Alps. But
knowing this full well, their parents and teachers do not stop them,
just giving them the statistics of deaths last year. Where there is
youth, there will be enterprise and climbing.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of boys and girls cross the English Channel, whereas we have
lost the courage to cross even a small rivulet. First we try to find how
deep it is, whether our forefathers have ever crossed it</p><p>or not. If our ancestors never crossed it, we are not going to do
that because we only follow in their footprints. We cannot take any
initiative. Why put our easy life in danger? Our personalities are so
fearful that we cling to the corpses. There is no way the new can be
born. If we get rid of the old, only then the new is born.</p><p><br></p><p>The most important task the teacher has to do is to make India free
from its clinging to the old. The teacher should know that he is guilty
if he ever tries to create infatuation for the old in children. He has
to prepare the children for inviting the new, for being aware of the
new, for embracing the new. Prepare the children to be attracted by the
unknown and to listen to the call of the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>American children are thinking of living on the moon, but Indian
children do not do anything more than watch the drama of “Ramleela.”
Rama was beautiful and Ramleela is also beautiful, but how long will we
continue to watch it? Even Rama would be feeling very much harassed by
now as to, “Why are these people after me year after year to enact the
same drama?” There will be other Ramas in the future, don’t we need to
care about that? Many other Ramleelas are going to be played, not only
on this earth but on the moon and Mars, and other stars as well.</p><p><br></p><p>But for us everything has happened in the past. Nothing is to happen
in future – all our work is over. The god of history has closed the
doors and gone ahead. Now there is no more history. Now only one work
remains to be done and that is to ruminate over past history. Just as
the buffaloes go on ruminating while sitting chewing grass, we also go
on ruminating over past history. Don’t we have to create anything new,
don’t we have to give birth to the future, and don’t we have to be
anything new? Don’t we have some dreams in our heart to create a new
tomorrow? And don’t we want to create some place where none of our
forefathers has even set foot? What is the purpose and meaning of our
life if we only have to walk in the footsteps of our forefathers?</p><p><br></p><p>We have to decide to walk on the paths where our forefathers never
set foot. We will see such visions which our forefathers never saw, we
will undertake voyages which have never been undertaken, we will walk on
virgin lands where so far nobody has ever walked.</p><p><br></p><p>But no, our very aspirations have died. We go on looking for the old
trodden paths and continue to walk on them. Hence, in India the new is
not taking birth. If the new is not born, life becomes sad. Life has
become sad. Every man is sad, tired and defeated. Every man is praying
to God for only one thing: to make him free from the chain of rebirth.
Somehow one wants to get rid of this life: where is liberation? Every
living man goes on asking where is salvation, where is emancipation? We
have made life so wretched that except for praying to get rid of it,
nothing else seems relevant.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole country has become very sad. It is bound to be sad. By
staying in the old for long, the mind becomes sad. When a calendar is
hanging in our house, we tear off the past date every day. Likewise,
every day the old must be discarded so that the new that is hidden
behind can appear. In the mind of India, a new date never appears. The
calendar is thousands of years old. There are so many old dates in it
that the new dates cannot be found, not even with great effort. We have
never thrown away the old calendar. We have to do that, so that new
dates can be seen.</p><p><br></p><p>When we see the birth of the new, our soul dances with joy to welcome
the new. A life of dance and cheer spreads all over, because there is
great interest in knowing the unknown. The familiar becomes known, no
interest remains for it. India has become interestless and hence it has
died. Interest is a characteristic of life.</p><p>If we want India to revive, the teacher has to do a most important
work. Perhaps there is no other more important work than this, and
nobody else can do it either. No other section of the society can bring
about this revolution. It is the teacher who has to be clear in his mind
not to allow new children to be dominated by the old. Before that can
happen, sow new seeds in them. Before their mind starts being burdened
with the old, make them listen to the music of the new. Before their
minds become dulled by old tunes, let the tunes of new songs reach them,
so that they are stirred up and engaged in the search for the new.</p><p>It is necessary to save the children of India from their parents. It
may sound peculiar but it is so. Who will do this? Parents go on casting
their children in their own image. Till they complete this job they do
not die. When the parents feel that their son has now reached the same
development as they had, the parents pass on. Every generation is doing
this. The old molds are ready for casting; every new child is being cast
into the old molds. Who will prevent this? Who will protect children
from their parents? If this is not done, this country cannot take a new
birth.</p><p>The teacher can save the children from parents. But the teacher is
not aware, the teacher is not conscious. He has become the agent of
parents, he is working for them. Parents give him a salary so that he
can cooperate in molding the children as they like. That is why this has
become a vicious circle. How to break it? Someone should take the
courage to do it. Difficulties will be there, because the society does
not respect such a person, but somebody will have to bear the
consequences; otherwise this country cannot take birth.</p><p>Excepting the teacher, I do not see anyone else fit for the job. It
is wrong to expect this from politicians; it is wrong to expect anything
from them. For politicians, if good days arrive, mental treatment will
have to be arranged; that much is alright, but nothing else can be
expected from them. If the politicians from all the capital cities are
arrested and they are sent away for treatment, the world will be
different. But it is very unlikely that something can happen through
them. Perhaps if people from the planet Mars arrive, something can be
done. But there is no hope from our politicians, because they are the
agents of all our diseases and they are exploiting our diseases. They
have made our weaknesses stepping stones to climb into positions of
power. Nothing good is to be expected from them. For them our weaknesses
are their ladders, our diseases are their paths, and our ignorance,
blind beliefs and foolishnesses are their stepping stones.</p><p>Who else can help then? Sadhus and sannyasins? No. Once upon a time
they were revolutionaries. That time is gone. Now sadhu-sannyasins are
not revolutionaries. Once there was a time there were people like
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ and Shankara. Those days are gone. Now
sadhu-sannyasins are servants of the society. The society gives them
meals and they go on praising the society. Their condition is no better
than this. Nothing can be expected of them.</p><p>There is only one class of people which has not yet bothered to do
anything. That is the educated class of teachers. It is quite a big
class and has immense power. Its greatest power is that the new
generation is in its hands. Before the new generation changes for the
worse, the teachers can give a new direction, new awareness to the new
generation. There is a tremendous power in their hands about which they
are not aware. If the new principles of transforming life are brought to
the minds of the students, the whole country can be transformed within
twenty years, because in twenty years the old generation makes way for
the new generation to come. The accumulated filth of thousands of years
can be removed just within twenty years. But this can only be done by
the teacher and no one else.</p><p>So first the teacher should become aware that he is committing a
crime if he is communicating the old diseases into the new generations.
Old generations were afflicted by Hindu-Muslim labels. If a teacher is
teaching the children under his guidance that “You are a Hindu,” or “You
are a Muslim,” he is committing a great offence. He must teach the new
generation that “You are all human beings, not Muslims and not Hindus.”
Then a new country will be born. If the old generation teaches that “You
are a brahmin,” or “You are a sudra,” and if the teacher also confirms
it, then he is the agent of the old generation. He will then continue
the diseases, he cannot stop them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is enough to be a human being. If the new generation can
understand this, the diseases of thousands of years can be destroyed
within twenty years. Nothing can prevent this change. But the teacher is
not aware and conscious about what he is doing.</p><p><br></p><p>We are infatuated with the old. The children should give up this
infatuation with the old. In fact children are not interested in the
old, they are very keen to know new things, but we are forcibly making
them accept the old. Every day they must be taught the new. Courage,
enterprise, risk- taking is the one virtue which, if it is inculcated
into the minds of the future generations of India by the teachers – the
work will be over.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the structure that is devised so far, the child becomes
impotent because he is confused; he does not know what to do. The
teacher does not know what to do and what not to do. The people in the
society who are supposed to think of the subject also do not know what
to do. There is restlessness, but no clear path is visible. It has to be
properly thought out, what can be done, what is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I feel that we have a golden opportunity in our hands today, because
there is more rebellious spirit in the minds of Indian children than any
time before in the history so far. If the teacher can give proper
direction to these rebellious children, the old rubbish can be put to
the fire. From this energy of rebellion the new can take birth.</p><p><br></p><p>But the teacher is unable to understand even the potential of this
rebellion that is born in children. He is not able to utilize this
potential energy. In fact the teacher himself is afraid of it and he is
trying to destroy this rebellion of the children from all sides. He does
not know that he is committing a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>The rebellion of the children is not to be destroyed, but it has to
be given the right direction. This spirit of rebellion that has come in
them, the soul that is born – which at present is throwing stones,
breaking windows and chairs – this wonderful capacity to destroy that
has arisen in them, can be directed to some worthy destruction. If we do
not direct this energy properly, their anger will be wasted on
destroying the wrong things. Breaking chairs and windows won’t help in
any way, but this courage to break chairs is welcome. With that courage
the Hindu-Muslim fanaticism can be broken, the brahmin-sudra stupidity
can be stopped, the foolish walls created between man and woman can be
removed. The rotten morality can be exposed and a new, more healthy,
more scientific morality can be given birth.</p><p><br></p><p>The capacity to break has arrived – but the teacher is afraid of it.
He thinks that this ability to destroy is bad. Furniture is being
broken, windows are being broken – but I say to you that the children do
not know what to break, that is why they are breaking chairs. If the
teacher explains to them what</p><p>is to be broken, then they will never break chairs; they will start
breaking what needs to be broken. But the teacher is afraid. He says,
“Do not break anything. Be disciplined.”</p><p><br></p><p>However, you do not know that it is a great thing to break
discipline. Discipline has a value, indiscipline has a value too.
Discipline is valuable to maintain the society as it is. But when the
society is to be changed, discipline is of no use, indiscipline becomes
valuable. This is the time for change.</p><p><br></p><p>Utilize the indiscipline that is there in children. Whatsoever is
rotten can be destroyed with the help of these children. What has become
a great burden like rock on the life of man should be changed. The
teacher can do it because he is very near and intimate to them. But he
too is unable to understand the children and does not know what is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good sign that this rebellious spirit is aroused in children.
If the teacher can become aware of his revolutionary role and can
understand that the burning torch of revolution is in his hands, perhaps
these children will love their teacher as they have never loved before.
The teacher then will be a collaborator in making a golden future for
the children as he never was before.</p><p><br></p><p>I have put before the teacher friends these few questions. What I am
saying does not necessarily have to be right; it may all be wrong, so it
is not necessary for you to believe it. But please think and meditate on
whatsoever I have said.</p><p><br></p><p>It is necessary to give birth to a dialogue in the whole country,
that the teachers begin to think, and they talk to the children, they
try to understand them and then come to some decisions. Then I am very
hopeful. A lot can be done. The situation is ripe, the opportunity is
waiting, the whole climate is there; it is a God given opportunity and
it is in our hands to utilize this great energy of transition. Or, would
you rather just sit back and watch what is going on and condemn it as
bad and not do anything? Would you rather be a spectator? Would you
prove to be only a spectator in the life of the coming society? Then
every day you will go to school and while you teach the children that
two plus two is four, or teach them the ABC’s, the politicians will go
on preparing atom bombs. While you teach them arithmetic and the
geography of the earth, the politicians will continue the preparations
for destroying the very earth itself.</p><p><br></p><p>No, this cannot be tolerated any more. Teach that two plus two makes
four – but that is not the only work of a teacher. He should become the
creator of a revolution too, then only does he become a teacher. He has
to remain awake to everything that is happening around life. He has to
be conscious of the new sprouts that have shot forth in children. He
also has to be concerned about his own role in life.</p><p><br></p><p>India has good teachers, but they are asleep. India has a very
intelligent group of teachers, but they are not revolutionary. India has
a long line of sincere teachers and teachers full of morality, but their
sincerity and morality is retrogressive and reactionary. He is not a
revolutionary and that is why he is watching helplessly. He feels there
is nothing in his hands; he has only remained an instrument of the
society.</p><p><br></p><p>In the whole world, India included, the politicians have cut off the
teachers from the lifestream. Politicians tell the teachers that they
should not worry about the quality of life and about politics;</p><p>they must do their work within the four walls of the school. The
politician is very clever. He knows that if the teacher starts actively
thinking about life, he has so much power in his hands that he will
transform the whole society. So, cleverly and cunningly he has kept the
teacher away from and separate from life as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The politicians have persuaded the teachers to feel that they are not
concerned with life as such, that their great work is to teach the
children that two plus two makes four and show them on the map where
Timbuktu is, unmindful of whether Timbuktu actually exists! Now the
possibility of saving humanity is becoming less and less, and if the
teacher continues to watch silently this situation, I am not prepared to
call him a teacher. The teacher has a great responsibility. The teacher
is a midwife for the new generation.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates has defined the teacher as one who works as a midwife in
giving birth to the new soul. Socrates has said it rightly. He was one
of the most wonderful teachers of the world. He has rightly said that
the teacher has to work just like a midwife and assist in giving birth
to a new soul. If you are not becoming, we are not becoming that
midwife, we have no right to call ourselves teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>I have made a few humble suggestions here. I am grateful for your
having heard me so silently and peacefully. Finally, I salute the divine
residing within all of you. Accept my salutations.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is the root of the word ‘star’, the Sanskrit root. It means the star...\nRemember that the real star is within. And the real star is not even a whispering star: it is utterly silent, not even a whisper. And we reach it only when we are totally silent.\nEven if a little whispering remains, that is enough of a barrier, that is enough of a wall. Only silence is the door. Words, whether said loudly or whispered, are words, and words are the only barrier between you and your real you. Words create continuous smoke around your being; a fog is created by words. Words have to disappear, and they can disappear easily if we don’t cooperate with them. If we don’t go on pouring our energy into them they start dying of their own accord. They cannot live by themselves, they are parasites: they live on our blood. And everybody looks to be so sucked, so dry of juice, because those words are constantly sucking on their soul. The more words that are in the mind, the less juice your life will have. And if the mind goes on in inner talk continuously – that’s how it is – then it drives you crazy.\nSilence is sane; in fact the only way to be sane is to be silent. And the whole art of sannyas consists of being utterly silent. Everything else is just a device to help you towards silence. It may be music, it may be dance, it may be anything, but the basic thing is that all these methods lead you slowly slowly towards an inner stillness. And when all is silent – the inner talk has disappeared and there is no fog, no smoke of the mind – the star rises.\nThe story in the Bible that three wise men saw a star when Jesus was born and followed it, and by following the star reached Jesus, has nothing to do with any star in the sky. The stars in the sky don’t move that way; they have their fixed roots. Then what is the story talking about? It is saying something of the inner; but the inner can be seen only by the wise.\nWhenever a man like Jesus or Buddha is there on the earth, those who have any wisdom left in them start moving towards the person – sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly. Sometimes they think it is just accidental, coincidental, that they have arrived; but it is not so. Their deepest being has seen something. Their mind may not have heard about it, because the mind knows nothing much about the deeper depths of your being. There are things in you which your mind is not aware of, and because they are very deep sometimes the mind remains unaware for years. But they are very potential, powerful: they can move your life into certain directions.\nThose three wise men from the East saw the star rising not in the outer sky but in the inner sky. They felt a presence; they felt that something of the unknown had penetrated the earth again, that something of the divine had again materialised. It was a rare miracle. They travelled long distances. It was not a question of seeing a star in the sky and following it. They were continuously meditating and feeling and groping to find where the miracle had happened; and they did find it.\nThat’s how you have come here to me. That’s how millions are going to come. It has nothing to do with anything that you may have heard from the outside: it has something to do with your inner feeling.\nAnd you have come in the right time. Something tremendously important is going to happen. Just become more and more silent so that you can feel your inner light, your inner star, more clearly.\nDeva means divine, sansargo means contact divine contact. Sannyas is the beginning of a new contact, of a new relationship. It is falling in love with god. All other loves fail: only love for god succeeds. All other loves only promise but they never fulfil. And the strange thing is that love for god promises nothing but it fulfils; it is the only fulfillment in life. So those who are searching for anything else except god are moving in a wasteland. Futile is their search, fruitless is their life, and frustration is their who!e biography. From one frustration to another frustration; they go on moving that way, in a vicious circle. After each frustration they hope; that hope brings them to another frustration. They hope again; again there is frustration.\nLove for god is not a hope. It has nothing to do with the future: it has something to do with the present, because god is the present. God is never the past, never the future; god is always present, always now. He is the eternal now. So one cannot hope for god. Those who hope have missed the point. People can only live god: they cannot desire or hope for god. God is now and god is here. God is all that is.\nSo one has to jump, plunge, into this mysterious existence. This is what I mean by falling in love with god. Falling in love with trees and birds and animals and people and rivers and oceans and stars... all this is falling in love with god. This whole universe is his temple. He may not be visible to those who are not in love with him but he is visible to those who are in love with him – although not visible as a person but as a presence.\nYou will feel his presence in the tree, in the flower: you will feel his presence everywhere. God is a presence, and only love can feel the presence, because only love has the eyes to see the invisible.\nAnand means bliss, rupen means beauty – beauty that comes out of bliss. Bliss brings beauty which is not of the body, which is not of the mind either. Bliss opens the doors for the divine. The moment\none is blissful the divine starts radiating from one’s being, and that creates a beautiful phenomenon around oneself.\nIt is said that Jesus was physically ugly. It may have been so, but he attracted so many people; his impact was tremendous. Something was radiating from him which was not of the body, not of the earth: the sky was expressing itself through him. Socrates also was not beautiful physically but his impact on people was tremendous: very penetrating, very deep-going. Sometimes it happens that a person has both: Buddha was physically beautiful too. But the physical beauty is just a wave in the ocean: it comes and goes – a soap bubble. One moment it is here, another moment it is gone.\nBut the inner beauty remains, it is non-temporal. And once the person has become spiritually beautiful, his body may die but his beauty goes on circulating in existence like a fragrance. The flower disappears but the fragrance remains. In that sense Jesus is still here, Buddha is still here, as a fragrance: they permeate the whole of existence.\nSearch for the beauty that comes from bliss, because that is the only eternal beauty.\nSangit means music. And music is the ancientmost meditation. It was discovered as meditation; it was practised for centuries as meditation. Now it has fallen from its pedestal; it has become mundane, it has become very ordinary, a commodity in the marketplace. Otherwise it was on the same plane as prayer.\nBut it can be used as a meditation if one understands how to use it. It is a tremendously powerful method. The whole art consists in this: if you can play music yourself then get lost in playing. Don’t remain separate from the music: dissolve into it, be possessed by it, and it becomes meditation. Or, if you are just a listener, then get lost in listening, become music again. Don’t be there as a spectator, don’t be critical, don’t question whether it is good or bad. Don’t bring in your likes and dislikes: be choicelessly lost. Let it overpower you, let it surround you... first without and then within, slowly slowly. Then you will be just a part, a throbbing part of the melody, and immediately music will open a door to meditation.\nWhenever the ego is lost, meditation arises. The ego is the state of non-meditation; egolessness is the state of meditation. And music will really help you. Use music as a door: it is one of the most beautiful doors to enter god.\n[To a sannyasin newly returned from the West Osho says:]\nJust come a little closer, raise your hands. Close your eyes. If anything starts happening, allow it; just be in Latihan.\nYou start your Latihan again. Now it will go far deeper. In these six months much has been cleansed in your being; many impurities have fallen. You have passed through many many cathartic moments; now you are a purer vehicle. Latihan will take on a more graceful expression now.\nStart Latihan again that’s absolutely the right meditation for you.\n[Anand Saman – song of bliss] Life has the potential to become a song of bliss, but there is every possibility of missing it too. It is not a certainty, there is no inevitability about it. It depends: you can\nmake it, you can destroy it. Out of one hundred, ninety-nine point nine percent of people destroy their song of bliss. Then their life is nothing but a cry, a scream of pain and agony. But they have chosen it that way; nobody else is ever responsible.\nThis is the first truth to be learned in life: that you are always responsible, nobody else. With that comes great freedom, because with that all alternatives are open. If you think that somebody else is responsible then you are a slave; then nothing is open. Then you have to be what you are. If your life is a tragedy then it has to be a tragedy, because others are responsible; unless they change, nothing can be done about it. You don’t have any freedom.\nAnd that is the reason why millions of people live in misery: they think others are creating their misery. Nobody is creating your misery, nobody can create it; and nobody can create your bliss either. It is a totally individual phenomenon. It is just your work upon yourself.\nAnd the most strange thing is: to create misery is difficult and to create bliss is easy, but people always choose the difficult thing, because the difficult thing always gives them an ego-trip. The ego is not interested in easy things; the ego is interested only in difficult things. The more impossible a thing looks, the more attractive it feels for the ego, because the ego feels a challenge, and only through challenge can it conquer, can it prove to the world ‘I am somebody special.’\nMisery gives you challenge: bliss is very simple. Trees are blissful, birds are blissful. It needs no special talent to be blissful. To be miserable needs talents, one has to be really very very clever to be miserable.\nBliss is innocent; you can be blissful without any education, but you cannot be miserable without any education, remember! It is very difficult. You need degrees, universities, mm? then only do you become skilful.\nSo the first truth has to sink deep in the heart: ‘I am always responsible for whatsoever I am. Bliss or misery, this is my choice. If I have chosen to be miserable, then there is no need to be sad about it; this is my choice and I am doing my thing.’ Feel happy that you have succeeded in being miserable! If this is not your choice, drop it immediately, drop all those patterns that create it and start creating new patterns, new doors from where bliss starts flowing.\nFor example, the person who wants to be miserable has to think in terms of fighting with life; that is his gestalt. He is always fighting. The person who wants to be blissful has to be a non-fighter, surrendered to life, in a kind of let-go. The person who wants to be miserable has to create great ideals, has to make impossible demands upon himself. Then only can you be miserable; otherwise you will not be miserable. You have to be this, you have to be that, and when you cannot be, frustration settles in.\nThe man who wants to be blissful has no ideals at all, he is a non-idealist; he is a realist. The miserable person is always an idealist. The happy person, the blissful person, is a realist: he lives moment to moment with no ideals. You cannot frustrate him because he has no expectations. The miserable person always condemns himself because he is not rising high enough to fulfil the demands. He is a constant condemnor; he lives in self-condemnation. The blissful person is very accepting of himself. He makes no demands. He is relaxed, at ease with himself; he loves himself as he is.\nSo you have to watch: that which creates misery, drop; and that which brings bliss like a flood, create that space in you. And my whole effort here is to make each of my sannyasins a song of bliss: not miserable saints, not long faces, but celebrants! I am interested in celebrants, not in saints at all.\nSo let your life become a celebration; and it is up to you! That is the meaning of your name – make it a reality. It is possible and it is easy!\n[Prem Sampurno] It means love perfection, perfect love. And by perfect love I don’t mean any ideal: by perfect love I mean an unconditional state of love. Give, and don’t ask anything in return. It comes, it comes a thousandfold – and when it comes, receive it with gratefulness – but don’t ask for it! The moment you ask, you stop its coming. And the moment you ask, you become miserable, because it is not coming and you feel at a loss. When you ask something in return you are already thinking in terms of profit, and profit means: give less and get more. So from the very beginning you are miserly in giving.\nLove is responded to only when it is not miserly, when it is given totally, with abandon, when it is not a business, a bargain, but just a sheer joy of giving. That love I call perfect; and perfect love brings perfect bliss.\nSo feel more and more love. Let it become just the climate around you – not that once in a while you are loving: let it be a twenty-four-hour climate around you, let it become your breathing. Even asleep a real man of love is loving... even in sleep. If you go into the room of a man who loves, he may be asleep but you will feel the room full of love vibrations, because now love is not a question of doing or not doing; love is just his very life. Then I call it perfect.\nAnd this is possible for every human being because this is a built-in potential in us. It has not to be brought from somewhere: it has to be just allowed to grow, allowed to be expressed. So express as much love as you can, and more will be coming, more and more will be flowing. It is something inexhaustible, you cannot exhaust it. The more you give, the more you have of it.\n[Somadeva – Moon god] The moon represents a few things.… One: it is light but cool. The sun is also light, but hot. The sun represents passion; the moon represents compassion. The sun energy is male energy, aggressive; the moon energy is feminine energy, receptive.\nIf somebody wants to become a scientist he will need to have more and more sun energy. But if somebody wants to become religious he will need more and more of the moon energy. Science is a male project; religion is a female project, soft.\nGod cannot be conquered: god can only be invited. The very idea of conquering is of violence. All meditators have to learn how to become more and more part of the moon energy: receptive, womb-like, feminine, available, vulnerable, open, so existence can pour its mysteries into you. That has to be remembered.\nMeditate on this metaphor – not only meditate on this metaphor: let this metaphor slowly become your life. Become moon-oriented, and much will be possible through it.\n[Shrira] It means body of bliss. The physical body is the outer body; there is an inner body also: that body is the bliss body. It is made of the stuff called bliss, it consists only of bliss and nothing else. It is pure energy, and energy is delight.\nThe physical body is gross: the bliss body is the most subtle. And the finer the energy, the more joyful it is. The bliss body has the finest particles in it; there is no more possibility to make it more refined.\nWe have to search for it. You cannot find it outside in the world: you will have to go in. It can be found only with closed eyes; it is an inner journey.\nSlowly slowly you will start feeling it. The more you remain silent and quiet and just watching inside, tuning in, turning in, one day the contact happens and suddenly you see such light as you have never seen before, and you hear such music as you have never heard before. You have entered paradise. And it was always there: we had just not opened the gates for it. All that is needed is an in-sight.\n[A sannyasin says: I had a friend... he introduced me to marijuana and brownies and the first type of touching experiences with a man. It was beautiful when I could let go... I picked up a lot of guilt feelings sometimes and other times feelings to open and.I’m not sure.]\nIt can be a beautiful experience – you can continue. No need to be afraid and no need to feel guilty. It will be helpful. And when you feel that now it is no more helping, then stop it; but use everything possible that seems to give some experience. Use it! Even if sometimes it doesn’t happen, no need to worry.\nAlways remember: no method has to become an addiction, that’s all. When it is finished, its work is finished, when it no more gives you anything, simply drop it; but while it gives you something, continue. No need to be worried.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3165","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/turn_on_tune_in_and_drop_the_lot/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/turn_on_tune_in_and_drop_the_lot/>Turn On, Tune In and Drop the Lot</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">13</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3165 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Turn_On_Tune_In_and_Drop_the_Lot/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

feel your inner light, your inner star, more clearly.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, sansargo means contact divine contact. Sannyas is
the beginning of a new contact, of a new relationship. It is falling in
love with god. All other loves fail: only love for god succeeds. All
other loves only promise but they never fulfil. And the strange thing is
that love for god promises nothing but it fulfils; it is the only
fulfillment in life. So those who are searching for anything else except
god are moving in a wasteland. Futile is their search, fruitless is
their life, and frustration is their who!e biography. From one
frustration to another frustration; they go on moving that way, in a
vicious circle. After each frustration they hope; that hope brings them
to another frustration. They hope again; again there is frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>Love for god is not a hope. It has nothing to do with the future: it
has something to do with the present, because god is the present. God is
never the past, never the future; god is always present, always now. He
is the eternal now. So one cannot hope for god. Those who hope have
missed the point. People can only live god: they cannot desire or hope
for god. God is now and god is here. God is all that is.</p><p><br></p><p>So one has to jump, plunge, into this mysterious existence. This is
what I mean by falling in love with god. Falling in love with trees and
birds and animals and people and rivers and oceans and stars... all this
is falling in love with god. This whole universe is his temple. He may
not be visible to those who are not in love with him but he is visible
to those who are in love with him – although not visible as a person but
as a presence.</p><p><br></p><p>You will feel his presence in the tree, in the flower: you will feel
his presence everywhere. God is a presence, and only love can feel the
presence, because only love has the eyes to see the invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, rupen means beauty – beauty that comes out of
bliss. Bliss brings beauty which is not of the body, which is not of the
mind either. Bliss opens the doors for the divine. The moment</p><p>one is blissful the divine starts radiating from one’s being, and
that creates a beautiful phenomenon around oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that Jesus was physically ugly. It may have been so, but
he attracted so many people; his impact was tremendous. Something was
radiating from him which was not of the body, not of the earth: the sky
was expressing itself through him. Socrates also was not beautiful
physically but his impact on people was tremendous: very penetrating,
very deep-going. Sometimes it happens that a person has both: Buddha was
physically beautiful too. But the physical beauty is just a wave in the
ocean: it comes and goes – a soap bubble. One moment it is here, another
moment it is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>But the inner beauty remains, it is non-temporal. And once the person
has become spiritually beautiful, his body may die but his beauty goes
on circulating in existence like a fragrance. The flower disappears but
the fragrance remains. In that sense Jesus is still here, Buddha is
still here, as a fragrance: they permeate the whole of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Search for the beauty that comes from bliss, because that is the only
eternal beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Sangit means music. And music is the ancientmost meditation. It was
discovered as meditation; it was practised for centuries as meditation.
Now it has fallen from its pedestal; it has become mundane, it has
become very ordinary, a commodity in the marketplace. Otherwise it was
on the same plane as prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>But it can be used as a meditation if one understands how to use it.
It is a tremendously powerful method. The whole art consists in this: if
you can play music yourself then get lost in playing. Don’t remain
separate from the music: dissolve into it, be possessed by it, and it
becomes meditation. Or, if you are just a listener, then get lost in
listening, become music again. Don’t be there as a spectator, don’t be
critical, don’t question whether it is good or bad. Don’t bring in your
likes and dislikes: be choicelessly lost. Let it overpower you, let it
surround you... first without and then within, slowly slowly. Then you
will be just a part, a throbbing part of the melody, and immediately
music will open a door to meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the ego is lost, meditation arises. The ego is the state of
non-meditation; egolessness is the state of meditation. And music will
really help you. Use music as a door: it is one of the most beautiful
doors to enter god.</p><p><br></p><p>[To a sannyasin newly returned from the West Osho says:]</p><p><br></p><p>Just come a little closer, raise your hands. Close your eyes. If
anything starts happening, allow it; just be in Latihan.</p><p><br></p><p>You start your Latihan again. Now it will go far deeper. In these six
months much has been cleansed in your being; many impurities have
fallen. You have passed through many many cathartic moments; now you are
a purer vehicle. Latihan will take on a more graceful expression
now.</p><p><br></p><p>Start Latihan again that’s absolutely the right meditation for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>[Anand Saman – song of bliss] Life has the potential to become a song
of bliss, but there is every possibility of missing it too. It is not a
certainty, there is no inevitability about it. It depends: you can</p><p>make it, you can destroy it. Out of one hundred, ninety-nine point
nine percent of people destroy their song of bliss. Then their life is
nothing but a cry, a scream of pain and agony. But they have chosen it
that way; nobody else is ever responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the first truth to be learned in life: that you are always
responsible, nobody else. With that comes great freedom, because with
that all alternatives are open. If you think that somebody else is
responsible then you are a slave; then nothing is open. Then you have to
be what you are. If your life is a tragedy then it has to be a tragedy,
because others are responsible; unless they change, nothing can be done
about it. You don’t have any freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the reason why millions of people live in misery: they
think others are creating their misery. Nobody is creating your misery,
nobody can create it; and nobody can create your bliss either. It is a
totally individual phenomenon. It is just your work upon yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most strange thing is: to create misery is difficult and to
create bliss is easy, but people always choose the difficult thing,
because the difficult thing always gives them an ego-trip. The ego is
not interested in easy things; the ego is interested only in difficult
things. The more impossible a thing looks, the more attractive it feels
for the ego, because the ego feels a challenge, and only through
challenge can it conquer, can it prove to the world ‘I am somebody
special.’</p><p><br></p><p>Misery gives you challenge: bliss is very simple. Trees are blissful,
birds are blissful. It needs no special talent to be blissful. To be
miserable needs talents, one has to be really very very clever to be
miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is innocent; you can be blissful without any education, but you
cannot be miserable without any education, remember! It is very
difficult. You need degrees, universities, mm? then only do you become
skilful.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first truth has to sink deep in the heart: ‘I am always
responsible for whatsoever I am. Bliss or misery, this is my choice. If
I have chosen to be miserable, then there is no need to be sad about it;
this is my choice and I am doing my thing.’ Feel happy that you have
succeeded in being miserable! If this is not your choice, drop it
immediately, drop all those patterns that create it and start creating
new patterns, new doors from where bliss starts flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the person who wants to be miserable has to think in
terms of fighting with life; that is his gestalt. He is always fighting.
The person who wants to be blissful has to be a non-fighter, surrendered
to life, in a kind of let-go. The person who wants to be miserable has
to create great ideals, has to make impossible demands upon himself.
Then only can you be miserable; otherwise you will not be miserable. You
have to be this, you have to be that, and when you cannot be,
frustration settles in.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who wants to be blissful has no ideals at all, he is a
non-idealist; he is a realist. The miserable person is always an
idealist. The happy person, the blissful person, is a realist: he lives
moment to moment with no ideals. You cannot frustrate him because he has
no expectations. The miserable person always condemns himself because he
is not rising high enough to fulfil the demands. He is a constant
condemnor; he lives in self-condemnation. The blissful person is very
accepting of himself. He makes no demands. He is relaxed, at ease with
himself; he loves himself as he is.</p><p>So you have to watch: that which creates misery, drop; and that which
brings bliss like a flood, create that space in you. And my whole effort
here is to make each of my sannyasins a song of bliss: not miserable
saints, not long faces, but celebrants! I am interested in celebrants,
not in saints at all.</p><p>So let your life become a celebration; and it is up to you! That is
the meaning of your name – make it a reality. It is possible and it is
easy!</p><p>[Prem Sampurno] It means love perfection, perfect love. And by
perfect love I don’t mean any ideal: by perfect love I mean an
unconditional state of love. Give, and don’t ask anything in return. It
comes, it comes a thousandfold – and when it comes, receive it with
gratefulness – but don’t ask for it! The moment you ask, you stop its
coming. And the moment you ask, you become miserable, because it is not
coming and you feel at a loss. When you ask something in return you are
already thinking in terms of profit, and profit means: give less and get
more. So from the very beginning you are miserly in giving.</p><p>Love is responded to only when it is not miserly, when it is given
totally, with abandon, when it is not a business, a bargain, but just a
sheer joy of giving. That love I call perfect; and perfect love brings
perfect bliss.</p><p>So feel more and more love. Let it become just the climate around you
– not that once in a while you are loving: let it be a twenty-four-hour
climate around you, let it become your breathing. Even asleep a real man
of love is loving... even in sleep. If you go into the room of a man who
loves, he may be asleep but you will feel the room full of love
vibrations, because now love is not a question of doing or not doing;
love is just his very life. Then I call it perfect.</p><p>And this is possible for every human being because this is a built-in
potential in us. It has not to be brought from somewhere: it has to be
just allowed to grow, allowed to be expressed. So express as much love
as you can, and more will be coming, more and more will be flowing. It
is something inexhaustible, you cannot exhaust it. The more you give,
the more you have of it.</p><p>[Somadeva – Moon god] The moon represents a few things.… One: it is
light but cool. The sun is also light, but hot. The sun represents
passion; the moon represents compassion. The sun energy is male energy,
aggressive; the moon energy is feminine energy, receptive.</p><p>If somebody wants to become a scientist he will need to have more and
more sun energy. But if somebody wants to become religious he will need
more and more of the moon energy. Science is a male project; religion is
a female project, soft.</p><p>God cannot be conquered: god can only be invited. The very idea of
conquering is of violence. All meditators have to learn how to become
more and more part of the moon energy: receptive, womb-like, feminine,
available, vulnerable, open, so existence can pour its mysteries into
you. That has to be remembered.</p><p>Meditate on this metaphor – not only meditate on this metaphor: let
this metaphor slowly become your life. Become moon-oriented, and much
will be possible through it.</p><p>[Shrira] It means body of bliss. The physical body is the outer body;
there is an inner body also: that body is the bliss body. It is made of
the stuff called bliss, it consists only of bliss and nothing else. It
is pure energy, and energy is delight.</p><p>The physical body is gross: the bliss body is the most subtle. And
the finer the energy, the more joyful it is. The bliss body has the
finest particles in it; there is no more possibility to make it more
refined.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to search for it. You cannot find it outside in the world:
you will have to go in. It can be found only with closed eyes; it is an
inner journey.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly slowly you will start feeling it. The more you remain silent
and quiet and just watching inside, tuning in, turning in, one day the
contact happens and suddenly you see such light as you have never seen
before, and you hear such music as you have never heard before. You have
entered paradise. And it was always there: we had just not opened the
gates for it. All that is needed is an in-sight.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I had a friend... he introduced me to marijuana
and brownies and the first type of touching experiences with a man. It
was beautiful when I could let go... I picked up a lot of guilt feelings
sometimes and other times feelings to open and.<span class=s4></span>I’m not sure.]</p><p><br></p><p>It can be a beautiful experience – you can continue. No need to be
afraid and no need to feel guilty. It will be helpful. And when you feel
that now it is no more helping, then stop it; but use everything
possible that seems to give some experience. Use it! Even if sometimes
it doesn’t happen, no need to worry.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember: no method has to become an addiction, that’s all.
When it is finished, its work is finished, when it no more gives you
anything, simply drop it; but while it gives you something, continue. No
need to be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The seed and the flower and the fragrance – these are also the states of human consciousness. Man is born as a seed. There is no necessity that the seed will become the flower; the seed can die as a seed. The seed can become a flower but it will have to search for the right soil and will have to be courageous enough to die, because only when the seed dies is the tree born and the possibility of flowering is there.\nFrom seed to flower great courage, great effort, is needed on the part of the seeker. From the flower to the fragrance no effort is needed, no action is needed; it is part of divine grace. Fragrance happens of its own accord: when the flower is ripe the fragrance will be released, of necessity. No flower can die without releasing the fragrance, but millions of seeds die without ever becoming flowers.\nSo these are the two things to be understood: effort from the seed to the flower and no effort from the flower to the fragrance. But when we have become invisible fragrances, only then is life fulfilled.\nThat is the meaning of sourabh.\nDeva means divine, svado means taste – divine taste. God is literally a taste. God is not a thought: it is a taste, it is an experience, and as inexpressible as the experience of taste. You can eat something but only you know how it tastes; you cannot express it. Unless the other has also tasted it there is no possibility of any communication. But when the other himself has tasted it there is no need for communication.\nThis is one of the dilemmas, one of the greatest, that those who know can communicate, but then there is no need to communicate. Communication is needed from the one who knows to the one\nwho does not know, but then it is impossible. It is like explaining the taste of sweetness to somebody who has never tasted it: it is utterly impossible.\nThe function of a master is not to express the inexpressible but to help you to taste it, to create the situation where you can also taste of it, you can also drink out of it. Hence I say that god is literally a taste. One has to eat and digest god, only then does one know.\nThe knowledge has to be absolutely existential; it is not a question of the intellect at all. Every fibre of your being, every cell of your body, has to become a witness to it.\nPrem means love, geha means home. Love is the only home. A house becomes a home if it is full of love; otherwise it remains a house. Love transforms everything it touches. Without love man is a homeless wanderer on the earth. With love, immediately one starts growing roots into the earth. One feels grounded, one feels centered; one is at home.\nThe loving heart is at home everywhere, and the unloving heart is at home nowhere. Unless one creates love in the heart, one remains a stranger, an outsider. We can make great palaces outside but they will not be homes. Even a small cottage, a hut, can be a home if you have created love in your heart, if you radiate love.\nRemember it, that love is the only home in existence; all other homes are just poor substitutes. And love is not only a home for you: if you have created it, it becomes a home for others tool and ultimately it becomes the home of god. The man of love finally becomes a temple, an abode for god to reside in.\nPrem means love, adeha means bodiless. Love is basically a bodiless experience. Even though it is felt through the body, even though it is expressed through the body, it is not part of the body. It is something that hovers around the body, it is an aura around the body. The body is only a field that attracts it, but it is not produced by the material of the body, it is not the same stuff. It comes from the beyond: it lives on the earth but it is a penetration of the sky into the earth.\nThat’s why the moment you start feeling love you start soaring high; you become more and more astral, less and less physical. When one is in love, one immediately becomes weightless, as if gravitation has no effect on one, because something in one starts growing which is beyond the field of gravitation; and it is so close to one’s heart that the earth and the earthly heaviness disappear.\nBut I am not saying that one has to love only bodilessly. The body is just the language. The poetry has to be expressed through it but the poetry does not consist only of language; it is more than language, more than grammar. It is like music. The guitar is physical but the music that comes out of it is non-physical. The body is a guitar and the music that can come out of it is love; but love itself is bodiless.\nDeva means divine, karuno means compassion – divine compassion. Man has all the potential to become compassion, but we never use that potential; we remain at the minimum. At the minimum life is a passion: at the maximum life becomes compassion, only at the maximum when one lives life in its totality. Then passion starts having a totally new quality to it. It is transformed into compassion, it starts growing wings. It is no more tethered to the earth, it becomes free of the earth.\nBut things happen only at the maximum, that has to be remembered. People miss life because they don’t have intensity. They live only so-so, lukewarm; that is the definition of their life. They never come to the boiling point, and only at the boiling point does the evaporation happen. The moment the water evaporates it takes a totally new form – not only quantitatively different but qualitatively different. Water flows downwards, vapour rises upwards; water is visible, vapour becomes invisible. Passion flows downwards, compassion rises upwards; passion is visible, compassion is invisible. Compassion is evaporation of all your passions; but that is possible only at one-hundred-degree heat.\nAnd that is my whole teaching: to live life in utter intensity, to live life madly and totally.\nBodhi means enlightenment, sattvo means potential. Bodhisattvo means one who is potentially a Buddha. Everyone is. We may not claim it; that is our responsibility and our fault. If we claim it, it is ours. One can remain potentially a Buddha for thousands of lives never claiming it, but all those lives will remain nightmarish, miserable; that’s what hell is. Not to be that which you are meant to be, that is what hell is. To miss that which is your destiny, which is your fulfilment, that’s what hell is.\nThe moment you have recognised, realised, who you are, when the total potential has been transformed into the actual it is metaphorically called heaven – one has arrived home. And then life has beauty and grace and joy.\n[A sannyasin says: A week ago I mentioned to someone ‘I think my father might die’ and today during the lecture my watch stopped; then I got the telegram that he’s very sick.I just have the\nfeeling that this is the first time I can understand him and show him that I love him. I feel that he might have been hurt.]\nJust go and see whatsoever happens. Mm? don’t be worried about the future – just go. And give him as much love and respect as you can. This will be far more important than anything else. Don’t be worried about the groups or anything; that is secondary.\nIf you can settle your accounts with your father, that is the greatest thing. People remain entangled with their parents. Accounts are never settled, and unless accounts are settled, one remains childish. Growth happens by settling accounts. If one is perfectly clear about one’s parents, that is growth: one is mature. But very few people are clear about their relationship. Their relationship is formal, clumsy, unloving, inhibited, and a thousand and one complexities are there.\nIf your father is dying, then this is the time not to miss but to settle everything, because once he is gone, then for years and years you can be in Primal Therapy and nothing will be settled. This can be settled very easily now, so forget everything, just go.\nAnd I am not saying that he is going to die. I am saying the idea that he is going to die is very helpful, mm? – you will be able to settle things. If you know that he is not going to die, you will postpone.\nAnd don’t be worried about the watch. Watches are not very intelligent: they can stop any time! It is very difficult now to find those wise watches which used to stop exactly!\nDon’t be worried – just go!\nPragito means a great song; and life should be a great song. It should be lived aesthetically. No religion has yet existed on the earth which has been aesthetic: nobody has worshipped beauty and nobody has thought of music as prayer and dance as worship. Now the world needs a religion utterly life-affirmative, with no denial, with no inhibition. Total acceptance should be the only law; and then life starts becoming a great song, each act is a new addition to the celebration.\nUp to now religions have been death-oriented, hence they have crippled and paralysed life. Rather than helping to make this earth closer to paradise, they have made this earth ugly, condemned. They have condemned the body, they have condemned everything; condemnation has been their only contribution to life. They have made everybody guilty; and out of guilt there is no possibility of any celebration. I am against guilt, against the idea of sin.\nAnd I am not saying that you have first to become pure, then you can sing the song: I am saying to sing the song and the song will purify you.\nAnd Punito means utter purity, innocence. Not the purity that comes by virtue: that is a cultivated thing, that is not true purity. It is practised it is a manoeuvre. The so-called saints are pure. But the real purity is found in the children, not in the saints: uncultivated, unpractised, natural, spontaneous. And when there is a real saint like a Jesus or Buddha, he is innocent like a child. His innocence is not a calculated gesture, his innocence is not through some motivation. If there is motivation how then can there be innocence? If there is calculation how can there be purity?\nThe so-called saint is pure because he thinks that by being pure he will be able to attain to heaven, to the great joys of heaven, to great rewards, and if he is not pure he will suffer in hell. His purity is out of fear and greed; and that which is out of fear and greed may be anything else but it cannot be purity. Purity is absence of fear and greed.\nReal purity is not the purity of the so-called saints. Learn it from small children, learn it from flowers. Learn it from trees, birds, animals: they are really innocent. And when a man is innocent like that, like a tree, like a mountain, then something superb, something really virgin, starts happening. That brings god to you. God comes following this innocence. You need not search for god then: your innocence is bound to bring him to you, you need not go anywhere.\nDrop complexities, calculations, cleverness, and become simple. Even if you become a simpleton it is good! Jesus was known as an idiot in his days, a simpleton; Buddha was also known as an idiot. You will be surprised to know: the Hindi word for ‘idiot’ is buddhu; it comes from Buddha. And that is the sense in which the great Russian novelist, Dostoevsky, has written his book ‘The Idiot’. Read it! That is a real saint. That is the meaning of punito.\n[A sannyasin, who had completed Primal therapy said it was a bit hard because she was a bit hard.]\nIt is hard, the very process is hard – it has nothing to do with your hardness; but that is the beauty of it. It is like a hammering, it is very destructive, but out of that destruction something is created. A sculptor has to be hard on the stone. It is hard for the stone – chunks of it have to be cut – but only then does a beautiful figure arise out of it.\nPrimal Therapy is hard work, but it pays!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2185","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/turn_on_tune_in_and_drop_the_lot/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/turn_on_tune_in_and_drop_the_lot/>Turn On, Tune In and Drop the Lot</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">11</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2185 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Turn_On_Tune_In_and_Drop_the_Lot/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

these are also the states of human consciousness. Man is born as a seed.
There is no necessity that the seed will become the flower; the seed can
die as a seed. The seed can become a flower but it will have to search
for the right soil and will have to be courageous enough to die, because
only when the seed dies is the tree born and the possibility of

wings. It is no more tethered to the earth, it becomes free of the
earth.</p><p>But things happen only at the maximum, that has to be remembered.
People miss life because they don’t have intensity. They live only
so-so, lukewarm; that is the definition of their life. They never come
to the boiling point, and only at the boiling point does the evaporation
happen. The moment the water evaporates it takes a totally new form –
not only quantitatively different but qualitatively different. Water
flows downwards, vapour rises upwards; water is visible, vapour becomes
invisible. Passion flows downwards, compassion rises upwards; passion is
visible, compassion is invisible. Compassion is evaporation of all your
passions; but that is possible only at one-hundred-degree heat.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is my whole teaching: to live life in utter intensity, to

postpone.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be worried about the watch. Watches are not very
intelligent: they can stop any time! It is very difficult now to find
those wise watches which used to stop exactly!</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried – just go!</p><p>Pragito means a great song; and life should be a great song. It
should be lived aesthetically. No religion has yet existed on the earth
which has been aesthetic: nobody has worshipped beauty and nobody has
thought of music as prayer and dance as worship. Now the world needs a
religion utterly life-affirmative, with no denial, with no inhibition.
Total acceptance should be the only law; and then life starts becoming a
great song, each act is a new addition to the celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now religions have been death-oriented, hence they have
crippled and paralysed life. Rather than helping to make this earth
closer to paradise, they have made this earth ugly, condemned. They have
condemned the body, they have condemned everything; condemnation has
been their only contribution to life. They have made everybody guilty;
and out of guilt there is no possibility of any celebration. I am
against guilt, against the idea of sin.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying that you have first to become pure, then you can
sing the song: I am saying to sing the song and the song will purify
you.</p><p><br></p><p>And Punito means utter purity, innocence. Not the purity that comes
by virtue: that is a cultivated thing, that is not true purity. It is
practised it is a manoeuvre. The so-called saints are pure. But the real
purity is found in the children, not in the saints: uncultivated,
unpractised, natural, spontaneous. And when there is a real saint like a
Jesus or Buddha, he is innocent like a child. His innocence is not a
calculated gesture, his innocence is not through some motivation. If
there is motivation how then can there be innocence? If there is
calculation how can there be purity?</p><p><br></p><p>The so-called saint is pure because he thinks that by being pure he
will be able to attain to heaven, to the great joys of heaven, to great
rewards, and if he is not pure he will suffer in hell. His purity is out
of fear and greed; and that which is out of fear and greed may be
anything else but it cannot be purity. Purity is absence of fear and
greed.</p><p><br></p><p>Real purity is not the purity of the so-called saints. Learn it from
small children, learn it from flowers. Learn it from trees, birds,
animals: they are really innocent. And when a man is innocent like that,
like a tree, like a mountain, then something superb, something really
virgin, starts happening. That brings god to you. God comes following
this innocence. You need not search for god then: your innocence is
bound to bring him to you, you need not go anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop complexities, calculations, cleverness, and become simple. Even
if you become a simpleton it is good! Jesus was known as an idiot in his
days, a simpleton; Buddha was also known as an idiot. You will be
surprised to know: the Hindi word for ‘idiot’ is buddhu; it comes from
Buddha. And that is the sense in which the great Russian novelist,
Dostoevsky, has written his book ‘The Idiot’. Read it! That is a real
saint. That is the meaning of punito.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who had completed Primal therapy said it was a bit hard
because she was a bit hard.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is hard, the very process is hard – it has nothing to do with your
hardness; but that is the beauty of it. It is like a hammering, it is
very destructive, but out of that destruction something is created. A
sculptor has to be hard on the stone. It is hard for the stone – chunks
of it have to be cut – but only then does a beautiful figure arise out
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Primal Therapy is hard work, but it pays!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

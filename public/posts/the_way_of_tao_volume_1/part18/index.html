LONG AND UNBROKEN DOES ITS POWER REMAIN, USE GENTLY AND WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF PAIN.\nThat which is born, verily dies. That which begins must end also.\nHe alone can go beyond death, who is not born. He alone can be infinite who is eternal. Light is created, it can be destroyed. Darkness is eternal. Perhaps you have never thought on these lines. The sun rises in the morning, sets in the evening. The lamp burns and the wick is spent, and the flame is no more. When the lamp was not lit, darkness was there. Now when the lamp is lit, the\ndarkness cannot be seen. The flame dies down and darkness is back where it was. Darkness is not affected at all. Darkness can never be put out. Darkness never ends; because there is no beginning to darkness. For light there is a beginning and so there is an end.\nAnother most interesting fact is, we can create light so we can also end it. We cannot create darkness and hence cannot des-troy it. The power of darkness is infinite. The power of light is not infinite.\nLao Tzu says: “THE VALLEY SPIRIT DIES NOT. IT IS EVER THE SAME AS IT IS.”\nWhat is this Spirit of the Valley?\nWherever there are mountains, there are bound to be valleys. But the mountains are created and destroyed, the valley is not. The valley means, the negative, the darkness. The mountain is the positive. If we take the right meaning, what is a valley? A valley is the absence of something. A mountain is the presence of something. Light is the presence of something whereas darkness is absence, non-presence. If I am in this room, I can be taken out of this room. When I am not present in this room my absence will b there and this you cannot throw out. There is no way to touch absence. If I am alive, I can be killed but if I die, you can do nothing to my death. Nothing can be done with that which is not. Therefore we can never create darkness nor destroy it.\nThe Valley Spirit is Lao Tzu’s nomenclature. What is this Valley-Spirit? The valley does not exist, it only appears between two mountains. This space between the mountains remains the same even long after the mountains are no more. The valley remains where it was, only it does not appear as a valley once the mountains are no more. When the mountains spring up again, the valley is seen once more. Similarly darkness does not go anywhere. When you light a lamp, it merely hides. It becomes invisible because of the light. When the light goes off, darkness appears just as it was. Perhaps darkness is unaware of the existence or non-existence of light. Lao Tzu’s entire thinking, his entire philosophy is based on the Negative aspect in the Void, the Emptiness.\nTherefore Lao Tzu says, “The Female-Mystery, thus do we name.” This needs to be understood and we shall have to go a little deeper for this is the original base of Lao Tzu’s tantra. What is meant by the female-mystery. It is the same mystery of the valley. What is the mystery of a female, is the mystery of darkness. The mystery of a female is a very deep mystery of Existence.\nThis is why the very ancient religions of the world, looked upon God as a female and not as a male. Their understanding was much deeper than the understanding of people who look upon God as father. As the male influence increased in the world however, God was also given the male-concept. But this father-concept of God is relatively new, whereas God the mother is an ancient concept.\nThe actual fact is, the very concept of ‘father’ is very new – whereas the concept of mother is very old. The father-concept came into existence only about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. Older than the concept of father is the concept of uncle. In the animal kingdom, there is no concept of ‘father’ whereas the mother is certain. The concept of father is man-made therefore. Now when we installed man as the father, we very quickly removed woman from the throne of God-hood and placed the man there. Then those who conceived of God as the father, quickly lost the sutras of feminine-mystery. its secrets were lost to them.\nNow Lao Tzu talks in the times when there was no concept of God, the father, in the world. This requires to be studied properly. We shall have to see it from many angles. Only the shall we be able to understand it.\nA child is born. The father is accidental in the birth of the child. His feelings are not very deep. New scientists say we can do without the father. It will not be long before the part of the father will be wiped out. The birth comes through the mother, so the key to the mystery of creating life, lies within the mother. There is no such key or mystery in the father’s body. Therefore the father can at any time be proclaimed redundant. Even an injection can perform his part in the creation of the child.\nBesides, if I want to become the father of a child, 10,000 years hence, I can; but if a mother desires to be the mother of a child 10,000 years hence, she cannot be. This is because, the mother’s presence is very necessary, the father’s is not. The father’s sperms can be conserved in a deep freeze for any length of time. Even after 10,000 years, they can cause the birth of a child, if injected into a woman. The presence of the father is not at all necessary. Very soon children will be born posthumously. The father may be dead hundreds of years hence, his child can still be born. The reason is, nature does not take any extensive or deep work from the male in the process of creation. The profound work is taken from the mother – the work of creation.\nPsychologists therefore deduce that woman does such a great creative job – that of producing a child – that no need to find substitutes remains. This is why women as a whole, are not creative, whereas men are. Man creates pictures, statues, makes discoveries in science, writes poetry, creates music. You will be surprised to know that even though cooking is supposed to be a woman’s forte, yet the best dishes are creations of man\nNew dishes are always invented by man. Any big hotel or even in a king’s palace, women are never employed for cooking. They keep male cooks. Whether it is a picture that is painted or an image created or whether a poem or a novel is written, it is always the man who does it. What is the reason?\nScientists say man is jealous of woman. He even feels inferior to her. Therefore, he also strives to create something so that he can stand up before woman and say that he too is capable of creating.\nA woman does not indulge in these lesser creations because of the fact that she is instrumental in creating a human life which is a very great act in itself. There is no longer any desire for creation within her once she becomes a mother. So when a woman becomes a mother, a great work of art, no matter how great, pales into insignificance as an act of creation, before her child. This is why barren women always strive to create like men. She competes with men to create something. If a woman becomes a mother in the true sense of the word, her existence becomes fulfilled in her most inner-most depths. Nature has chosen woman as a source of creation.\nWe shall have to understand the Female-Mystery that Lao Tzu speaks of, in the female body, in order to understand the Female-Mystery of Existence. Our difficulties are manifold because all the effort to understand Existence, has been done by the male. All the philosophy has been created by men. Not a single religion, up to now, has been found around a woman-prophet. All shastras belong to man. This is why, Lao Tzu had difficulty in finding a partner for he has praised the female-mystery. When a man thinks or does something, he always does so from where he stands himself and so all his creations are male oriented.\nAlso, man can never understand woman. Therefore he always experiences that woman is something mysterious, something that slips away. What is this that slips away? Verily, man and woman stay together. Man is born out of woman, he lives all his life with her, he loves her, then also what is that something within a woman that is forever strange and unknown to man? This very strange and unknown element in woman, Lao Tzu calls the Female-Mystery. The mystery of the valley, the mystery of darkness, the excellence of negation! What is within woman?\nWhen a woman falls in love, she is never aggressive. She is not aggressive even in love – she waits. She gives you the opportunity of aggression. You can never tell a woman – “You entangled me in your love, you married me”. And although the fact is, that it is the woman who manoeuvres, she never takes the initiative. This is her mystery – to draw without any action – non-active attraction. Their very presence attracts. That which Krishna has described as ‘in-action’, that is the very mystery of woman.\nEven when she falls in love, there is no hint from her. Her presence attracts you. It is you who first make the declaration of love. The woman is never the first to declare. She never takes the initiative, for initiative is aggressive, it is positive. When I say to someone, “I love you,” I step out of myself, I have caused aggression, I have trespassed into someone else’s boundary. A woman never trespasses, even then she is attractive – what is the reason? Verily, her attraction is negative, non-active. She calls but you cannot hear her voice. She stretches out her hand but they are not visible to sight. The invitation is there but there is no form to it.\nThe action has to be taken by man. He has to take the first step. He has to go to her, appeal to her. Even then she may refuse and walk away.\nWhenever a woman says yes, hastily, know that she too is ignorant of the female-mystery for as soon as the woman says ‘yes’, she becomes useless. Her denial, her refusal – her constant refusal is the mystery of the infinite essence. Her ‘no’ however is such as a man can never say. When a man says ‘no’ he means no. When a woman says ‘no’ she means yes. If a woman has to refuse she does not say no, for that also, is too much for her.\nMulla Nasruddin fell in love with a girl. He is terribly distressed. He went home and told his father. Mulla is very sad and worried. His father said, “Why are you so worried?”\nMulla said, “I am in great difficulty. The woman I have been pursuing since the last nine months, has dealt a final blow to me.” The father said, “You are inexperienced. When a woman says no, it never means no.” Nasruddin said, “That I also know but she did not say no. She called me a dog! If she had even said ‘no’, I would have been after her for another nine years. She did not give me even that much lead!”\nWhen a woman says ‘yes’, she speaks the language of man. Therefore, ‘yes’ always sounds hollow and insignificant and in a deeper sense, unethical when it comes from a woman’s lips, for even this much is aggression. All the mystery and secret of a woman lies in the fact that she says no and she invites you. She makes no commitment on her own. All commitments come from the man. Yet, do not be under the illusion that a woman has done nothing. She does a great deal, only her method of doing is negative, like the valley or the darkness. Negation is her method. To step away is an invitation to come near, her very act of freeing herself is a call. This is feminine mystery. If we go deep into this, we shall understand very many things.\nEven in the matter of sex, woman is passive. Never in the history of the world has a woman been accused for an outrage. This is an impossibility for her. A man commits outrage. 99 times out of 100, whatever man does, is an oppression. The relationship that a husband keeps with his wife is also 99\nWoman’s personality is receptive. Not only this but even her body has been so designed by nature that she can be nothing but receptive. It is the man who commits the aggression, which is absolutely coincidental and which can be done away with. The man’s body is aggressive but creation takes place only through the woman who is receptive only. Scientists say that birth always takes place in darkness. The seed sprouts only in the darkness of the soil. Take the seeds out in the light and the seed stops sprouting. The birth of a child takes place in the darkness of the mother’s womb. Light turns birth into death.\nThe mysterious sutras of Existence are always formed in darkness, in the hidden, secret world. That alone can be secret, which is passive. That which is aggressive carl never be hidden. Therefore man’s personality is more superficial and with little depth. The woman’s personality is much more deep and less superficial.\nThis is the very reason why a man tires so soon whereas a woman does not, for aggression is very tiring. Therefore there cannot be male-prostitutes for one intercourse tires him. woman could become a prostitute for even fifty acts of sex, do not tire her. She is merely receptive, she does nothing. So a very strange and unique happening took place: women became prostitutes, men could not; men could be aggressive, women could not be; men became ruffians, woman could not.\nYou will be surprised tO know that to a 100 girls that are born, there are 116 boys born. Nature keeps the balance for the body of a male is weak. We always think that man is the stronger of the two but this is a mere notion. That is why 116 boys are born to every 101 girls that are born, 16 boys die before they reach the age of 14 and so the number becomes equal. Nature has to produce 16 boys more; they are the extras needed to keep the balance.\nThe average age of a woman is more than a man’s by 5 to 7 years. If a man lives for 70 years, the woman lives till 75. How much labour the woman’s body undergoes! The labour involved in giving birth to one child is the same as the labour involved in producing one atom-bomb! And a woman can produce 20 children and still live five years longer than man. Women are less prone to illness also. The illnesses she does suffer from are all caused by the male-dominated society she lives in and the harassment thereof. Seventy per cent of her ailments are due to the male-domination. Man arranges his affairs from his point of view and woman has to adjust herself accordingly. This is the cause of all her illnesses. Hysteria is the result of adjusting to the male-society.\nIf there be a woman dominated society the incidence of hysteria among the men would be five times more. Almost all men would turn insane. It is the quality of self:resistance that has kept our woman- folk from ali going mad. Yet we find women ill-tempered, jealous, quarrelsome. She indulges in quarrel all the twenty-four hours. This is all because she is not allowed to be what she is born to be by our society, which is always demanding other things of them. This makes their creative power turn towards perversion, destruction and unnatural activities.\nWoman has been so long and so much suppressed and tyrannized by men that people (and also women themselves) have come to believe themselves to be the weaker sex. I wish to tell you that\nthose who know, know differently; and what they know is that women are so powerful and strong that if they had not been subdued they would have suppressed men long ago. Woman needs to be subdued from childhood for she can prove dangerous. Woman has been suppressed the world over only for this reason. Had she been allowed to grow up free, man’s plight would have been pitiable. Therefore she has been kept in check from all sides, right from her childhood.\nAnd the injunctions on women were very much like the Chinese custom of putting a little girl’s feet in iron shoes so that her feet did not grow. She could not run, she could not walk and always needed the support of man. Then the men turned round and told them, “You are so frail, you are so delicate!” They rated this frailty very high for that was the only way they could control them!\nA woman can prove stronger than man, if she is allowed to develop completely for nature has endowed her with the power of creation. The power of creation is so great a power that it can only be contained by those who are strong; for they alone are capable of holding the embryo.\nLao Tzu says, “Understand this Female-Mystery well.” This Spirit of the Valley never tires, never dies. Understand well this passivity, this art of acting without action, this non-violent aggression, this secret of calling without calling – understand it well. Lao Tzu says, “Only by understanding this secret, can a man attain the Supreme Truth.” We can never attain the Supreme Truth with our male-attitude for no act of aggression can be committed on the Supreme Truth. We cannot storm the house of God with a rifle or a sword!\nOnly he attains God who has thoroughly understood this Female-Mystery, who has so surrendered himself, who has so let go of himself that the power of God descends into him – just as in the act of love, the woman lets go of herself so entirely for the man to descend into her.\nA unique fact has begun to come within our notice since the last ten years. The authentic woman is completely lost and the pseudo-women of today are merely the creations of man. Those whom we call the women of today are no more than play-things designed by man. she is not a natural woman – as she should be.\nThe Western Scientists are carrying out a small experiment in which they are trying out a new method. Tantra has worked on this subject in this country, some 2,000 years ago and discovered that it is possible. In the sex-act, the man is active; if he is not, the act is not possible. If the man is old, or weak or if his genitals become lax, the act is impossible. But in this experiment that is being carried out in the West, the scientists declare that if a man’s genitals have become weak and inactive, this does not matter. If the woman really loves the man, as soon as her genitals reach the man’s, it silently sucks up his organ within herself. The man has no need to make any effort. If the woman’s love is strong, her body sucks up his organ as air is sucked up into an empty space. This is a very astonishing fact.\nAnd if this does not come about the only reason is that the woman does not love this man therefore, her body does not perform the act of suction. Hence all actions of man are aggressive. If a woman loves, her entire biological set up is such that she draws in the man within her.\nLao Tzu says, “This is the mystery of woman, that without doing anything she does all.” If man wishes to do something, he has to perform the act. The mystery of religion is also feminine. If anyone sets\nout to attain God, he will never attain him. If someone however keeps still where he is and opens the doors of his heart, God enters now and here, this very moment! Those who go far to seek, travel far into the infinite, wander from birth-to-birth, are never able to attain Him for the secret of attaining Him, is to become receptive. We have to leave ourselves open. We should be ready to see that our gates are not shut when He comes. Our love should be a passive awaiting – that is all.\nA woman can wait for many births for her lover to come; a man cannot. He does not know what it is to wait, it is missing in his mental make-up. He wants everything here and now – instantly. He wants instant coffee as well as instant sex! Therefore the system of marriage was evolved by man for instant sex is only possible in marriage. A man can never wait. He is fretful, ardent, restive, filled with tensions. A woman can wait – wait till eternity!\nIn this country, the custom of keeping a woman widow and allowing a man to marry after his wife’s death, was not so much to tyrannize them but because the element of her ability to bear and wait was also taken into consideration. This quality of her’s was well understood and recognised. A woman can wait not only life-long for her lover but for many lives to come. This trust was put in her by society. So when in India this custom came into practice, it was not only that it was because it was favourable for men; rather as far as I understand, this was a great insult to the male-sex, and a very deep-seated reverence for women that they could be trusted to wait. Since a man could not stay without sex, he was not forced not to remarry whereas for a woman, widow-hood was compulsory.\nThe compulsion for widow-hood was also because in the awaiting, her female-element revealed itself to the full. The more opportunity she had of non-active awaiting, the deeper became the depths within her. Then her inner mystery becomes more tender and fragrant.\nI have read a very astonishing matter which I could not find an answer to. The catholics go to make confessions to their priests. It is the experience of many priests, that when women confess their sins, they undergo a very curious-feeling. This is natural since they are merely priests by profession – trained into priesthood.\nThe worst thing that Christianity has given this world, is educated priests. No one can be trained into priest-hood. You can train a person to become a lawyer or a doctor but never to be a priest. It is just like the fact that there never can be a trained poet. If a person is educated in poetry, he will at most write inferior verse. Poetry will never flow out of him. To become a priest entails natural capability, attained by sadhana. It cannot be taught. Christianity has, however educated their priests. Anyone can take this training and attain the degree of Doctor of Divinity. Divinity that is attained by a certificate, is no divinity. You cannot decide divinity by a mere piece of paper!\nSo when women confess before these so-called priests, their confessions become very tempting. It is but natural that when a woman confesses her sins in a secluded place to a priest, it becomes a matter of uneasiness for the man. The woman feels relieved of her burden of sins but the load is passed on to the priest. One statement of these priests is very astonishing. They say they find widows more attractive and tempting. What could be the reason?\nActually if a widow is a widow in actuality, the beauty of her personality increases a thousand fold, because her awaiting makes her female-mystery more mysterious and profound. The mystery in an unmarried girl also, is the mystery of awaiting. Therefore everywhere in the world, there is the\ncustom of marrying a virgin girl. If a girl is not virgin, you will never have the opportunity to know the Female. Mystery for the mystery in her is already broken. She is no longer deep and mysterious for she has not undergone her full period of awaiting to allow the required time for the flower of mystery to bloom within her. Those societies that laid great stress on the virginity of women have not worried about the bachelor-hood of man. The reason is simple; this makes no difference whereas the virginity of a woman is very essential for there is a beauty in her virginity which is lost after marriage.\nThis beauty returns to the woman when she begins to be-come a mother for now she stands at the door-step of a greater awaiting – an awaiting for a great mystery to unfold itself. When a woman becomes pregnant, the husband is worried. This is natural, for there is no awaiting as far as the man is concerned; for him it is yet another economic problem. The mother, however, becomes tender. As the child develops within her, the depth in her eyes grows deeper. There is the unfoldment of new elements within her body. The beauty of a pregnant woman is heavy with the Female Mystery. What is this mystery? Passivity is the secret. She has not to do anything to become a mother. The child grows on its own within her. She has only to wait. Actually she has to stop doing anything and just wait as the development of the child progresses within her. She then is simply awaiting, weaving dreams.\nIf a woman stops all activities in the last months of her pregnancy, she can see those dreams which can be forerunners of her child’s future. This is why the dreams of the mothers of Mahavira and Buddha became so priceless. It is said in the case of both Mahavira and Buddha, that before their birth, their mothers had dreams. These dreams occurred every day and in them they could see the signs and marks of their coming lives. If a mother is really a mother and if she is in a complete passive state vis-a-vis the spirit within her womb, she can write the horoscope of her child. No astronomer or priest is required. And if a mother cannot write the horoscope of her child, no one else can, for so much one-ness, so much identity can never be with another person. There is not so much feeling of one-ness between a husband and a wife as between a mother and son for the son is an extension of her very self.\nA woman has to do nothing to become a mother. A man has to do a lot to become a father. The mother to be has merely to observe a silent awaiting; and in this silent awaiting, two things are born: one is the child and the other is the mother. This is why, the highest honour and respect that has been given to woman in the East (where the Feminine Mystery was recognized) has been as a mother. This is a very astonishing fact.\nPeople ask me, “You call the sannyasins ‘Swami’ but you call the Sannyasin is ‘Ma’ even those who are not married?” Actually the mother is the supreme dignity of a woman. A woman is on the highest pinnacle of her glory when she becomes a mother. Her peak experience is not that of being a beloved or a wife, these are the mere steps that lead her to the peak of mother-hood. Wherever a society has considered the woman to have reached the height of her woman-hood when she becomes a wife, the women have been very unhappy for that is not their ultimate experience. The man of this society is happy for him, his peak is reached when he becomes a husband or a father or a lover. The same is not the case with women however.\nThe secret of woman’s motherhood is according to Lao Tzu, like darkness. There are many more things we should take into consideration:\nWhen a male child is born, there are no sex-hormones within him at birth. His semen begins to be\nformed later on. But a girl is born with all the ova within her! All the ova she would need in her life-time are there within her right from birth. A woman is a complete woman from the time of her birth. A man is born incomplete. This is the reason why boys are so restless whereas girls are quiet. There is an uneasiness about boys that is born along with them. The beauty and demeanor of a girl’s personality has very much to do with the peace within her. We have to make an effort to make a girl uneasy and we have to make an effort to make a boy relax. This is natural.\nBiologists say that the nucleus of the egg from which a female is born contains similar chromosomes – xx whereas the nucleus of the egg from which a male is born are not similar, they are x, y. The elements that go into forming a female are alike, therefore the woman is graceful and shapely whereas man is not. The well-balanced chromosomes give the shapeliness of curves to a woman’s body. There is no such balance in the male body. Besides, the female body is made out of 48 chromosomes – the full number of chromosomes from both the male and female egg – whereas the male body is formed of 47 chromosomes.\nBiologists say it is the lack of this one chromosome that makes a man so restless and sends him running all his life. He runs from one place to another, from earth to the moon. It is the search for that one chromosome, the lack of which he feels in his lack of perfection.\nThis balanced, peaceful, patient personality of a woman, Lao Tzu says, is a profound mystery of Existence. God is in Existence, like the making of a woman and not like a man. Therefore we cannot see God, nor can we catch hold of Him. He is present – definitely – but His Presence is feminine-like, as good as not there. The more we try to catch-hold of Him, the more He eludes us, the farther He goes away from us and the more difficult His search becomes.\nExistence is feminine. This means whatever manifests in Existence is hidden in Existence from the beginning – just as I said that whatever is to be born of a woman is already present within her at birth. There is no new addition after her birth.\nShe is born complete. There is growth within her but no addition. This is the reason that she is satisfied in life. Her satisfaction is astonishing or else, she could not have been kept a slave for so long. She is content in her slavery, she is content to live under all conditions. It is difficult to make a woman dissatisfied. It can only be possible if there is any biological change within her. This has happened in the West, where woman has become restless.\nWhen a woman becomes restless, she is difficult to pacify, for this restlessness of hers is very unnatural. This is why a woman does not remain restless but goes mad. A woman is either serene, peaceful or mad. She cannot be anything in between. There are no gradations in her. A man is never very peaceful. nor so insane. He sways within the degrees of restlessness. This is why the most tense conditions do not make him insane and the most peaceful conditions fail to make him completely tranquil.\nNietzsche has made a very thought-provoking statement. He has said, “To my mind, people like Buddha must have had a large proportion of the female-element”. Nietzsche has called Buddha womanish. I think there is a deep understanding behind this remark. This is the truth – when a man becomes completely tranquil, he becomes effeminate. This is bound to be. He will become so serene and calm that all the uneasiness, all the restlessness and tensions that are inevitable in a man’s being, are all gone – Lost!\nThis is the reason why the images of Buddha, Krishna and Mahavira are made symbolically clean- shaven. It is not that these personalities had no beard or moustache but these were symbolically dropped from their images, for they no longer gave reference of their character. There is only one image where Buddha is shown with a beard and therefore people say it is a false image for no where else has Buddha been shown with a beard. There is one image of Mahavira that has a moustache shown. People do not take this image to be authentic either. The temple where this image is, is called the temple of the Mustachioed Mahavira. It is however not possible that Mahavira or Buddha had no moustache, no beard. There could be solitary exceptions where the lack of hormones could bring about this condition but that is rare. Besides, it cannot be that the 24 Tirthankaras of the Jainas had no moustaches and no beards! Such a big coincidence is impossible. The absence of these male signs on the faces of Mahavira and Buddha are the symbolic acceptance of the fact, that these personalities had entered into the feminine mystery.\nRemember, when I say, ‘feminine’, I do not mean only ‘woman’. It is quite possible a woman may never enter the feminine mystery and a man may enter. The Feminine Mystery is a Sutra of Existence.\nLao Tzu therefore says, “THE FEMALE MYSTERY, THUS DO WE NAME.” There is a reason for this simile for it is full of meaning. This mystery cannot be compared to man for this mystery is the Supreme Tranquility. It is so tranquil that its presence is not felt, for a presence can only be felt when it is conveyed.\nTherefore, the real beloved is not the one who always makes her presence felt to her lover. When the husband comes home, the wife devises a thousand and one ways of making her presence felt; the husband tries his utmost to ignore her presence – he re-opens the newspaper, he has read ten times. Then all the noises of the house that the woman creates, remain on the other side of the newspaper; it becomes a wall between the husband and the wife. The most authentic beloved is the one who has become aware of the feminine-mystery. She does not let her lover feel her presence at all!\nI shall tell you of a wonderful incident in the life of Vachaspati Mishra. His father urged him to marry. Vachaspati understood nothing of marriage. He however, bowed to his father’s wishes, taking it for granted that whatever he said was correct.\nVachaspati was engrossed in the search for God. He understood nothing else. If anyone talked about anything, he took it to be a topic of God. So when his father asked him, “Will you marry?” He said, “Yes”. Perhaps he thought his father said, “Will you meet God?” and he said yes. Just as it happens with people generally, if a person is seeking wealth and you ask him, “Will you seek religion?” He will think you are asking him about wealth. Whatever the search within, that only rings in our ears. So Vachaspati also heard what was within him perhaps and said yes.\nWhen he was made to sit on the horse to go to the bride’s place he asked, “Where are you taking me?” His father said, “You fool! Don’t you know you are getting married? Did you not agree to get married?” So Vachaspati thought it was not right to refuse at that moment. Since he had agreed even though without knowing, he took it to be God’s wish that he be married.\nHe returned home with his bride but it never occurred to him that he had brought a bride home! How could he remember for it was not he who said yes to marriage, nor he who got married. He\nwas engrossed in his own work. He was writing a commentary on BRAHMA-SUTRA. He finished this work after 12 years. For 12 years his wife would quietly light the lamp for him in the evening and place flowers at his feet each morning. In the afternoons she brought his meals and when he finished, she quietly withdrew it. For 12 years Vachaspati had not the slightest awareness of his wife. The wife made no effort to let him know she was there. On the contrary, she took all possible care that he may not, even by mistake, come to know of her presence. She wanted to cause no disturbance in his work.\nAfter 12 years on the night of a full-moon, when his work was completed and Vachaspati rose to go to bed, his wife picked up the lamp to show him the way. For the first time Vachaspati (so the story goes) saw his wife’s hand – Now after 12 years, when his work was over and his mind was disengaged from work. He saw the hands, the bangles and heard the tinkle of her bangles. He turned round and saw her and he exclaimed, “Woman! What are you doing, alone here at this time of night? Who are you? From where have you entered, the whole house is closed? Where have you to go, shall I reach you home?” His wife said, “For 12 years, you have been busy with your work. Perhaps you have forgotten – you have been so busy! It is not possible that you should remember. If you can think back, 12 years from now, perhaps you may be able to recollect – I am the woman you brought to this house as your wedded wife.”\nVachaspati wept, “It is too late now!” He moaned. “I have already made the vow to leave home when my composition was completed. Now it is time for me to leave! It is almost dawn and I am ready to leave. Why did you not tell me earlier, foolish girl! You should have given me some hint! Now it is too late.” Saying this, he wept like a child. Seeing her husband cry, she fell on his feet and said, “Whatever I was to achieve, I have achieved through these tears. I wish for nothing more. Go without any compunction. What more could I have achieved than this, that Vachaspati’s eyes are filled with tears for me? I have received more than I deserved.”\nVachaspati has named his book BHAMATI. This word has nothing to do with the book. It is his wife’s name. He said to her “I can do nothing for you but let the world forget me, let it not forget you. I shall name my book after you.” It is a fact, no one remembers Vachaspati but Bhamati is remembered by many. BHAMATI is a wonderful exposition of BRAHMA SUTRA. there is none to equal it. This woman must be having the Feminine-Mystery.\nIt is my firm belief that she attained so much of Vachaspati in that single moment, as she would never have attained by a thousand other means. The way Vachaspati must have become one with the heart of this woman, no woman could ever establish such oneness with her husband. The Feminine-Mystery, this non-presence of this woman touched the very life-breath of Vachaspati, twelve years – and this woman did not allow him to feel her presence! And every day she lit his lamp, every day she fed him. Vachaspati asked, “Then was it you who placed flowers at my feet each morning? And was it you who put the tray before me and was it you who lit the lamp for me every evening? But how is it that I did not ever see your hand?” Bhamati replied, “If my hand had become visible to you, it would only have meant that my love was lacking, I could wait”.\nSo it is not necessary that all women obtain this Feminine-Mystery. This is only a name given by Lao Tzu for this name is symptomatic, suggestive and enables us to understand this term. A man also can attain this Female-Mystery. Actually, only those can establish their identity with Existence who have thus reached this prayerful awaiting.\nThe door of this Feminine-Mystery is the original source of heaven and earth.\nWhether it is the birth of matter or whether it is the birth of consciousness; whether the earth is born or heaven, everything is born through the mystery that lies hidden in the depths of Existence. Therefore I have said that those who have looked upon God as mother – as Durga or Amba – their understanding is much deeper than those who look upon Him as Father. If God exists anywhere, He is feminine, for man does not have the ability and the patience to give birth to such a vast Universe. That which gives birth to the myriads of stars and moons must have a womb, without which it is impossible.\nTherefore the three extensions of the Jewish order – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – have given a very wrong concept of God to the world – that of God, the Father. This is a very dangerous concept for it gratifies the ego of man. Man looks upon himself as established in the form of God but this has no connection with the Reality of Existence. More befitting, more proper, is the concept of a Universal Mother. But this can only be understood when you understand the Feminine Mystery, when you understand Lao Tzu. Else it cannot be understood.\nHave you ever seen the image of Kali? She is the mother, She is terrible! In one hand she holds a human skull! She is the mother – Her eyes are filled with the ocean of tenderness. Down below – She stands on the chest of someone! Someone lies crushed under Her feet! Why? Because that which creates, destroys also. Destruction is the other part of creation. Those were wonderful people who conceived this image. They were people with great imagination who could visualise great possibilities. They have erected the image of Mother standing on a dead body! In her hands she holds the head of a dead man, dripping blood. Round her neck she wears a necklace of skulls but She has the eyes of the Mother, the Heart of the Mother from where the milk flows – and yet, the necklace of skulls!\nActually, the Annihilation of the Universe starts from the very place where creation starts. The circle completes at the same point. Therefore the mother gives birth but when she becomes terrible she can also give death. When a woman becomes terrible she becomes extremely dangerous. She has a great store of energy. The energy is the same whether it creates or destroys.\nThe imagination of those who conceived of the Mother as an embodiment both of creation and destruction was a very far-sighted imagination but together with this it was very deep and very near Truth.\nLao Tzu says, “That alone is the original source of the Earth and Heaven.” Everything takes birth therein. But remember everything is re-absorbed in the same place. That is the ultimate source also. It is altogether continuous. This Feminine Existence, this passive awaiting empty Existence is never divided. It is continuous – without any discontinuity whatsoever. As I said before, the lamp is lighted and extinguished; but darkness is continuous. Birth comes, life becomes visible; but death is ceaseless. Mountains appear and disappear, the valley remains forever. When the mountains are there, the valley can be seen; when they are no more, the valley cannot be seen but its existence is ceaseless – altogether ceaseless. It does not cease when the mountains cease. Its power is indivisible, indestructible. No matter how much energy is withdrawn from this emptiness, it never decreases.\nA man misses, a woman never misses. A man is enfeebled, a woman never.\nThose whom we ordinarily call women, they too do not waste away as much as men. If a woman gains the full knowledge of her Feminine Mystery, she can remain established in an immaculate beauty even in old age. This is difficult for man. A man comes like a storm and goes away. If a woman attains to the height of her motherhood, she can remain beautiful till her last moment of existence.\nA man can maintain his beauty till the end only if he penetrates the female mystery. This happens sometimes.\nIn this connection I shall give you another example. We have not made any pictures of Buddha, Krishna or Mahavira in their old age. All pictures depict them young. But Buddha died at the age of 80, so did Mahavira. Rama and Krishna also attained old age but the pictures we have of them are all of their young age. This is symbolic and purposely so. When a person becomes so engrossed and universed in Existence, he is forever young and fresh. He has attained the sutra within him for keeping constantly young: Now he is established indivisibly and ceaselessly in his energy.\n“Make use of it,” Lao Tzu says, “Make use of this constant energy. Make use of this Feminine-Energy and its natural services become available to you.” You must know how to use this energy for its doors are always open to you. This feminine element, is always ready to give, you just be ready to receive.”\n“USE GENTLY AND WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF PAIN LONG AND UNBROKEN, THUS ITS POWER REMAIN.”\nRemember, the more gentle you are, the more effeminate you are. The more manly you are, the less gentle you shall be. This is why when a man tries to be gentle, his male elements begin to get less. So a very strange and wonderful happening takes place, as it has happened in America of late. Today the White American’s fear of the Black Negro is not entirely for economic reasons. It is more on the ground of sexuality. The white man has become so gentle that he knows that on the sexual level, his wife would prefer a negro to him. The negro is potentially more sexual because he is coarse and crude and un-gentle. He belongs to the jungles. But a barbaric man has a particular attraction – the attraction of the male, which is very titillating.\nA man who is very gentle, becomes effeminate. If a love-story is to be made round Buddha; it would be a very difficult task. A love-story needs a masculine, coarse, lover. And the more crude he is, the more titillating, the more manly. So when a Western film director chooses a hero for his films, he takes care to see that he has hair on his chest and his arms. When he chooses a heroine, she should be without any hair on her body. The man should appear a little savage, a little raw, then the sexual attraction is more. The Negro is feared today and the fear is less monetary and more psychological.\nAs a man becomes gentle, he becomes more effeminate, more mild and the fun of the thing is; the milder he becomes, the less sexual, he is. Then this process of his getting less and less sexual, becomes the path that leads to the Supreme Mystery of life.\nLao Tzu says, “USE GENTLY AND WITHOUT TOUCH OF PAIN.” Remember this. It needs a little explanation.\nWhenever a man touches a woman, he wishes to give her many kinds of pain. Actually, the love of a man, viewed methodologically, is that of giving pain to the woman. If he wants to show more love, he will press her hand harder. If his kiss becomes more loving, he will bite, he will claw. In the old KAMA-SHASTRAS, this clawing is very much extolled: “He is no man who does not claw his woman till she bleeds.” That is a sign of a lover – clawing! If the lover is an expert, he would be like Marquis de Sade. When nails were not effective, he kept knives and forks with him.\nThe method of a man’s love is violent. Therefore, the more he loves, the more violent he becomes. It is a great possibility that if such a man loves completely, he may even murder his wife – all because of love! Such crimes have taken place and the courts have found it difficult to judge these cases where there has been no element of enmity or hatred – rather profusion of love. The man is so filled with love that whilst pressing his beloved, he does not know when he pressed the life out of her!\nLao Tzu says, ‘Use gently’. He is talking of this Supreme Truth, which he says, one must handle very gently “... AND WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF PAIN.” Let not Existence feel the slightest twitch of pain through you. Then and then alone will you be able to understand the Feminine Mystery. When a woman makes love to a man, she places her hand so lightly on his shoulder as if she is afraid of causing him even the slightest inconvenience of touching him. And that is the secret of a woman. The more her hand touches as if it is not touching, the more loving it becomes. When a woman presses a man’s shoulder, she is giving news of the fact that she has stepped apart from the Feminine Mystery and she is aping the man. The woman just lets herself go, she floats in the man’s love. She only shows her willingness. More than this, she does not do. She does not even touch a man so that the touch becomes ungentle!\nThere is a great arising in the West of late. The learned and wise women of the West – if so we can call them – assert that a woman should be as aggressive as a man. When she makes love, she should be as violent. She certainly will become like a man if she inculcates such violence and aggression but she will then undoubtedly, miss the Feminine Mystery that Lao Tzu talks about. We must concede however, that Lao Tzu is much much wiser. His wisdom is the ultimate in wisdom. He talks from the plane where there is a wisdom beyond wisdom, where all intellectualism fails and the Perfect Wisdom is born. He talks from that plane.\nThis applies to both men and women however.\nLet me tell you one more thing in the end. Let not the ladies feel very proud within themselves for there are hardly any ‘women’ among them. It is a very difficult task to be a woman. To be a woman, is the highest experience. Let not the men-folk be distressed for there is not much difference between them and the ladies. Both have to go a long way. Understand this, that we shall be able to understand Truth only to the extent that we become non-aggressive, awaiting, passive like the Spirit of the Valley; and not if we are egoist like the mountains. We should be humble like the valley, silent like the womb and filled with awaiting. The indivisible, constant energy, resides in that supreme passivity and perfect inaction. Everything is born there-from and everything merges again into it.\nEnough for today, rest tomorrow.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8806","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_1/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_1/>The Way of Tao, Volume 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18 The supreme power \-- corresponding to the valley female and mysterious</h1><div class=post-meta>42 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8806 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Way_of_Tao_Volume_1/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

infinite who is eternal. Light is created, it can be destroyed. Darkness
is eternal. Perhaps you have never thought on these lines. The sun rises
in the morning, sets in the evening. The lamp burns and the wick is
spent, and the flame is no more. When the lamp was not lit, darkness was
there. Now when the lamp is lit, the</p><p>darkness cannot be seen. The flame dies down and darkness is back
where it was. Darkness is not affected at all. Darkness can never be put
out. Darkness never ends; because there is no beginning to darkness. For
light there is a beginning and so there is an end.</p><p><br></p><p>Another most interesting fact is, we can create light so we can also
end it. We cannot create darkness and hence cannot des-troy it. The
power of darkness is infinite. The power of light is not infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says: “THE VALLEY SPIRIT DIES NOT. IT IS EVER THE SAME AS IT
IS.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is this Spirit of the Valley?</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever there are mountains, there are bound to be valleys. But the
mountains are created and destroyed, the valley is not. The valley
means, the negative, the darkness. The mountain is the positive. If we
take the right meaning, what is a valley? A valley is the absence of
something. A mountain is the presence of something. Light is the
presence of something whereas darkness is absence, non-presence. If I am
in this room, I can be taken out of this room. When I am not present in
this room my absence will b there and this you cannot throw out. There
is no way to touch absence. If I am alive, I can be killed but if I die,
you can do nothing to my death. Nothing can be done with that which is
not. Therefore we can never create darkness nor destroy it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Valley Spirit is Lao Tzu’s nomenclature. What is this
Valley-Spirit? The valley does not exist, it only appears between two
mountains. This space between the mountains remains the same even long
after the mountains are no more. The valley remains where it was, only
it does not appear as a valley once the mountains are no more. When the
mountains spring up again, the valley is seen once more. Similarly
darkness does not go anywhere. When you light a lamp, it merely hides.
It becomes invisible because of the light. When the light goes off,
darkness appears just as it was. Perhaps darkness is unaware of the
existence or non-existence of light. Lao Tzu’s entire thinking, his
entire philosophy is based on the Negative aspect in the Void, the
Emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore Lao Tzu says, “The Female-Mystery, thus do we name.” This
needs to be understood and we shall have to go a little deeper for this
is the original base of Lao Tzu’s tantra. What is meant by the
female-mystery. It is the same mystery of the valley. What is the
mystery of a female, is the mystery of darkness. The mystery of a female
is a very deep mystery of Existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why the very ancient religions of the world, looked upon God
as a female and not as a male. Their understanding was much deeper than
the understanding of people who look upon God as father. As the male
influence increased in the world however, God was also given the
male-concept. But this father-concept of God is relatively new, whereas
God the mother is an ancient concept.</p><p><br></p><p>The actual fact is, the very concept of ‘father’ is very new –
whereas the concept of mother is very old. The father-concept came into
existence only about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. Older than the concept of
father is the concept of uncle. In the animal kingdom, there is no
concept of ‘father’ whereas the mother is certain. The concept of father
is man-made therefore. Now when we installed man as the father, we very
quickly removed woman from the throne of God-hood and placed the man
there. Then those who conceived of God as the father, quickly lost the
sutras of feminine-mystery. its secrets were lost to them.</p><p>Now Lao Tzu talks in the times when there was no concept of God, the
father, in the world. This requires to be studied properly. We shall
have to see it from many angles. Only the shall we be able to understand
it.</p><p><br></p><p>A child is born. The father is accidental in the birth of the child.
His feelings are not very deep. New scientists say we can do without the
father. It will not be long before the part of the father will be wiped
out. The birth comes through the mother, so the key to the mystery of
creating life, lies within the mother. There is no such key or mystery
in the father’s body. Therefore the father can at any time be proclaimed
redundant. Even an injection can perform his part in the creation of the
child.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides, if I want to become the father of a child, 10,000 years
hence, I can; but if a mother desires to be the mother of a child 10,000
years hence, she cannot be. This is because, the mother’s presence is
very necessary, the father’s is not. The father’s sperms can be
conserved in a deep freeze for any length of time. Even after 10,000
years, they can cause the birth of a child, if injected into a woman.
The presence of the father is not at all necessary. Very soon children
will be born posthumously. The father may be dead hundreds of years
hence, his child can still be born. The reason is, nature does not take
any extensive or deep work from the male in the process of creation. The
profound work is taken from the mother – the work of creation.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists therefore deduce that woman does such a great creative
job – that of producing a child – that no need to find substitutes
remains. This is why women as a whole, are not creative, whereas men
are. Man creates pictures, statues, makes discoveries in science, writes
poetry, creates music. You will be surprised to know that even though
cooking is supposed to be a woman’s forte, yet the best dishes are
creations of man</p><p><br></p><p>New dishes are always invented by man. Any big hotel or even in a
king’s palace, women are never employed for cooking. They keep male
cooks. Whether it is a picture that is painted or an image created or
whether a poem or a novel is written, it is always the man who does it.
What is the reason?</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say man is jealous of woman. He even feels inferior to
her. Therefore, he also strives to create something so that he can stand
up before woman and say that he too is capable of creating.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman does not indulge in these lesser creations because of the
fact that she is instrumental in creating a human life which is a very
great act in itself. There is no longer any desire for creation within
her once she becomes a mother. So when a woman becomes a mother, a great
work of art, no matter how great, pales into insignificance as an act of
creation, before her child. This is why barren women always strive to
create like men. She competes with men to create something. If a woman
becomes a mother in the true sense of the word, her existence becomes
fulfilled in her most inner-most depths. Nature has chosen woman as a
source of creation.</p><p><br></p><p>We shall have to understand the Female-Mystery that Lao Tzu speaks
of, in the female body, in order to understand the Female-Mystery of
Existence. Our difficulties are manifold because all the effort to
understand Existence, has been done by the male. All the philosophy has
been created by men. Not a single religion, up to now, has been found
around a woman-prophet. All shastras belong to man. This is why, Lao Tzu
had difficulty in finding a partner for he has praised the
female-mystery. When a man thinks or does something, he always does so
from where he stands himself and so all his creations are male
oriented.</p><p>Also, man can never understand woman. Therefore he always experiences
that woman is something mysterious, something that slips away. What is
this that slips away? Verily, man and woman stay together. Man is born
out of woman, he lives all his life with her, he loves her, then also
what is that something within a woman that is forever strange and
unknown to man? This very strange and unknown element in woman, Lao Tzu
calls the Female-Mystery. The mystery of the valley, the mystery of
darkness, the excellence of negation! What is within woman?</p><p><br></p><p>When a woman falls in love, she is never aggressive. She is not
aggressive even in love – she waits. She gives you the opportunity of
aggression. You can never tell a woman – “You entangled me in your love,
you married me”. And although the fact is, that it is the woman who
manoeuvres, she never takes the initiative. This is her mystery – to
draw without any action – non-active attraction. Their very presence
attracts. That which Krishna has described as ‘in-action’, that is the
very mystery of woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when she falls in love, there is no hint from her. Her presence
attracts you. It is you who first make the declaration of love. The
woman is never the first to declare. She never takes the initiative, for
initiative is aggressive, it is positive. When I say to someone, “I love
you,” I step out of myself, I have caused aggression, I have trespassed
into someone else’s boundary. A woman never trespasses, even then she is
attractive – what is the reason? Verily, her attraction is negative,
non-active. She calls but you cannot hear her voice. She stretches out
her hand but they are not visible to sight. The invitation is there but
there is no form to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The action has to be taken by man. He has to take the first step. He
has to go to her, appeal to her. Even then she may refuse and walk
away.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a woman says yes, hastily, know that she too is ignorant of
the female-mystery for as soon as the woman says ‘yes’, she becomes
useless. Her denial, her refusal – her constant refusal is the mystery
of the infinite essence. Her ‘no’ however is such as a man can never
say. When a man says ‘no’ he means no. When a woman says ‘no’ she means
yes. If a woman has to refuse she does not say no, for that also, is too
much for her.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin fell in love with a girl. He is terribly distressed.
He went home and told his father. Mulla is very sad and worried. His
father said, “Why are you so worried?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “I am in great difficulty. The woman I have been pursuing
since the last nine months, has dealt a final blow to me.” The father
said, “You are inexperienced. When a woman says no, it never means no.”
Nasruddin said, “That I also know but she did not say no. She called me
a dog! If she had even said ‘no’, I would have been after her for
another nine years. She did not give me even that much lead!”</p><p><br></p><p>When a woman says ‘yes’, she speaks the language of man. Therefore,
‘yes’ always sounds hollow and insignificant and in a deeper sense,
unethical when it comes from a woman’s lips, for even this much is
aggression. All the mystery and secret of a woman lies in the fact that
she says no and she invites you. She makes no commitment on her own. All
commitments come from the man. Yet, do not be under the illusion that a
woman has done nothing. She does a great deal, only her method of doing
is negative, like the valley or the darkness. Negation is her method. To
step away is an invitation to come near, her very act of freeing herself
is a call. This is feminine mystery. If we go deep into this, we shall
understand very many things.</p><p>Even in the matter of sex, woman is passive. Never in the history of
the world has a woman been accused for an outrage. This is an
impossibility for her. A man commits outrage. 99 times out of 100,
whatever man does, is an oppression. The relationship that a husband
keeps with his wife is also 99</p><p><br></p><p>Woman’s personality is receptive. Not only this but even her body has
been so designed by nature that she can be nothing but receptive. It is
the man who commits the aggression, which is absolutely coincidental and
which can be done away with. The man’s body is aggressive but creation
takes place only through the woman who is receptive only. Scientists say
that birth always takes place in darkness. The seed sprouts only in the
darkness of the soil. Take the seeds out in the light and the seed stops
sprouting. The birth of a child takes place in the darkness of the
mother’s womb. Light turns birth into death.</p><p><br></p><p>The mysterious sutras of Existence are always formed in darkness, in
the hidden, secret world. That alone can be secret, which is passive.
That which is aggressive carl never be hidden. Therefore man’s
personality is more superficial and with little depth. The woman’s
personality is much more deep and less superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the very reason why a man tires so soon whereas a woman does
not, for aggression is very tiring. Therefore there cannot be
male-prostitutes for one intercourse tires him. woman could become a
prostitute for even fifty acts of sex, do not tire her. She is merely
receptive, she does nothing. So a very strange and unique happening took
place: women became prostitutes, men could not; men could be aggressive,
women could not be; men became ruffians, woman could not.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised tO know that to a 100 girls that are born,
there are 116 boys born. Nature keeps the balance for the body of a male
is weak. We always think that man is the stronger of the two but this is
a mere notion. That is why 116 boys are born to every 101 girls that are
born, 16 boys die before they reach the age of 14 and so the number
becomes equal. Nature has to produce 16 boys more; they are the extras
needed to keep the balance.</p><p><br></p><p>The average age of a woman is more than a man’s by 5 to 7 years. If a
man lives for 70 years, the woman lives till 75. How much labour the
woman’s body undergoes! The labour involved in giving birth to one child
is the same as the labour involved in producing one atom-bomb! And a
woman can produce 20 children and still live five years longer than man.
Women are less prone to illness also. The illnesses she does suffer from
are all caused by the male-dominated society she lives in and the
harassment thereof. Seventy per cent of her ailments are due to the
male-domination. Man arranges his affairs from his point of view and
woman has to adjust herself accordingly. This is the cause of all her
illnesses. Hysteria is the result of adjusting to the male-society.</p><p><br></p><p>If there be a woman dominated society the incidence of hysteria among
the men would be five times more. Almost all men would turn insane. It
is the quality of self:resistance that has kept our woman- folk from ali
going mad. Yet we find women ill-tempered, jealous, quarrelsome. She
indulges in quarrel all the twenty-four hours. This is all because she
is not allowed to be what she is born to be by our society, which is
always demanding other things of them. This makes their creative power
turn towards perversion, destruction and unnatural activities.</p><p><br></p><p>Woman has been so long and so much suppressed and tyrannized by men
that people (and also women themselves) have come to believe themselves
to be the weaker sex. I wish to tell you that</p><p>those who know, know differently; and what they know is that women
are so powerful and strong that if they had not been subdued they would
have suppressed men long ago. Woman needs to be subdued from childhood
for she can prove dangerous. Woman has been suppressed the world over
only for this reason. Had she been allowed to grow up free, man’s plight
would have been pitiable. Therefore she has been kept in check from all
sides, right from her childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>And the injunctions on women were very much like the Chinese custom
of putting a little girl’s feet in iron shoes so that her feet did not
grow. She could not run, she could not walk and always needed the
support of man. Then the men turned round and told them, “You are so
frail, you are so delicate!” They rated this frailty very high for that
was the only way they could control them!</p><p><br></p><p>A woman can prove stronger than man, if she is allowed to develop
completely for nature has endowed her with the power of creation. The
power of creation is so great a power that it can only be contained by
those who are strong; for they alone are capable of holding the
embryo.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “Understand this Female-Mystery well.” This Spirit of
the Valley never tires, never dies. Understand well this passivity, this
art of acting without action, this non-violent aggression, this secret
of calling without calling – understand it well. Lao Tzu says, “Only by
understanding this secret, can a man attain the Supreme Truth.” We can
never attain the Supreme Truth with our male-attitude for no act of
aggression can be committed on the Supreme Truth. We cannot storm the
house of God with a rifle or a sword!</p><p><br></p><p>Only he attains God who has thoroughly understood this
Female-Mystery, who has so surrendered himself, who has so let go of
himself that the power of God descends into him – just as in the act of
love, the woman lets go of herself so entirely for the man to descend
into her.</p><p><br></p><p>A unique fact has begun to come within our notice since the last ten
years. The authentic woman is completely lost and the pseudo-women of
today are merely the creations of man. Those whom we call the women of
today are no more than play-things designed by man. she is not a natural
woman – as she should be.</p><p><br></p><p>The Western Scientists are carrying out a small experiment in which
they are trying out a new method. Tantra has worked on this subject in
this country, some 2,000 years ago and discovered that it is possible.
In the sex-act, the man is active; if he is not, the act is not
possible. If the man is old, or weak or if his genitals become lax, the
act is impossible. But in this experiment that is being carried out in
the West, the scientists declare that if a man’s genitals have become
weak and inactive, this does not matter. If the woman really loves the
man, as soon as her genitals reach the man’s, it silently sucks up his
organ within herself. The man has no need to make any effort. If the
woman’s love is strong, her body sucks up his organ as air is sucked up
into an empty space. This is a very astonishing fact.</p><p><br></p><p>And if this does not come about the only reason is that the woman
does not love this man therefore, her body does not perform the act of
suction. Hence all actions of man are aggressive. If a woman loves, her
entire biological set up is such that she draws in the man within
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “This is the mystery of woman, that without doing
anything she does all.” If man wishes to do something, he has to perform
the act. The mystery of religion is also feminine. If anyone sets</p><p>out to attain God, he will never attain him. If someone however keeps
still where he is and opens the doors of his heart, God enters now and
here, this very moment! Those who go far to seek, travel far into the
infinite, wander from birth-to-birth, are never able to attain Him for
the secret of attaining Him, is to become receptive. We have to leave
ourselves open. We should be ready to see that our gates are not shut
when He comes. Our love should be a passive awaiting – that is all.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman can wait for many births for her lover to come; a man cannot.
He does not know what it is to wait, it is missing in his mental
make-up. He wants everything here and now – instantly. He wants instant
coffee as well as instant sex! Therefore the system of marriage was
evolved by man for instant sex is only possible in marriage. A man can
never wait. He is fretful, ardent, restive, filled with tensions. A
woman can wait – wait till eternity!</p><p><br></p><p>In this country, the custom of keeping a woman widow and allowing a
man to marry after his wife’s death, was not so much to tyrannize them
but because the element of her ability to bear and wait was also taken
into consideration. This quality of her’s was well understood and
recognised. A woman can wait not only life-long for her lover but for
many lives to come. This trust was put in her by society. So when in
India this custom came into practice, it was not only that it was
because it was favourable for men; rather as far as I understand, this
was a great insult to the male-sex, and a very deep-seated reverence for
women that they could be trusted to wait. Since a man could not stay
without sex, he was not forced not to remarry whereas for a woman,
widow-hood was compulsory.</p><p><br></p><p>The compulsion for widow-hood was also because in the awaiting, her
female-element revealed itself to the full. The more opportunity she had
of non-active awaiting, the deeper became the depths within her. Then
her inner mystery becomes more tender and fragrant.</p><p><br></p><p>I have read a very astonishing matter which I could not find an
answer to. The catholics go to make confessions to their priests. It is
the experience of many priests, that when women confess their sins, they
undergo a very curious-feeling. This is natural since they are merely
priests by profession – trained into priesthood.</p><p><br></p><p>The worst thing that Christianity has given this world, is educated
priests. No one can be trained into priest-hood. You can train a person
to become a lawyer or a doctor but never to be a priest. It is just like
the fact that there never can be a trained poet. If a person is educated
in poetry, he will at most write inferior verse. Poetry will never flow
out of him. To become a priest entails natural capability, attained by
sadhana. It cannot be taught. Christianity has, however educated their
priests. Anyone can take this training and attain the degree of Doctor
of Divinity. Divinity that is attained by a certificate, is no divinity.
You cannot decide divinity by a mere piece of paper!</p><p><br></p><p>So when women confess before these so-called priests, their
confessions become very tempting. It is but natural that when a woman
confesses her sins in a secluded place to a priest, it becomes a matter
of uneasiness for the man. The woman feels relieved of her burden of
sins but the load is passed on to the priest. One statement of these
priests is very astonishing. They say they find widows more attractive
and tempting. What could be the reason?</p><p><br></p><p>Actually if a widow is a widow in actuality, the beauty of her
personality increases a thousand fold, because her awaiting makes her
female-mystery more mysterious and profound. The mystery in an unmarried
girl also, is the mystery of awaiting. Therefore everywhere in the
world, there is the</p><p>custom of marrying a virgin girl. If a girl is not virgin, you will
never have the opportunity to know the Female. Mystery for the mystery
in her is already broken. She is no longer deep and mysterious for she
has not undergone her full period of awaiting to allow the required time
for the flower of mystery to bloom within her. Those societies that laid
great stress on the virginity of women have not worried about the
bachelor-hood of man. The reason is simple; this makes no difference
whereas the virginity of a woman is very essential for there is a beauty
in her virginity which is lost after marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>This beauty returns to the woman when she begins to be-come a mother
for now she stands at the door-step of a greater awaiting – an awaiting
for a great mystery to unfold itself. When a woman becomes pregnant, the
husband is worried. This is natural, for there is no awaiting as far as
the man is concerned; for him it is yet another economic problem. The
mother, however, becomes tender. As the child develops within her, the
depth in her eyes grows deeper. There is the unfoldment of new elements
within her body. The beauty of a pregnant woman is heavy with the Female
Mystery. What is this mystery? Passivity is the secret. She has not to
do anything to become a mother. The child grows on its own within her.
She has only to wait. Actually she has to stop doing anything and just
wait as the development of the child progresses within her. She then is
simply awaiting, weaving dreams.</p><p>If a woman stops all activities in the last months of her pregnancy,
she can see those dreams which can be forerunners of her child’s future.
This is why the dreams of the mothers of Mahavira and Buddha became so
priceless. It is said in the case of both Mahavira and Buddha, that
before their birth, their mothers had dreams. These dreams occurred
every day and in them they could see the signs and marks of their coming
lives. If a mother is really a mother and if she is in a complete
passive state vis-a-vis the spirit within her womb, she can write the
horoscope of her child. No astronomer or priest is required. And if a
mother cannot write the horoscope of her child, no one else can, for so
much one-ness, so much identity can never be with another person. There
is not so much feeling of one-ness between a husband and a wife as
between a mother and son for the son is an extension of her very
self.</p><p>A woman has to do nothing to become a mother. A man has to do a lot
to become a father. The mother to be has merely to observe a silent
awaiting; and in this silent awaiting, two things are born: one is the
child and the other is the mother. This is why, the highest honour and
respect that has been given to woman in the East (where the Feminine
Mystery was recognized) has been as a mother. This is a very astonishing
fact.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask me, “You call the sannyasins ‘Swami’ but you call the
Sannyasin is ‘Ma’ even those who are not married?” Actually the mother
is the supreme dignity of a woman. A woman is on the highest pinnacle of
her glory when she becomes a mother. Her peak experience is not that of
being a beloved or a wife, these are the mere steps that lead her to the
peak of mother-hood. Wherever a society has considered the woman to have
reached the height of her woman-hood when she becomes a wife, the women
have been very unhappy for that is not their ultimate experience. The
man of this society is happy for him, his peak is reached when he
becomes a husband or a father or a lover. The same is not the case with
women however.</p><p>The secret of woman’s motherhood is according to Lao Tzu, like
darkness. There are many more things we should take into
consideration:</p><p><br></p><p>When a male child is born, there are no sex-hormones within him at
birth. His semen begins to be</p><p>formed later on. But a girl is born with all the ova within her! All
the ova she would need in her life-time are there within her right from
birth. A woman is a complete woman from the time of her birth. A man is
born incomplete. This is the reason why boys are so restless whereas
girls are quiet. There is an uneasiness about boys that is born along
with them. The beauty and demeanor of a girl’s personality has very much
to do with the peace within her. We have to make an effort to make a
girl uneasy and we have to make an effort to make a boy relax. This is
natural.</p><p><br></p><p>Biologists say that the nucleus of the egg from which a female is
born contains similar chromosomes – xx whereas the nucleus of the egg
from which a male is born are not similar, they are x, y. The elements
that go into forming a female are alike, therefore the woman is graceful
and shapely whereas man is not. The well-balanced chromosomes give the
shapeliness of curves to a woman’s body. There is no such balance in the
male body. Besides, the female body is made out of 48 chromosomes – the
full number of chromosomes from both the male and female egg – whereas
the male body is formed of 47 chromosomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Biologists say it is the lack of this one chromosome that makes a man
so restless and sends him running all his life. He runs from one place
to another, from earth to the moon. It is the search for that one
chromosome, the lack of which he feels in his lack of perfection.</p><p><br></p><p>This balanced, peaceful, patient personality of a woman, Lao Tzu
says, is a profound mystery of Existence. God is in Existence, like the
making of a woman and not like a man. Therefore we cannot see God, nor
can we catch hold of Him. He is present – definitely – but His Presence
is feminine-like, as good as not there. The more we try to catch-hold of
Him, the more He eludes us, the farther He goes away from us and the
more difficult His search becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is feminine. This means whatever manifests in Existence is
hidden in Existence from the beginning – just as I said that whatever is
to be born of a woman is already present within her at birth. There is
no new addition after her birth.</p><p><br></p><p>She is born complete. There is growth within her but no addition.
This is the reason that she is satisfied in life. Her satisfaction is
astonishing or else, she could not have been kept a slave for so long.
She is content in her slavery, she is content to live under all
conditions. It is difficult to make a woman dissatisfied. It can only be
possible if there is any biological change within her. This has happened
in the West, where woman has become restless.</p><p><br></p><p>When a woman becomes restless, she is difficult to pacify, for this
restlessness of hers is very unnatural. This is why a woman does not
remain restless but goes mad. A woman is either serene, peaceful or mad.
She cannot be anything in between. There are no gradations in her. A man
is never very peaceful. nor so insane. He sways within the degrees of
restlessness. This is why the most tense conditions do not make him
insane and the most peaceful conditions fail to make him completely
tranquil.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche has made a very thought-provoking statement. He has said,
“To my mind, people like Buddha must have had a large proportion of the
female-element”. Nietzsche has called Buddha womanish. I think there is
a deep understanding behind this remark. This is the truth – when a man
becomes completely tranquil, he becomes effeminate. This is bound to be.
He will become so serene and calm that all the uneasiness, all the
restlessness and tensions that are inevitable in a man’s being, are all
gone – Lost!</p><p>This is the reason why the images of Buddha, Krishna and Mahavira are
made symbolically clean- shaven. It is not that these personalities had
no beard or moustache but these were symbolically dropped from their
images, for they no longer gave reference of their character. There is
only one image where Buddha is shown with a beard and therefore people
say it is a false image for no where else has Buddha been shown with a
beard. There is one image of Mahavira that has a moustache shown. People
do not take this image to be authentic either. The temple where this
image is, is called the temple of the Mustachioed Mahavira. It is
however not possible that Mahavira or Buddha had no moustache, no beard.
There could be solitary exceptions where the lack of hormones could
bring about this condition but that is rare. Besides, it cannot be that
the 24 Tirthankaras of the Jainas had no moustaches and no beards! Such
a big coincidence is impossible. The absence of these male signs on the
faces of Mahavira and Buddha are the symbolic acceptance of the fact,
that these personalities had entered into the feminine mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, when I say, ‘feminine’, I do not mean only ‘woman’. It is
quite possible a woman may never enter the feminine mystery and a man
may enter. The Feminine Mystery is a Sutra of Existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu therefore says, “THE FEMALE MYSTERY, THUS DO WE NAME.” There
is a reason for this simile for it is full of meaning. This mystery
cannot be compared to man for this mystery is the Supreme Tranquility.
It is so tranquil that its presence is not felt, for a presence can only
be felt when it is conveyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, the real beloved is not the one who always makes her
presence felt to her lover. When the husband comes home, the wife
devises a thousand and one ways of making her presence felt; the husband
tries his utmost to ignore her presence – he re-opens the newspaper, he
has read ten times. Then all the noises of the house that the woman
creates, remain on the other side of the newspaper; it becomes a wall
between the husband and the wife. The most authentic beloved is the one
who has become aware of the feminine-mystery. She does not let her lover
feel her presence at all!</p><p><br></p><p>I shall tell you of a wonderful incident in the life of Vachaspati
Mishra. His father urged him to marry. Vachaspati understood nothing of
marriage. He however, bowed to his father’s wishes, taking it for
granted that whatever he said was correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Vachaspati was engrossed in the search for God. He understood nothing
else. If anyone talked about anything, he took it to be a topic of God.
So when his father asked him, “Will you marry?” He said, “Yes”. Perhaps
he thought his father said, “Will you meet God?” and he said yes. Just
as it happens with people generally, if a person is seeking wealth and
you ask him, “Will you seek religion?” He will think you are asking him
about wealth. Whatever the search within, that only rings in our ears.
So Vachaspati also heard what was within him perhaps and said yes.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was made to sit on the horse to go to the bride’s place he
asked, “Where are you taking me?” His father said, “You fool! Don’t you
know you are getting married? Did you not agree to get married?” So
Vachaspati thought it was not right to refuse at that moment. Since he
had agreed even though without knowing, he took it to be God’s wish that
he be married.</p><p><br></p><p>He returned home with his bride but it never occurred to him that he
had brought a bride home! How could he remember for it was not he who
said yes to marriage, nor he who got married. He</p><p>was engrossed in his own work. He was writing a commentary on
BRAHMA-SUTRA. He finished this work after 12 years. For 12 years his
wife would quietly light the lamp for him in the evening and place
flowers at his feet each morning. In the afternoons she brought his
meals and when he finished, she quietly withdrew it. For 12 years
Vachaspati had not the slightest awareness of his wife. The wife made no
effort to let him know she was there. On the contrary, she took all
possible care that he may not, even by mistake, come to know of her
presence. She wanted to cause no disturbance in his work.</p><p><br></p><p>After 12 years on the night of a full-moon, when his work was
completed and Vachaspati rose to go to bed, his wife picked up the lamp
to show him the way. For the first time Vachaspati (so the story goes)
saw his wife’s hand – Now after 12 years, when his work was over and his
mind was disengaged from work. He saw the hands, the bangles and heard
the tinkle of her bangles. He turned round and saw her and he exclaimed,
“Woman! What are you doing, alone here at this time of night? Who are
you? From where have you entered, the whole house is closed? Where have
you to go, shall I reach you home?” His wife said, “For 12 years, you
have been busy with your work. Perhaps you have forgotten – you have
been so busy! It is not possible that you should remember. If you can
think back, 12 years from now, perhaps you may be able to recollect – I
am the woman you brought to this house as your wedded wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vachaspati wept, “It is too late now!” He moaned. “I have already
made the vow to leave home when my composition was completed. Now it is
time for me to leave! It is almost dawn and I am ready to leave. Why did
you not tell me earlier, foolish girl! You should have given me some
hint! Now it is too late.” Saying this, he wept like a child. Seeing her
husband cry, she fell on his feet and said, “Whatever I was to achieve,
I have achieved through these tears. I wish for nothing more. Go without
any compunction. What more could I have achieved than this, that
Vachaspati’s eyes are filled with tears for me? I have received more
than I deserved.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vachaspati has named his book BHAMATI. This word has nothing to do
with the book. It is his wife’s name. He said to her “I can do nothing
for you but let the world forget me, let it not forget you. I shall name
my book after you.” It is a fact, no one remembers Vachaspati but
Bhamati is remembered by many. BHAMATI is a wonderful exposition of
BRAHMA SUTRA. there is none to equal it. This woman must be having the
Feminine-Mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my firm belief that she attained so much of Vachaspati in that
single moment, as she would never have attained by a thousand other
means. The way Vachaspati must have become one with the heart of this
woman, no woman could ever establish such oneness with her husband. The
Feminine-Mystery, this non-presence of this woman touched the very
life-breath of Vachaspati, twelve years – and this woman did not allow
him to feel her presence! And every day she lit his lamp, every day she
fed him. Vachaspati asked, “Then was it you who placed flowers at my
feet each morning? And was it you who put the tray before me and was it
you who lit the lamp for me every evening? But how is it that I did not
ever see your hand?” Bhamati replied, “If my hand had become visible to
you, it would only have meant that my love was lacking, I could
wait”.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not necessary that all women obtain this Feminine-Mystery.
This is only a name given by Lao Tzu for this name is symptomatic,
suggestive and enables us to understand this term. A man also can attain
this Female-Mystery. Actually, only those can establish their identity
with Existence who have thus reached this prayerful awaiting.</p><p>The door of this Feminine-Mystery is the original source of heaven
and earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether it is the birth of matter or whether it is the birth of
consciousness; whether the earth is born or heaven, everything is born
through the mystery that lies hidden in the depths of Existence.
Therefore I have said that those who have looked upon God as mother – as
Durga or Amba – their understanding is much deeper than those who look
upon Him as Father. If God exists anywhere, He is feminine, for man does
not have the ability and the patience to give birth to such a vast
Universe. That which gives birth to the myriads of stars and moons must
have a womb, without which it is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore the three extensions of the Jewish order – Judaism,
Christianity and Islam – have given a very wrong concept of God to the
world – that of God, the Father. This is a very dangerous concept for it
gratifies the ego of man. Man looks upon himself as established in the
form of God but this has no connection with the Reality of Existence.
More befitting, more proper, is the concept of a Universal Mother. But
this can only be understood when you understand the Feminine Mystery,
when you understand Lao Tzu. Else it cannot be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen the image of Kali? She is the mother, She is
terrible! In one hand she holds a human skull! She is the mother – Her
eyes are filled with the ocean of tenderness. Down below – She stands on
the chest of someone! Someone lies crushed under Her feet! Why? Because
that which creates, destroys also. Destruction is the other part of
creation. Those were wonderful people who conceived this image. They
were people with great imagination who could visualise great
possibilities. They have erected the image of Mother standing on a dead
body! In her hands she holds the head of a dead man, dripping blood.
Round her neck she wears a necklace of skulls but She has the eyes of
the Mother, the Heart of the Mother from where the milk flows – and yet,
the necklace of skulls!</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, the Annihilation of the Universe starts from the very place
where creation starts. The circle completes at the same point. Therefore
the mother gives birth but when she becomes terrible she can also give
death. When a woman becomes terrible she becomes extremely dangerous.
She has a great store of energy. The energy is the same whether it
creates or destroys.</p><p><br></p><p>The imagination of those who conceived of the Mother as an embodiment
both of creation and destruction was a very far-sighted imagination but
together with this it was very deep and very near Truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “That alone is the original source of the Earth and
Heaven.” Everything takes birth therein. But remember everything is
re-absorbed in the same place. That is the ultimate source also. It is
altogether continuous. This Feminine Existence, this passive awaiting
empty Existence is never divided. It is continuous – without any
discontinuity whatsoever. As I said before, the lamp is lighted and
extinguished; but darkness is continuous. Birth comes, life becomes
visible; but death is ceaseless. Mountains appear and disappear, the
valley remains forever. When the mountains are there, the valley can be
seen; when they are no more, the valley cannot be seen but its existence
is ceaseless – altogether ceaseless. It does not cease when the
mountains cease. Its power is indivisible, indestructible. No matter how
much energy is withdrawn from this emptiness, it never decreases.</p><p><br></p><p>A man misses, a woman never misses. A man is enfeebled, a woman
never.</p><p>Those whom we ordinarily call women, they too do not waste away as
much as men. If a woman gains the full knowledge of her Feminine
Mystery, she can remain established in an immaculate beauty even in old
age. This is difficult for man. A man comes like a storm and goes away.
If a woman attains to the height of her motherhood, she can remain
beautiful till her last moment of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>A man can maintain his beauty till the end only if he penetrates the
female mystery. This happens sometimes.</p><p><br></p><p>In this connection I shall give you another example. We have not made
any pictures of Buddha, Krishna or Mahavira in their old age. All
pictures depict them young. But Buddha died at the age of 80, so did
Mahavira. Rama and Krishna also attained old age but the pictures we
have of them are all of their young age. This is symbolic and purposely
so. When a person becomes so engrossed and universed in Existence, he is
forever young and fresh. He has attained the sutra within him for
keeping constantly young: Now he is established indivisibly and
ceaselessly in his energy.</p><p><br></p><p>“Make use of it,” Lao Tzu says, “Make use of this constant energy.
Make use of this Feminine-Energy and its natural services become
available to you.” You must know how to use this energy for its doors
are always open to you. This feminine element, is always ready to give,
you just be ready to receive.”</p><p><br></p><p>“USE GENTLY AND WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF PAIN LONG AND UNBROKEN, THUS ITS
POWER REMAIN.”</p><p>Remember, the more gentle you are, the more effeminate you are. The
more manly you are, the less gentle you shall be. This is why when a man
tries to be gentle, his male elements begin to get less. So a very
strange and wonderful happening takes place, as it has happened in
America of late. Today the White American’s fear of the Black Negro is
not entirely for economic reasons. It is more on the ground of
sexuality. The white man has become so gentle that he knows that on the
sexual level, his wife would prefer a negro to him. The negro is
potentially more sexual because he is coarse and crude and un-gentle. He
belongs to the jungles. But a barbaric man has a particular attraction –
the attraction of the male, which is very titillating.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who is very gentle, becomes effeminate. If a love-story is to
be made round Buddha; it would be a very difficult task. A love-story
needs a masculine, coarse, lover. And the more crude he is, the more
titillating, the more manly. So when a Western film director chooses a
hero for his films, he takes care to see that he has hair on his chest
and his arms. When he chooses a heroine, she should be without any hair
on her body. The man should appear a little savage, a little raw, then
the sexual attraction is more. The Negro is feared today and the fear is
less monetary and more psychological.</p><p><br></p><p>As a man becomes gentle, he becomes more effeminate, more mild and
the fun of the thing is; the milder he becomes, the less sexual, he is.
Then this process of his getting less and less sexual, becomes the path
that leads to the Supreme Mystery of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “USE GENTLY AND WITHOUT TOUCH OF PAIN.” Remember this.
It needs a little explanation.</p><p>Whenever a man touches a woman, he wishes to give her many kinds of
pain. Actually, the love of a man, viewed methodologically, is that of
giving pain to the woman. If he wants to show more love, he will press
her hand harder. If his kiss becomes more loving, he will bite, he will
claw. In the old KAMA-SHASTRAS, this clawing is very much extolled: “He
is no man who does not claw his woman till she bleeds.” That is a sign
of a lover – clawing! If the lover is an expert, he would be like
Marquis de Sade. When nails were not effective, he kept knives and forks
with him.</p><p><br></p><p>The method of a man’s love is violent. Therefore, the more he loves,
the more violent he becomes. It is a great possibility that if such a
man loves completely, he may even murder his wife – all because of love!
Such crimes have taken place and the courts have found it difficult to
judge these cases where there has been no element of enmity or hatred –
rather profusion of love. The man is so filled with love that whilst
pressing his beloved, he does not know when he pressed the life out of
her!</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, ‘Use gently’. He is talking of this Supreme Truth,
which he says, one must handle very gently “... AND WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF
PAIN.” Let not Existence feel the slightest twitch of pain through you.
Then and then alone will you be able to understand the Feminine Mystery.
When a woman makes love to a man, she places her hand so lightly on his
shoulder as if she is afraid of causing him even the slightest
inconvenience of touching him. And that is the secret of a woman. The
more her hand touches as if it is not touching, the more loving it
becomes. When a woman presses a man’s shoulder, she is giving news of
the fact that she has stepped apart from the Feminine Mystery and she is
aping the man. The woman just lets herself go, she floats in the man’s
love. She only shows her willingness. More than this, she does not do.
She does not even touch a man so that the touch becomes ungentle!</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great arising in the West of late. The learned and wise
women of the West – if so we can call them – assert that a woman should
be as aggressive as a man. When she makes love, she should be as
violent. She certainly will become like a man if she inculcates such
violence and aggression but she will then undoubtedly, miss the Feminine
Mystery that Lao Tzu talks about. We must concede however, that Lao Tzu
is much much wiser. His wisdom is the ultimate in wisdom. He talks from
the plane where there is a wisdom beyond wisdom, where all
intellectualism fails and the Perfect Wisdom is born. He talks from that
plane.</p><p><br></p><p>This applies to both men and women however.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you one more thing in the end. Let not the ladies feel
very proud within themselves for there are hardly any ‘women’ among
them. It is a very difficult task to be a woman. To be a woman, is the
highest experience. Let not the men-folk be distressed for there is not
much difference between them and the ladies. Both have to go a long way.
Understand this, that we shall be able to understand Truth only to the
extent that we become non-aggressive, awaiting, passive like the Spirit
of the Valley; and not if we are egoist like the mountains. We should be
humble like the valley, silent like the womb and filled with awaiting.
The indivisible, constant energy, resides in that supreme passivity and
perfect inaction. Everything is born there-from and everything merges
again into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today, rest tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

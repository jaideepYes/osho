What is his trouble? What is his distress?\nIf there is one man who is worried or a few men, one could understand that they may be at fault. But the opposite is the case. Once in a while we come across a calm and composed person or a person really filled with well-being. The rest of us are restless, unhealthy and suffering. Illness seems to be the order of the day and well-being and good health seem to be exceptions. Ignorance seems to be the soul of life and knowledge, an accidental happening – a coincidence. It seems that to be a human being is to be ill, worried, distressed.\nWe never know how sometimes, someone becomes carefree, relaxed! Either it is a mistake of Nature or a boon from the Gods! The rule seems to be: As we are, we are diseased, ailing harassed.\nThis sutra of Lao Tzu is unique. He says the cause of restlessness in so many people, is the make- up of the human mind, the fundaments of his culture, the mode of thinking of his civilisation, the very structure of his society. Each man is so placed that he is bound to be ill.\nThe latest research in the West shows that each man is born a genius but we have created such a state of affairs around us that the genius is maimed and almost destroyed.\nSwami Ram writes in his memoirs that while in Japan, he saw pine trees the size of just one span. He was surprised! The trees were not saplings. They were 100-150 years old but their growth was stunted. When he inquired of the gardener, he was shown the bottom of the pots. They were broken and the roots were regularly cut by the gardener. The roots could not grow, so the trees also could not shoot up. It is very necessary for roots to go deep down into the earth, if the tree has to grow taller. Now it the gardener does not want the tree to grow taller. He will keep on clipping the roots with the result that the tree will grow old but remain small.\nOur method for human beings is also somewhat similar. Therefore all the people we see, have grown only a span in height whereas they could have touched the skies.\nWe have been feeding poison to the roots of mankind.\nThis poisoning has gone on for ages with the result we have forgotten it is poison. Then each generation puts in its own share of poison. Your elders pour poison into your roots and you pour poison into your children’s roots. Naturally every father does to his son what his father did to him and so the vicious circle goes on.\nLao Tzu has said a few things in connection with this poison.\nTo understand this we have first and foremost to understand that what has been fed to the human mind in largest quantity, is the poison of ambition. The whole structure of our society is based on ambition. We make it a point to make the littlest child ambitious. He is goaded on and on to stand first in whatever he does – whether at school or at play, while learning behaviour or wearing clothes; whatever he does, or whatever we make him do, we see that he is well caught in the spirit of competition.\nAmbition means: We make his ego stand in competition with the ego of others. We tell him that others should not overtake him. His legging behind will leave no place for his ego. So wherever he is, he should always try to be at the top. This being the first, is our poison. Whether in clothes or in business or in education or whether in worship and prayer or in renunciation or in penance we are taught constantly to remember that ‘I am being judged vis-a-vis others’. I have forever to see where I stand with regard to others. What is my place in the line? Am I lagging behind? If so, I shall be pained.\nAnd if there is a long line behind me, I shall be delighted. Those who are happy are only so when they know they are giving pain to others behind them. Or else there is no delight.\nBut the world is so big, that no one person can be absolutely in the fore-front; and life so complicated that there does not arise the question of being in the forefront. This complexity of life is multi-faceted. If a man succeeds in amassing a lot of wealth, he finds someone else has beaten him in health then be he a beggar begging on the streets. whose clothes are in tatters. One person may be rich in health but he finds himself most lacking in looks. If a man is a successful businessman, he finds many others who are intellectually much above him. And more often than not a very intellectual\nperson finds it hard to obtain two square meals a day, while others with much lesser intelligence build palaces for themselves.\nLife is many-faced – multi-dimensional. Then if in every direction a man tries to be at the top, he is bound to go mad. It is a miracle if he does not! The whole structure is insane. Therefore, wherever we stand there is pain and anguish for we find some standing before us and some behind!\nTo be ambitious is never to think in terms of ‘who I am’ but to think in terms of myself as related to others. Never to see myself straight in the face but always in comparison with others. Never to see whether, where I stand gives pleasure or not but to see that others do not gain more happiness than me. Also not to worry if I am in pain, if others are undergoing greater pain. Then I can be content.\nIt is said that once, there were floods in a village. An old farmer was looking sad and worried for all his fields and cattle were carried away by the flood waters. His young neighbour asked him “Grandpa, you look very worried? Have you lost all your goats in the floods?” “Have you lost yours too?” The old man asked, “Yes” replied the young man, “And did all your cattle die too?” He asked again “Yes,” said the young man. “And are all your fields washed away?” “Yes,” said the young man again. “In that case,” says the old man, “I have no reason to be so worried.” The question was not whether he had lost all but whether others lost equally or more!\nWhether in joy or in sorrow, we have always to be aware where we are in the line. Our thinking is arranged in lines. We never think of ourselves as free individuals, we always see and worry about our place in the line – where we stand in the queue. And this is a circular queue. We overtake one, then another, then another, always hoping to be first but we find always that there are always some in front of us!\nThe queue is round. There is no straight line. And usually the one who runs a great deal suddenly discovers that he lags far behind others! He finds that those he left way back, stand in front of him! Therefore invariably, those who reach the peak of success, fall into calamity. They are always frustrated and what is this frustration? They find that inspite of all their toil and labour they have not reached the peak and those they left far behind, suddenly appear right in front of them!\nUnderstand Lao Tzu’s sutra in this context.\nLao Tzu says that if there are no quality-grades of talent and aptitude, there would be no struggle and no envy or rivalry. “Why should we make talent a grade to judge people?” asks Lao Tzu. Why should we not take it as the nature of the person? Understand the difference for many things depend upon it: Why should we not consider the capability of a person as his characteristic and why should we make it a quality-measure?\nA man is proficient in mathematics. This proficiency is his nature. One man is proficient in music; this is his nature. Now one man is weak in mathematics – that is his disposition. There is nothing great about a mathematical genius for he has attained this quality from nature. And it is no disqualification for a man to be weak in mathematics for that again is what he has attained from nature in the same way.\nThe Zen Fakir Rinzai was telling a man as he stood outside his hut. “Do you see those trees reaching the skies and do you see these shrubs yonder?” “It is years,” he says, “Since I live near these trees\nand never have I once heard the shrubs wondering why the trees are so tall! Nor have I ever seen the tall trees looking down haughtily at the tiny shrubs!” “What is the secret?” His companion asked him. “The secret is only this,” said Rinzai “that the trees are trees because nature made them so and the shrubs are shrubs for the same reason.” No status is achieved by being big and there is no loss of face in being small. The same nature that makes the trees tall, makes the grass weeds small. It is also not always necessary that those that are big are big in all respects. When the storm comes, the big trees are uprooted whereas the lowly weed is left unharmed.\nNapoleon was a short man. He was not tall. But it invariably happens that men of short stature aspire to great heights. One day he was trying to remove a book from a shelf in his library. His hand could not reach so his attendant who was 7 feet tall said, “Sir, if it is does not seem improper may I step ahead and bring the book out for you? I am the highest man in your army. There is no one higher than me,” Napoleon was red with fury. “You are not higher, you are only taller. There may be no one taller than you but I alone am the highest.”\nIt was but natural that Napoleon was hurt. The fault was not only of the language – it was avery big mistake. Napoleon corrected him immediately – tallest not highest. What is the difference? To be tall is a natural phenomena. With height there is valuation, quality, grade. There is no valuation with tallness for that is a gift of nature but with the question of height, of stature, valuation comes in\nLao Tzu says, “If there is no quality-grade with talent, there would be no strifes and no struggles.” Would that we would begin to see that things have their own specific nature and act accordingly; and they are not responsible for their natural characteristics! We never hold a blind man responsible for his blindness? Even if he is blind from birth we sympathise with him.\nAbout two years ago, a blind boy came to see me in Jabalpur, all the way from Srinagar. There was a Shivir held there on Mahavira. He came to know of it much later and so missed, so he came all the way to Jabalpur. “You must have found it very difficult to travel the long distance from Srinagar to Jabalpur?” I asked him. “Not at all!” He replied “Blindness is a great asset to me. Everybody is ready to help. One person catches hold of my hand, another buys a ticket for me. Why, the rickshaw-man brought me all the way from station, free of charge and is waiting outside to drop me back to the station. If I had eyes, I could not have been better off.”\nIf some one is blind we are all sympathy for him. We feel it is not his fault but if someone is dull, we do not sympathise with him. On the contrary, we call him an idiot! We never ever wait and ponder how he is at fault if he is dull? The poor man is criticised and looked down upon. Everywhere he will be ill-treated and pushed back. No one will ever be kind to him. Why? Because we have made the intellect our sutra for ambition. Without intellect we cannot progress in ambition. Therefore the measure of intellect, the I.Q. Has become very important.\nBut what is behind all this? One man is born an Einstein, what is Einstein’s qualification in that? He has not brought about his genius. One man is born an idiot – what is his fault in that?\nLao Tzu says, “Nature makes one person in one way and another in another. It is because we do not accept nature and attribute quality-status to one and quality-deficiency to the other that we give birth to all struggle and rivalry.” This means we are unable to see what is natural, what is the characteristic qualities of a person. We pile our expectations on to nature and think accordingly.\nLao Tzu believes in ‘Nature-ism’. He believes in the natural characteristics. Tao means the natural disposition. “I am such”, he says, “not only this but also that the other is such.” “Then this would mean, we must accept the thief, as a thief, a cheat as a cheat for nature has made them so?” We might argue, “If nature has made them so, what can be done? Should we accept fraud and let it work its way in life?”\nThis is the fight between Lao Tzu and the moralist. The moralist would undoubtedly say that this sutra is dangerous. Suppose we go even so far as to accept that one man is an idiot, one man is a genius and nature has made them so; but if a man is a fraud, if he is a thief, a murderer, what are we to do? Should we accept them as being created such by nature? If you ask Lao Tzu, he will say, “When you did not accept them for what they are, how many murderers did you reform? How many cheats did you convert into honest men? You punished the male-factor by whipping him, putting him in jail and even executing him. Were you able to reform people this way?”\n“The truth is,” says Lao Tzu, “When you punish a person, you make him stronger in his short- comings.” You never rid him of his fault, you only make him more competent. The person who visits the jail once, becomes a jail-bird by and by, for there he gets just the company he wants. He finds enough education on his craft. He comes across master-criminals and others with greater experience than him. So his knowledge of his art improves. Also, if once a man is branded a criminal, you stamp a seal on him. Then be has no way also, of improving his ways. Even if he means to be honest, no one will accept him. Lao Tzu says, “You cannot make a saint out of a sinner.”\nIn England, about 150 years ago, thieves were punished by being flogged in the market-square. Large crowds would gather to witness the flogging. This was done with a view to discourage others from stealing. Soon it was discovered that as the crowd was engaged in watching the spectacle, many pockets were picked!\nThis was discussed in the British Parliament. When an example was being set to dissuade people from stealing, at that very time pockets were being picked! In spite of all the punishments, we have not been able to change man in the least. He is getting worse and worse everyday. According to Lao Tzu: as the laws increase, the law-breakers increase also. Every new law becomes a sutra to create new criminals. Every sentence creates a new crime. Lao Tzu says, “You may keep saying ‘What will happen to man if he does not change!’ The fact remains you have not changed a single man.” The number of courts and jails and the numerous law-books have failed miserably. But it seems some people’s self-interest is hidden behind this.\nI have heard that a thief was convicted for the third time. This is the last, for he has been sentenced for life. After he read out the sentence, the judge asked him, “You took birth in this world and what has been your contribution towards it?” “Don’t you know?” The thief replied, “Because of me how many judges and lawyers and detectives and police earn their living? They would be out of job but for me. You too would be begging on the streets had it not been for me!”\nThis is not merely a joke. This is a truth – a deep truth. If there is no thief on the face of this earth, how would the magistrate be? All this elaborate arrangement carrying so much status and dignity about it, depends entirely on thieves, cheats and men of the underworld. If we look deep with in these people, we shall find that all this class of law-givers would not be happy to hear Lao Tzu. They\nwill argue, “Then it means accept a thief as a thief. Do nothing about it. Then what will happen to the law-givers?” And the most interesting thing that the psychologists have discovered is that only those people become law-givers, who would be the first to break all laws if these were removed. In fact, only the thief takes pleasure in flogging a thief.\nNasruddin was working in a shop but he did not behave well with the customers. So he was turned out. The owner of the shop told him, “You are being thrown out because your behaviour towards the customers is bad. Remember, the law says, ‘the customer is always right’. So it will not do here if you are always trying to prove yourself right and the customer wrong.” Fifteen days after, the shop-owner found Nasruddin standing on the cross-roads dressed as a police-man. He asked him, “Nasruddin you have become a police-man?” “Yes” said Nasruddin. “This is the only job I found where the customer is always wrong.”\nLao Tzu’s statements are difficult to understand and follow. Not only the judiciary but also the sadhu find it ungratifying for the Sadhu considers his piety to be a cultivated quality and not a part of his nature. He says, “With great penance and sadhana and with arduous practice, I have attained piety. You are not a sadhu for you have done nothing.” But Lao Tzu’s piety and goodness are supreme. He says, “If I am a good man, it is no attainment on my part, I deserve no credit for it. If you are not a good man you deserve no contempt. My being good is my nature, you not being good is your nature.” What can we do where there is a question of nature? So no one is high and no one is low.\nOur sadhu’s endeavour however is, on being at the top. If he is not above us, all his efforts are in vain. If we stop reverence of our sadhus and giving them pride of place,99 out of 100 sadhus. will immediately disappear; for respect and reverence is their only mainstay. Their piety is nourishment for their ambition, their ego and their pride. It is very gratifying to be a sadhu and when the society is particularly sinful, saintliness pays great dividends, for then your ego, your ambition and your pride get the best nourishment.\nA sadhu never approves of Lao Tzu. Therefore, the words of Lao Tzu proved very revolutionary for China. Even now after 2,500 years, they are revolutionary and 2,500 years hence also, they will be revolutionary. There is no greater revolution than the Lao Tzu philosophy. Lao Tzu says, “I am like the bitter leaf of the neem tree. It is no fault of the neem tree that its leaves are bitter! The mango bears sweet fruit, what is the greatness of the mango tree in that? Why should the neem be rated low and the mango rated high? Even if one is more useful to you than the other, it is no criterion to judge.”\nWe should understand the opposition of the judiciary, the politician and the moralists. Their argument is, that society will fall still lower but they do not realise that society has already fallen low and can go no lower. The society is degenerated – not will be.\nLao Tzu however says, “It is you who have caused the society to be degenerated. You revile a thief and destroy the possibility of his changing.” You shut all doors of reform. In fact, whenever you praise or condemn, you create boundaries. Then as we create these boundaries of praise and condemnation, we force the evil-doer to remain an evil-doer and constrain a good man to develop hypocrisy in order to maintain an appearance of continued goodness. We leave no place for him to be evil for no man is so good that there is no trace of evil in him and no man so bad that there is no good in him.\nWe tend to break everything into two. We say, “This man is good, there is no evil in him, and no man so bad that there is no good in him.”\nWe tend to break everything into two. We say, “This man is good, there is no evil in him.” Then when some part of evil begins to manifest itself in his life, he will have to practise some deceit. He will try to hide and suppress what is within him and begins to exhibit what is not within him. This our endeavour to praise goodness, turns it into hypocrisy. That is why 99\nIn the same manner, when we call a person bad, we close all doors of improvement for him. Constant condemnation kills all his possible expectation to improve. He feels himself in capable of taking any step in that direction. He looks upon himself as a person fated for damnation. Then slowly the thought gets strengthened within him. “Then why should I not be an expert in my badness?” This then becomes his life-adventure.\nLao Tzu says, “Do not call the bad, wicked, nor the good, good. Put no labels. Just know this, that each man lives according to his nature.” What is the meaning of this?\nThis means, there should be no category no hierarchy in Society. There should be no high and no low. Does this mean there should be communism? This needs to be understood a little. The type of society Lao Tzu talks about, if it is accepted that way, then all people will be uncommon and each person will be according to his nature. Therefore, there will be no feeling of inequality.\nLao Tzu says, “If a man is capable of earning, he will earn and if a man is capable of losing, he will lose and if a man is capable of begging only, he will beg.” But in no way will the beggar be lesser than the rich man, for we give the latter no grade of status. We say, it is the nature of this man that he cannot stay without constructing a palace. Another man’s nature is, he cannot keep the money he has. He cannot help squandering it. This is his nature. But we make no differentiation. We accept the disposition of each person and respect it. In truth, the chief mark of a sadhu is, that he accepts all – all kinds of dispositions and characteristics.\nIf such a possibility happens that we accept all types of dispositions, there will no longer be strifes and struggles.\nI was talking to a friend yesterday. There is a conflict between him and his wife. As is natural, he thought if he had married another woman there would not have been this state of affairs. Now this man has no experience of another woman. She exists only in imagination. The wife also feels the same way. She feels she has made a wrong choice. Another man would have made a better husband. In this case also, there is no experience of the other man. He is purely imaginary. Now we cannot have the experience of all the women in the world or all the men in the world, therefore, the illusion persists.\nI told my friend, “It is not a question of this woman or that woman. It is a question of your different natures. There is conflict in your dispositions. And it is the arrangement between a man and a woman that society has prescribed that is to be blamed for this, for it is an arrangement of ownership. Wherever we make permanent relationships, strife is bound to be, for the mind is most impermanent and relationships very permanent.\nToday I may tell a person, “No one is more beautiful than you,” but it is not necessary that I should say the same thing tomorrow. Perhaps I do not feel that way tomorrow? This does not mean that what I said was false. It was absolutely true and that belonged to the moment when I felt it as such. But this moment cannot put my whole future in bondage. Tomorrow I may feel that was a mistake: that could also be the truth for that moment. Then what shall I do that moment?\nWill I betray the truth of the initial moment or will I conjure up a fraud? If I put up an act, there will be conflict. I will fall in my own esteem for the hypocrisy I create! Wherever we fix relationships, the unstable mind causes trouble. Wherever there is demand, there is bound to be conflict. If a person finds himself on the highest rung, he will strive his hardest to remain there and so always be in the midst of a struggle. One who is low, will always try to reach high and so there will be struggle All our thinking is conflict-oriented.\nWe can only be rid of conflict if we accept the nature of things. Now what is meant by the nature of things?\nThe nature of things is such that if I love someone and derive happiness therefrom, I shall also derive unhappiness from the same person. This is inevitable. If you derive happiness from a person, you must also suffer unhappiness from him. We derive happiness from that person alone from whom we can also derive unhappiness. The door to unhappiness opens along with the door to happiness. Happiness an unhappiness both come from the same door. When I accept happiness and deny unhappiness, I am not accepting the nature of things. Then I say, happiness is alright but I do not accept unhappiness. Now I shall be angry also with the person I love. Conversely, one who loves me can also be angry with me. But we think, one can never be angry with the person one loves.\nWhere there is love, anger is also born. It is bound to be and if it is not, the quality of that love will be different. The very element of that love changes. Then it is not love but Compassion. But compassion does not satisfy you for compassion is serene love, non-insisting. You are gratified only by passionate and aggressive love. Then you feel, someone is out to win you. Now this is an interesting thing that you feel very happy when someone is out of to win you but when that someone wins you, you feel intense pain. When someone is out to win you, you get pleasure out of the thought that you are worth striving for but when you are won over. you feel the intense pain of the fact that now you are subservient to somebody. Both these are conjoined.\nIf we keep the nature of things in mind, there can be no struggle or conflict. What is conflict?\nConflict means I am trying every minute to be against my nature. I am busy trying to be what I cannot be. With others also our effort is the same – we want them to be what they cannot be.\nI can love a woman only if the woman appeals to me. The woman might think I love her for herself. She does not know that it is the woman in her I love. I can love another woman the same way I love her. Therefore you find that as soon as you fall in love with a woman, she at once begins to keep an eye over you for she knows the weakness of man’s mind. The mind does not acknowledge a person, it only acknowledges energies. It knows no particular A man or B woman. It only knows in terms of man and woman.\nNow this woman you have won, will always try to see that you do not fall for another woman. But the day this love for a woman departs from your mind, even this one you love will have to depart. And\nthen the conflict is terrible. Now her effort will be that you should love woman but only the woman within her, which is impossible. Only pain and anguish results from this.\nEverywhere this happens.\nVoltaire has written in his memoirs that he used to wish that when he went along the road, someone should wish him, recognise him. But nobody did for no one knew him. This used to pain him. So he worked hard and at last reached the place he aspired to. But now it became impossible for him to walk along the road! Then Voltaire writes, “Now these people do not allow me to sleep also! I cannot go out alone for a walk. Someone or the other turns up and starts talking.”\nThen he continues to write that on pondering over this, he realised that it was he alone who was responsible for this. These poor people never wished him first and this pained him. Now that crowds gather round him wherever he goes, that also is troublesome.\nOh, the mind of man! We ask for troubles and when they come, we are distressed by them. First man aspires for status, when he gets it he hankers to be alone. Now to aspire for status and fame means aspiring for crowds. Then as soon as the crowds gather, he is suffocated! Hitler used to see that great crowds gathered around him, but when they did he used to try and evade them.\nThis is a most interesting thing: those who have not gathered crowds are distressed and those who have, they too are distressed, Lao Tzu says, “It is because we do not accept nature that we experience this difficulty.” And this also we do not see, that many more things come together with one thing. They cannot be dropped out. I take great precautions to see that no one insult me. But where there is reverence, irreverence is bound to be. But this we do not see. If we can see this part of nature, then Lao Tzu says, “If you do not wish for insult, do not wish for respect either.” If you aspire for honour be ready for dishonour also. Then there is no difficulty, then there is no conflict within.\nAnother fact: If there is conflict within one person, there is bound to be conflict in the whole community. If each person is engaged in a fight within himself for all the 24 hours, then what we know as life cannot be life. What do we do all the 24 hours? We are fighting wars – in the market we fight financial wars, at home we fight domestic wars, there is politics even between friends. If we take into account a single day’s life of a person for a period of his waking hours, we will find he has been doing nothing but fight all day long. Only he changes his fronts many times according to where he is; he fights on one front and goes to another. When he has finished with this, he forms a third front and so on. He may feel a little respite in the interval between two fronts – all else is war! When after a full day he sleeps in the night, then also the wars continue. His dreams are invaded by his day-long strifes. What is the cause of this conflict-ridden state of mind?\nCould it be that we are poisoning the very roots of the human race? For this alone can bring about such state of affairs. And this is the reason – that we are poisoning our very roots. This planned scheme is so old that it has become a part of our collective mind. It seems now it is impossible to live in any other way. This is a snare of our own making.\nIf you were to get a chance to be tranquil for a full day, you will become so restless – more than you normally are when in conflict. People say they want peace because they do not know what\npeace is. If they are given peace, within 24 hours they will say “Forgive us, we do not want peace.” Restlessness appears a thousand times better than this peace! The reason is that in moments of peace your ego drops.\nEgo can remain only in conflict, in struggle, in winning and losing. Even losing is preferred for at least the ego in there. It is better even to lose rather than be nobody, the ego at least remains. In complete tranquility the ego cannot be, for you yourself cannot be. In perfect tranquility, only tranquility – remains. You are no more. This is very disturbing. You will come quickly out of this and then you will ask for peace no longer! Hell would seem better than this, for at least you were doing something – something was happening! Whether anything was happening or not, is irrelevant – things seemed to happen. You were busy, occupied; and the mind felt very important – you were doing something great!\nThe greater the conflict, the more you feel you are doing something big. Therefore people discard smaller conflicts and search for bigger ones. They let go small troubles and look for bigger ones. If there is not enough material for conflict in our own house, we start probing into our neighbour’s affairs, or even that of our society, our country, our nation. We look for bigger troubles of the human race.\nAn American youth of the Peace Corps came to me. He is one of the 400 who have come to India to establish peace. He took sannyas. I asked him, “Is it not to save yourself from your own restlessness that you are trying for peace for others?” He was taken aback. “What do you say? You are absolutely right but how did you know? There is so much conflict in my family! I can’t get on with my father, I cannot get on with my mother or my brothers. Things had reached such a peak that there would have been bloodshed. Either I would have killed my father or he would have killed me! Therefore it was necessary to run away from home. I heard there was need for peace in India so I joined the Peace Corps and came here. Ever since then I have plunged whole-heartedly in to my work.”\nAll the organisations that are out to serve society, also all reformers and leaders, are those who are not satisfied with lesser conflicts. They look for bigger spans and amplitudes. And they look for problems that defy solutions. You cannot dwell longer on problems that are easily solved, you have to then move on the fresh problems. So we look for permanent problems that can never be solved. We are people who have no knowledge of tranquility and whose whole make-up is of restlessness. We create restlessness with each movement of ours – sitting, standing, walking, talking. Even our silence is filled with restlessness.\nNasruddin is talking to his wife. She has already been talking for half an hour. Nasruddin said, “You have been talking continuously for half an hour. I could not get in a single syllable!” His wife said, “You are silent but your silence is so aggressive, I cannot stand it!”\nA man can look aggressive even when he is sitting quietly. Your keeping quiet may be a lot worse than if you had given an abuse. Our very being is one of conflict. Therefore our merely sitting quiet also becomes aggressive. You may say, “I’m sitting silent, not saying a word” but your not speaking also does the trick. You normally do not speak when you have to say something more dangerous than words can express. Then you become silent for you do not have words that weigh so much as to express your feelings. Why is it like this?\nAccording to Lao Tzu, this is because we have not given our acquiescence to nature. We have played games with nature, the game of quality – grades. We say, “So and so is low, so and so is high in standing.” This is according to our utility needs. We give higher standards to things which seem more useful to us but when utility changes, this ranking of high and low also changes.\nThere was a time when the family priest held the pride of place. Why? Because he had his uses. When the clouds thundered and lightning flashed, no one but the priest knew why it was so – Indra was angry! Now how was he to be appeased? Only he had an answer to this. He knew the mantras to cool Indra’s anger. So even the king sat at his feet. This is why the PUROHITS (family priests) tried very hard to protect their knowledge from others. Their knowledge was their monopoly. Even the kings came to ask of them. They also touched the feet of the purohit. So the family priest was at the very top once upon a time.\nToday, however, it is not so and in twenty years time, the scientist will take the place that belonged to the purohit 2,000 years ago. Today, the scientist is invaluable for on him depends the destiny of Man. If one scientist is smuggled out of Germany or Russia that would change the history of the world!\nToday if America is so prosperous and well-established it is because 90\nBut how can they stop them? They have no such big institutions, nor such arrangement for work nor such high salaries to pay. Nor do they enjoy such freedom and have such conveniences to work. Even if he is not allowed to leave his country, the scientist will not give his best and will always try to migrate to America.\nThose who know, are watching with open eyes and they know that the future lies in the hands of that country where the scientists are gathering. Today the scientist wields power.\nAnd it may seem that the power is in the hands of the politician but it is not so. Everything is under the scientists’ command. The politicians may keep complaining that it is no use going to the moon, people may die of hunger, but the scientist insists of going to the moon and the politicians have to make arrangements for him.\nIf today the five topmost scientists of America refuse to work, America will be at the feet of Russia. Five men yield such power! The utility has changed and brought the scientist in the place of the family priest.\nIn between, it was the warrior who was at the top. The sword was above everything.\nWhere utility changes, everything, all other arrangements, have to change with it. Today intellect is of great value for it helps you to rise up but if in the near future, we are able to produce machines that can do all the work that man does, than there will be no further use of intellect. Then it is possible that the flute-player or the fisherman or the card-player may come to the top. And you, who are running big stores and markets – no one will even look at you! These people who know the art to relax, will be the people in demand. He who can be blissful in rest will become valuable.\nThose who work, will lose their value, for machines will prove better workers. Now a great scientist has to do complicated mathematics, but where he takes six months to solve a problem, the computer\ntakes six seconds. So a computer will be as good as a scientist and he will no longer be important. Then the whole situation will change. A very different class of people will now be at the top – The entertainer’s.\nIn today’s world you see that the film star enjoys a position he never did before, though dramas and plays always existed. He was not only unrecognised but looked down upon. It was not supposed to be respectful work but suddenly we find he has risen high in esteem and day by day he will rise higher! As people find themselves idle, without any work, they will need more and more of entertainment. They will need something to keep their minds engaged – some dance, some song, some drama, which will fill up their empty hours. So the actor will rise higher and higher. He has already relegated the politician to a lower position in public appeal. But why is this so?\nThis again is a problem of utility. There was a time when the actor was scarce. One or two funsters, existed in each village. They were not heeded much, but who could have said then that this lonely funster will one day become Charlie Chaplin and even Gandhiji would be eager to meet him? These men were supposed to be the worthless types. Each village had them and made use of them on occasions like marriage or for some important occasion in the village to add a lighter side to the function. Nobody respected them. Then how is it that they have risen in esteem? As the value for work decreases, the value of relaxation rises. It is the utility that decides who should be at the top and who should not be.\nBy nature, no one is high or low. Lao Tzu says, “By nature, you are as you are.” If we once accept this fact then there is no strife, no struggle, either within or without.\nIf no importance is given to things that are hard to attain, people will be rid of thieving and pilfering. We always condemn the thief, the bandit, the cheat, the trickster but do we ever think what it is they are after? The things they desire are getting more and more expensive each day so the lure for them increases – and we condemn them! It is a strange play, a foul deception!\nOn the one hand we give a place of prestige to the Kohinoor diamond and on the other, condemn the efforts that go on to attain it. Now this Kohinoor is one and people are in millions! And they all hanker after Kohinoor. Everybody cannot have it, so it is impossible to attain it lawfully. Now everyday we see that those who break the law, they alone attain the thing which is otherwise unattainable. The Kohinoor is open to view; people stand in queues. The law-breaker scoffs at them for according to him they are fools who do not know that he who wants to break the queue and get the diamond, exhorts others to respect the queue.\nI have heard that a magistrate once reprimanded a thief saying “Are you not ashamed to deceive such a good man?” The thief replied, “Your honour, it is impossible to cheat a cheat.” To them, honesty is their mainstay. So the trickster always wishes that there is a publicity of honesty or else their business will suffer. If honesty prevails then alone dishonesty can work or else it cannot.\nMachiavelli or Chanakya are the absolute opposite of Lao Tzu. They are the opposite pole of Lao Tzu. Machiavelli says “Preach honesty, then only dishonesty will prosper. Tell people to be simple to be plain and undeceitful, then only will you succeed.”\nIn his book “THE PRINCE”, Machiavelli has advised the kings that a king should be such who encourages morality in his subjects but does not practise it himself. Otherwise he says, what is the\ngain? He advises them never to be moral, for if they are, some one else will take advantage of the situation. They should be promoters of ethics and keep all outside appearances. But be alert and never practise morality for it is immorality that always prospers in life.\nThis man is just the opposite of Lao Tzu. He is a great intellectual and presents one face of man as it really is – this much we must allow him. Machiavelli has a deep insight within man and what he says about man is true to a great extent – 99\nOn the one-hand we are increasing our infatuations and allurements of rare objects. Now on the other hand, can we visualize an Adivasi (backward tribe) settlement, where the Kohinoor would lie on the streets and the children would play games with it? Nobody would care to pick it up for there is no intrinsic value as such of the Kohinoor. The value it enjoys is endowed on it. It is of no use; it cannot be eaten or drunk or put to any use. It is a thoroughly useless object. Its only quality is, it is one of its kind. There is only one Kohinoor.\nIf we give a value to a rare thing, the world goes mad after it. It can happen that a man might gamble away his lie just to attain the Kohinoor! Now this diamond in itself is completely useless but the dignity and glory conferred on its being a rare thing gives rise to robbery, deceit and competition in the world. Now for instance, gold – what is the intrinsic value of gold? It fulfils no requirement of life. If you place a piece of bread and a piece of gold before an animal, the animal will pick up the bread and go his way; he is wise. But if the same alternative is placed before a man, he invariably will pick up the piece of gold and run.\nAnd the most interesting fact is, no one – no creature – is prepared to choose the gold except Man! The reason is simple. It has no intrinsic value; the value it enjoys has been given to it and we have accepted its value. If today we do not accept it as valuable it will become valueless!\nValues are established in a thousand ways in the world; sometimes such values, you would not dream of! Now an African woman fills her arms with bangles of bones. She sees your hands and says, “What nakedness – nothing in the hands?” Now for instance you see a Western woman and wonder at their bare hands and bare ears and nose. These are all values that have been given – and there are strange values attached to things!\nIf a society feels long hair is the criterion of beauty, then long hair become beautiful; if it considers short hair or even shaven heads as a sign of beauty then that becomes the order of the day. There are places yet on the surface of the earth, where shaven heads are a sign of beauty. You may be shocked but it is so. They believe that unless the hair is not removed, the actual beauty of the face cannot be gauged. According to them hair deceives. It hides a beautiful face and covers an ugly one. This is their criterion, that only without hair can you gauge the intrinsic beauty of a woman. The beauty that appears by the hair-styles is not genuine, it is deceitful. These are given valuations.\nIt is difficult for us to understand how a shaven head could lend beauty to a face because the valuation that we have decided for ourselves is different. There is a tribe in Africa where big hanging lips are considered beautiful and every effort is made to increase the size of the lips. The more the lip hangs, the more beautiful it is considered to be. Women born with hanging lips are considered beautiful from birth! If anyone is born in such a way in our country, he would be considered downright ugly.\nWhat is ugliness, what is beauty? These are all our given valuations. Which things do we value? We give value to a stone and it becomes precious. We give value to a mettle and it becomes precious. Verily we give value to things that are rare. If a thing is not rare, then no matter how valuable it is, the very fact that it is easily available reduces its value. Rarity creates the value.\nLao Tzu says, “If rare commodities are not given importance the element of theft can be eradicated.” Then no one will be a thief or a dishonest person. Remember, no dishonesty is required to live life but if you aspire to rise above others, dishonesty becomes necessary. Honesty is enough, just to live and if everyone makes an effort just to live, there is no need of dishonesty. But if you want to rise above mere living, if you aspire not bread alone but also Kohinoor, then honesty is not enough. Honesty cannot get you the Kohinoor; you will have to be dishonest. It is also an interesting fact, that the rarer the thing, the more dishonest you will have to be. Now for instance, we are all here. If everyone sits in his own place, there is no quarrel but if all of you try to occupy my chair there will be chaos. Also the rowdiest one will succeed in capturing the chair.\nNow if we decide that to sit on this chair is the goal of life, then there will be nothing but struggle, rowdyism and dishonesty in this room. The one who manages to capture the seat will also not be able to sit in peace for there will be others pulling at his legs always, trying to bring him down. So he will only appear as sitting. Actually, he will also be always in a constant state of strain and stress for he fears he might be brought down any moment by others who will keep trying to get at the chair in the same way.\nLao Tzu’s insight is very profound. He says “Give no significance to things that are not easily available.” That is, give no importance to things that are rare and there shall be no theft, no dishonesty in the world. By punishing the thief, theft cannot be eradicated, by preaching and sermonizing the robber. you cannot end robbery and by frightening the trickster with the terrors of hell dishonesty will not end. Give no importance to rare things and all these will end. Just think this over.\nWhenever you have been dishonest or whenever you have committed a theft or wanted to commit a theft you have never done so purely for the sake of living; rather for something more than living. You may have tried to delude yourself that it was necessary for life but it is always for something more than life. You may have done it to obtain a good shirt; dishonesty is not necessary to cover the body. He who is interested in only covering his body will never be dishonest. Such a man, if need be, will even be ready to go about naked also someday but will never be ready to be dishonest. But if merely covering the body is not enough and with what it covered is of more importance, then honesty alone will not do. The meaning of Lao Tzu’s sutra is that Life, Existence alone, does not accept dishonesty as necessary. It is only our tendency to give significance to things that are rare that spreads the whole web of dishonesty.\nTherefore remember, the more backward a community, the less dishonest it is and the reason for it is only this, that whatever that community values is easily available. Now there are these Adivasis. They value food, a loin-cloth, kerosene and these are all easily available. In some houses there is one lantern burning and in some there are two but this does not make them restless for the amount of work done is the same, whether the lanterns are two or one. Their desires are not more than this. There is no such thing they desire for which they may have to sell their souls.\nRemember we have to sell our souls to attain the rare thing. For it is not available by toil. No one can\never dream that if he works honestly each day for eight hours, some day he will find the Kohinoor in his wife’s necklace! This is something that even Mahavira or Buddha cannot think of. The most noble of men can never claim that by living simply and artlessly, he can attain the Kohinoor to adorn his wife’s neck. The Kohinoor adorns the neck of the person who is ready to cut a million necks. When there is only one diamond and millions aspiring for it, the matter cannot be so simple.\nBut we always give value to the rare objects. Our method of evaluation is such. The lesser a thing is available the more valuable it is supposed to be. The availability of a thing does not add or subtract from the quality of the thing. The criterion should actually be the other way round.\nI have heard that Abraham Lincoln had a dream one night. He saw himself passing though a big crowd and people were looking at him and whispering into each other’s ears. He could hear them say, “Such an ordinary looking person, where was the need to make him the President of America?” Lincoln is upset. He did not know what to do. The whisperings went on and he could hear the same thing being repeated again and again. “Could they not find a better-looking person to hold such a high post?” Lincoln became so uneasy that he woke up. He could not sleep the rest of the night.\nIn the morning he wrote in his diary about this dream and also his answer to it. He says, “I believe there is a reason to select me the President. The faces that god creates in a very small number, I feel He does not like them. Therefore I feel he prefers ordinary faces, for he creates them in such large numbers! An ordinary face is God’s choice. The extraordinary faces happen to be created by mistake sometimes or else they would have been in large numbers.”\nLincoln has written jokingly but that which is created in large quantities should be the basis of life. But we do otherwise. The type of features that generally people have are of no value to us. They should be such as not all have – then it becomes valuable. Thus we give rise to strife and struggle and begin a race for the uncommon which makes people mad. And this rat-race then has no end! This is not in one thing but in everything in life.\nIf their minds are not attracted towards those things that are desirable, their hearts will become non distressed. If we do not draw the minds of people toward things that awaken desire, their minds will not be distressed and despondent. The storms of restlessness will not rise within them and their hearts will be tranquil and silent. But what we do is to goad them on towards the peak of the Everest. Nothing on the ground seems worth attaining. So we say, “Go to the peaks of Everest as Tensing and Hillary did. Reach there and plant your flag then you will have done something or else you have lived in vain!”\nWhat fruitful purpose has planting a flag on the Everest served in life, is what puzzles me! Tomorrow, when many people begin to alight on the Gourishankar by plane, what will be the value of your having planted the flag there? Neither Gourishankar is important, nor the planting of flag there. The value is of rarity. Now when a lone man, an Armstrong, steps on the moon, he makes news all over the world. In one moment, a man who performs an unattainable task, reaches the top, where a man who toils honestly for recognition, would reach after 50 years. Then too, it is not certain.\nDo not think that the day you land on the moon, you will make history. You will not, for you will reach when it is easy and convenient for people to go there. In Japan, a company is selling tickets to the moon! It promises to take the passengers to the moon on the 1st of January 1975. The advance\nbooking ;s on and people are buying tickets. But if they feel they too will become famous, they are mistaken The significance is always of the rarity of the situation. Armstrong was the first human being to step on the moon that is the only value, nothing else.\nWherever we turn, we find we value things only when its availability is less or almost impossible. Thus we give rise to strife and conflict for everyone sets out to attain it and in the process they become despondent and filled with distress. And those who do achieve realise after achieving that they have not achieved anything at all! If you go and stand on the moon, what will you get? The soil is not such different from the earth. What will you attain, what inner achievement will you attain? None whatsoever. Now those who have not reached will die of despondency. They will feel that till they reach the moon, everything else is useless. They will think they were born in vain, for they could not reach the moon.\nThe seeds that are sown within us from childhood are like this mania for reaching the moon. Now the difficulty is, if you reach there you find you have achieved nothing and if you do not, you die of disappointment, you suffer the agony of non-fulfillment. Those who have reached had to pass through a lot of stress and strain and difficulties. Those who have not reached, also live through a lot of conflict and ultimately die. Nothing is attained by reaching but in the effort of reaching a great deal is lost. You lose the opportunity oS life from where the rays of bliss could have emanated.\nAll this stress of Lao Tzu is negative, not only so that you may not be despondent, that is not the meaning. What he means is, that if you are not despondent, then the state of non-despondency, will open the gates of positive bliss. The individual who has entered the rat-race of achieving the rare commodity, misses this opportunity that is open to all.\nPerhaps we do not seek God because the saints say, God is everywhere. Then He is no longer desirable for they say, he is in every grain, in every particle, all around! Then it seems useless to look for Him. Had He been somewhere far away. where only one in a million can reach, then perhaps all humanity would have set out for Him and even made Him their goal!\nSo it is the saints who with their very hands make God undesirable. He is everywhere, they say, wherever you see, it is He. Whether you attain Him ar whether you don’t, He is always around you. Whether you know or whether you don’t, He is always around you as the ocean surrounds the fish. Then the mind argues, “Where is the sense in attaining a thing that is so near always?” Such an useless thing is not worth striving for – a thing which is always with you, whether you sleep or wake or even if you run away it is with you. So if it is always with you, there is no point in seeking it.\nWe will set out to seek that which is not everywhere. We will seek that which is rare and found only sometimes somewhere by a very few. And those who attain, become figures of history. Then where is the sense in wasting your life in the pursuit of God?\nNow even if you attain God a person like Buddha will say, “What is so great about it? He is already attained!” Mahavir will say, “So what if you attained? It is your very nature!” So Lao Tzu says also there is no need to give it in the papers. Thousands have attained and thousands will attain him. There is no need to be proud, there is no need to be made with joy. There is no need to plant a flag! God has forever been attained and he stands ready by the side of those who have not attained also. As soon as they become aware, they too will attain!” This way no desire is created.\nIf God does not become our search, it is only because he does not become our desire. The desire does not arise within us as it would if we had to snatch Him from others and attain Him. This is another disadvantage. The satisfaction of attaining something only comes when it is snatched from someone. Otherwise, it does not seems worth it. God is such a thing, that no matter how much of Him you attain, no one is the poorer for it. It is not as if your attainment will put me into difficulty. It is not that if you have attained it prevents me from attaining. No; no matter how much you attain, He is still as much open to me for attainment. Your attainment makes no difference to my attainment. The Saints say: “He is infinite!” No matter how much He is attained, He yet remains much more to be attained. Now, when there is no sense of competition, the guest for God seems useless to us. There is no gratification of snatching from others. Ah, the relish, the joy, of depriving someone! When we snatch a thing, remember it is not the joy of owning the thing but the gratification of having deprived another of it, which is so satisfying. It is the joy of causing pains to others.\nIf supposing, Kohinoor is scattered like pebbles on the road, found in each and every house, the Queen will at once pull it off her neck and throw it away as useless. The very thought that even a beggar owns it, is enough to make it meaningless. It was the thought that no one had it, that was the joy of owning it. We arouse our longings and desires for even the most insignificant of things.\nOne more thing needs to be understood in this context. Just as the judiciary are against the first sutra of Lao Tzu, so the economists oppose the second sutra of Lao Tzu. Actually, the economists say that the very law of economics is that there is conflict for the rare, for that which is not available in big quantities.\nIn fact only that thing has economic value, which is less. Therefore there is no price on air or on water in the villages. Sometimes ago, even land had no value. After some time even air will have a price because now oxygen is getting less day by day. The population has increased so much that within the next 50 years only those who can afford it, will carry their oxygen about in boxes. The poor will have to go a begging for air.\nIt will not be strange then if people knock at your door and ask for a loan of oxygen. He may ask to take a few puffs from your box!\nOxygen is so much less in the atmosphere of New York, that scientists wonder how people live there. The proportion of poisonous gases is becoming so alarming that it will be impossible to remain alive for long. Thus you see, that air will become valuable. There never used to be price on water. Fifty years ago milk used to be free. As soon as a thing begins to get deficient in quantity, ib value increases. All science of economics is based on deficit. The correct meaning of value is – the price of a thing depends on the lack of its availability. The price shows how non-available a thing is. A thing is in short supply and its price rises. The greater availability of a thing the lesser is its value.\nIt is therefore, that America had to throw away millions of bales of cloth into the sea. So much of cloth was produced that the price of cloth would have fallen very low. So that the prices may remain stable, they had to do this or it would have affected the home-market adversely. And millions of people go naked in the world! But the science of economics requires that this should be done or else the economy will fall.\nIf Lao Tzu had his way, there would be no economics in the world and no science of economics. For Lao Tzu says, “Why do you attach value to the deficient? Set your eyes on that which is in plenty.”\nGive value and place to that which is easily available to all. Do not heed that which is in short supply. If one person sports a diamond, do not heed him. Let word go round that there is a mad man in town who wears a stone round his neck. Ingrain this into the minds of children and let them notice the futility and stupidity of this man. Then this world can be made desireless. We can then take man’s mind away from restlessness and into a world of peace and tranquility.\nLao Tzu used to say, “I have heard that in the times of my father and grandfather, they could hear the bark of dogs across the river. There was some village there. When the skies were clear, they could see the smoke of the fires burning in the houses of those people. But nobody from his village went across to find out who stayed there. People were so filled with peace that they did not take unnecessary disturbances upon themselves. How did it concern them, who stayed there? They heard their dogs and saw the smoke rising from their fires. That was more than enough to show that there were people across the river. But no one was so inquisitive as to try to know more.”\nAnd here we are! We will not rest till we find out everything about all the stars and planets!\nDeep within, this matter depends entirely on our state of distress or non-distress. He who is filled with distress will always be on the run. He will run at the slightest excuse. He who is non-distressed, will keep sitting. He will be tranquil and still under circumstances. There is no simmering or agitation within him. He will not invite unnecessary and useless storms or cyclones within himself. So he will not indulge in useless inquiry.\nEducation should have entirely different foundations, according to Lao Tzu – non-ambitions foundations, desireless. If someone can tackle mathematics, good; if he cannot, then also it is good. Try to find out what he is good in and do not hammer the fact that he is not good at mathematics. Do not destroy him, for he is sure to be good in something else.\nMulla Nasruddin was employed in a shop. But the Mulla could not help snoozing off every now and then. His master tried him on all counters; but wherever he sat, he fell asleep. The master ultimately asked him, “Mulla, now you tell me where I should place you.” The Mulla said, “Master, put me in charge of your pyjama-counter and place a board beside me, ‘Our pyjamas are so cosy and comfortable that even the sales-man falls asleep!’ What else can I suggest?”\nThe problem is not of sleep but of lack of incentive to remain awake. You are not awake without a reason and it is also not without a reason that you cannot sleep in the night. So what Nasruddin is trying to say is that he has no curiosity to know who is passing on the road or who enters the shop or leaves it.\nNasruddin used to say, “A man put his hand in my pocket but I did not extend my hand towards my pocket, even to know what he was doing. I debated with myself that if there was something in my pocket, someone must have already removed it by now. It cannot remain so long with me!\nOnce a thief entered the Mulla’s house. His wife woke him up. The Mulla said, “Let him find his own mistake. Why should I help him?”\nOnce again a thief entered Mulla’s house. Nasruddin hid himself in the almirah. The thief searched the whole house but found nothing – not even the master of the house! The door was locked\nfrom within. When he could not find anything he became curious about the master of the house. Ultimately he found him standing with his back towards him in the almirah. The thief was surprised. “What are you doing here?” He asked him. The Mulla said, “I was so ashamed you will find my house bare that I hid myself.”\nSo Nasruddin says that he cannot remain awake because there is no cause no incentive, to keep him awake. Then where was the need to remain awake? Now if you cannot sleep at night it is because the reasons that keep you awake in the day time do not subside at night – and so how can you sleep? All images of the day keep returning again and again – the people you met, the conversations you had. The excitement of the day continues in the night and therefore you cannot sleep.\nHence we see why Lao Tzu talks of a non-distressed mind. He is a different man altogether – non- distressed. He hankers after nothing and is happy with what he has. Rather, he feels it is more than enough. He is grateful for what he has received: he is thankful for it. And what he has not received, is not the hankering of his mind. He does not ask, he does not desire nor expect to possess what he has not been given by nature. What he does not have, he does not have. It is not part of his mind at all!\nBut our minds are made differently. We are blind towards what we have and very much awake and aware of what we do not have. We forget what we have. If you stay with me for seven days and I give you plenty of attention and then if one day I look at you sharply, you will forget all that you had received the last seven days. My angry eyes will remain lifelong in your memory. If a person gives you love for years on end but forgets to give it one day, all the previous years become useless, meaningless. The love-less day becomes very precious to us. We seem to grasp only that which is not. All our attention is rooted into the lack of things.\nI have two hands, too feet. My attention is never drawn towards them, I take them for granted. Now suddenly, if I were to lose one finger, my whole life becomes useless. Now my life becomes a torture I keep arguing with God for his gross injustice in depriving me of a finger. When he had given it to me, there was never the feeling of gratitude within but now when He has taken it away, I feel the injustice! And not that I had done something worthwhile with this finger – I had not painted a picture or played the veena or given a helping hand to somebody. I was in fact, totally unconscious of its existence; I had taken it so much for granted. It was only the day that I lost it that I became conscious of it.\nNow the fact remains that I never did anything worthwhile with this finger, then why am I so upset, now that I have lost it? Nothing has come to an end, none of my activities have stopped but this is the way of our mind – the loss is always greater and what we have, we hardly are aware of.\nLao Tzu says, “If we create minds that are desireless, if we do not draw the attention of people towards desirous things, their hearts will be calm, unruffled.”\nBut we attract attention.\nIn the olden days when a person was rich, the society requested him not to make a show of his riches. That he was rich, was enough. His display would only become the cause of torment and\ndistress to the hearts of others. Therefore, the proof of riches was always this, that the rich man did not display his wealth. Only the poor made a show of having and those who did possess went about as if they did not.\nI have heard a Sufi story:\nThere was a beggar who descended from a series of emperors. It was a known fact that his forefathers were great kings and they had great treasures but since a few generations they had turned paupers. Nobody knew where or when they lost their treasures and their Kingdom and how they were reduced to this state. For generation this remained a secret.\nThen in one generation, a fakir came to their house. He called the young beggar and said, “You are the one who can be told about the treasures. We are the guardians.” “What guardians?” The youth asked. “We know nothing.” The fakir said, “Your forefathers left their treasures in the care of our Guru’s Guru and he said, when such a person is born in our house who is not eager to flout wealth, you may return the treasures to him. You are the man and I have come to give you back the treasure.” The youth said, “At least give me some time to think!” The fakir said, “You are the right man we were looking for!”\nIf someone brought news of such treasure to you, would you sit quietly? No. You would at once jump to your feet and inquire eagerly, “Where is it? Hurry!” Here was a house-hold, living on alms and yet this man says, “Give me time to think.” For this man feels it is a great responsibility. To live in poverty is not as difficult as having wealth and not making a show of it. So the youth begs for time to think over. “You have taken care of my forefathers’ treasures so long. Look after them a little longer please!” He begged of him. The fakir urged him to follow him that very moment for now he said the signs were complete. “For,” he said, “We have got the title-deed in which it is clearly written,”Whenever a person of our family asks for time to think over, hand over the treasure to him.” He said he came in every generation but whomever he asked, he got ready to take possession at once.\nThe treasure was given to the youth. The news spread like wild-fire in the town but the begging continued. The king sent for the young man and said, “Are you mad or is it only a rumour, that you have received your forefathers’ wealth? If you have, then why do you still beg?” The youth replied, “At first begging was a necessity, now it has become a duty. For the treasure has been given to me entirely on condition that I make no show of it. Now if I do not beg and just sit in my house, what could be a greater exhibition of wealth than that?”\nWhen wealth becomes an exhibition, desires are born. But we earn wealth so that we can show it off. If we cannot display, where is the sense in earning it? Then where is the sense in making palaces in which we are never going to stay? And that is the use of keeping that which we cannot exhibit? This is how we think. But Lao Tzu says, “If you do not draw people’s attention, they can live in supreme peace.”\nThis exhibitionist is a diseased person, for it is healthy to enjoy what you have but very unhealthy to display it. Try and understand this a little. It is healthy to enjoy what one has in a spirit of gratefulness but to go about exhibiting it is an illness a disease. Actually, only he is eager to show off, who cannot enjoy it. He who enjoys it, has no need to display it. What you cannot enjoy, you display. What you can, you never make a show of. There is this Exhibitionism at all levels in our society.\nNowadays, scientists call only a particular type of people exhibitionists. People who exhibit their sex- organs any time, anywhere are called exhibitionists. There is a big class of people in this category and it works on principles as well as without principles. When it works on some regulations we raise no objections but when it works without any rules, we object.\nThe scientists were confounded what was the motive that drove a man to exhibit his nakedness in the middle of the road! What does he get out of it? After a lot of research it was discovered that only that person indulges in this kind of exhibitionism, who has had no pleasure of sex. He who has never enjoyed sex, now takes pleasure in exhibiting it. This is of course meaningless. Nothing is gained by this showing of the body by the exhibitor as well as the spectator. Nothing is achieved but something within the exhibitor must be getting satisfied.\nYou will be shocked to know what all devices the exhibitionists contrive at! In Athens men’s clothes were so designed that their genitals were clearly visible. Not satisfied with this, they improvised leather genitals which they wore under their clothes to give the necessary effect! We are shocked to know this today. Today, women all over the world are keen on displaying their breasts but since it is well within the frame-work of our society, we do not object nor do we notice it as unnatural. Just the same was the condition in Athens 2,000 years ago.\nNow these leather genitals are displayed in the museum of Athens and people are shocked to think how eccentric the Athenians must have been; for where was the need? Two thousand years hence, all the devices of showing off the breasts that exist today will be displayed in museums and the women of the future times will wonder why all this display!\nWhat was the need?\nThere is no need but there is something somewhere and that is, whatever we begin to become incapable of enjoying, we begin to exhibit. Whatever we enjoy, we do not display. The man who eats well and also digests his food well, never goes about talking what is cooked in his house! He does not go about throwing parties to show people the umpteen fares he enjoys!\nNasruddin was once invited by the emperor. It was the king’s rule that he invited a few special people on his birthday. Nasruddin also, was called – for the first time. There were about 500 guests. Plates were laid out and also the dishes but the dinner was not started yet. Dish upon dish of delectable fare was being laid out. The hall is filled with delicious aromas. It was said that every time the king served entirely new dishes.\nNow Nasruddin began to get restless. His hunger was getting out of control. At last he shouted, “What is this happening brothers? Is the food laid out for eating or merely display?” The man next to him whispered to him, “Ssh! You are showing lack of manners. This clearly shows you come from a hungry house-hold. Let all the food be laid out. Till then talk of other things. Do not look there at all! When you eat also, see that you do not lick your plate clean. Leave something back. You seem to be a poor man who has not enough to eat.” Said Nasruddin, “Is it better to show that I have food or that I have hunger?” Only he displays food who has no hunger within him.\nWhen there is no hunger within, it becomes necessary to display food. As long as one has hunger, one eats food and does not display it. So whatever things we exhibit, are those things that we\ncannot, or are unable to enjoy. This is the sign of a diseased mind. And Lao Tzu says, “If people’s attention is not drawn towards the rare and the unattainable (and hence useless for they have no intrinsic value) then people will not be distressed but they will remain cool and calm.”\nAnd when people are calm and cool a new dimension opens in life. Distress leads to the mundane world whereas calmness, tranquility leads towards God. Distress is a journey of sorrow, Of samsara, whereas tranquility is a journey towards freedom, liberation, Truth.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"13875","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_1/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_1/>The Way of Tao, Volume 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 The poison of ambition and the order of life</h1><div class=post-meta>66 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;13875 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Way_of_Tao_Volume_1/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE PEOPLE FROM RIVALRY AMONG THEMSELVES; NOT TO PRIZE ARTICLES WHICH
ARE DIFFICULT TO PROCURE IS THE WAY TO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING THIEVES;
NOT TO SHOW THEM WHAT IS LIKELY TO EXCITE THEIR DESIRES IS THE WAY TO
KEEP THEIR MINDS FROM DISORDER.</p><p>What is the worry of man? What is his trouble? What is his
distress?</p><p><br></p><p>If there is one man who is worried or a few men, one could understand
that they may be at fault. But the opposite is the case. Once in a while
we come across a calm and composed person or a person really filled with
well-being. The rest of us are restless, unhealthy and suffering.
Illness seems to be the order of the day and well-being and good health
seem to be exceptions. Ignorance seems to be the soul of life and
knowledge, an accidental happening – a coincidence. It seems that to be
a human being is to be ill, worried, distressed.</p><p>We never know how sometimes, someone becomes carefree, relaxed!
Either it is a mistake of Nature or a boon from the Gods! The rule seems
to be: As we are, we are diseased, ailing harassed.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra of Lao Tzu is unique. He says the cause of restlessness in
so many people, is the make- up of the human mind, the fundaments of his
culture, the mode of thinking of his civilisation, the very structure of
his society. Each man is so placed that he is bound to be ill.</p><p>The latest research in the West shows that each man is born a genius
but we have created such a state of affairs around us that the genius is
maimed and almost destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Swami Ram writes in his memoirs that while in Japan, he saw pine
trees the size of just one span. He was surprised! The trees were not
saplings. They were 100-150 years old but their growth was stunted. When
he inquired of the gardener, he was shown the bottom of the pots. They
were broken and the roots were regularly cut by the gardener. The roots
could not grow, so the trees also could not shoot up. It is very
necessary for roots to go deep down into the earth, if the tree has to
grow taller. Now it the gardener does not want the tree to grow taller.
He will keep on clipping the roots with the result that the tree will
grow old but remain small.</p><p><br></p><p>Our method for human beings is also somewhat similar. Therefore all
the people we see, have grown only a span in height whereas they could
have touched the skies.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been feeding poison to the roots of mankind.</p><p><br></p><p>This poisoning has gone on for ages with the result we have forgotten
it is poison. Then each generation puts in its own share of poison. Your
elders pour poison into your roots and you pour poison into your
children’s roots. Naturally every father does to his son what his father
did to him and so the vicious circle goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu has said a few things in connection with this poison.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand this we have first and foremost to understand that what
has been fed to the human mind in largest quantity, is the poison of
ambition. The whole structure of our society is based on ambition. We
make it a point to make the littlest child ambitious. He is goaded on
and on to stand first in whatever he does – whether at school or at
play, while learning behaviour or wearing clothes; whatever he does, or
whatever we make him do, we see that he is well caught in the spirit of
competition.</p><p><br></p><p>Ambition means: We make his ego stand in competition with the ego of
others. We tell him that others should not overtake him. His legging
behind will leave no place for his ego. So wherever he is, he should
always try to be at the top. This being the first, is our poison.
Whether in clothes or in business or in education or whether in worship
and prayer or in renunciation or in penance we are taught constantly to
remember that ‘I am being judged vis-a-vis others’. I have forever to
see where I stand with regard to others. What is my place in the line?
Am I lagging behind? If so, I shall be pained.</p><p><br></p><p>And if there is a long line behind me, I shall be delighted. Those
who are happy are only so when they know they are giving pain to others
behind them. Or else there is no delight.</p><p><br></p><p>But the world is so big, that no one person can be absolutely in the
fore-front; and life so complicated that there does not arise the
question of being in the forefront. This complexity of life is
multi-faceted. If a man succeeds in amassing a lot of wealth, he finds
someone else has beaten him in health then be he a beggar begging on the
streets. whose clothes are in tatters. One person may be rich in health
but he finds himself most lacking in looks. If a man is a successful
businessman, he finds many others who are intellectually much above him.
And more often than not a very intellectual</p><p>person finds it hard to obtain two square meals a day, while others
with much lesser intelligence build palaces for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is many-faced – multi-dimensional. Then if in every direction a
man tries to be at the top, he is bound to go mad. It is a miracle if he
does not! The whole structure is insane. Therefore, wherever we stand
there is pain and anguish for we find some standing before us and some
behind!</p><p><br></p><p>To be ambitious is never to think in terms of ‘who I am’ but to think
in terms of myself as related to others. Never to see myself straight in
the face but always in comparison with others. Never to see whether,
where I stand gives pleasure or not but to see that others do not gain
more happiness than me. Also not to worry if I am in pain, if others are
undergoing greater pain. Then I can be content.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that once, there were floods in a village. An old farmer
was looking sad and worried for all his fields and cattle were carried
away by the flood waters. His young neighbour asked him “Grandpa, you
look very worried? Have you lost all your goats in the floods?” “Have
you lost yours too?” The old man asked, “Yes” replied the young man,
“And did all your cattle die too?” He asked again “Yes,” said the young
man. “And are all your fields washed away?” “Yes,” said the young man
again. “In that case,” says the old man, “I have no reason to be so
worried.” The question was not whether he had lost all but whether
others lost equally or more!</p><p><br></p><p>Whether in joy or in sorrow, we have always to be aware where we are
in the line. Our thinking is arranged in lines. We never think of
ourselves as free individuals, we always see and worry about our place
in the line – where we stand in the queue. And this is a circular queue.
We overtake one, then another, then another, always hoping to be first
but we find always that there are always some in front of us!</p><p><br></p><p>The queue is round. There is no straight line. And usually the one
who runs a great deal suddenly discovers that he lags far behind others!
He finds that those he left way back, stand in front of him! Therefore
invariably, those who reach the peak of success, fall into calamity.
They are always frustrated and what is this frustration? They find that
inspite of all their toil and labour they have not reached the peak and
those they left far behind, suddenly appear right in front of them!</p><p><br></p><p>Understand Lao Tzu’s sutra in this context.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says that if there are no quality-grades of talent and
aptitude, there would be no struggle and no envy or rivalry. “Why should
we make talent a grade to judge people?” asks Lao Tzu. Why should we not
take it as the nature of the person? Understand the difference for many
things depend upon it: Why should we not consider the capability of a
person as his characteristic and why should we make it a
quality-measure?</p><p><br></p><p>A man is proficient in mathematics. This proficiency is his nature.
One man is proficient in music; this is his nature. Now one man is weak
in mathematics – that is his disposition. There is nothing great about a
mathematical genius for he has attained this quality from nature. And it
is no disqualification for a man to be weak in mathematics for that
again is what he has attained from nature in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen Fakir Rinzai was telling a man as he stood outside his hut.
“Do you see those trees reaching the skies and do you see these shrubs
yonder?” “It is years,” he says, “Since I live near these trees</p><p>and never have I once heard the shrubs wondering why the trees are so
tall! Nor have I ever seen the tall trees looking down haughtily at the
tiny shrubs!” “What is the secret?” His companion asked him. “The secret
is only this,” said Rinzai “that the trees are trees because nature made
them so and the shrubs are shrubs for the same reason.” No status is
achieved by being big and there is no loss of face in being small. The
same nature that makes the trees tall, makes the grass weeds small. It
is also not always necessary that those that are big are big in all
respects. When the storm comes, the big trees are uprooted whereas the
lowly weed is left unharmed.</p><p><br></p><p>Napoleon was a short man. He was not tall. But it invariably happens
that men of short stature aspire to great heights. One day he was trying
to remove a book from a shelf in his library. His hand could not reach
so his attendant who was 7 feet tall said, “Sir, if it is does not seem
improper may I step ahead and bring the book out for you? I am the
highest man in your army. There is no one higher than me,” Napoleon was
red with fury. “You are not higher, you are only taller. There may be no
one taller than you but I alone am the highest.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was but natural that Napoleon was hurt. The fault was not only of
the language – it was avery big mistake. Napoleon corrected him
immediately – tallest not highest. What is the difference? To be tall is
a natural phenomena. With height there is valuation, quality, grade.
There is no valuation with tallness for that is a gift of nature but
with the question of height, of stature, valuation comes in</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “If there is no quality-grade with talent, there would
be no strifes and no struggles.” Would that we would begin to see that
things have their own specific nature and act accordingly; and they are
not responsible for their natural characteristics! We never hold a blind
man responsible for his blindness? Even if he is blind from birth we
sympathise with him.</p><p><br></p><p>About two years ago, a blind boy came to see me in Jabalpur, all the
way from Srinagar. There was a Shivir held there on Mahavira. He came to
know of it much later and so missed, so he came all the way to Jabalpur.
“You must have found it very difficult to travel the long distance from
Srinagar to Jabalpur?” I asked him. “Not at all!” He replied “Blindness
is a great asset to me. Everybody is ready to help. One person catches
hold of my hand, another buys a ticket for me. Why, the rickshaw-man
brought me all the way from station, free of charge and is waiting
outside to drop me back to the station. If I had eyes, I could not have
been better off.”</p><p><br></p><p>If some one is blind we are all sympathy for him. We feel it is not
his fault but if someone is dull, we do not sympathise with him. On the
contrary, we call him an idiot! We never ever wait and ponder how he is
at fault if he is dull? The poor man is criticised and looked down upon.
Everywhere he will be ill-treated and pushed back. No one will ever be
kind to him. Why? Because we have made the intellect our sutra for
ambition. Without intellect we cannot progress in ambition. Therefore
the measure of intellect, the I.Q. Has become very important.</p><p><br></p><p>But what is behind all this? One man is born an Einstein, what is
Einstein’s qualification in that? He has not brought about his genius.
One man is born an idiot – what is his fault in that?</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “Nature makes one person in one way and another in
another. It is because we do not accept nature and attribute
quality-status to one and quality-deficiency to the other that we give
birth to all struggle and rivalry.” This means we are unable to see what
is natural, what is the characteristic qualities of a person. We pile
our expectations on to nature and think accordingly.</p><p>Lao Tzu believes in ‘Nature-ism’. He believes in the natural
characteristics. Tao means the natural disposition. “I am such”, he
says, “not only this but also that the other is such.” “Then this would
mean, we must accept the thief, as a thief, a cheat as a cheat for
nature has made them so?” We might argue, “If nature has made them so,
what can be done? Should we accept fraud and let it work its way in
life?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the fight between Lao Tzu and the moralist. The moralist
would undoubtedly say that this sutra is dangerous. Suppose we go even
so far as to accept that one man is an idiot, one man is a genius and
nature has made them so; but if a man is a fraud, if he is a thief, a
murderer, what are we to do? Should we accept them as being created such
by nature? If you ask Lao Tzu, he will say, “When you did not accept
them for what they are, how many murderers did you reform? How many
cheats did you convert into honest men? You punished the male-factor by
whipping him, putting him in jail and even executing him. Were you able
to reform people this way?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The truth is,” says Lao Tzu, “When you punish a person, you make him
stronger in his short- comings.” You never rid him of his fault, you
only make him more competent. The person who visits the jail once,
becomes a jail-bird by and by, for there he gets just the company he
wants. He finds enough education on his craft. He comes across
master-criminals and others with greater experience than him. So his
knowledge of his art improves. Also, if once a man is branded a
criminal, you stamp a seal on him. Then be has no way also, of improving
his ways. Even if he means to be honest, no one will accept him. Lao Tzu
says, “You cannot make a saint out of a sinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>In England, about 150 years ago, thieves were punished by being
flogged in the market-square. Large crowds would gather to witness the
flogging. This was done with a view to discourage others from stealing.
Soon it was discovered that as the crowd was engaged in watching the
spectacle, many pockets were picked!</p><p><br></p><p>This was discussed in the British Parliament. When an example was
being set to dissuade people from stealing, at that very time pockets
were being picked! In spite of all the punishments, we have not been
able to change man in the least. He is getting worse and worse everyday.
According to Lao Tzu: as the laws increase, the law-breakers increase
also. Every new law becomes a sutra to create new criminals. Every
sentence creates a new crime. Lao Tzu says, “You may keep saying ‘What
will happen to man if he does not change!’ The fact remains you have not
changed a single man.” The number of courts and jails and the numerous
law-books have failed miserably. But it seems some people’s
self-interest is hidden behind this.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a thief was convicted for the third time. This is
the last, for he has been sentenced for life. After he read out the
sentence, the judge asked him, “You took birth in this world and what
has been your contribution towards it?” “Don’t you know?” The thief
replied, “Because of me how many judges and lawyers and detectives and
police earn their living? They would be out of job but for me. You too
would be begging on the streets had it not been for me!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is not merely a joke. This is a truth – a deep truth. If there
is no thief on the face of this earth, how would the magistrate be? All
this elaborate arrangement carrying so much status and dignity about it,
depends entirely on thieves, cheats and men of the underworld. If we
look deep with in these people, we shall find that all this class of
law-givers would not be happy to hear Lao Tzu. They</p><p>will argue, “Then it means accept a thief as a thief. Do nothing
about it. Then what will happen to the law-givers?” And the most
interesting thing that the psychologists have discovered is that only
those people become law-givers, who would be the first to break all laws
if these were removed. In fact, only the thief takes pleasure in
flogging a thief.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin was working in a shop but he did not behave well with the
customers. So he was turned out. The owner of the shop told him, “You
are being thrown out because your behaviour towards the customers is
bad. Remember, the law says, ‘the customer is always right’. So it will
not do here if you are always trying to prove yourself right and the
customer wrong.” Fifteen days after, the shop-owner found Nasruddin
standing on the cross-roads dressed as a police-man. He asked him,
“Nasruddin you have become a police-man?” “Yes” said Nasruddin. “This is
the only job I found where the customer is always wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu’s statements are difficult to understand and follow. Not only
the judiciary but also the sadhu find it ungratifying for the Sadhu
considers his piety to be a cultivated quality and not a part of his
nature. He says, “With great penance and sadhana and with arduous
practice, I have attained piety. You are not a sadhu for you have done
nothing.” But Lao Tzu’s piety and goodness are supreme. He says, “If I
am a good man, it is no attainment on my part, I deserve no credit for
it. If you are not a good man you deserve no contempt. My being good is
my nature, you not being good is your nature.” What can we do where
there is a question of nature? So no one is high and no one is low.</p><p><br></p><p>Our sadhu’s endeavour however is, on being at the top. If he is not
above us, all his efforts are in vain. If we stop reverence of our
sadhus and giving them pride of place,99 out of 100 sadhus. will
immediately disappear; for respect and reverence is their only mainstay.
Their piety is nourishment for their ambition, their ego and their
pride. It is very gratifying to be a sadhu and when the society is
particularly sinful, saintliness pays great dividends, for then your
ego, your ambition and your pride get the best nourishment.</p><p><br></p><p>A sadhu never approves of Lao Tzu. Therefore, the words of Lao Tzu
proved very revolutionary for China. Even now after 2,500 years, they
are revolutionary and 2,500 years hence also, they will be
revolutionary. There is no greater revolution than the Lao Tzu
philosophy. Lao Tzu says, “I am like the bitter leaf of the neem tree.
It is no fault of the neem tree that its leaves are bitter! The mango
bears sweet fruit, what is the greatness of the mango tree in that? Why
should the neem be rated low and the mango rated high? Even if one is
more useful to you than the other, it is no criterion to judge.”</p><p><br></p><p>We should understand the opposition of the judiciary, the politician
and the moralists. Their argument is, that society will fall still lower
but they do not realise that society has already fallen low and can go
no lower. The society is degenerated – not will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu however says, “It is you who have caused the society to be
degenerated. You revile a thief and destroy the possibility of his
changing.” You shut all doors of reform. In fact, whenever you praise or
condemn, you create boundaries. Then as we create these boundaries of
praise and condemnation, we force the evil-doer to remain an evil-doer
and constrain a good man to develop hypocrisy in order to maintain an
appearance of continued goodness. We leave no place for him to be evil
for no man is so good that there is no trace of evil in him and no man
so bad that there is no good in him.</p><p>We tend to break everything into two. We say, “This man is good,
there is no evil in him, and no man so bad that there is no good in
him.”</p><p><br></p><p>We tend to break everything into two. We say, “This man is good,
there is no evil in him.” Then when some part of evil begins to manifest
itself in his life, he will have to practise some deceit. He will try to
hide and suppress what is within him and begins to exhibit what is not
within him. This our endeavour to praise goodness, turns it into
hypocrisy. That is why 99</p><p><br></p><p>In the same manner, when we call a person bad, we close all doors of
improvement for him. Constant condemnation kills all his possible
expectation to improve. He feels himself in capable of taking any step
in that direction. He looks upon himself as a person fated for
damnation. Then slowly the thought gets strengthened within him. “Then
why should I not be an expert in my badness?” This then becomes his
life-adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “Do not call the bad, wicked, nor the good, good. Put
no labels. Just know this, that each man lives according to his nature.”
What is the meaning of this?</p><p><br></p><p>This means, there should be no category no hierarchy in Society.
There should be no high and no low. Does this mean there should be
communism? This needs to be understood a little. The type of society Lao
Tzu talks about, if it is accepted that way, then all people will be
uncommon and each person will be according to his nature. Therefore,
there will be no feeling of inequality.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “If a man is capable of earning, he will earn and if a
man is capable of losing, he will lose and if a man is capable of
begging only, he will beg.” But in no way will the beggar be lesser than
the rich man, for we give the latter no grade of status. We say, it is
the nature of this man that he cannot stay without constructing a
palace. Another man’s nature is, he cannot keep the money he has. He
cannot help squandering it. This is his nature. But we make no
differentiation. We accept the disposition of each person and respect
it. In truth, the chief mark of a sadhu is, that he accepts all – all
kinds of dispositions and characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p>If such a possibility happens that we accept all types of
dispositions, there will no longer be strifes and struggles.</p><p><br></p><p>I was talking to a friend yesterday. There is a conflict between him
and his wife. As is natural, he thought if he had married another woman
there would not have been this state of affairs. Now this man has no
experience of another woman. She exists only in imagination. The wife
also feels the same way. She feels she has made a wrong choice. Another
man would have made a better husband. In this case also, there is no
experience of the other man. He is purely imaginary. Now we cannot have
the experience of all the women in the world or all the men in the
world, therefore, the illusion persists.</p><p><br></p><p>I told my friend, “It is not a question of this woman or that woman.
It is a question of your different natures. There is conflict in your
dispositions. And it is the arrangement between a man and a woman that
society has prescribed that is to be blamed for this, for it is an
arrangement of ownership. Wherever we make permanent relationships,
strife is bound to be, for the mind is most impermanent and
relationships very permanent.</p><p>Today I may tell a person, “No one is more beautiful than you,” but
it is not necessary that I should say the same thing tomorrow. Perhaps I
do not feel that way tomorrow? This does not mean that what I said was
false. It was absolutely true and that belonged to the moment when I
felt it as such. But this moment cannot put my whole future in bondage.
Tomorrow I may feel that was a mistake: that could also be the truth for
that moment. Then what shall I do that moment?</p><p><br></p><p>Will I betray the truth of the initial moment or will I conjure up a
fraud? If I put up an act, there will be conflict. I will fall in my own
esteem for the hypocrisy I create! Wherever we fix relationships, the
unstable mind causes trouble. Wherever there is demand, there is bound
to be conflict. If a person finds himself on the highest rung, he will
strive his hardest to remain there and so always be in the midst of a
struggle. One who is low, will always try to reach high and so there
will be struggle All our thinking is conflict-oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>We can only be rid of conflict if we accept the nature of things. Now
what is meant by the nature of things?</p><p><br></p><p>The nature of things is such that if I love someone and derive
happiness therefrom, I shall also derive unhappiness from the same
person. This is inevitable. If you derive happiness from a person, you
must also suffer unhappiness from him. We derive happiness from that
person alone from whom we can also derive unhappiness. The door to
unhappiness opens along with the door to happiness. Happiness an
unhappiness both come from the same door. When I accept happiness and
deny unhappiness, I am not accepting the nature of things. Then I say,
happiness is alright but I do not accept unhappiness. Now I shall be
angry also with the person I love. Conversely, one who loves me can also
be angry with me. But we think, one can never be angry with the person
one loves.</p><p><br></p><p>Where there is love, anger is also born. It is bound to be and if it
is not, the quality of that love will be different. The very element of
that love changes. Then it is not love but Compassion. But compassion
does not satisfy you for compassion is serene love, non-insisting. You
are gratified only by passionate and aggressive love. Then you feel,
someone is out to win you. Now this is an interesting thing that you
feel very happy when someone is out of to win you but when that someone
wins you, you feel intense pain. When someone is out to win you, you get
pleasure out of the thought that you are worth striving for but when you
are won over. you feel the intense pain of the fact that now you are
subservient to somebody. Both these are conjoined.</p><p><br></p><p>If we keep the nature of things in mind, there can be no struggle or
conflict. What is conflict?</p><p><br></p><p>Conflict means I am trying every minute to be against my nature. I am
busy trying to be what I cannot be. With others also our effort is the
same – we want them to be what they cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>I can love a woman only if the woman appeals to me. The woman might
think I love her for herself. She does not know that it is the woman in
her I love. I can love another woman the same way I love her. Therefore
you find that as soon as you fall in love with a woman, she at once
begins to keep an eye over you for she knows the weakness of man’s mind.
The mind does not acknowledge a person, it only acknowledges energies.
It knows no particular A man or B woman. It only knows in terms of man
and woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this woman you have won, will always try to see that you do not
fall for another woman. But the day this love for a woman departs from
your mind, even this one you love will have to depart. And</p><p>then the conflict is terrible. Now her effort will be that you should
love woman but only the woman within her, which is impossible. Only pain
and anguish results from this.</p><p><br></p><p>Everywhere this happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Voltaire has written in his memoirs that he used to wish that when he
went along the road, someone should wish him, recognise him. But nobody
did for no one knew him. This used to pain him. So he worked hard and at
last reached the place he aspired to. But now it became impossible for
him to walk along the road! Then Voltaire writes, “Now these people do
not allow me to sleep also! I cannot go out alone for a walk. Someone or
the other turns up and starts talking.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he continues to write that on pondering over this, he realised
that it was he alone who was responsible for this. These poor people
never wished him first and this pained him. Now that crowds gather round
him wherever he goes, that also is troublesome.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, the mind of man! We ask for troubles and when they come, we are
distressed by them. First man aspires for status, when he gets it he
hankers to be alone. Now to aspire for status and fame means aspiring
for crowds. Then as soon as the crowds gather, he is suffocated! Hitler
used to see that great crowds gathered around him, but when they did he
used to try and evade them.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a most interesting thing: those who have not gathered crowds
are distressed and those who have, they too are distressed, Lao Tzu
says, “It is because we do not accept nature that we experience this
difficulty.” And this also we do not see, that many more things come
together with one thing. They cannot be dropped out. I take great
precautions to see that no one insult me. But where there is reverence,
irreverence is bound to be. But this we do not see. If we can see this
part of nature, then Lao Tzu says, “If you do not wish for insult, do
not wish for respect either.” If you aspire for honour be ready for
dishonour also. Then there is no difficulty, then there is no conflict
within.</p><p><br></p><p>Another fact: If there is conflict within one person, there is bound
to be conflict in the whole community. If each person is engaged in a
fight within himself for all the 24 hours, then what we know as life
cannot be life. What do we do all the 24 hours? We are fighting wars –
in the market we fight financial wars, at home we fight domestic wars,
there is politics even between friends. If we take into account a single
day’s life of a person for a period of his waking hours, we will find he
has been doing nothing but fight all day long. Only he changes his
fronts many times according to where he is; he fights on one front and
goes to another. When he has finished with this, he forms a third front
and so on. He may feel a little respite in the interval between two
fronts – all else is war! When after a full day he sleeps in the night,
then also the wars continue. His dreams are invaded by his day-long
strifes. What is the cause of this conflict-ridden state of mind?</p><p><br></p><p>Could it be that we are poisoning the very roots of the human race?
For this alone can bring about such state of affairs. And this is the
reason – that we are poisoning our very roots. This planned scheme is so
old that it has become a part of our collective mind. It seems now it is
impossible to live in any other way. This is a snare of our own
making.</p><p><br></p><p>If you were to get a chance to be tranquil for a full day, you will
become so restless – more than you normally are when in conflict. People
say they want peace because they do not know what</p><p>peace is. If they are given peace, within 24 hours they will say
“Forgive us, we do not want peace.” Restlessness appears a thousand
times better than this peace! The reason is that in moments of peace
your ego drops.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego can remain only in conflict, in struggle, in winning and losing.
Even losing is preferred for at least the ego in there. It is better
even to lose rather than be nobody, the ego at least remains. In
complete tranquility the ego cannot be, for you yourself cannot be. In
perfect tranquility, only tranquility – remains. You are no more. This
is very disturbing. You will come quickly out of this and then you will
ask for peace no longer! Hell would seem better than this, for at least
you were doing something – something was happening! Whether anything was
happening or not, is irrelevant – things seemed to happen. You were
busy, occupied; and the mind felt very important – you were doing
something great!</p><p><br></p><p>The greater the conflict, the more you feel you are doing something
big. Therefore people discard smaller conflicts and search for bigger
ones. They let go small troubles and look for bigger ones. If there is
not enough material for conflict in our own house, we start probing into
our neighbour’s affairs, or even that of our society, our country, our
nation. We look for bigger troubles of the human race.</p><p><br></p><p>An American youth of the Peace Corps came to me. He is one of the 400
who have come to India to establish peace. He took sannyas. I asked him,
“Is it not to save yourself from your own restlessness that you are
trying for peace for others?” He was taken aback. “What do you say? You
are absolutely right but how did you know? There is so much conflict in
my family! I can’t get on with my father, I cannot get on with my mother
or my brothers. Things had reached such a peak that there would have
been bloodshed. Either I would have killed my father or he would have
killed me! Therefore it was necessary to run away from home. I heard
there was need for peace in India so I joined the Peace Corps and came
here. Ever since then I have plunged whole-heartedly in to my work.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the organisations that are out to serve society, also all
reformers and leaders, are those who are not satisfied with lesser
conflicts. They look for bigger spans and amplitudes. And they look for
problems that defy solutions. You cannot dwell longer on problems that
are easily solved, you have to then move on the fresh problems. So we
look for permanent problems that can never be solved. We are people who
have no knowledge of tranquility and whose whole make-up is of
restlessness. We create restlessness with each movement of ours –
sitting, standing, walking, talking. Even our silence is filled with
restlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin is talking to his wife. She has already been talking for
half an hour. Nasruddin said, “You have been talking continuously for
half an hour. I could not get in a single syllable!” His wife said, “You
are silent but your silence is so aggressive, I cannot stand it!”</p><p><br></p><p>A man can look aggressive even when he is sitting quietly. Your
keeping quiet may be a lot worse than if you had given an abuse. Our
very being is one of conflict. Therefore our merely sitting quiet also
becomes aggressive. You may say, “I’m sitting silent, not saying a word”
but your not speaking also does the trick. You normally do not speak
when you have to say something more dangerous than words can express.
Then you become silent for you do not have words that weigh so much as
to express your feelings. Why is it like this?</p><p>According to Lao Tzu, this is because we have not given our
acquiescence to nature. We have played games with nature, the game of
quality – grades. We say, “So and so is low, so and so is high in
standing.” This is according to our utility needs. We give higher
standards to things which seem more useful to us but when utility
changes, this ranking of high and low also changes.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a time when the family priest held the pride of place. Why?
Because he had his uses. When the clouds thundered and lightning
flashed, no one but the priest knew why it was so – Indra was angry! Now
how was he to be appeased? Only he had an answer to this. He knew the
mantras to cool Indra’s anger. So even the king sat at his feet. This is
why the PUROHITS (family priests) tried very hard to protect their
knowledge from others. Their knowledge was their monopoly. Even the
kings came to ask of them. They also touched the feet of the purohit. So
the family priest was at the very top once upon a time.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, however, it is not so and in twenty years time, the scientist
will take the place that belonged to the purohit 2,000 years ago. Today,
the scientist is invaluable for on him depends the destiny of Man. If
one scientist is smuggled out of Germany or Russia that would change the
history of the world!</p><p><br></p><p>Today if America is so prosperous and well-established it is because
90</p><p><br></p><p>But how can they stop them? They have no such big institutions, nor
such arrangement for work nor such high salaries to pay. Nor do they
enjoy such freedom and have such conveniences to work. Even if he is not
allowed to leave his country, the scientist will not give his best and
will always try to migrate to America.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who know, are watching with open eyes and they know that the
future lies in the hands of that country where the scientists are
gathering. Today the scientist wields power.</p><p><br></p><p>And it may seem that the power is in the hands of the politician but
it is not so. Everything is under the scientists’ command. The
politicians may keep complaining that it is no use going to the moon,
people may die of hunger, but the scientist insists of going to the moon
and the politicians have to make arrangements for him.</p><p><br></p><p>If today the five topmost scientists of America refuse to work,
America will be at the feet of Russia. Five men yield such power! The
utility has changed and brought the scientist in the place of the family
priest.</p><p><br></p><p>In between, it was the warrior who was at the top. The sword was
above everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Where utility changes, everything, all other arrangements, have to
change with it. Today intellect is of great value for it helps you to
rise up but if in the near future, we are able to produce machines that
can do all the work that man does, than there will be no further use of
intellect. Then it is possible that the flute-player or the fisherman or
the card-player may come to the top. And you, who are running big stores
and markets – no one will even look at you! These people who know the
art to relax, will be the people in demand. He who can be blissful in
rest will become valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who work, will lose their value, for machines will prove better
workers. Now a great scientist has to do complicated mathematics, but
where he takes six months to solve a problem, the computer</p><p>takes six seconds. So a computer will be as good as a scientist and
he will no longer be important. Then the whole situation will change. A
very different class of people will now be at the top – The
entertainer’s.</p><p><br></p><p>In today’s world you see that the film star enjoys a position he
never did before, though dramas and plays always existed. He was not
only unrecognised but looked down upon. It was not supposed to be
respectful work but suddenly we find he has risen high in esteem and day
by day he will rise higher! As people find themselves idle, without any
work, they will need more and more of entertainment. They will need
something to keep their minds engaged – some dance, some song, some
drama, which will fill up their empty hours. So the actor will rise
higher and higher. He has already relegated the politician to a lower
position in public appeal. But why is this so?</p><p><br></p><p>This again is a problem of utility. There was a time when the actor
was scarce. One or two funsters, existed in each village. They were not
heeded much, but who could have said then that this lonely funster will
one day become Charlie Chaplin and even Gandhiji would be eager to meet
him? These men were supposed to be the worthless types. Each village had
them and made use of them on occasions like marriage or for some
important occasion in the village to add a lighter side to the function.
Nobody respected them. Then how is it that they have risen in esteem? As
the value for work decreases, the value of relaxation rises. It is the
utility that decides who should be at the top and who should not be.</p><p><br></p><p>By nature, no one is high or low. Lao Tzu says, “By nature, you are
as you are.” If we once accept this fact then there is no strife, no
struggle, either within or without.</p><p><br></p><p>If no importance is given to things that are hard to attain, people
will be rid of thieving and pilfering. We always condemn the thief, the
bandit, the cheat, the trickster but do we ever think what it is they
are after? The things they desire are getting more and more expensive
each day so the lure for them increases – and we condemn them! It is a
strange play, a foul deception!</p><p><br></p><p>On the one hand we give a place of prestige to the Kohinoor diamond
and on the other, condemn the efforts that go on to attain it. Now this
Kohinoor is one and people are in millions! And they all hanker after
Kohinoor. Everybody cannot have it, so it is impossible to attain it
lawfully. Now everyday we see that those who break the law, they alone
attain the thing which is otherwise unattainable. The Kohinoor is open
to view; people stand in queues. The law-breaker scoffs at them for
according to him they are fools who do not know that he who wants to
break the queue and get the diamond, exhorts others to respect the
queue.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a magistrate once reprimanded a thief saying “Are
you not ashamed to deceive such a good man?” The thief replied, “Your
honour, it is impossible to cheat a cheat.” To them, honesty is their
mainstay. So the trickster always wishes that there is a publicity of
honesty or else their business will suffer. If honesty prevails then
alone dishonesty can work or else it cannot.</p><p><br></p><p>Machiavelli or Chanakya are the absolute opposite of Lao Tzu. They
are the opposite pole of Lao Tzu. Machiavelli says “Preach honesty, then
only dishonesty will prosper. Tell people to be simple to be plain and
undeceitful, then only will you succeed.”</p><p><br></p><p>In his book “THE PRINCE”, Machiavelli has advised the kings that a
king should be such who encourages morality in his subjects but does not
practise it himself. Otherwise he says, what is the</p><p>gain? He advises them never to be moral, for if they are, some one
else will take advantage of the situation. They should be promoters of
ethics and keep all outside appearances. But be alert and never practise
morality for it is immorality that always prospers in life.</p><p><br></p><p>This man is just the opposite of Lao Tzu. He is a great intellectual
and presents one face of man as it really is – this much we must allow
him. Machiavelli has a deep insight within man and what he says about
man is true to a great extent – 99</p><p><br></p><p>On the one-hand we are increasing our infatuations and allurements of
rare objects. Now on the other hand, can we visualize an Adivasi
(backward tribe) settlement, where the Kohinoor would lie on the streets
and the children would play games with it? Nobody would care to pick it
up for there is no intrinsic value as such of the Kohinoor. The value it
enjoys is endowed on it. It is of no use; it cannot be eaten or drunk or
put to any use. It is a thoroughly useless object. Its only quality is,
it is one of its kind. There is only one Kohinoor.</p><p><br></p><p>If we give a value to a rare thing, the world goes mad after it. It
can happen that a man might gamble away his lie just to attain the
Kohinoor! Now this diamond in itself is completely useless but the
dignity and glory conferred on its being a rare thing gives rise to
robbery, deceit and competition in the world. Now for instance, gold –
what is the intrinsic value of gold? It fulfils no requirement of life.
If you place a piece of bread and a piece of gold before an animal, the
animal will pick up the bread and go his way; he is wise. But if the
same alternative is placed before a man, he invariably will pick up the
piece of gold and run.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most interesting fact is, no one – no creature – is prepared
to choose the gold except Man! The reason is simple. It has no intrinsic
value; the value it enjoys has been given to it and we have accepted its
value. If today we do not accept it as valuable it will become
valueless!</p><p><br></p><p>Values are established in a thousand ways in the world; sometimes
such values, you would not dream of! Now an African woman fills her arms
with bangles of bones. She sees your hands and says, “What nakedness –
nothing in the hands?” Now for instance you see a Western woman and
wonder at their bare hands and bare ears and nose. These are all values
that have been given – and there are strange values attached to
things!</p><p><br></p><p>If a society feels long hair is the criterion of beauty, then long
hair become beautiful; if it considers short hair or even shaven heads
as a sign of beauty then that becomes the order of the day. There are
places yet on the surface of the earth, where shaven heads are a sign of
beauty. You may be shocked but it is so. They believe that unless the
hair is not removed, the actual beauty of the face cannot be gauged.
According to them hair deceives. It hides a beautiful face and covers an
ugly one. This is their criterion, that only without hair can you gauge
the intrinsic beauty of a woman. The beauty that appears by the
hair-styles is not genuine, it is deceitful. These are given
valuations.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult for us to understand how a shaven head could lend
beauty to a face because the valuation that we have decided for
ourselves is different. There is a tribe in Africa where big hanging
lips are considered beautiful and every effort is made to increase the
size of the lips. The more the lip hangs, the more beautiful it is
considered to be. Women born with hanging lips are considered beautiful
from birth! If anyone is born in such a way in our country, he would be
considered downright ugly.</p><p>What is ugliness, what is beauty? These are all our given valuations.
Which things do we value? We give value to a stone and it becomes
precious. We give value to a mettle and it becomes precious. Verily we
give value to things that are rare. If a thing is not rare, then no
matter how valuable it is, the very fact that it is easily available
reduces its value. Rarity creates the value.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “If rare commodities are not given importance the
element of theft can be eradicated.” Then no one will be a thief or a
dishonest person. Remember, no dishonesty is required to live life but
if you aspire to rise above others, dishonesty becomes necessary.
Honesty is enough, just to live and if everyone makes an effort just to
live, there is no need of dishonesty. But if you want to rise above mere
living, if you aspire not bread alone but also Kohinoor, then honesty is
not enough. Honesty cannot get you the Kohinoor; you will have to be
dishonest. It is also an interesting fact, that the rarer the thing, the
more dishonest you will have to be. Now for instance, we are all here.
If everyone sits in his own place, there is no quarrel but if all of you
try to occupy my chair there will be chaos. Also the rowdiest one will
succeed in capturing the chair.</p><p>Now if we decide that to sit on this chair is the goal of life, then
there will be nothing but struggle, rowdyism and dishonesty in this
room. The one who manages to capture the seat will also not be able to
sit in peace for there will be others pulling at his legs always, trying
to bring him down. So he will only appear as sitting. Actually, he will
also be always in a constant state of strain and stress for he fears he
might be brought down any moment by others who will keep trying to get
at the chair in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu’s insight is very profound. He says “Give no significance to
things that are not easily available.” That is, give no importance to
things that are rare and there shall be no theft, no dishonesty in the
world. By punishing the thief, theft cannot be eradicated, by preaching
and sermonizing the robber. you cannot end robbery and by frightening
the trickster with the terrors of hell dishonesty will not end. Give no
importance to rare things and all these will end. Just think this
over.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you have been dishonest or whenever you have committed a
theft or wanted to commit a theft you have never done so purely for the
sake of living; rather for something more than living. You may have
tried to delude yourself that it was necessary for life but it is always
for something more than life. You may have done it to obtain a good
shirt; dishonesty is not necessary to cover the body. He who is
interested in only covering his body will never be dishonest. Such a
man, if need be, will even be ready to go about naked also someday but
will never be ready to be dishonest. But if merely covering the body is
not enough and with what it covered is of more importance, then honesty
alone will not do. The meaning of Lao Tzu’s sutra is that Life,
Existence alone, does not accept dishonesty as necessary. It is only our
tendency to give significance to things that are rare that spreads the
whole web of dishonesty.</p><p>Therefore remember, the more backward a community, the less dishonest
it is and the reason for it is only this, that whatever that community
values is easily available. Now there are these Adivasis. They value
food, a loin-cloth, kerosene and these are all easily available. In some
houses there is one lantern burning and in some there are two but this
does not make them restless for the amount of work done is the same,
whether the lanterns are two or one. Their desires are not more than
this. There is no such thing they desire for which they may have to sell
their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember we have to sell our souls to attain the rare thing. For it
is not available by toil. No one can</p><p>ever dream that if he works honestly each day for eight hours, some
day he will find the Kohinoor in his wife’s necklace! This is something
that even Mahavira or Buddha cannot think of. The most noble of men can
never claim that by living simply and artlessly, he can attain the
Kohinoor to adorn his wife’s neck. The Kohinoor adorns the neck of the
person who is ready to cut a million necks. When there is only one
diamond and millions aspiring for it, the matter cannot be so
simple.</p><p><br></p><p>But we always give value to the rare objects. Our method of
evaluation is such. The lesser a thing is available the more valuable it
is supposed to be. The availability of a thing does not add or subtract
from the quality of the thing. The criterion should actually be the
other way round.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Abraham Lincoln had a dream one night. He saw
himself passing though a big crowd and people were looking at him and
whispering into each other’s ears. He could hear them say, “Such an
ordinary looking person, where was the need to make him the President of
America?” Lincoln is upset. He did not know what to do. The whisperings
went on and he could hear the same thing being repeated again and again.
“Could they not find a better-looking person to hold such a high post?”
Lincoln became so uneasy that he woke up. He could not sleep the rest of
the night.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning he wrote in his diary about this dream and also his
answer to it. He says, “I believe there is a reason to select me the
President. The faces that god creates in a very small number, I feel He
does not like them. Therefore I feel he prefers ordinary faces, for he
creates them in such large numbers! An ordinary face is God’s choice.
The extraordinary faces happen to be created by mistake sometimes or
else they would have been in large numbers.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lincoln has written jokingly but that which is created in large
quantities should be the basis of life. But we do otherwise. The type of
features that generally people have are of no value to us. They should
be such as not all have – then it becomes valuable. Thus we give rise to
strife and struggle and begin a race for the uncommon which makes people
mad. And this rat-race then has no end! This is not in one thing but in
everything in life.</p><p><br></p><p>If their minds are not attracted towards those things that are
desirable, their hearts will become non distressed. If we do not draw
the minds of people toward things that awaken desire, their minds will
not be distressed and despondent. The storms of restlessness will not
rise within them and their hearts will be tranquil and silent. But what
we do is to goad them on towards the peak of the Everest. Nothing on the
ground seems worth attaining. So we say, “Go to the peaks of Everest as
Tensing and Hillary did. Reach there and plant your flag then you will
have done something or else you have lived in vain!”</p><p><br></p><p>What fruitful purpose has planting a flag on the Everest served in
life, is what puzzles me! Tomorrow, when many people begin to alight on
the Gourishankar by plane, what will be the value of your having planted
the flag there? Neither Gourishankar is important, nor the planting of
flag there. The value is of rarity. Now when a lone man, an Armstrong,
steps on the moon, he makes news all over the world. In one moment, a
man who performs an unattainable task, reaches the top, where a man who
toils honestly for recognition, would reach after 50 years. Then too, it
is not certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not think that the day you land on the moon, you will make
history. You will not, for you will reach when it is easy and convenient
for people to go there. In Japan, a company is selling tickets to the
moon! It promises to take the passengers to the moon on the 1st of
January 1975. The advance</p><p>booking ;s on and people are buying tickets. But if they feel they
too will become famous, they are mistaken The significance is always of
the rarity of the situation. Armstrong was the first human being to step
on the moon that is the only value, nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever we turn, we find we value things only when its availability
is less or almost impossible. Thus we give rise to strife and conflict
for everyone sets out to attain it and in the process they become
despondent and filled with distress. And those who do achieve realise
after achieving that they have not achieved anything at all! If you go
and stand on the moon, what will you get? The soil is not such different
from the earth. What will you attain, what inner achievement will you
attain? None whatsoever. Now those who have not reached will die of
despondency. They will feel that till they reach the moon, everything
else is useless. They will think they were born in vain, for they could
not reach the moon.</p><p><br></p><p>The seeds that are sown within us from childhood are like this mania
for reaching the moon. Now the difficulty is, if you reach there you
find you have achieved nothing and if you do not, you die of
disappointment, you suffer the agony of non-fulfillment. Those who have
reached had to pass through a lot of stress and strain and difficulties.
Those who have not reached, also live through a lot of conflict and
ultimately die. Nothing is attained by reaching but in the effort of
reaching a great deal is lost. You lose the opportunity oS life from
where the rays of bliss could have emanated.</p><p><br></p><p>All this stress of Lao Tzu is negative, not only so that you may not
be despondent, that is not the meaning. What he means is, that if you
are not despondent, then the state of non-despondency, will open the
gates of positive bliss. The individual who has entered the rat-race of
achieving the rare commodity, misses this opportunity that is open to
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps we do not seek God because the saints say, God is everywhere.
Then He is no longer desirable for they say, he is in every grain, in
every particle, all around! Then it seems useless to look for Him. Had
He been somewhere far away. where only one in a million can reach, then
perhaps all humanity would have set out for Him and even made Him their
goal!</p><p><br></p><p>So it is the saints who with their very hands make God undesirable.
He is everywhere, they say, wherever you see, it is He. Whether you
attain Him ar whether you don’t, He is always around you. Whether you
know or whether you don’t, He is always around you as the ocean
surrounds the fish. Then the mind argues, “Where is the sense in
attaining a thing that is so near always?” Such an useless thing is not
worth striving for – a thing which is always with you, whether you sleep
or wake or even if you run away it is with you. So if it is always with
you, there is no point in seeking it.</p><p><br></p><p>We will set out to seek that which is not everywhere. We will seek
that which is rare and found only sometimes somewhere by a very few. And
those who attain, become figures of history. Then where is the sense in
wasting your life in the pursuit of God?</p><p><br></p><p>Now even if you attain God a person like Buddha will say, “What is so
great about it? He is already attained!” Mahavir will say, “So what if
you attained? It is your very nature!” So Lao Tzu says also there is no
need to give it in the papers. Thousands have attained and thousands
will attain him. There is no need to be proud, there is no need to be
made with joy. There is no need to plant a flag! God has forever been
attained and he stands ready by the side of those who have not attained
also. As soon as they become aware, they too will attain!” This way no
desire is created.</p><p>If God does not become our search, it is only because he does not
become our desire. The desire does not arise within us as it would if we
had to snatch Him from others and attain Him. This is another
disadvantage. The satisfaction of attaining something only comes when it
is snatched from someone. Otherwise, it does not seems worth it. God is
such a thing, that no matter how much of Him you attain, no one is the
poorer for it. It is not as if your attainment will put me into
difficulty. It is not that if you have attained it prevents me from
attaining. No; no matter how much you attain, He is still as much open
to me for attainment. Your attainment makes no difference to my
attainment. The Saints say: “He is infinite!” No matter how much He is
attained, He yet remains much more to be attained. Now, when there is no
sense of competition, the guest for God seems useless to us. There is no
gratification of snatching from others. Ah, the relish, the joy, of
depriving someone! When we snatch a thing, remember it is not the joy of
owning the thing but the gratification of having deprived another of it,
which is so satisfying. It is the joy of causing pains to others.</p><p><br></p><p>If supposing, Kohinoor is scattered like pebbles on the road, found
in each and every house, the Queen will at once pull it off her neck and
throw it away as useless. The very thought that even a beggar owns it,
is enough to make it meaningless. It was the thought that no one had it,
that was the joy of owning it. We arouse our longings and desires for
even the most insignificant of things.</p><p><br></p><p>One more thing needs to be understood in this context. Just as the
judiciary are against the first sutra of Lao Tzu, so the economists
oppose the second sutra of Lao Tzu. Actually, the economists say that
the very law of economics is that there is conflict for the rare, for
that which is not available in big quantities.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact only that thing has economic value, which is less. Therefore
there is no price on air or on water in the villages. Sometimes ago,
even land had no value. After some time even air will have a price
because now oxygen is getting less day by day. The population has
increased so much that within the next 50 years only those who can
afford it, will carry their oxygen about in boxes. The poor will have to
go a begging for air.</p><p><br></p><p>It will not be strange then if people knock at your door and ask for
a loan of oxygen. He may ask to take a few puffs from your box!</p><p><br></p><p>Oxygen is so much less in the atmosphere of New York, that scientists
wonder how people live there. The proportion of poisonous gases is
becoming so alarming that it will be impossible to remain alive for
long. Thus you see, that air will become valuable. There never used to
be price on water. Fifty years ago milk used to be free. As soon as a
thing begins to get deficient in quantity, ib value increases. All
science of economics is based on deficit. The correct meaning of value
is – the price of a thing depends on the lack of its availability. The
price shows how non-available a thing is. A thing is in short supply and
its price rises. The greater availability of a thing the lesser is its
value.</p><p><br></p><p>It is therefore, that America had to throw away millions of bales of
cloth into the sea. So much of cloth was produced that the price of
cloth would have fallen very low. So that the prices may remain stable,
they had to do this or it would have affected the home-market adversely.
And millions of people go naked in the world! But the science of
economics requires that this should be done or else the economy will
fall.</p><p><br></p><p>If Lao Tzu had his way, there would be no economics in the world and
no science of economics. For Lao Tzu says, “Why do you attach value to
the deficient? Set your eyes on that which is in plenty.”</p><p>Give value and place to that which is easily available to all. Do not
heed that which is in short supply. If one person sports a diamond, do
not heed him. Let word go round that there is a mad man in town who
wears a stone round his neck. Ingrain this into the minds of children
and let them notice the futility and stupidity of this man. Then this
world can be made desireless. We can then take man’s mind away from
restlessness and into a world of peace and tranquility.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu used to say, “I have heard that in the times of my father and
grandfather, they could hear the bark of dogs across the river. There
was some village there. When the skies were clear, they could see the
smoke of the fires burning in the houses of those people. But nobody
from his village went across to find out who stayed there. People were
so filled with peace that they did not take unnecessary disturbances
upon themselves. How did it concern them, who stayed there? They heard
their dogs and saw the smoke rising from their fires. That was more than
enough to show that there were people across the river. But no one was
so inquisitive as to try to know more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And here we are! We will not rest till we find out everything about
all the stars and planets!</p><p><br></p><p>Deep within, this matter depends entirely on our state of distress or
non-distress. He who is filled with distress will always be on the run.
He will run at the slightest excuse. He who is non-distressed, will keep
sitting. He will be tranquil and still under circumstances. There is no
simmering or agitation within him. He will not invite unnecessary and
useless storms or cyclones within himself. So he will not indulge in
useless inquiry.</p><p><br></p><p>Education should have entirely different foundations, according to
Lao Tzu – non-ambitions foundations, desireless. If someone can tackle
mathematics, good; if he cannot, then also it is good. Try to find out
what he is good in and do not hammer the fact that he is not good at
mathematics. Do not destroy him, for he is sure to be good in something
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was employed in a shop. But the Mulla could not help
snoozing off every now and then. His master tried him on all counters;
but wherever he sat, he fell asleep. The master ultimately asked him,
“Mulla, now you tell me where I should place you.” The Mulla said,
“Master, put me in charge of your pyjama-counter and place a board
beside me, ‘Our pyjamas are so cosy and comfortable that even the
sales-man falls asleep!’ What else can I suggest?”</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is not of sleep but of lack of incentive to remain awake.
You are not awake without a reason and it is also not without a reason
that you cannot sleep in the night. So what Nasruddin is trying to say
is that he has no curiosity to know who is passing on the road or who
enters the shop or leaves it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin used to say, “A man put his hand in my pocket but I did not
extend my hand towards my pocket, even to know what he was doing. I
debated with myself that if there was something in my pocket, someone
must have already removed it by now. It cannot remain so long with
me!</p><p><br></p><p>Once a thief entered the Mulla’s house. His wife woke him up. The
Mulla said, “Let him find his own mistake. Why should I help him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Once again a thief entered Mulla’s house. Nasruddin hid himself in
the almirah. The thief searched the whole house but found nothing – not
even the master of the house! The door was locked</p><p>from within. When he could not find anything he became curious about
the master of the house. Ultimately he found him standing with his back
towards him in the almirah. The thief was surprised. “What are you doing
here?” He asked him. The Mulla said, “I was so ashamed you will find my
house bare that I hid myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Nasruddin says that he cannot remain awake because there is no
cause no incentive, to keep him awake. Then where was the need to remain
awake? Now if you cannot sleep at night it is because the reasons that
keep you awake in the day time do not subside at night – and so how can
you sleep? All images of the day keep returning again and again – the
people you met, the conversations you had. The excitement of the day
continues in the night and therefore you cannot sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence we see why Lao Tzu talks of a non-distressed mind. He is a
different man altogether – non- distressed. He hankers after nothing and
is happy with what he has. Rather, he feels it is more than enough. He
is grateful for what he has received: he is thankful for it. And what he
has not received, is not the hankering of his mind. He does not ask, he
does not desire nor expect to possess what he has not been given by
nature. What he does not have, he does not have. It is not part of his
mind at all!</p><p><br></p><p>But our minds are made differently. We are blind towards what we have
and very much awake and aware of what we do not have. We forget what we
have. If you stay with me for seven days and I give you plenty of
attention and then if one day I look at you sharply, you will forget all
that you had received the last seven days. My angry eyes will remain
lifelong in your memory. If a person gives you love for years on end but
forgets to give it one day, all the previous years become useless,
meaningless. The love-less day becomes very precious to us. We seem to
grasp only that which is not. All our attention is rooted into the lack
of things.</p><p><br></p><p>I have two hands, too feet. My attention is never drawn towards them,
I take them for granted. Now suddenly, if I were to lose one finger, my
whole life becomes useless. Now my life becomes a torture I keep arguing
with God for his gross injustice in depriving me of a finger. When he
had given it to me, there was never the feeling of gratitude within but
now when He has taken it away, I feel the injustice! And not that I had
done something worthwhile with this finger – I had not painted a picture
or played the veena or given a helping hand to somebody. I was in fact,
totally unconscious of its existence; I had taken it so much for
granted. It was only the day that I lost it that I became conscious of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the fact remains that I never did anything worthwhile with this
finger, then why am I so upset, now that I have lost it? Nothing has
come to an end, none of my activities have stopped but this is the way
of our mind – the loss is always greater and what we have, we hardly are
aware of.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “If we create minds that are desireless, if we do not
draw the attention of people towards desirous things, their hearts will
be calm, unruffled.”</p><p><br></p><p>But we attract attention.</p><p><br></p><p>In the olden days when a person was rich, the society requested him
not to make a show of his riches. That he was rich, was enough. His
display would only become the cause of torment and</p><p>distress to the hearts of others. Therefore, the proof of riches was
always this, that the rich man did not display his wealth. Only the poor
made a show of having and those who did possess went about as if they
did not.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a Sufi story:</p><p><br></p><p>There was a beggar who descended from a series of emperors. It was a
known fact that his forefathers were great kings and they had great
treasures but since a few generations they had turned paupers. Nobody
knew where or when they lost their treasures and their Kingdom and how
they were reduced to this state. For generation this remained a
secret.</p><p><br></p><p>Then in one generation, a fakir came to their house. He called the
young beggar and said, “You are the one who can be told about the
treasures. We are the guardians.” “What guardians?” The youth asked. “We
know nothing.” The fakir said, “Your forefathers left their treasures in
the care of our Guru’s Guru and he said, when such a person is born in
our house who is not eager to flout wealth, you may return the treasures
to him. You are the man and I have come to give you back the treasure.”
The youth said, “At least give me some time to think!” The fakir said,
“You are the right man we were looking for!”</p><p><br></p><p>If someone brought news of such treasure to you, would you sit
quietly? No. You would at once jump to your feet and inquire eagerly,
“Where is it? Hurry!” Here was a house-hold, living on alms and yet this
man says, “Give me time to think.” For this man feels it is a great
responsibility. To live in poverty is not as difficult as having wealth
and not making a show of it. So the youth begs for time to think over.
“You have taken care of my forefathers’ treasures so long. Look after
them a little longer please!” He begged of him. The fakir urged him to
follow him that very moment for now he said the signs were complete.
“For,” he said, “We have got the title-deed in which it is clearly
written,”Whenever a person of our family asks for time to think over,
hand over the treasure to him.” He said he came in every generation but
whomever he asked, he got ready to take possession at once.</p><p><br></p><p>The treasure was given to the youth. The news spread like wild-fire
in the town but the begging continued. The king sent for the young man
and said, “Are you mad or is it only a rumour, that you have received
your forefathers’ wealth? If you have, then why do you still beg?” The
youth replied, “At first begging was a necessity, now it has become a
duty. For the treasure has been given to me entirely on condition that I
make no show of it. Now if I do not beg and just sit in my house, what
could be a greater exhibition of wealth than that?”</p><p><br></p><p>When wealth becomes an exhibition, desires are born. But we earn
wealth so that we can show it off. If we cannot display, where is the
sense in earning it? Then where is the sense in making palaces in which
we are never going to stay? And that is the use of keeping that which we
cannot exhibit? This is how we think. But Lao Tzu says, “If you do not
draw people’s attention, they can live in supreme peace.”</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibitionist is a diseased person, for it is healthy to enjoy
what you have but very unhealthy to display it. Try and understand this
a little. It is healthy to enjoy what one has in a spirit of
gratefulness but to go about exhibiting it is an illness a disease.
Actually, only he is eager to show off, who cannot enjoy it. He who
enjoys it, has no need to display it. What you cannot enjoy, you
display. What you can, you never make a show of. There is this
Exhibitionism at all levels in our society.</p><p>Nowadays, scientists call only a particular type of people
exhibitionists. People who exhibit their sex- organs any time, anywhere
are called exhibitionists. There is a big class of people in this
category and it works on principles as well as without principles. When
it works on some regulations we raise no objections but when it works
without any rules, we object.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientists were confounded what was the motive that drove a man
to exhibit his nakedness in the middle of the road! What does he get out
of it? After a lot of research it was discovered that only that person
indulges in this kind of exhibitionism, who has had no pleasure of sex.
He who has never enjoyed sex, now takes pleasure in exhibiting it. This
is of course meaningless. Nothing is gained by this showing of the body
by the exhibitor as well as the spectator. Nothing is achieved but
something within the exhibitor must be getting satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be shocked to know what all devices the exhibitionists
contrive at! In Athens men’s clothes were so designed that their
genitals were clearly visible. Not satisfied with this, they improvised
leather genitals which they wore under their clothes to give the
necessary effect! We are shocked to know this today. Today, women all
over the world are keen on displaying their breasts but since it is well
within the frame-work of our society, we do not object nor do we notice
it as unnatural. Just the same was the condition in Athens 2,000 years
ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these leather genitals are displayed in the museum of Athens and
people are shocked to think how eccentric the Athenians must have been;
for where was the need? Two thousand years hence, all the devices of
showing off the breasts that exist today will be displayed in museums
and the women of the future times will wonder why all this display!</p><p><br></p><p>What was the need?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need but there is something somewhere and that is,
whatever we begin to become incapable of enjoying, we begin to exhibit.
Whatever we enjoy, we do not display. The man who eats well and also
digests his food well, never goes about talking what is cooked in his
house! He does not go about throwing parties to show people the umpteen
fares he enjoys!</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin was once invited by the emperor. It was the king’s rule
that he invited a few special people on his birthday. Nasruddin also,
was called – for the first time. There were about 500 guests. Plates
were laid out and also the dishes but the dinner was not started yet.
Dish upon dish of delectable fare was being laid out. The hall is filled
with delicious aromas. It was said that every time the king served
entirely new dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Nasruddin began to get restless. His hunger was getting out of
control. At last he shouted, “What is this happening brothers? Is the
food laid out for eating or merely display?” The man next to him
whispered to him, “Ssh! You are showing lack of manners. This clearly
shows you come from a hungry house-hold. Let all the food be laid out.
Till then talk of other things. Do not look there at all! When you eat
also, see that you do not lick your plate clean. Leave something back.
You seem to be a poor man who has not enough to eat.” Said Nasruddin,
“Is it better to show that I have food or that I have hunger?” Only he
displays food who has no hunger within him.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is no hunger within, it becomes necessary to display food.
As long as one has hunger, one eats food and does not display it. So
whatever things we exhibit, are those things that we</p><p>cannot, or are unable to enjoy. This is the sign of a diseased mind.
And Lao Tzu says, “If people’s attention is not drawn towards the rare
and the unattainable (and hence useless for they have no intrinsic
value) then people will not be distressed but they will remain cool and
calm.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when people are calm and cool a new dimension opens in life.
Distress leads to the mundane world whereas calmness, tranquility leads
towards God. Distress is a journey of sorrow, Of samsara, whereas
tranquility is a journey towards freedom, liberation, Truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

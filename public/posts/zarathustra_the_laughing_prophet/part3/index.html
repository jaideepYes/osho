AND WHAT I DESIRE THEY MAY NOT DESIRE!\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOne of the most important distinctions one has to make is between knowledge and knowing. Knowledge is cheap and easy: knowing is costly, risky, needs courage. Knowledge is available in the market. There are special markets for knowledge – the universities, the colleges. Knowing is not available anywhere except within yourself.\nKnowing is your capacity. Knowledge is your memory, and memory is the function of the mind that can be easily done by any computer. Knowledge is always borrowed. It is not a flower that grows in your soul, it is something plastic that has been imposed upon you. Knowledge has no roots; it does not grow. It is a dead compilation of corpses. Knowing is a continuous growth, it is a living process. In other words: knowing belongs to your consciousness and its evolution, knowledge belongs to your mind and its memory system.\nThe words look similar; hence they have created much confusion in the world. And knowledge is cheap – you can get it from books, you can get it from the rabbis, you can get it from the pundits, you can get it from the bishops – there are thousands of ways of accumulating knowledge. But it is a\ndead pile; it has no life of its own. And the most significant thing to remember is: all your knowledge, however great, makes no difference to your ignorance. Your ignorance remains intact. The only difference it makes is, it covers up your ignorance. You can pretend to the world that you are no longer ignorant, but deep inside you there is just darkness. Behind the borrowed words there is no experience.\nKnowing dispels your ignorance; knowing is just like light which dispels darkness. Hence, remember the difference between the scholar and the wise man. The wise man is not necessarily a scholar and vice versa – the scholar is also not necessarily a wise man.\nMost probably the scholar rarely becomes a wise man – for the simple reason that he has so much knowledge that he can deceive people, and if he can deceive many people he is deceived by their deception. He starts believing: if so many people think me a wise man, then I must be. So many people cannot be so foolish. Hence, in the life of the scholar there is no journey, no exploration, no discovery. He lives in the greatest illusion in the world – he knows nothing and he thinks he knows all.\nThe man of knowing starts by disowning knowledge, because knowledge is a hindrance; it is a false coin. And the false should be removed before the real can be realised. He disowns everything that is not his own. It is better to be ignorant than to be knowledgeable, because at least the ignorance is yours. It needs more courage than renouncing riches, renouncing kingdoms, renouncing your family, renouncing the society, because they are all outside. Knowledge accumulates inside your mind. Wherever you go... deep in the Himalayas it will be with you.\nRenouncing knowledge means a deep inner cleansing and that is what I mean by meditation. Meditation is nothing but renouncing borrowed knowledge and becoming fully aware of one’s ignorance. This brings a metamorphosis. The moment you are aware of your ignorance, ignorance goes through such a great change that unless it happens it remains unbelievable. The very ignorance becomes your innocence. The wise man also says, “I do not know.”\nAccording to Zarathustra, the highest stage of consciousness is that of a child. You are born a child but then you are ignorant. You will go through much knowledge, much memory and if you are fortunate enough, one day you will see that it is all false – because it is not yours.\nBuddha may have known, Jesus may have known, Krishna may have known; but their knowledge cannot become my knowing, their life cannot become my life, their love cannot become my love. How can their knowledge become my knowledge? I will have to seek and search on my own. I have to become an adventurer, a seeker of the unknown. I have to go on untrodden paths into uncharted seas. And I have to risk everything with a determined will that if others have achieved the truth, there is no reason why existence will be unkind to me.\nVery few fortunate people start dropping their borrowed knowledge. And as they start dropping their borrowed knowledge the circle starts moving back toward their childhood. The completion of the circle comes when ignorance becomes luminous. When ignorance meets with awareness the greatest explosion in the whole experience of man happens: you disappear as an ego. Now you are a pure, innocent existence – pure “isness,” with no claim for anything.\nIn this moment Socrates said, “I do not know anything.” In the same state Bodhidharma declared, “I know nothing. And moreover, my ‘I’ is just a linguistic convenience. Inside me there is no entity which can say ‘I’. I am just using it, because without it you will not be able to understand. The reality is that I have disappeared and there is only a pure sky, a pure ‘isness’ – utterly innocent, with no clouds of knowledge.”\nIt is a difficult task to disown knowledge, because knowledge gives you respectability, makes you a great man, brings you a Nobel prize. You are known to millions of people, although you know nothing about yourself. It is a very strange state: the whole world knows you except yourself. To disown knowledge means to fall in the eyes of people, to lose respectability, fame, celebrity. And the ego is very much against doing such a thing – because with the respectability, the fame and the knowledge disowned, the ego starts dying. It can live only on the borrowed. It itself is the most false thing in your life.\nZarathustra’s statements have to be contemplated very deeply: I HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE OF SCHOLARS AND SLAMMED THE DOOR BEHIND ME. It is not only that he has left the house, the emphasis, it should be remembered, is that he has slammed the door behind him. He is finished with scholarship. This is not the place where truth is found. This is the place where truth is discussed, this is the place where thousands of hypotheses about truth are produced, this is the place where no conclusion has ever been arrived at.\nFor thousands of years scholars have been discussing, in minute detail, but there has never been a conclusion. Scholars are empty shells – they make much noise but that noise is meaningless. They argue much but the hypothesis they are arguing about still remains a hypothesis; no argument can make a hypothesis a reality. And above all, how can you discuss something which you have never experienced?\nThe scholars are like the five blind people of Aesop’s fable who had gone to see an elephant. Obviously they had no eyes. They could not see the elephant, so they touched the elephant. Somebody touched his feet, somebody touched his big ears, somebody touched some other part, and everybody declared, “I know now what an elephant is.” The one who had touched his legs said, “An elephant is just like a pillar.” And the one who had touched his ears said, “You are an idiot, my experience shows that an elephant is just like a big fan.” And so on and so forth. They cannot come to any conclusion. And what they are saying looks absurd: the elephant is not like a pillar, but something in the elephant is like a pillar – his legs. But at least they have touched some part of the elephant.\nScholars are in an even worse condition. They have not touched anything about truth, about love, about silence, about meditation, about ecstasy – not even a partial experience – and they are so prolific in their arguments. They create much noise; they shout at each other. For centuries they have been doing that.\nZarathustra says, I HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE OF SCHOLARS.… It is a mad place – people are talking about things they know nothing about. Blind people are discussing detailed information about light, about darkness, about colors. People who don’t have any ears are talking about music. People who have never known a single moment of silence are creating great philosophical systems based on silence. They are very articulate about words, language, grammar, but that is not the search of Zarathustra.\nHe slammed the door behind him, forever. Scholarship, knowledgeability is not his way, is no one’s way; it is only for fools to deceive themselves.\nTOO LONG DID MY SOUL SIT HUNGRY AT THEIR TABLE; I HAVE NOT BEEN SCHOOLED, AS THEY HAVE, TO CRACK KNOWLEDGE AS ONE CRACKS NUTS.\nI LOVE FREEDOM AND THE AIR OVER FRESH SOIL; I WOULD SLEEP ON OX-SKINS RATHER THAN ON THEIR DIGNITIES AND RESPECTABILITIES.\nI AM TOO HOT AND SCORCHED BY MY OWN THOUGHT: IT IS OFTEN ABOUT TO TAKE MY BREATH AWAY. THEN I HAVE TO GET INTO THE OPEN AIR AND AWAY FROM ALL DUSTY ROOMS.\nBUT THEY SIT COOL IN THE COOL SHADE: THEY WANT TO BE MERE SPECTATORS IN EVERYTHING AND THEY TAKE CARE NOT TO SIT WHERE THE SUN BURNS UPON THE STEPS.\nThe scholar lives comfortably in his invented hypotheses, in his borrowed knowledge, in his respectability. He has no longing to experience life on his own. He loves comfort and respectability too much, which for a real seeker do not mean anything. What can respectability be – respectability from the people who are ignorant, who know nothing. They respect you, thinking that you are wise – you can quote scriptures. But the very idea of being respected by the ignorant is against the pride of an authentic man.\nAnd comfort is a slow death. Soon death will be knocking on your doors; then neither comfort can save you, nor respectability can be a shield. The only thing that can save you is your own realization of truth, is your own knowing of the meaning of life. It is your own taste.\nBut the scholars don’t have courage enough to drop all comfort, all respectability, and to declare to the world that, “I am not a wise man, not yet. Now I am going to search, and I will stake everything to have even a glimpse of the beauty and ecstasy of reality. I have lived too much in words, now I want actual experience.”\nAnd actual experience is wordless. It is a taste, it is a nourishment, it fulfills you. The word love is not love. Love is a deep dance of your heart, a rejoicing in your soul, an overflowing of your life juices, a sharing with those who are receptive and available. But the word love has nothing to do with it.\nWHEN THEY GIVE THEMSELVES OUT AS WISE, THEIR LITTLE SAYINGS AND TRUTHS MAKE ME SHIVER: THEIR WISDOM OFTEN SMELLS AS IF IT CAME FROM THE SWAMPS.\nIt smells, it stinks, it is really disgusting. If you have known something on your own, then you can see that the so-called scholars are all carrying corpses. And they are bragging whose corpse is the most ancient. The more rotten a corpse is, the more ancient a scripture is, the greater is the scholar.\nScholars certainly stink. But the innocent man – who is no longer burdened with dusty books, who is no longer living in dusty rooms of scholarship, who has come into the open, under the sky –\nhas a fragrance around him. Innocence has a fragrance, just as knowledge has a disgusting smell, because knowledge comes from corpses, and knowing comes from a living life source.\nTHEY ARE CLEVER, THEY HAVE CUNNING FINGERS: WHAT IS my SIMPLICITY COMPARED\nWITH THEIR DIVERSITY? Zarathustra says, “I am just a simple man, I am not clever – no wise man is clever.” Cleverness is a poor substitute for wisdom; cunningness is even a perversion. The innocent man is neither clever, nor cunning; but there is tremendous beauty and grandeur in him.\nI used to know a very rare human being, an old man, Magga Baba. This statement of Zarathustra’s reminds me of him. Nobody knew his name. He had nothing except a jug; and the Hindi word for jug is magga. Because he had a jug to drink water out of, or to have food in – that was his only possession – people started calling him Magga Baba. He was so simple that people would drop money into his magga – he would never beg – and some other people might take money out of his magga, but he would never prevent it. It was none of his concern.\nYou will not believe me... he was the only man, perhaps, who was stolen many times. A man – and he did not prevent it. People would simply take him and put him in a rickshaw. And he would not say, “Where are you taking me? And why are you taking me?” – he would simply go. They would take him to another village. And when, in the place where he was living, they became aware that somebody had stolen Magga Baba, they would go in search of him, to bring him back. He would not say anything to them either; they just had to put him back into a car or into a rickshaw.\nOnce he was lost for almost twelve years, because some people took him far away in a train. His followers went around the villages, but he was not found, because he was thousands of miles away. It was just by chance – a businessman had gone to that place and he saw Magga Baba. He dropped his business, took hold of Magga Baba, put him onto a train and brought him back to the city. There was great rejoicing all over the city: Magga Baba has been found! Twelve years... people had almost forgotten him.\nHe was so simple, just like a child. He used to speak very rarely – just a word, and that too not in response to your questions or anything. Once he told me, when he was aloneHe used to live in a\nshed, an open shed, and at night his disciples used to massage him. The whole night, the massage used to go on. He told me, “I need to sleep also, and these disciples of mine, they don’t understand that if they continue massaging me.…” And not only one – five, six people were massaging him. Somebody was massaging his head, somebody was massaging his feet.\nHe said, “How can I sleep? I have not slept for almost twenty years, because these lovers won’t let me.”\nI was always concerned about it, that this stupidity should be stopped, so I told the owner of the shed, “You put some doors on the shed, because this is too much for the poor man. The whole day people are there – and this they call ‘serving the master’ – and the whole night they are there. There is always a crowd serving the master, and nobody is at all concerned that he needs some rest. You put some doors on, and you close it at ten o’clock at night, and open it in the morning.”\nHe said, “I have been thinking about it.”\nI said, “There is no question of thinking, it is a simple thing.”\nSo he managed to put the doors on. But by the time he had fixed the doors, Magga Baba had been stolen. His disciples, seeing that doors are being put on, had taken him away to another shed.\nI told him, “It seems impossible, in this life, for you to sleep. I can ask again, the owner of this shed... but your disciples will take you away again. Their concern is to serve you. You don’t speak.”\nNobody ever asked him what he likes to eat; whatever they brought he would eat. One day I saw that he was smoking two cigarettes.\nI said, “Magga Baba!”\nHe said, “What to do? Two disciples”\n“But,” I said, “do you smoke?”\nHe said, “I don’t know, but they have put the cigarettes in my mouth, so what else can I do? I’m smoking – I have never smoked before. Just a competition between two disciples.” Such a simplicity.\nZarathustra must have been a very simple man, because his insights prove that. Only a very simple heart, utterly innocent, is capable of knowing the depths of life, and the heights of consciousness, and the mysteries of existence. Innocence is a door that leads you into all the mysteries and all the secrets of life.\nTHEIR FINGERS UNDERSTAND ALL THREADING AND KNITTING AND WEAVING: THUS THEY WEAVE THE STOCKINGS OF THE SPIRIT!\nTHEY KEEP A SHARP EYE UPON ONE ANOTHER AND DO NOT TRUST ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT. INVENTIVE IN SMALL SLYNESSES, THEY LIE IN WAIT FOR THOSE WHOSE WILLS GO UPON LAME FEET – THEY LIE IN WAIT LIKE SPIDERS.\nTHEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO PLAY WITH LOADED DICE; AND I FOUND THEM PLAYING SO ZEALOUSLY THAT THEY WERE SWEATING.\nWE ARE STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER, AND THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED\nTO MY TASTE THAN ARE THEIR FALSEHOODS AND LOADED DICE. All these things he is saying about the scholars, about the people who are recognized in the world as great men. All the mystics are strangers to the scholars, for the simple reason that the mystic does not believe, the mystic does not think; the mystic experiences. To think about water is one thing.You can write a treatise on\nwater, and you will be known as a great scholar; you may be awarded a Ph.D. on your thesis. But your book or your knowledge cannot quench the thirst; and the man who drinks water need not know that its chemical formula is H2O – because “H2O” cannot quench your thirst.\nThe mystic’s concern is to quench his thirst, to nourish his being, to explore his interiority and to come into rapport with existence and all that it contains. And it contains all the joys, and all the beauties, and all the blessings, and all the benedictions. The scholar is content only to think about these things. He is not really thirsty; otherwise he would seek water, not a treatise on water; he would go to the well, not to the library. The mystic goes to the well and the scholar goes to the library. They are absolute strangers to each other.\nWE ARE STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER, AND THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED\nTO MY TASTE THAN ARE THEIR FALSEHOODS AND LOADED DICE. The scholar cannot speak the truth, because he knows nothing about it. Even people who know about it cannot speak it, but at least they can point towards it; they can give a few hints, a few guidelines. They can hold your hand and take you to the window to show you the open sky and the stars. But the scholar is too much involved in language, in theology, in philosophy – he has no time even to look out of the window. He has forgotten living; he knows only thinking.\nThinking is a falsehood, because you think only when you do not know. When you see a beautiful sunset, do you think? Most probably, out of old habit, you start thinking. You start saying within yourself, “What a beautiful sunset.” But your words are becoming a barrier. That is not a way to be in rapport with the sunset; all thinking should stop. Then you will be there – utterly in harmony with the sunset, almost a part of it. And then you will know its beauty. Not by repeating, “It is beautiful” – those words are borrowed. You have heard them, and you are saying them just to show that you have a great aesthetic sense.\nBut you are not there; your mind is wandering somewhere else. If beauty cannot stop your mind, you don’t know what beauty is. If a great dance cannot bring meditation to you, then you don’t know how to see a dance. We are loaded with falsehoods.\nZarathustra says, THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED TO MY TASTE. Their virtues are very strange. Different scholars have different virtues, belonging to different herds. I will tell you one incident in the life of a great philosopher that India has produced – Shankaracharya, the first Adi Shankaracharya. Because now there are successors, like the popes, they are all called shankaracharyas. He preached the philosophy that the world is illusory, that it only appears, it does not exist. It is almost made of the same stuff as dreams are made of.\nIn Varanasi, which is the Hindu citadel, he was delivering discourses on the illusoriness of the world. One morning... it was dark, there was still time before the sun would rise... according to the tradition – he was a brahmin monk – he took a bath in the Ganges. He was coming up the steps, there was nobody around, and suddenly a man appeared and, touching his body, passed by his side. The man then stopped and said, “Forgive me, perhaps in the darkness you cannot recognize me, but I can recognize you: I am a sudra, I am an untouchable.”\nHindus have the oldest fascist religion. They have reduced one-fourth of their society to an almost animal existence. They call them untouchables because to touch them, or even to be touched by their shadow, defiles you. You have to take a bath immediately to cleanse yourself. For five thousand years they have been torturing these poor people, who do all the dirty work of the society. But they are not allowed to live in the cities, in the towns; they have to live outside. They are the poorest of the poor, the most exploited, the most downtrodden.\nShankaracharya was a high-caste brahmin, and one of the greatest Hindu philosophers. He was really very angry. He said, “You are an untouchable and you recognized me, and still you touched me. I will have to go back to the river and take another bath.”\nBut the untouchable said, “Before you go, you will have to answer a few questions; otherwise I will remain here and touch you again.”\nThere was nobody there, so Shankaracharya was in a fix – what to do? If he goes and takes a bath and comes back and he is touched again, the situation will be the same. So he said, “Okay, what are your questions? You seem to be a very nasty and stubborn person.”\nHe said, “My first question is: Am I real or illusory? If I am an illusion, you need not have another bath; you can go and do your worship in the temple. If I am real, then drop this nonsense that you have been talking.”\nShankara was silent for a moment – what to say to this man? He had been discussing his philosophy all over the country. He had conquered all the Hindu philosophers. A book exists, SHANKARA DIGVIJAYA, the victory of the great Shankara. Wherever he went, he logically proved that the world is illusory. But what to do with this untouchable?\nHe was standing there. The untouchable said, “I am illusory, the river is illusory, your bath is illusory, you are illusory – these are all according to your philosophy. I want to ask a few things more: you call me untouchable. Is it my body that is untouchable? Do you think your body is made with different ingredients? Is it possible to find a difference between the bones of an untouchable and the bones of a brahmin, or the blood, or the skin, or the skull? I can bring skulls and you tell me which one is the skull of a brahmin. Certainly bodies are all made of the same ingredients; you cannot find any difference of superior or inferior.\n“Then perhaps, our minds are untouchable. But can you touch my mind? That which cannot be touched should not be called untouchable. Your mind is also untouchable. Or do you think my soul is untouchable? – because I have heard you speaking, that there is only one soul in the whole universe, the brahma, the ultimate soul, and we are all parts of it. What about the untouchables? Do they have souls or not? And if they have souls, are they part of your ultimate one soul, or do they have a separate, out-of-this-town place?”\nShankara, who was a great logician, for the first time felt defeated. He said, “Forgive me, you have awakened me from a deep sleep. I was living in words; you challenged me by reality.”\nThe people who become accustomed to living in words start living in castles in the air. They forget the real world, the real beings. Their virtues, their religions are derived from their aircastles. Their virtues are not derived from the reality in which they exist. That’s why Zarathustra says: THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED TO MY TASTE. They are just verbal, logical, linguistic; they have nothing to do with reality. And you can make anything a virtue – you just have to give arguments for it.\nIt happened to a man: he was always coming late to his house, and his wife was continually telling him, “I know where you go and someday you will repent.” But he did not listen – he was going to the prostitutes. That night the wife was really angry, and as he entered the house she cut his nose off with a knife. The man said, “What are you doing?” But by that time his nose was on the ground. The man said, “Are you mad or something? Now, how will I live? What will I say to people?”\nThe woman said, “Now it is your problem. I have lived enough in anguish, now you live”\nThe man thought: it is really a very embarrassing situation. Everybody in the town will be asking, “What happened to your nose?” It is better to escape from this town. But the problem still remains that in the other town they will also ask, “What happened to your nose?”\nHe was a man who had some interest in philosophy and religion. He found a way: he escaped in the night to the other town, and there he sat under a tree in a lotus posture with closed eyes. People came around. They had seen many saints, but this was a special saint – without a nose and sitting absolutely buddha-like.\nFinally somebody asked, “You are new here and we are happy to have a great saint like you” – because he was sitting so still, so silently; although inside there was nothing of the silence, it was just a posture.\nHe said, “I have found God.”\nThey said, “You have found God? Then we would like to be your disciples.”\nHe said, “There is a condition: unless you cut off your noseIt is the nose that is the barrier. Once\nthe nose is cut off, immediately you will see God standing before you.”\nIt was a difficult thing. People thought many timesbut everywhere you can find idiots. Some idiot\ncame out and he said, “Okay! I am ready.”\nThe man had brought a knife with him. He took him aside and cut his nose off. The man looked around but there was no God. He said, “But where is God?”\nThe master said, “Don’t talk about God, because there is no God and it has nothing to do with cutting your nose off. But if you say to people that you are not seeing God, they will laugh at you – that you are idiot, you lost your nose unnecessarily. It is better that you just go and tell people – go dancing – that, ‘This is a simple method, great. The moment the nose came off, God was standing before me.’” The man thought, and he also was convinced that this is the only way to save himself from embarrassment.\nThe master said, “This is the situation, the same situation with me. I don’t know anything about God, but you are my chief disciple, and we will make many disciples – just have a little courage.”\nSo the man went and told people, “I had done everything and I had not found God. This man has found the right key: just a small sacrifice of the nose and immediately... it is as if a curtain has opened and God is standing there. I have seen Him,” and he was dancing.\nPeople said, “This is something. We have never heard.there is no scripture in which it is written:\ncut your nose off and see God.”\nBut that man was from their own village. He sat by his master’s side in a lotus posture, and the line started growing. The trick was the same: he would take them to the side, cut their nose off, and tell them the fact, “There is no question of God, it is a question now of saving yourself from embarrassment. You are free, you can say... but they will only call you an idiot. If you listen to me you will be worshiped like a great saint, as all my followers are being worshiped.”\nThe thing became so infectious that there were hundreds of people in that town without noses; and everybody was touching their feet, inviting them to their home for food, for clothes. The rumor even reached the king.\nHe was a person very deeply interested in religion. He said, “But I have never heard, never read... but so many people cannot lie. If it was only one person, that would be one thing, but from our own capital, hundreds of people have seen God. To remain without the realization of God just to save your nose does not seem to be right. I’m going!”\nHe told the prime minister, “Make arrangements. I’m going. One day one has to die – nose and all – so if just by cutting your nose off you can experience God, it is worth it.”\nThe prime minister was a very intelligent man. He said, “Just wait. There is no hurry. You can cut your nose off tomorrow. Let me first enquire, find out what is happening.”\nHe went... invited the “great master” – because now he had become a great master, who has found the most shortcut way to God. You cannot even imagine that there can be a shorter way. He invited him into the palace and the master was very happy; he went into the palace. He was taken into a room where four very strong wrestlers were ready; he could not see what is going on.\nThe prime minister said, “You tell the truth; otherwise these four people are going to beat you, torture you, make as many fractures in your body as possible until you tell the truth.”\nThe man saw the situation. He said, “The reality is, my wife has cut my nose off. I have not seen any God or anything. Please don’t torture me; I will leave the city.”\nAnd the prime minister asked, “What about your other disciples?”\nHe said, “Nobody has seen... but once somebody’s nose is gone, he has two alternatives: either to be a saint or to be a fool. The whole city will laugh, that this idiot has lost his nose and we were telling him, ‘Don’t do this,’ but he didn’t listen.”\nHe took the man to the king, and when the king heard that he said, “My God! If I had gone yesterday, by this time I would also have seen God!”\nYou can find any kind of stupidity, support it by cunningness, by cleverness, and the world is so full of idiots that you will always find followers. All these religions that exist are nothing but different versions of the same story. Nobody has seen God, but by torturing yourself you become a saint. And then it looks foolish to say that this torturing has been useless... I have not seen God. Now it is better to keep quiet. You have become so respectable – God or no God. You were of no use, worthless, nobody ever respected you; now thousands of people respect you. It is better to keep quiet and enjoy the respectability.\nLogic, argument, philosophy, in the hands of cunning and clever people, can create all kinds of virtues and moralities in which you cannot see what is moral. But they can give evidence, and they can always bring witnesses to say, “Yes. It is happening.”\nHindu monks use a wooden sandal. It is very torturous because it has no support – you have to hold it between your big toe and your second toe. It is heavy and walking becomes unnecessary torture. But ask the Hindu monks, “Why are you doing it when more comfortable, convenient sandals are possible?”\nOne great Hindu saint, Karpatri, told me that there is a secret in it. I said, “What is the secret?” He said, “The secret is that it keeps a man celibate.”\nI said, “Great! The wooden sandal?”\nHe said, “You don’t understand. There is a nerve in your big toe that controls your sexuality.”\nI said, “Now, man’s whole physiology has been completely explored – there is no nerve there which controls sexuality. You can even cut the whole leg off, then too sexuality will not be controlled.” But millions of Hindu monks believe in it. And there is another thing: every Hindu wears a sacred thread around his neck; and when he goes to the urinal, he has to put that thread around his ear.\nI asked the shankaracharya of Dwarika – I was staying in Dwarika – “I don’t see the point.” I had to ask him because he himself had made a man look so foolish amongst the peopleA young\nman had stood up and he wanted to ask something, but the shankaracharya said, “Before you ask anything, answer my few questions.” The man was wearing Western dress – long pants, a coat, and a tie – and that had infuriated the shankaracharya.\nHe asked, “Do you have the Hindu thread, the sacred thread, inside your shirt or not?” The man said, “No, I don’t have it.”\nThe shankaracharya was very angry, and he said, “The moment you stood up, I knew – with those kinds of clothes, you must be urinating standing up and that is against Hinduism. First get a sacred thread. Change this dress, and when you are urinating put the thread round your ear.” The people laughed and the poor man looked stupid among those idiots.\nI had just heard about it, so I asked him, “What is the science of your sacred thread? And in what way is it spiritual to put it around your ear while urinating?”\nThe same answerthat in the ear there is a nerve which controls your sexuality. So when you wind\nthe sacred thread round and round the ear, that nerve is caught. It helps a man to remain celibate.\nMillions of Hindus believe this. And it is not only Hindus – in every religion you will find the same kind of stupid ideas have been propagated for thousands of years. Nobody raises any question because nobody wants to fall apart from the crowd, lose the respect of the crowd.\nAnd the crowd can be very nasty; it can misbehave with the person. The person may have to lose his job. Even his family will become against him; his own friends will turn their backs on him. He will become lonely in the very crowd, and condemned. But if he were doing those stupid things that the crowd believes have some spirituality in them, some virtue in them, the crowd would have been respectful.\nAs far as I see, to be respectable in this society means you are cunning, means you are a hypocrite. It means that just to remain respectable you are pretending many things, which you know perfectly well are just either useless or stupid or even harmful.\nAND WHEN I LIVED AMONG THEM I LIVED ABOVE THEM. THEY GREW ANGRY WITH ME FOR\nTHAT. I know it from my own experience. I have made so many religious people angry around the world – religious heads, saints, sages – just for the simple reason that I showed them that what they understand as character, as virtue, as religion, is mostly rubbish. They don’t have any answer. Their answer is anger; but anger is not an argument. It does not prove anything – in fact it disproves. If you become angry, that simply shows that you have been exposed; and you don’t have any evidence, any proof, any rationality in your actions.\nAND WHEN I LIVED AMONG THEM I LIVED ABOVE THEM. THEY GREW ANGRY WITH ME FOR THAT.\nTHEY DID NOT WANT TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE WAS WALKING OVER THEIR HEADS; AND SO THEY PUT WOOD AND DIRT AND RUBBISH BETWEEN THEIR HEADS AND ME.\nTHUS THEY MUFFLED THE SOUND OF MY STEPS: AND FROM THEN ON THE MOST SCHOLARLY HEARD ME THE WORST.\nBUT I WALK ABOVE THEIR HEADS WITH MY THOUGHTS IN SPITE OF THAT; AND EVEN IF I SHOULD WALK UPON MY OWN FAULTS, I SHOULD STILL BE ABOVE THEM AND THEIR HEADS.\nFOR MEN ARE NOT EQUAL.\nThis is such a great statement. Particularly today, because communism has made it almost universally accepted that all men are equal. And it is not right at all: not even two men are equal.\nEquality is a false idea.\nEvery man is unique.\nHe is a category in himself.\nI conceive that everybody should be given equal opportunity to grow in his uniqueness, but no men are equal. Equality is our contemporary superstition – the latest and the most widely accepted, even by those who are not communists. They have also accepted it, because they have not denied it.\nEven the non-communists don’t have the guts to say that men are not equal, because they are afraid that the crowds will be angry. Crowds are very happy to know that men are equal, that you are equal to Albert Einstein, that you are equal to Bertrand Russell, that you are equal to Martin Buber, that you are equal to Jean-Paul Sartre. The masses are very happy with the idea. It is so ego-fulfilling that even those who are not communists are afraid to say that men are not equal. But I am absolutely in agreement with Zarathustra: men are not equal.\nTHUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. AND WHAT I DESIRE they MAY NOT DESIRE! My likings are different, your likings are different; my talents are different, your talents are different; my destiny is only my destiny, your destiny is only your destiny. In fact, only cattle are equal. Man is the only being on the earth who has uniqueness. But you will create anger in them.…\nWhen I said, twenty years ago, that men are not equal, the Communist party of India passed a resolution against me, condemning me. And the president of the Communist party of India, S.A. Dange, declared that soon his son-in-law, who is a professor, is going to write a book to confute my idea that men are not equal. He has written a book against me; although there is no argument except anger, abuse and lies – but not a single argument to prove that men are equal.\nZarathustra is right: THUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. I have my own conception of a better society: it will provide equal opportunity to all, but the equal opportunity will be for them to be unequal, to grow in their uniqueness.\nTo me, communism means equal opportunity for all, not equality of man. Zarathustra had the insight twenty-five centuries ago. It is absolutely just and fair that man should not be sacrificed again in the name of equality. He has been sacrificed many times, in different names, in different temples, before different gods. Now he is being sacrificed in the temple of communism – before a holy book, DAS KAPITAL, before a trinity of gods, Marx, Engels and Lenin.\nIt is such a simple thing; everybody knows that nobody is equal. But man’s jealousy... jealousy of the small man against the great, jealousy of the little ones against the giants, makes them shout loudly – and of course they are in the majority – that man is equal, and equality is man’s birthright. And they know not that they are saying something which is synonymous to committing suicide. Equal opportunity to grow is perfectly right. And the acceptance of the uniqueness of individuals makes the society rich, gives it the variety of all kinds of flowers, of different colors, with different fragrances.\nZarathustra is rare, in the sense that he has seen faraway things, because nobody was talking about equality of man in his day. Marx was yet to come, after twenty-four centuries. But the more meditative you are, the more silent, the clearer becomes your vision, and it can see far away in the future. This statement is against Karl Marx; although Zarathustra is not aware of any Karl Marx in particular.\nKarl Marx was just a scholar and nothing else. He spent his whole life in the library of the British Museum. He was there before the library opened, and he was almost pushed out, every day, when the library closed – and sometimes even carried out, because in his old age he would continue reading and reading, and he would become unconscious. By the time the library was going to be closed they would find that his head was on the table and he was unconscious. He had to be carried out and an ambulance called to take him home. And tomorrow morning he was back again. A perfect scholar! Not metaphorically, but really a bookworm. All his experience was only with books – not with people, not with existence, not with himself.\nFOR MEN ARE NOT EQUAL: THUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. AND WHAT I DESIRE THEY MAY NOT DESIRE!\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7494","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/>Zarathustra.

knowledge and knowing. Knowledge is cheap and easy: knowing is costly,
risky, needs courage. Knowledge is available in the market. There are
special markets for knowledge – the universities, the colleges. Knowing
is not available anywhere except within yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing is your capacity. Knowledge is your memory, and memory is the
function of the mind that can be easily done by any computer. Knowledge
is always borrowed. It is not a flower that grows in your soul, it is
something plastic that has been imposed upon you. Knowledge has no
roots; it does not grow. It is a dead compilation of corpses. Knowing is
a continuous growth, it is a living process. In other words: knowing
belongs to your consciousness and its evolution, knowledge belongs to
your mind and its memory system.</p><p><br></p><p>The words look similar; hence they have created much confusion in the
world. And knowledge is cheap – you can get it from books, you can get
it from the rabbis, you can get it from the pundits, you can get it from
the bishops – there are thousands of ways of accumulating knowledge. But
it is a</p><p>dead pile; it has no life of its own. And the most significant thing
to remember is: all your knowledge, however great, makes no difference
to your ignorance. Your ignorance remains intact. The only difference it
makes is, it covers up your ignorance. You can pretend to the world that
you are no longer ignorant, but deep inside you there is just darkness.
Behind the borrowed words there is no experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing dispels your ignorance; knowing is just like light which
dispels darkness. Hence, remember the difference between the scholar and
the wise man. The wise man is not necessarily a scholar and vice versa –
the scholar is also not necessarily a wise man.</p><p><br></p><p>Most probably the scholar rarely becomes a wise man – for the simple
reason that he has so much knowledge that he can deceive people, and if
he can deceive many people he is deceived by their deception. He starts
believing: if so many people think me a wise man, then I must be. So
many people cannot be so foolish. Hence, in the life of the scholar
there is no journey, no exploration, no discovery. He lives in the
greatest illusion in the world – he knows nothing and he thinks he knows
all.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of knowing starts by disowning knowledge, because knowledge
is a hindrance; it is a false coin. And the false should be removed
before the real can be realised. He disowns everything that is not his
own. It is better to be ignorant than to be knowledgeable, because at
least the ignorance is yours. It needs more courage than renouncing
riches, renouncing kingdoms, renouncing your family, renouncing the
society, because they are all outside. Knowledge accumulates inside your
mind. Wherever you go... deep in the Himalayas it will be with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Renouncing knowledge means a deep inner cleansing and that is what I
mean by meditation. Meditation is nothing but renouncing borrowed
knowledge and becoming fully aware of one’s ignorance. This brings a
metamorphosis. The moment you are aware of your ignorance, ignorance
goes through such a great change that unless it happens it remains
unbelievable. The very ignorance becomes your innocence. The wise man
also says, “I do not know.”</p><p><br></p><p>According to Zarathustra, the highest stage of consciousness is that
of a child. You are born a child but then you are ignorant. You will go
through much knowledge, much memory and if you are fortunate enough, one
day you will see that it is all false – because it is not yours.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha may have known, Jesus may have known, Krishna may have known;
but their knowledge cannot become my knowing, their life cannot become
my life, their love cannot become my love. How can their knowledge
become my knowledge? I will have to seek and search on my own. I have to
become an adventurer, a seeker of the unknown. I have to go on untrodden
paths into uncharted seas. And I have to risk everything with a
determined will that if others have achieved the truth, there is no
reason why existence will be unkind to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Very few fortunate people start dropping their borrowed knowledge.
And as they start dropping their borrowed knowledge the circle starts
moving back toward their childhood. The completion of the circle comes
when ignorance becomes luminous. When ignorance meets with awareness the
greatest explosion in the whole experience of man happens: you disappear
as an ego. Now you are a pure, innocent existence – pure “isness,” with
no claim for anything.</p><p>In this moment Socrates said, “I do not know anything.” In the same
state Bodhidharma declared, “I know nothing. And moreover, my ‘I’ is
just a linguistic convenience. Inside me there is no entity which can
say ‘I’. I am just using it, because without it you will not be able to
understand. The reality is that I have disappeared and there is only a
pure sky, a pure ‘isness’ – utterly innocent, with no clouds of
knowledge.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a difficult task to disown knowledge, because knowledge gives
you respectability, makes you a great man, brings you a Nobel prize. You
are known to millions of people, although you know nothing about
yourself. It is a very strange state: the whole world knows you except
yourself. To disown knowledge means to fall in the eyes of people, to
lose respectability, fame, celebrity. And the ego is very much against
doing such a thing – because with the respectability, the fame and the
knowledge disowned, the ego starts dying. It can live only on the
borrowed. It itself is the most false thing in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra’s statements have to be contemplated very deeply: I HAVE
LEFT THE HOUSE OF SCHOLARS AND SLAMMED THE DOOR BEHIND ME. It is not
only that he has left the house, the emphasis, it should be remembered,
is that he has slammed the door behind him. He is finished with
scholarship. This is not the place where truth is found. This is the
place where truth is discussed, this is the place where thousands of
hypotheses about truth are produced, this is the place where no
conclusion has ever been arrived at.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years scholars have been discussing, in minute
detail, but there has never been a conclusion. Scholars are empty shells
– they make much noise but that noise is meaningless. They argue much
but the hypothesis they are arguing about still remains a hypothesis; no
argument can make a hypothesis a reality. And above all, how can you
discuss something which you have never experienced?</p><p><br></p><p>The scholars are like the five blind people of Aesop’s fable who had
gone to see an elephant. Obviously they had no eyes. They could not see
the elephant, so they touched the elephant. Somebody touched his feet,
somebody touched his big ears, somebody touched some other part, and
everybody declared, “I know now what an elephant is.” The one who had
touched his legs said, “An elephant is just like a pillar.” And the one
who had touched his ears said, “You are an idiot, my experience shows
that an elephant is just like a big fan.” And so on and so forth. They
cannot come to any conclusion. And what they are saying looks absurd:
the elephant is not like a pillar, but something in the elephant is like
a pillar – his legs. But at least they have touched some part of the
elephant.</p><p>Scholars are in an even worse condition. They have not touched
anything about truth, about love, about silence, about meditation, about
ecstasy – not even a partial experience – and they are so prolific in
their arguments. They create much noise; they shout at each other. For
centuries they have been doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, I HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE OF SCHOLARS.… It is a mad
place – people are talking about things they know nothing about. Blind
people are discussing detailed information about light, about darkness,
about colors. People who don’t have any ears are talking about music.
People who have never known a single moment of silence are creating
great philosophical systems based on silence. They are very articulate
about words, language, grammar, but that is not the search of
Zarathustra.</p><p>He slammed the door behind him, forever. Scholarship,
knowledgeability is not his way, is no one’s way; it is only for fools
to deceive themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>TOO LONG DID MY SOUL SIT HUNGRY AT THEIR TABLE; I HAVE NOT BEEN
SCHOOLED, AS THEY HAVE, TO CRACK KNOWLEDGE AS ONE CRACKS NUTS.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE FREEDOM AND THE AIR OVER FRESH SOIL; I WOULD SLEEP ON OX-SKINS
RATHER THAN ON THEIR DIGNITIES AND RESPECTABILITIES.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM TOO HOT AND SCORCHED BY MY OWN THOUGHT: IT IS OFTEN ABOUT TO
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY. THEN I HAVE TO GET INTO THE OPEN AIR AND AWAY FROM
ALL DUSTY ROOMS.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THEY SIT COOL IN THE COOL SHADE: THEY WANT TO BE MERE SPECTATORS
IN EVERYTHING AND THEY TAKE CARE NOT TO SIT WHERE THE SUN BURNS UPON THE
STEPS.</p><p><br></p><p>The scholar lives comfortably in his invented hypotheses, in his
borrowed knowledge, in his respectability. He has no longing to
experience life on his own. He loves comfort and respectability too
much, which for a real seeker do not mean anything. What can
respectability be – respectability from the people who are ignorant, who
know nothing. They respect you, thinking that you are wise – you can
quote scriptures. But the very idea of being respected by the ignorant
is against the pride of an authentic man.</p><p><br></p><p>And comfort is a slow death. Soon death will be knocking on your
doors; then neither comfort can save you, nor respectability can be a
shield. The only thing that can save you is your own realization of
truth, is your own knowing of the meaning of life. It is your own
taste.</p><p><br></p><p>But the scholars don’t have courage enough to drop all comfort, all
respectability, and to declare to the world that, “I am not a wise man,
not yet. Now I am going to search, and I will stake everything to have
even a glimpse of the beauty and ecstasy of reality. I have lived too
much in words, now I want actual experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>And actual experience is wordless. It is a taste, it is a
nourishment, it fulfills you. The word love is not love. Love is a deep
dance of your heart, a rejoicing in your soul, an overflowing of your
life juices, a sharing with those who are receptive and available. But
the word love has nothing to do with it.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THEY GIVE THEMSELVES OUT AS WISE, THEIR LITTLE SAYINGS AND
TRUTHS MAKE ME SHIVER: THEIR WISDOM OFTEN SMELLS AS IF IT CAME FROM THE
SWAMPS.</p><p><br></p><p>It smells, it stinks, it is really disgusting. If you have known
something on your own, then you can see that the so-called scholars are
all carrying corpses. And they are bragging whose corpse is the most
ancient. The more rotten a corpse is, the more ancient a scripture is,
the greater is the scholar.</p><p><br></p><p>Scholars certainly stink. But the innocent man – who is no longer
burdened with dusty books, who is no longer living in dusty rooms of
scholarship, who has come into the open, under the sky –</p><p>has a fragrance around him. Innocence has a fragrance, just as
knowledge has a disgusting smell, because knowledge comes from corpses,
and knowing comes from a living life source.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY ARE CLEVER, THEY HAVE CUNNING FINGERS: WHAT IS my SIMPLICITY
COMPARED</p><p>WITH THEIR DIVERSITY? Zarathustra says, “I am just a simple man, I am
not clever – no wise man is clever.” Cleverness is a poor substitute for
wisdom; cunningness is even a perversion. The innocent man is neither
clever, nor cunning; but there is tremendous beauty and grandeur in
him.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to know a very rare human being, an old man, Magga Baba. This
statement of Zarathustra’s reminds me of him. Nobody knew his name. He
had nothing except a jug; and the Hindi word for jug is magga. Because
he had a jug to drink water out of, or to have food in – that was his
only possession – people started calling him Magga Baba. He was so
simple that people would drop money into his magga – he would never beg
– and some other people might take money out of his magga, but he would
never prevent it. It was none of his concern.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not believe me... he was the only man, perhaps, who was
stolen many times. A man – and he did not prevent it. People would
simply take him and put him in a rickshaw. And he would not say, “Where
are you taking me? And why are you taking me?” – he would simply go.
They would take him to another village. And when, in the place where he
was living, they became aware that somebody had stolen Magga Baba, they
would go in search of him, to bring him back. He would not say anything
to them either; they just had to put him back into a car or into a
rickshaw.</p><p><br></p><p>Once he was lost for almost twelve years, because some people took
him far away in a train. His followers went around the villages, but he
was not found, because he was thousands of miles away. It was just by
chance – a businessman had gone to that place and he saw Magga Baba. He
dropped his business, took hold of Magga Baba, put him onto a train and
brought him back to the city. There was great rejoicing all over the
city: Magga Baba has been found! Twelve years... people had almost
forgotten him.</p><p><br></p><p>He was so simple, just like a child. He used to speak very rarely –
just a word, and that too not in response to your questions or anything.
Once he told me, when he was alone<span class=s4></span>He used to
live in a</p><p>shed, an open shed, and at night his disciples used to massage him.
The whole night, the massage used to go on. He told me, “I need to sleep
also, and these disciples of mine, they don’t understand that if they
continue massaging me.…” And not only one – five, six people were
massaging him. Somebody was massaging his head, somebody was massaging
his feet.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How can I sleep? I have not slept for almost twenty years,
because these lovers won’t let me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was always concerned about it, that this stupidity should be
stopped, so I told the owner of the shed, “You put some doors on the
shed, because this is too much for the poor man. The whole day people
are there – and this they call ‘serving the master’ – and the whole
night they are there. There is always a crowd serving the master, and
nobody is at all concerned that he needs some rest. You put some doors
on, and you close it at ten o’clock at night, and open it in the
morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have been thinking about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no question of thinking, it is a simple thing.”</p><p>So he managed to put the doors on. But by the time he had fixed the
doors, Magga Baba had been stolen. His disciples, seeing that doors are
being put on, had taken him away to another shed.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “It seems impossible, in this life, for you to sleep. I
can ask again, the owner of this shed... but your disciples will take
you away again. Their concern is to serve you. You don’t speak.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>Nobody ever asked him what he likes to eat; whatever they brought he
would eat. One day I saw that he was smoking two cigarettes.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Magga Baba!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What to do? Two disciples<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” I said, “do you smoke?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t know, but they have put the cigarettes in my mouth,
so what else can I do? I’m smoking – I have never smoked before. Just a
competition between two disciples.” Such a simplicity.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra must have been a very simple man, because his insights
prove that. Only a very simple heart, utterly innocent, is capable of
knowing the depths of life, and the heights of consciousness, and the
mysteries of existence. Innocence is a door that leads you into all the
mysteries and all the secrets of life.</p><p><br></p><p>THEIR FINGERS UNDERSTAND ALL THREADING AND KNITTING AND WEAVING: THUS
THEY WEAVE THE STOCKINGS OF THE SPIRIT!</p><p><br></p><p>THEY KEEP A SHARP EYE UPON ONE ANOTHER AND DO NOT TRUST ONE ANOTHER
AS WELL AS THEY MIGHT. INVENTIVE IN SMALL SLYNESSES, THEY LIE IN WAIT
FOR THOSE WHOSE WILLS GO UPON LAME FEET – THEY LIE IN WAIT LIKE
SPIDERS.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO PLAY WITH LOADED DICE; AND I FOUND THEM PLAYING
SO ZEALOUSLY THAT THEY WERE SWEATING.</p><p><br></p><p>WE ARE STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER, AND THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE
OPPOSED</p><p>TO MY TASTE THAN ARE THEIR FALSEHOODS AND LOADED DICE. All these
things he is saying about the scholars, about the people who are
recognized in the world as great men. All the mystics are strangers to
the scholars, for the simple reason that the mystic does not believe,
the mystic does not think; the mystic experiences. To think about water
is one thing.<span class=s4></span>You can write a treatise on</p><p>water, and you will be known as a great scholar; you may be awarded a
Ph.D. on your thesis. But your book or your knowledge cannot quench the
thirst; and the man who drinks water need not know that its chemical
formula is H2O – because “H2O” cannot quench your thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic’s concern is to quench his thirst, to nourish his being,
to explore his interiority and to come into rapport with existence and
all that it contains. And it contains all the joys, and all the
beauties, and all the blessings, and all the benedictions. The scholar
is content only to think about these things. He is not really thirsty;
otherwise he would seek water, not a treatise on water; he would go to
the well, not to the library. The mystic goes to the well and the
scholar goes to the library. They are absolute strangers to each
other.</p><p>WE ARE STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER, AND THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE
OPPOSED</p><p>TO MY TASTE THAN ARE THEIR FALSEHOODS AND LOADED DICE. The scholar
cannot speak the truth, because he knows nothing about it. Even people
who know about it cannot speak it, but at least they can point towards
it; they can give a few hints, a few guidelines. They can hold your hand
and take you to the window to show you the open sky and the stars. But
the scholar is too much involved in language, in theology, in philosophy
– he has no time even to look out of the window. He has forgotten
living; he knows only thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking is a falsehood, because you think only when you do not know.
When you see a beautiful sunset, do you think? Most probably, out of old
habit, you start thinking. You start saying within yourself, “What a
beautiful sunset.” But your words are becoming a barrier. That is not a
way to be in rapport with the sunset; all thinking should stop. Then you
will be there – utterly in harmony with the sunset, almost a part of it.
And then you will know its beauty. Not by repeating, “It is beautiful” –
those words are borrowed. You have heard them, and you are saying them
just to show that you have a great aesthetic sense.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are not there; your mind is wandering somewhere else. If
beauty cannot stop your mind, you don’t know what beauty is. If a great
dance cannot bring meditation to you, then you don’t know how to see a
dance. We are loaded with falsehoods.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED TO MY TASTE.
Their virtues are very strange. Different scholars have different
virtues, belonging to different herds. I will tell you one incident in
the life of a great philosopher that India has produced –
Shankaracharya, the first Adi Shankaracharya. Because now there are
successors, like the popes, they are all called shankaracharyas. He
preached the philosophy that the world is illusory, that it only
appears, it does not exist. It is almost made of the same stuff as
dreams are made of.</p><p><br></p><p>In Varanasi, which is the Hindu citadel, he was delivering discourses
on the illusoriness of the world. One morning... it was dark, there was
still time before the sun would rise... according to the tradition – he
was a brahmin monk – he took a bath in the Ganges. He was coming up the
steps, there was nobody around, and suddenly a man appeared and,
touching his body, passed by his side. The man then stopped and said,
“Forgive me, perhaps in the darkness you cannot recognize me, but I can
recognize you: I am a sudra, I am an untouchable.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus have the oldest fascist religion. They have reduced one-fourth
of their society to an almost animal existence. They call them
untouchables because to touch them, or even to be touched by their
shadow, defiles you. You have to take a bath immediately to cleanse
yourself. For five thousand years they have been torturing these poor
people, who do all the dirty work of the society. But they are not
allowed to live in the cities, in the towns; they have to live outside.
They are the poorest of the poor, the most exploited, the most
downtrodden.</p><p><br></p><p>Shankaracharya was a high-caste brahmin, and one of the greatest
Hindu philosophers. He was really very angry. He said, “You are an
untouchable and you recognized me, and still you touched me. I will have
to go back to the river and take another bath.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the untouchable said, “Before you go, you will have to answer a
few questions; otherwise I will remain here and touch you again.”</p><p>There was nobody there, so Shankaracharya was in a fix – what to do?
If he goes and takes a bath and comes back and he is touched again, the
situation will be the same. So he said, “Okay, what are your questions?
You seem to be a very nasty and stubborn person.”</p><p>He said, “My first question is: Am I real or illusory? If I am an
illusion, you need not have another bath; you can go and do your worship
in the temple. If I am real, then drop this nonsense that you have been
talking.”</p><p>Shankara was silent for a moment – what to say to this man? He had
been discussing his philosophy all over the country. He had conquered
all the Hindu philosophers. A book exists, SHANKARA DIGVIJAYA, the
victory of the great Shankara. Wherever he went, he logically proved
that the world is illusory. But what to do with this untouchable?</p><p>He was standing there. The untouchable said, “I am illusory, the
river is illusory, your bath is illusory, you are illusory – these are
all according to your philosophy. I want to ask a few things more: you
call me untouchable. Is it my body that is untouchable? Do you think
your body is made with different ingredients? Is it possible to find a
difference between the bones of an untouchable and the bones of a
brahmin, or the blood, or the skin, or the skull? I can bring skulls and
you tell me which one is the skull of a brahmin. Certainly bodies are
all made of the same ingredients; you cannot find any difference of
superior or inferior.</p><p>“Then perhaps, our minds are untouchable. But can you touch my mind?
That which cannot be touched should not be called untouchable. Your mind
is also untouchable. Or do you think my soul is untouchable? – because I
have heard you speaking, that there is only one soul in the whole
universe, the brahma, the ultimate soul, and we are all parts of it.
What about the untouchables? Do they have souls or not? And if they have
souls, are they part of your ultimate one soul, or do they have a
separate, out-of-this-town place?”</p><p>Shankara, who was a great logician, for the first time felt defeated.
He said, “Forgive me, you have awakened me from a deep sleep. I was
living in words; you challenged me by reality.”</p><p>The people who become accustomed to living in words start living in
castles in the air. They forget the real world, the real beings. Their
virtues, their religions are derived from their aircastles. Their
virtues are not derived from the reality in which they exist. That’s why
Zarathustra says: THEIR VIRTUES ARE EVEN MORE OPPOSED TO MY TASTE. They
are just verbal, logical, linguistic; they have nothing to do with
reality. And you can make anything a virtue – you just have to give
arguments for it.</p><p>It happened to a man: he was always coming late to his house, and his
wife was continually telling him, “I know where you go and someday you
will repent.” But he did not listen – he was going to the prostitutes.
That night the wife was really angry, and as he entered the house she
cut his nose off with a knife. The man said, “What are you doing?” But
by that time his nose was on the ground. The man said, “Are you mad or
something? Now, how will I live? What will I say to people?”</p><p>The woman said, “Now it is your problem. I have lived enough in
anguish, now you live<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The man thought: it is really a very embarrassing situation.
Everybody in the town will be asking, “What happened to your nose?” It
is better to escape from this town. But the problem still remains that
in the other town they will also ask, “What happened to your nose?”</p><p>He was a man who had some interest in philosophy and religion. He
found a way: he escaped in the night to the other town, and there he sat
under a tree in a lotus posture with closed eyes. People came around.
They had seen many saints, but this was a special saint – without a nose
and sitting absolutely buddha-like.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally somebody asked, “You are new here and we are happy to have a
great saint like you” – because he was sitting so still, so silently;
although inside there was nothing of the silence, it was just a
posture.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have found God.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You have found God? Then we would like to be your
disciples.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “There is a condition: unless you cut off your nose<span class=s4></span>It is the nose that is the barrier. Once</p><p>the nose is cut off, immediately you will see God standing before
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a difficult thing. People thought many times<span class=s4></span>but everywhere you can find idiots. Some idiot</p><p>came out and he said, “Okay! I am ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man had brought a knife with him. He took him aside and cut his
nose off. The man looked around but there was no God. He said, “But
where is God?”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “Don’t talk about God, because there is no God and
it has nothing to do with cutting your nose off. But if you say to
people that you are not seeing God, they will laugh at you – that you
are idiot, you lost your nose unnecessarily. It is better that you just
go and tell people – go dancing – that, ‘This is a simple method, great.
The moment the nose came off, God was standing before me.’” The man
thought, and he also was convinced that this is the only way to save
himself from embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “This is the situation, the same situation with me.
I don’t know anything about God, but you are my chief disciple, and we
will make many disciples – just have a little courage.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the man went and told people, “I had done everything and I had not
found God. This man has found the right key: just a small sacrifice of
the nose and immediately... it is as if a curtain has opened and God is
standing there. I have seen Him,” and he was dancing.</p><p><br></p><p>People said, “This is something. We have never heard.<span class=s4></span>there is no scripture in which it is written:</p><p>cut your nose off and see God.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that man was from their own village. He sat by his master’s side
in a lotus posture, and the line started growing. The trick was the
same: he would take them to the side, cut their nose off, and tell them
the fact, “There is no question of God, it is a question now of saving
yourself from embarrassment. You are free, you can say... but they will
only call you an idiot. If you listen to me you will be worshiped like a
great saint, as all my followers are being worshiped.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thing became so infectious that there were hundreds of people in
that town without noses; and everybody was touching their feet, inviting
them to their home for food, for clothes. The rumor even reached the
king.</p><p>He was a person very deeply interested in religion. He said, “But I
have never heard, never read... but so many people cannot lie. If it was
only one person, that would be one thing, but from our own capital,
hundreds of people have seen God. To remain without the realization of
God just to save your nose does not seem to be right. I’m going!”</p><p><br></p><p>He told the prime minister, “Make arrangements. I’m going. One day
one has to die – nose and all – so if just by cutting your nose off you
can experience God, it is worth it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister was a very intelligent man. He said, “Just wait.
There is no hurry. You can cut your nose off tomorrow. Let me first
enquire, find out what is happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went... invited the “great master” – because now he had become a
great master, who has found the most shortcut way to God. You cannot
even imagine that there can be a shorter way. He invited him into the
palace and the master was very happy; he went into the palace. He was
taken into a room where four very strong wrestlers were ready; he could
not see what is going on.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, “You tell the truth; otherwise these four
people are going to beat you, torture you, make as many fractures in
your body as possible until you tell the truth.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man saw the situation. He said, “The reality is, my wife has cut
my nose off. I have not seen any God or anything. Please don’t torture
me; I will leave the city.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the prime minister asked, “What about your other disciples?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Nobody has seen... but once somebody’s nose is gone, he has
two alternatives: either to be a saint or to be a fool. The whole city
will laugh, that this idiot has lost his nose and we were telling him,
‘Don’t do this,’ but he didn’t listen.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took the man to the king, and when the king heard that he said,
“My God! If I had gone yesterday, by this time I would also have seen
God!”</p><p><br></p><p>You can find any kind of stupidity, support it by cunningness, by
cleverness, and the world is so full of idiots that you will always find
followers. All these religions that exist are nothing but different
versions of the same story. Nobody has seen God, but by torturing
yourself you become a saint. And then it looks foolish to say that this
torturing has been useless... I have not seen God. Now it is better to
keep quiet. You have become so respectable – God or no God. You were of
no use, worthless, nobody ever respected you; now thousands of people
respect you. It is better to keep quiet and enjoy the
respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>Logic, argument, philosophy, in the hands of cunning and clever
people, can create all kinds of virtues and moralities in which you
cannot see what is moral. But they can give evidence, and they can
always bring witnesses to say, “Yes. It is happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hindu monks use a wooden sandal. It is very torturous because it has
no support – you have to hold it between your big toe and your second
toe. It is heavy and walking becomes unnecessary torture. But ask the
Hindu monks, “Why are you doing it when more comfortable, convenient
sandals are possible?”</p><p>One great Hindu saint, Karpatri, told me that there is a secret in
it. I said, “What is the secret?” He said, “The secret is that it keeps
a man celibate.”</p><p>I said, “Great! The wooden sandal?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t understand. There is a nerve in your big toe that
controls your sexuality.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Now, man’s whole physiology has been completely explored –
there is no nerve there which controls sexuality. You can even cut the
whole leg off, then too sexuality will not be controlled.” But millions
of Hindu monks believe in it. And there is another thing: every Hindu
wears a sacred thread around his neck; and when he goes to the urinal,
he has to put that thread around his ear.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the shankaracharya of Dwarika – I was staying in Dwarika – “I
don’t see the point.” I had to ask him because he himself had made a man
look so foolish amongst the people<span class=s4></span>A young</p><p>man had stood up and he wanted to ask something, but the
shankaracharya said, “Before you ask anything, answer my few questions.”
The man was wearing Western dress – long pants, a coat, and a tie – and
that had infuriated the shankaracharya.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked, “Do you have the Hindu thread, the sacred thread, inside
your shirt or not?” The man said, “No, I don’t have it.”</p><p>The shankaracharya was very angry, and he said, “The moment you stood
up, I knew – with those kinds of clothes, you must be urinating standing
up and that is against Hinduism. First get a sacred thread. Change this
dress, and when you are urinating put the thread round your ear.” The
people laughed and the poor man looked stupid among those idiots.</p><p><br></p><p>I had just heard about it, so I asked him, “What is the science of
your sacred thread? And in what way is it spiritual to put it around
your ear while urinating?”</p><p><br></p><p>The same answer<span class=s4></span>that in the ear there is a
nerve which controls your sexuality. So when you wind</p><p>the sacred thread round and round the ear, that nerve is caught. It
helps a man to remain celibate.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of Hindus believe this. And it is not only Hindus – in every
religion you will find the same kind of stupid ideas have been
propagated for thousands of years. Nobody raises any question because
nobody wants to fall apart from the crowd, lose the respect of the
crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>And the crowd can be very nasty; it can misbehave with the person.
The person may have to lose his job. Even his family will become against
him; his own friends will turn their backs on him. He will become lonely
in the very crowd, and condemned. But if he were doing those stupid
things that the crowd believes have some spirituality in them, some
virtue in them, the crowd would have been respectful.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I see, to be respectable in this society means you are
cunning, means you are a hypocrite. It means that just to remain
respectable you are pretending many things, which you know perfectly
well are just either useless or stupid or even harmful.</p><p>AND WHEN I LIVED AMONG THEM I LIVED ABOVE THEM. THEY GREW ANGRY WITH
ME FOR</p><p>THAT. I know it from my own experience. I have made so many religious
people angry around the world – religious heads, saints, sages – just
for the simple reason that I showed them that what they understand as
character, as virtue, as religion, is mostly rubbish. They don’t have
any answer. Their answer is anger; but anger is not an argument. It does
not prove anything – in fact it disproves. If you become angry, that
simply shows that you have been exposed; and you don’t have any
evidence, any proof, any rationality in your actions.</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN I LIVED AMONG THEM I LIVED ABOVE THEM. THEY GREW ANGRY WITH
ME FOR THAT.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY DID NOT WANT TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE WAS WALKING OVER THEIR HEADS;
AND SO THEY PUT WOOD AND DIRT AND RUBBISH BETWEEN THEIR HEADS AND
ME.</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY MUFFLED THE SOUND OF MY STEPS: AND FROM THEN ON THE MOST
SCHOLARLY HEARD ME THE WORST.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT I WALK ABOVE THEIR HEADS WITH MY THOUGHTS IN SPITE OF THAT; AND
EVEN IF I SHOULD WALK UPON MY OWN FAULTS, I SHOULD STILL BE ABOVE THEM
AND THEIR HEADS.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR MEN ARE NOT EQUAL.</p><p><br></p><p>This is such a great statement. Particularly today, because communism
has made it almost universally accepted that all men are equal. And it
is not right at all: not even two men are equal.</p><p><br></p><p>Equality is a false idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man is unique.</p><p><br></p><p>He is a category in himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I conceive that everybody should be given equal opportunity to grow
in his uniqueness, but no men are equal. Equality is our contemporary
superstition – the latest and the most widely accepted, even by those
who are not communists. They have also accepted it, because they have
not denied it.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the non-communists don’t have the guts to say that men are not
equal, because they are afraid that the crowds will be angry. Crowds are
very happy to know that men are equal, that you are equal to Albert
Einstein, that you are equal to Bertrand Russell, that you are equal to
Martin Buber, that you are equal to Jean-Paul Sartre. The masses are
very happy with the idea. It is so ego-fulfilling that even those who
are not communists are afraid to say that men are not equal. But I am
absolutely in agreement with Zarathustra: men are not equal.</p><p><br></p><p>THUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. AND WHAT I DESIRE they MAY NOT DESIRE! My
likings are different, your likings are different; my talents are
different, your talents are different; my destiny is only my destiny,
your destiny is only your destiny. In fact, only cattle are equal. Man
is the only being on the earth who has uniqueness. But you will create
anger in them.…</p><p>When I said, twenty years ago, that men are not equal, the Communist
party of India passed a resolution against me, condemning me. And the
president of the Communist party of India, S.A. Dange, declared that
soon his son-in-law, who is a professor, is going to write a book to
confute my idea that men are not equal. He has written a book against
me; although there is no argument except anger, abuse and lies – but not
a single argument to prove that men are equal.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is right: THUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. I have my own conception
of a better society: it will provide equal opportunity to all, but the
equal opportunity will be for them to be unequal, to grow in their
uniqueness.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, communism means equal opportunity for all, not equality of
man. Zarathustra had the insight twenty-five centuries ago. It is
absolutely just and fair that man should not be sacrificed again in the
name of equality. He has been sacrificed many times, in different names,
in different temples, before different gods. Now he is being sacrificed
in the temple of communism – before a holy book, DAS KAPITAL, before a
trinity of gods, Marx, Engels and Lenin.</p><p><br></p><p>It is such a simple thing; everybody knows that nobody is equal. But
man’s jealousy... jealousy of the small man against the great, jealousy
of the little ones against the giants, makes them shout loudly – and of
course they are in the majority – that man is equal, and equality is
man’s birthright. And they know not that they are saying something which
is synonymous to committing suicide. Equal opportunity to grow is
perfectly right. And the acceptance of the uniqueness of individuals
makes the society rich, gives it the variety of all kinds of flowers, of
different colors, with different fragrances.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is rare, in the sense that he has seen faraway things,
because nobody was talking about equality of man in his day. Marx was
yet to come, after twenty-four centuries. But the more meditative you
are, the more silent, the clearer becomes your vision, and it can see
far away in the future. This statement is against Karl Marx; although
Zarathustra is not aware of any Karl Marx in particular.</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Marx was just a scholar and nothing else. He spent his whole
life in the library of the British Museum. He was there before the
library opened, and he was almost pushed out, every day, when the
library closed – and sometimes even carried out, because in his old age
he would continue reading and reading, and he would become unconscious.
By the time the library was going to be closed they would find that his
head was on the table and he was unconscious. He had to be carried out
and an ambulance called to take him home. And tomorrow morning he was
back again. A perfect scholar! Not metaphorically, but really a
bookworm. All his experience was only with books – not with people, not
with existence, not with himself.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR MEN ARE NOT EQUAL: THUS SPEAKS JUSTICE. AND WHAT I DESIRE THEY

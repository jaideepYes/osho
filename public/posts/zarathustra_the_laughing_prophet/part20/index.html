ON THE CONTRARY, HE LAY STILL WITH CLOSED EYES\nLIKE A SLEEPER, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT ASLEEP: FOR HE WAS CONVERSING WITH HIS SOUL. THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE, HOWEVER, WHEN THEY FOUND HIM THUS SILENT, RESPECTED THE GREAT STILLNESS AROUND HIM AND DISCREETLY WITHDREW.\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nThere are many beautiful parables in the ancient literature. People have enjoyed them, but have rarely understood them. A parable is something like poetry; it is more symbolic. One has to dig deep to find the treasure hidden in it. Apparently, it is only a story and it appears that it is only for entertainment, but this is not true.\nThe ancient parables of Panch Tantra, or the parables in the life of Gautam Buddha, or the parables of Aesop in the West, all have tremendous spiritual significance. They have been written in such a way, or told in such a way that even children can enjoy them – but to find their meaning, a sage is needed.\nIt was just an old device used when there were no written books, when writing was not yet invented, and things had to be told from the teacher to the disciple. The parable greatly served the purpose, because it can be easily remembered, and because it has many layers of meaning – at least at the lowest everybody can remember it.\nAt its highest, only those who have that quality of consciousnessFor example, all these parables\nare based on dialogues between animals, or between animals and man. And we know that animals don’t speak. Still, around the world the same pattern has been followed; and great truths have been expressed through the animals.\nThe animal is a symbol of absolute innocence. Even a child is not so innocent; even a child starts becoming diplomatic, political from the very beginning, because he’s surrounded by an atmosphere which contaminates his consciousness.\nThe smallest child will smile at the mother – not that he really feels like smiling; his smile is no different from the smile of Jimmy Carter – he knows that by smiling he persuades the mother. His smiling is diplomatic; it is not from his heart. It is not that he is very happy, seeing the mother, but he depends on the mother. His whole nourishment is in the hands of the mother – he has to keep her happy. He smiles, not without some reason – his smile is not innocent.\nIn the parables animals have been used because they are absolutely uncontaminated by human cunningness, diplomacy, and dirty politics. They are absolutely simple and innocent. They represent innocence – an innocence which, even though it may not speak, its very presence radiates truth. Today’s fragment on Zarathustra starts with a small parable.\nONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS CAVE, ZARATHUSTRA PASSES\nTHROUGH A PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS WHEN HE IS AS DEAD. In parables everything has to be searched, because one never knows where the meaning has been hidden in its words. For example: ZARATHUSTRA PASSES THROUGH A PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS. Seven days are symbolic and significant; they are symbolic of the seven stages of human consciousness. For centuries the so- called crowd of humanity has known only one stage, in which we live – the so-called consciousness.\nIt was only in this century in the West that Sigmund Freud and his colleagues introduced the very shocking idea of the unconscious mind – because he was working with dreams, with hypnosis, with analysis, and he found a great unconscious space in man, of which he is not aware; although it affects his actions, his ideas, his behavior, his whole life-style.\nSigmund Freud became more interested in your unconsciousness than in what you call your consciousness because your consciousness, he found, is not reliable. You lie, and you lie so sincerely that it is very difficult to detect it. You don’t even know that you are lying. You have become so habituated to lying that it appears to you that you are telling the truth.\nBut when you are asleep you are beyond the control of all the religions, of all so-called moralities, societies, cultures, civilizations. Suddenly you are more authentic. Your dreams say much truer things about you than you say yourself. You may even contradict them; you may find it very difficult to believe that this has come from your own unconscious.\nSigmund Freud brought to the light one more stage of your consciousness which he called the unconscious mind. His disciple and later on his rival, Carl Gustav Jung, tried going even deeper than the unconscious, and discovered that everybody is carrying within his being a collective unconscious – which is not his, which belongs to thousands of years, which carries the whole past in it.\nIt was even more shocking: we are not aware that we are carrying the whole history of humanity. But in the East we have been aware of these stages: the unconscious, the collective unconscious, and one more, which perhaps soon the West will have to find – the universal unconscious. The collective unconscious is concerned only with humanity; the universal unconscious is concerned with the whole universe. You are not only carrying, in subtle forms, the whole history of mankind, you are carrying within you the whole history of the universe itself.\nThese are the three stages below your so-called conscious mind. I am calling it so-called because in the East we have found the real conscious mind. The so-called conscious mind is only utilitarian – a small part which is useful for day to day work, but it cannot give you a glimpse of the truth.\nJust as these are the stages below your conscious mind, the East has been aware of a similar three stages above your conscious mind. And that seems very rational and very scientific, because it balances you. The East, for at least twenty-five centuries, has been absolutely aware that above your conscious mind is the superconscious mind, and above the superconscious mind is the collective superconscious mind, and above the collective superconscious mind is the universal superconscious mind.\nThese seven stages have been referred in many ways, but in Zarathustra’s parable his being for seven days in a strange state which looked as if he is almost dead – he was alive... he passed through all these seven stages, from the lowest to the highest. He discovered his whole rainbow of consciousness – the seven colors, the whole spectrum. And when he awoke after seven days he was not the old Zarathustra. The superman had arrived, who was fully conscious of his whole being. There was not even a small corner within him anymore which was dark. All was light. And this is what has been referred to as self-knowledge, or enlightenment, or awakening to your ultimate reality.\nWHEN HE FINALLY COMES TO HIMSELF, HE FINDS HE IS SURROUNDED BY FRUITS AND SWEET-SMELLING HERBS BROUGHT TO HIM BY HIS ANIMALS.\nPerhaps animals can fall in rapport with a man who is aware of his whole being; no language is needed. But they were taking care of Zarathustra. They had brought fruits and herbs and they were waiting for his awakening.\nON SEEING HIM AWAKE, HIS ANIMALS ASK ZARATHUSTRA IF HE WOULD NOT NOW STEP OUT INTO THE WORLD WHICH IS WAITING FOR HIM.\nNow he’s ready. The thing for which he was waiting has happened to him. He has arrived to the optimum awakening. It is time: go down to man; they are groping in darkness.\n’THE WIND IS LADEN WITH HEAVY FRAGRANCE THAT LONGS FOR YOU AND ALL THE\nBROOKS WOULD LIKE TO RUN AFTER YOU,’ THEY TELL HIM. The parable indicates one significant thing: a man like Zarathustra can be understood only by innocence. Not by the knowledgeable, not by the scholars, not by those who have lost themselves in beautiful words and theories and philosophies, but by those who are utterly silent.\n’FOR BEHOLD, O ZARATHUSTRA! NEW LYRES ARE NEEDED FOR YOUR NEW SONGS. You\nare no longer the old Zarathustra who had gone to sleep. In these seven days you have died and you have resurrected; you are an absolutely new man. You will need new lyres for your new songs.\nSING AND BUBBLE OVER, O ZARATHUSTRA, HEAL YOUR SOUL WITH NEW SONGS, SO THAT YOU MAY BEAR YOUR GREAT DESTINY, THAT WAS NEVER YET THE DESTINY OF ANY MAN!\nFOR YOUR ANIMALS WELL KNOW, O ZARATHUSTRA, WHO YOU ARE AND MUST BECOME: BEHOLD, YOU ARE THE TEACHER OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE, THAT IS NOW YOUR DESTINY!’\nThis concept of eternal recurrence has to be understood. This is one of the most significant contributions of Zarathustra to humanity. There are religions which believe that there is only one life: Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism. They think life begins when you are born and ends when you die. Of course your soul does not end, but you will not have another life. Your soul will be presented before God to be judged.\nThe three other religions, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, believe in reincarnation – man goes on being born. Just as Charles Darwin thinks that man has evolved out of the chimpanzees, or apes, or monkeys, these three religions, for centuries, have believed that man’s soul has been passing through different forms according to his actions. And man is the highest form that human consciousness comes to, but it has been moving from other animals.\nPerhaps the differences in human beings are based on their coming through different sources: somebody’s soul has moved from the elephants, somebody’s soul has moved from the lions, somebody’s soul has moved from the eagles. Naturally, they will be carrying some characteristics of their past life. And there is not only one past life, there are thousands of past lives. You have moved from one animal to another, each higher than the first.\nAnd man is not the end. Just as you have been transcending other animals, one day you have to transcend man, too. The idea of evolution is not new; it has dominated the whole East for as far back as there are any references available. Man has been moving on from lower forms of animals to higher forms. This is called the theory of reincarnation.\nZarathustra has a third concept, and he’s the only one as far as the theory of recurrence is concerned. But his theory has something beautiful about it, and it has to be understood without any prejudice. Just as seasons move: after summer come the rains, after rains comes the winter, after winter comes the summer – it is a circle. Zarathustra says, just like modern science, that everything moves in a circle. The earth goes around the sun, and the sun itself is going around some sun about which science has only guesswork. We have not yet been able to discover that faraway sun, around which our sun is moving. And all the stars are moving in circles. The circle seems to be the natural way of movement.\nZarathustra says, “Consciousness, life, everything moves in a circle. It recurs again and again.” When for the first time you understand him, it feels very strange. What he is saying, in other words, is that we have met in this Chuang Tzu Hall millions of times before, and I have been saying the same things to you – and this is not the first time you have laughed. And this will go on eternally, again and again, in Chuang Tzu Hall. The same people will be meeting, and talking, and laughing, and singing, and there will not be even a little difference.\nHis idea is strange, but looking at the circular movement in existence everywhere, there is a possibility that howsoever crazy it may seem, Zarathustra may be right. For eternity... the circle may be very big, it may be repeated after millions of years, but he insists that there is recurrence. What you see today has been there millions of times, and will be there millions of times again.\nThe animals say to him, “Zarathustra, now go to man. This is going to be your destiny: to teach them the philosophy of recurrence. This is what you have discovered in these seven days. This is what you have come to know in these seven days’ absolute silence.” There is no way to refute, and there is no way to support. I will not say he is right, I will not say he is wrong. All that I can say is that he has a great idea – unique, original. Nobody has talked about it before and nobody has ever dared again – because people laugh at it.\nBut this is the law of life: the fall comes and the leaves fall from the trees; and new leaves replace them, and again the fall comes – and the same thing happens again. Every morning the sun rises, and every evening it sets; every day you are hungry, and every day you are thirsty. Just look at your life, and you will find you are moving in circles; every day is a circle. Just like the clock, the hands of your life go on moving in a circle. They pass through the same territory.\nPerhaps Zarathustra has seen a glimpse of something which has yet to be decided whether it is true or not. But for twenty-five centuries people have ignored it. They have not even discussed it. That is ugly. You can deny a doctrine, you can say it is not true, you can give proofs why it is not true – that is acceptable. Or, you may prove it right, and give arguments and proofs and evidence. But to ignore it, what could be the psychology behind it?\nMy own understanding is that man is afraid to talk about it. Man is afraid because, who knows? – it may be true. It is better not to talk about such things, because if it is true it will change your whole\nlife’s values. You will have to think anew about everything, because you will be getting the same wife, the same children, the same parents again and again and again. And there is no end to it. It will create really a great boredom if somebody proves it right. Perhaps out of fear people have ignored it.\nNobody has given any reasons against or for. I can only say one thing: the idea is immensely original and should be respected, should be discussed, should be explored. There is every possibility that it may be true. But by ignoring it, you are behaving like the ostrich. Just by closing your eyes it does not mean that the world has disappeared.\n’THAT YOU HAVE TO BE THE FIRST TO TEACH THIS DOCTRINE – HOW SHOULD THIS GREAT\nDESTINY NOT ALSO BE YOUR GREATEST DANGER! This is going to be your destiny, to teach this doctrine. But this is also going to be your great danger, because nobody is going to like it. Nobody is going even to hear it. It will shake their foundations of life. It will create such great phobia: “My God, I will have eternally to be married to the same woman. I was thinking that it is only a question of one life. Somehow much has passed, a little bit remains – that too will pass – but eternally?”\nYou can say that you can divorce now, but that will not make any difference to the doctrine – that simply means you will have to divorce her again. Whatever you are going through, you will have to go through millions of times, eternally. This is the wheel of life that will go on moving.\nSo the animals say to him, “This is your great destiny, because you are the first man to teach this doctrine. But remember this is your great danger, too, because nobody’s going to like the idea.”\nIt is terrifying, if you think over it in the night, lying down in your bed in the darkness, “My God, again and again, in the same room, on the same bed... millions of times I have been lying on this bed, and still millions of times more?” In fact, there is no end to it... forever and forever. You may have nightmares. It is a nightmare if it is true – an eternal nightmare that goes on repeating.\nBut my own experience is that Zarathustra is using it just as a device – a great device to make you utterly bored, so that you have to do something to jump out of the wheel of recurrence. If you don’t do anything, then mechanically you will go on moving in the wheel.\nYou have to do some conscious act to attain freedom – freedom from the clutches of the eternal law of recurrence. And I think the device is great. If you understand that this is going to be so, then something has to be done right now to get out of the way, to become an exception to the law. Perhaps that is the hidden intention of Zarathustra.\nThe theory of recurrence may not be true, but it can be used as a great device for people to go beyond themselves. It can create the right atmosphere for transformation. I would support the theory of recurrence for the simple reason that it can make you think again: don’t repeat anything in this life; start changing from today. Learn not to repeat, so that one day you can be out of the mechanical recurrence.\nBut people go on repeating the same thing, sometimes in spite of themselves. So many people have told me they want to stop smoking. I said, “Then who is preventing you? At least I’m not preventing you. Why are you bothering me? If I want to start smoking I will not ask anybody. If I have not started smoking it is not because somebody advised me. Who is preventing you? you want to stop.”\nThey feel shocked, because they were thinking I would show sympathy. They say, “We have tried many times but again and again the urge comes with such force that we forget all our decisions. We forget all our willpower, and we start even arguing in favor of smoking: just one cigarette, once in a while, cannot be so harmful. But one cigarette brings another in.”\nJust look at your life. If you are repetitive in your life, perhaps you will be repetitive on a larger scale – what Zarathustra calls recurrence. You commit the same mistakes again and again. You get angry and you repent, and your repentance is not going to prevent you because it is a pattern. First you get angry, then you repent, then you get angry again, then you repent.The repentance is really to\nerase the feeling of guilt that you became angry – now you are again ready to be angry, the guilt is gone.\nIt happened once: Ramakrishna was asked by a man, “I’m going to Varanasi.” Every twelve years\npeople gather near the Ganges to have a holy dip, and Hindus believe that whatever sins you have committed in twelve years are washed out – just one dip. It is a very cold season, and the water is ice-cold, coming directly from the Himalayan ice. So even one dip is enough to freeze your blood, and people jump out. But now for twelve years they are again free to commit the same things. After twelve years they will come again.\nThis man was going to take a holy dip, and he was a devotee of Ramakrishna, so he went just to touch his feet and to get his blessings. Ramakrishna said, “Where are you going?” He said, “I am going for a holy dip.”\nRamakrishna said, “If you are going, very good. You can take one dip for me too, because I am not going; the water is too cold. And anyway, I have not committed any sin, so why unnecessarily harass the Ganges, where so many people are. And I am also afraid: I have not committed any sin, and so many people are throwing their sins into the Gangesentering into the Ganges is dangerous –\nsome sins may get stuck to me. So you can take one dip for me too.”\nThe man said, “Are you kidding or what?”Ramakrishna said, “To tell you the truth... but I’m not preventing you. Have you seen those big trees standing by the side of the Ganges?”\nHe said, “Yes, because twelve years ago I went for the holy dip, and I saw really big trees, huge trees.”\nRamakrishna said, “Do you know their purpose, why they are standing there?” He said, “How am I supposed to know the purpose of the trees, why they are standing there? Today you are in a strange mood.”\nRamakrishna said, “I will tell you their purpose. When you take the dip it is not the Ganges that the sins are worried about, it is the coldness of the water. So they jump out, sit on the trees and wait for you. How long can you remain in the Ganges?”\nThe man said, “How long? I cannot remain for more than two minutes; the water is too cold.”\nSo Ramakrishna said, “Yes, as you come out they jump back on you. And remember, sometimes it happens that somebody else’s sins may also jump on you. Seeing that a very good guyjust for a\nchange; they have tortured somebody enough, now torture this fellow. So be very alert; when you are passing under those trees, be careful!”\nHe said, “How I can be careful? – because I don’t see anything. I don’t see the sins.” Ramakrishna said, “It is up to you. It is a very dangerous thing that you are doing. If you hear me, think it over. There is no hurry; you can go tomorrow. The Ganges will be there, and those trees will be there.”\nThe man remained awake the whole night. He thought again and again, and the idea looked meaningful – although it was a pure device; there was no truth in it.\nNeither is there is any truth in the idea that by taking a dip in the Ganges your sins are washed away. If it was so cheap then you could do every kind of thing you wanted to do for twelve years, and then after twelve years just for one day go to the Ganges, and take a dip.\nAnd particularly now there is no need even to go to the Ganges. The Ganges water can be supplied by pipes throughout the country. So just in your bathroom, take a shower. And why wait for twelve years? Every day keep yourself fresh for new sins to commit.\nDevices can be helpful. And devices need not be true or false; if they are helpful they are true. And I say, the theory of recurrence can be of immense help to many people; hence it has a truth.\n’BEHOLD, WE KNOW WHAT YOU TEACH: THAT ALL THINGS RECUR ETERNALLY AND WE OURSELVES WITH THEM, AND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXISTED AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE AND ALL THINGS WITH US.\n’YOU TEACH THAT THERE IS A GREAT YEAR OF BECOMING, A COLOSSUS OF A YEAR: THIS YEAR MUST, LIKE AN HOUR-GLASS, TURN ITSELF OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN, SO THAT IT MAY RUN DOWN AND RUN OUT ANEW.\nYou have seen an ancient device for measuring time. Just a glass made in the shape of a drum is filled with sand, and the sand goes on falling through slowly, slowly. The passage is very narrow. In one hour the upper glass is empty; the lower glass is full. And the device is made in such a way that when the upper glass is empty, completely empty, the lower glass moves up and the upper glass moves down. Again, the same sand, the same glass and the same recurrence.\nThe animals are saying...\nLIKE AN HOUR-GLASS, TURN ITSELF OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN, SO THAT IT MAY RUN DOWN AND RUN OUT ANEW:\n’SO THAT ALL THESE YEARS RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER, IN THE GREATEST THINGS AND IN THE SMALLEST, SO THAT WE OURSELVES RESEMBLE OURSELVES IN EACH GREAT YEAR, IN THE GREATEST THINGS AND IN THE SMALLEST.\n’AND IF YOU SHOULD DIE NOW, O ZARATHUSTRA: BEHOLD, WE KNOW TOO WHAT YOU WOULD THEN SAY TO YOURSELF – BUT YOUR ANIMALS ASK YOU NOT TO DIE YET!\n’YOU WOULD SAY – AND WITHOUT TREMBLING, BUT RATHER GASPING FOR HAPPINESS: FOR A GREAT WEIGHT AND OPPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM YOU, MOST PATIENT OF MEN!\n’“NOW I DIE AND DECAY,” YOU WOULD SAY, “AND IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE NOTHINGNESS. SOULS ARE AS MORTAL AS BODIES.\n’“BUT THE COMPLEX OF CAUSES IN WHICH I AM ENTANGLED WILL RECUR – IT WILL CREATE ME AGAIN! I MYSELF AM PART OF THESE CAUSES OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE.\n’“I SHALL RETURN, WITH THIS SUN, WITH THIS EARTH, WITH THIS EAGLE, WITH THIS SERPENT – NOT TO A NEW LIFE OR A BETTER LIFE OR A SIMILAR LIFE:\n’“I SHALL RETURN ETERNALLY TO THIS IDENTICAL AND SELF-SAME LIFE, IN THE GREATEST THINGS AND IN THE SMALLEST, TO TEACH ONCE MORE THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS,\n’“TO SPEAK ONCE MORE THE TEACHINGS OF THE GREAT NOONTIDE OF EARTH AND MAN, TO TELL MAN OF THE SUPERMAN ONCE MORE.\n’“I SPOKE MY TEACHING, I BROKE UPON MY TEACHING: THUS MY ETERNAL FATE WILL HAVE IT – AS PROPHET DO I PERISH!\n‘“NOW THE HOUR HAS COME WHEN HE WHO IS GOING DOWN SHALL BLESS HIMSELF. THUS – ENDS ZARATHUSTRA’S DOWN-GOING.”’\nWHEN THE ANIMALS HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THEY FELL SILENT AND EXPECTED THAT ZARATHUSTRA WOULD SAY SOMETHING TO THEM: BUT ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT HEAR THAT THEY WERE SILENT. ON THE CONTRARY, HE LAY STILL WITH CLOSED EYES LIKE A SLEEPER, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT ASLEEP: FOR HE WAS CONVERSING WITH HIS SOUL. THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE, HOWEVER, WHEN THEY FOUND HIM THUS SILENT, RESPECTED THE GREAT STILLNESS AROUND HIM AND DISCREETLY WITHDREW.\nHearing the animals is symbolic. It means as if the universal life, the anima itself, spoke to Zarathustra: “This is your destiny, to go to men and to teach them the theory of eternal recurrence. But remember, your destiny is also very dangerous.” Listening to these animals Zarathustra closed his eyes, and it seemed as if he had fallen asleep. But he was not asleep. He was in deep meditation, consulting with his own soul. About what was he consulting with his own soul?\n“Is it the right hour for me to take this dangerous path and to go to men, whom I know perfectly well are deaf and blind and are not going to see any truth, and are not going to listen about any truth? Is it time for me? Has my hour come? Is it the noontide I have been waiting for? If the hour has come then I will take the challenge and I will go to men – to be laughed at or to be crucified, but I will deliver the message that existence itself has given to me.\n“These animals, who have never spoken, who never speak, seem to have become vehicles of existence, and what they are saying is absolutely true. This is my finding. In those seven days\nI have come across the discovery of eternal recurrence. But the question is, is the time ripe? – because I don’t want to reach humanity before the right time. I want to reach exactly at the time when at least a few people will be ready to hear me, and to understand me.”\nThat’s what he was conversing about with his own soul. And the parable ends with a beautiful and graceful expression of his animals. The serpent and the eagle, seeing him silent... RESPECTED THE GREAT STILLNESS THAT WAS SURROUNDING HIM AND DISCREETLY WITHDREW. Even\nman is not so discreet, is not so respectful of the silence of a master, of the silence of the meditator.\nI am reminded of one instance of this century. One of the greatest enlightened men was Raman Maharshi, in South India, on the mountain of Arunachal. He was not a man of many words; he was not very educated either. He was only seventeen when he escaped into the mountains in search of himself. He was a very silent man, and people used to go particularly to have a taste of his silence.\nOne thing very miraculous was watched by every comer: whenever he sat in the veranda of the temple, waiting for people who wanted to sit with him in silence, a cow used to come without fail, exactly at the right time. She would sit there, and people could not believe it: “What kind of cow is that?” And when Raman Maharshi moved inside his room, and everybody dispersed, the cow would come close to the window and put her head inside – just to say goodbye, every day. And then she would go back. Then tomorrow she would come again.\nIt went on continually for years. But one day she did not turn up, and Raman Maharshi said, “She must be either very ill or she must be dead. I must go in search of her.”\nThe people said, “It doesn’t look right for a man of your heights to go in search of a cow.” But Raman Maharshi did not listen to the people, he went. People followed, and the cow was found. She had fallen in a ditch.\nShe had become old. She was coming, she was on the way, but she had slipped and had fallen into the ditch.\nBut she was still alive, and as Raman Maharshi reached her, sat by her side, the cow had tears in her eyes. And she put her head into Raman Maharshi’s lap and died.\nRaman Maharshi told his people,“A great temple should be made in her memory here, because she has died enlightened – she will not be born even as a human being.” And even today the temple stands there, with a statue of the cow inside.\nPerhaps we have not made much effort to communicate with animals, with trees, with mountains, with rivers. Certainly their language cannot be our language; some other ways have to be found. But in silence many people have experienced a harmony with the trees, with the animals, with the birds.\nSo it is not only a parable, it is also an indication of a possibility for the future. Man just has to explore... there is so much to explore! But we are engaged in trivia. We are not concerned with the real and great values of life. We are not concerned even with life itself and its different forms. All these are different forms of the same life which we are made of – the same stuff. There must be some way of communion.\nZarathustra was in silence, conversing with himself, searching for a decision to go down from the mountains, from the animals and their innocence to the men who are full of self-conceit and cunningness and who think that they know, although they know nothing.\nThis fragment does not say what was the conclusion of the communion with his own soul, but the coming fragment is concerned with his going down from the mountains to humanity. So it must have been that he had heard the still, small voice of his own soul, saying, “Don’t hesitate. It is a difficult destiny and dangerous too, but you have to go, because whatever you have known and seen and experienced, you have to share it.”\nEternal recurrence can become a great blessing if people understand it and start changing their life from the mechanical to a more conscious and alert awareness. It is possible, because it has happened to many people. It can happen to everybody. The only question is to gather courage and to accept the challenge.\nSomewhere else Zarathustra says, “Unless you gather courage to transcend yourself and your mechanicalness, your robot-like behavior, the superman, which is going to be your fulfillment, cannot be born.”\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5984","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/>Zarathustra.

have enjoyed them, but have rarely understood them. A parable is
something like poetry; it is more symbolic. One has to dig deep to find
the treasure hidden in it. Apparently, it is only a story and it appears
that it is only for entertainment, but this is not true.</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient parables of Panch Tantra, or the parables in the life of
Gautam Buddha, or the parables of Aesop in the West, all have tremendous
spiritual significance. They have been written in such a way, or told in
such a way that even children can enjoy them – but to find their
meaning, a sage is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just an old device used when there were no written books, when
writing was not yet invented, and things had to be told from the teacher
to the disciple. The parable greatly served the purpose, because it can
be easily remembered, and because it has many layers of meaning – at
least at the lowest everybody can remember it.</p><p><br></p><p>At its highest, only those who have that quality of
consciousness<span class=s4></span>For example, all these parables</p><p>are based on dialogues between animals, or between animals and man.
And we know that animals don’t speak. Still, around the world the same
pattern has been followed; and great truths have been expressed through
the animals.</p><p><br></p><p>The animal is a symbol of absolute innocence. Even a child is not so
innocent; even a child starts becoming diplomatic, political from the
very beginning, because he’s surrounded by an atmosphere which
contaminates his consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The smallest child will smile at the mother – not that he really
feels like smiling; his smile is no different from the smile of Jimmy
Carter – he knows that by smiling he persuades the mother. His smiling
is diplomatic; it is not from his heart. It is not that he is very
happy, seeing the mother, but he depends on the mother. His whole
nourishment is in the hands of the mother – he has to keep her happy. He
smiles, not without some reason – his smile is not innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>In the parables animals have been used because they are absolutely
uncontaminated by human cunningness, diplomacy, and dirty politics. They
are absolutely simple and innocent. They represent innocence – an
innocence which, even though it may not speak, its very presence
radiates truth. Today’s fragment on Zarathustra starts with a small
parable.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE MORNING NOT LONG AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS CAVE, ZARATHUSTRA
PASSES</p><p>THROUGH A PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS WHEN HE IS AS DEAD. In parables
everything has to be searched, because one never knows where the meaning
has been hidden in its words. For example: ZARATHUSTRA PASSES THROUGH A
PERIOD OF SEVEN DAYS. Seven days are symbolic and significant; they are
symbolic of the seven stages of human consciousness. For centuries the
so- called crowd of humanity has known only one stage, in which we live
– the so-called consciousness.</p><p>It was only in this century in the West that Sigmund Freud and his
colleagues introduced the very shocking idea of the unconscious mind –
because he was working with dreams, with hypnosis, with analysis, and he
found a great unconscious space in man, of which he is not aware;
although it affects his actions, his ideas, his behavior, his whole
life-style.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigmund Freud became more interested in your unconsciousness than in
what you call your consciousness because your consciousness, he found,
is not reliable. You lie, and you lie so sincerely that it is very
difficult to detect it. You don’t even know that you are lying. You have
become so habituated to lying that it appears to you that you are
telling the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you are asleep you are beyond the control of all the
religions, of all so-called moralities, societies, cultures,
civilizations. Suddenly you are more authentic. Your dreams say much
truer things about you than you say yourself. You may even contradict
them; you may find it very difficult to believe that this has come from
your own unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Sigmund Freud brought to the light one more stage of your
consciousness which he called the unconscious mind. His disciple and
later on his rival, Carl Gustav Jung, tried going even deeper than the
unconscious, and discovered that everybody is carrying within his being
a collective unconscious – which is not his, which belongs to thousands
of years, which carries the whole past in it.</p><p><br></p><p>It was even more shocking: we are not aware that we are carrying the
whole history of humanity. But in the East we have been aware of these
stages: the unconscious, the collective unconscious, and one more, which
perhaps soon the West will have to find – the universal unconscious. The
collective unconscious is concerned only with humanity; the universal
unconscious is concerned with the whole universe. You are not only
carrying, in subtle forms, the whole history of mankind, you are
carrying within you the whole history of the universe itself.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the three stages below your so-called conscious mind. I am
calling it so-called because in the East we have found the real
conscious mind. The so-called conscious mind is only utilitarian – a
small part which is useful for day to day work, but it cannot give you a
glimpse of the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as these are the stages below your conscious mind, the East has
been aware of a similar three stages above your conscious mind. And that
seems very rational and very scientific, because it balances you. The
East, for at least twenty-five centuries, has been absolutely aware that
above your conscious mind is the superconscious mind, and above the
superconscious mind is the collective superconscious mind, and above the
collective superconscious mind is the universal superconscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>These seven stages have been referred in many ways, but in
Zarathustra’s parable his being for seven days in a strange state which
looked as if he is almost dead – he was alive... he passed through all
these seven stages, from the lowest to the highest. He discovered his
whole rainbow of consciousness – the seven colors, the whole spectrum.
And when he awoke after seven days he was not the old Zarathustra. The
superman had arrived, who was fully conscious of his whole being. There
was not even a small corner within him anymore which was dark. All was
light. And this is what has been referred to as self-knowledge, or
enlightenment, or awakening to your ultimate reality.</p><p>WHEN HE FINALLY COMES TO HIMSELF, HE FINDS HE IS SURROUNDED BY FRUITS
AND SWEET-SMELLING HERBS BROUGHT TO HIM BY HIS ANIMALS.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps animals can fall in rapport with a man who is aware of his
whole being; no language is needed. But they were taking care of
Zarathustra. They had brought fruits and herbs and they were waiting for
his awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>ON SEEING HIM AWAKE, HIS ANIMALS ASK ZARATHUSTRA IF HE WOULD NOT NOW
STEP OUT INTO THE WORLD WHICH IS WAITING FOR HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he’s ready. The thing for which he was waiting has happened to
him. He has arrived to the optimum awakening. It is time: go down to
man; they are groping in darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>’THE WIND IS LADEN WITH HEAVY FRAGRANCE THAT LONGS FOR YOU AND ALL
THE</p><p>BROOKS WOULD LIKE TO RUN AFTER YOU,’ THEY TELL HIM. The parable
indicates one significant thing: a man like Zarathustra can be
understood only by innocence. Not by the knowledgeable, not by the
scholars, not by those who have lost themselves in beautiful words and
theories and philosophies, but by those who are utterly silent.</p><p><br></p><p>’FOR BEHOLD, O ZARATHUSTRA! NEW LYRES ARE NEEDED FOR YOUR NEW SONGS.
You</p><p>are no longer the old Zarathustra who had gone to sleep. In these
seven days you have died and you have resurrected; you are an absolutely
new man. You will need new lyres for your new songs.</p><p><br></p><p>SING AND BUBBLE OVER, O ZARATHUSTRA, HEAL YOUR SOUL WITH NEW SONGS,
SO THAT YOU MAY BEAR YOUR GREAT DESTINY, THAT WAS NEVER YET THE DESTINY
OF ANY MAN!</p><p><br></p><p>FOR YOUR ANIMALS WELL KNOW, O ZARATHUSTRA, WHO YOU ARE AND MUST
BECOME: BEHOLD, YOU ARE THE TEACHER OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE, THAT IS
NOW YOUR DESTINY!’</p><p><br></p><p>This concept of eternal recurrence has to be understood. This is one
of the most significant contributions of Zarathustra to humanity. There
are religions which believe that there is only one life: Christianity,
Judaism, Mohammedanism. They think life begins when you are born and
ends when you die. Of course your soul does not end, but you will not
have another life. Your soul will be presented before God to be
judged.</p><p><br></p><p>The three other religions, Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, believe
in reincarnation – man goes on being born. Just as Charles Darwin thinks
that man has evolved out of the chimpanzees, or apes, or monkeys, these
three religions, for centuries, have believed that man’s soul has been
passing through different forms according to his actions. And man is the
highest form that human consciousness comes to, but it has been moving
from other animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the differences in human beings are based on their coming
through different sources: somebody’s soul has moved from the elephants,
somebody’s soul has moved from the lions, somebody’s soul has moved from
the eagles. Naturally, they will be carrying some characteristics of
their past life. And there is not only one past life, there are
thousands of past lives. You have moved from one animal to another, each
higher than the first.</p><p>And man is not the end. Just as you have been transcending other
animals, one day you have to transcend man, too. The idea of evolution
is not new; it has dominated the whole East for as far back as there are
any references available. Man has been moving on from lower forms of
animals to higher forms. This is called the theory of reincarnation.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has a third concept, and he’s the only one as far as the
theory of recurrence is concerned. But his theory has something
beautiful about it, and it has to be understood without any prejudice.
Just as seasons move: after summer come the rains, after rains comes the
winter, after winter comes the summer – it is a circle. Zarathustra
says, just like modern science, that everything moves in a circle. The
earth goes around the sun, and the sun itself is going around some sun
about which science has only guesswork. We have not yet been able to
discover that faraway sun, around which our sun is moving. And all the
stars are moving in circles. The circle seems to be the natural way of
movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, “Consciousness, life, everything moves in a circle.
It recurs again and again.” When for the first time you understand him,
it feels very strange. What he is saying, in other words, is that we
have met in this Chuang Tzu Hall millions of times before, and I have
been saying the same things to you – and this is not the first time you
have laughed. And this will go on eternally, again and again, in Chuang
Tzu Hall. The same people will be meeting, and talking, and laughing,
and singing, and there will not be even a little difference.</p><p><br></p><p>His idea is strange, but looking at the circular movement in
existence everywhere, there is a possibility that howsoever crazy it may
seem, Zarathustra may be right. For eternity... the circle may be very
big, it may be repeated after millions of years, but he insists that
there is recurrence. What you see today has been there millions of
times, and will be there millions of times again.</p><p><br></p><p>The animals say to him, “Zarathustra, now go to man. This is going to
be your destiny: to teach them the philosophy of recurrence. This is
what you have discovered in these seven days. This is what you have come
to know in these seven days’ absolute silence.” There is no way to
refute, and there is no way to support. I will not say he is right, I
will not say he is wrong. All that I can say is that he has a great idea
– unique, original. Nobody has talked about it before and nobody has
ever dared again – because people laugh at it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the law of life: the fall comes and the leaves fall from
the trees; and new leaves replace them, and again the fall comes – and
the same thing happens again. Every morning the sun rises, and every
evening it sets; every day you are hungry, and every day you are
thirsty. Just look at your life, and you will find you are moving in
circles; every day is a circle. Just like the clock, the hands of your
life go on moving in a circle. They pass through the same territory.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps Zarathustra has seen a glimpse of something which has yet to
be decided whether it is true or not. But for twenty-five centuries
people have ignored it. They have not even discussed it. That is ugly.
You can deny a doctrine, you can say it is not true, you can give proofs
why it is not true – that is acceptable. Or, you may prove it right, and
give arguments and proofs and evidence. But to ignore it, what could be
the psychology behind it?</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding is that man is afraid to talk about it. Man is
afraid because, who knows? – it may be true. It is better not to talk
about such things, because if it is true it will change your whole</p><p>life’s values. You will have to think anew about everything, because
you will be getting the same wife, the same children, the same parents
again and again and again. And there is no end to it. It will create
really a great boredom if somebody proves it right. Perhaps out of fear
people have ignored it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has given any reasons against or for. I can only say one
thing: the idea is immensely original and should be respected, should be
discussed, should be explored. There is every possibility that it may be
true. But by ignoring it, you are behaving like the ostrich. Just by
closing your eyes it does not mean that the world has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>’THAT YOU HAVE TO BE THE FIRST TO TEACH THIS DOCTRINE – HOW SHOULD
THIS GREAT</p><p>DESTINY NOT ALSO BE YOUR GREATEST DANGER! This is going to be your
destiny, to teach this doctrine. But this is also going to be your great
danger, because nobody is going to like it. Nobody is going even to hear
it. It will shake their foundations of life. It will create such great
phobia: “My God, I will have eternally to be married to the same woman.
I was thinking that it is only a question of one life. Somehow much has
passed, a little bit remains – that too will pass – but eternally?”</p><p><br></p><p>You can say that you can divorce now, but that will not make any
difference to the doctrine – that simply means you will have to divorce
her again. Whatever you are going through, you will have to go through
millions of times, eternally. This is the wheel of life that will go on
moving.</p><p><br></p><p>So the animals say to him, “This is your great destiny, because you
are the first man to teach this doctrine. But remember this is your
great danger, too, because nobody’s going to like the idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is terrifying, if you think over it in the night, lying down in
your bed in the darkness, “My God, again and again, in the same room, on
the same bed... millions of times I have been lying on this bed, and
still millions of times more?” In fact, there is no end to it... forever
and forever. You may have nightmares. It is a nightmare if it is true –
an eternal nightmare that goes on repeating.</p><p><br></p><p>But my own experience is that Zarathustra is using it just as a
device – a great device to make you utterly bored, so that you have to
do something to jump out of the wheel of recurrence. If you don’t do
anything, then mechanically you will go on moving in the wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to do some conscious act to attain freedom – freedom from
the clutches of the eternal law of recurrence. And I think the device is
great. If you understand that this is going to be so, then something has
to be done right now to get out of the way, to become an exception to
the law. Perhaps that is the hidden intention of Zarathustra.</p><p><br></p><p>The theory of recurrence may not be true, but it can be used as a
great device for people to go beyond themselves. It can create the right
atmosphere for transformation. I would support the theory of recurrence
for the simple reason that it can make you think again: don’t repeat
anything in this life; start changing from today. Learn not to repeat,
so that one day you can be out of the mechanical recurrence.</p><p><br></p><p>But people go on repeating the same thing, sometimes in spite of
themselves. So many people have told me they want to stop smoking. I
said, “Then who is preventing you? At least I’m not preventing you. Why
are you bothering me? If I want to start smoking I will not ask anybody.
If I have not started smoking it is not because somebody advised me. Who
is preventing you? you want to stop.”</p><p>They feel shocked, because they were thinking I would show sympathy.
They say, “We have tried many times but again and again the urge comes
with such force that we forget all our decisions. We forget all our
willpower, and we start even arguing in favor of smoking: just one
cigarette, once in a while, cannot be so harmful. But one cigarette
brings another in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at your life. If you are repetitive in your life, perhaps
you will be repetitive on a larger scale – what Zarathustra calls
recurrence. You commit the same mistakes again and again. You get angry
and you repent, and your repentance is not going to prevent you because
it is a pattern. First you get angry, then you repent, then you get
angry again, then you repent.<span class=s4></span>The repentance is
really to</p><p>erase the feeling of guilt that you became angry – now you are again
ready to be angry, the guilt is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once: Ramakrishna was asked by a man, “I’m going to
Varanasi.<span class=s4></span>” Every twelve years</p><p>people gather near the Ganges to have a holy dip, and Hindus believe
that whatever sins you have committed in twelve years are washed out –
just one dip. It is a very cold season, and the water is ice-cold,
coming directly from the Himalayan ice. So even one dip is enough to
freeze your blood, and people jump out. But now for twelve years they
are again free to commit the same things. After twelve years they will
come again.</p><p><br></p><p>This man was going to take a holy dip, and he was a devotee of
Ramakrishna, so he went just to touch his feet and to get his blessings.
Ramakrishna said, “Where are you going?” He said, “I am going for a holy
dip.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “If you are going, very good. You can take one dip
for me too, because I am not going; the water is too cold. And anyway, I
have not committed any sin, so why unnecessarily harass the Ganges,
where so many people are. And I am also afraid: I have not committed any
sin, and so many people are throwing their sins into the Ganges<span class=s4></span>entering into the Ganges is dangerous –</p><p>some sins may get stuck to me. So you can take one dip for me
too.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Are you kidding or what?”Ramakrishna said, “To tell
you the truth... but I’m not preventing you. Have you seen those big
trees standing by the side of the Ganges?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, because twelve years ago I went for the holy dip, and
I saw really big trees, huge trees.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “Do you know their purpose, why they are standing
there?” He said, “How am I supposed to know the purpose of the trees,
why they are standing there? Today you are in a strange mood.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “I will tell you their purpose. When you take the
dip it is not the Ganges that the sins are worried about, it is the
coldness of the water. So they jump out, sit on the trees and wait for
you. How long can you remain in the Ganges?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “How long? I cannot remain for more than two minutes;
the water is too cold.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Ramakrishna said, “Yes, as you come out they jump back on you. And
remember, sometimes it happens that somebody else’s sins may also jump
on you. Seeing that a very good guy<span class=s4></span>just for
a</p><p>change; they have tortured somebody enough, now torture this fellow.
So be very alert; when you are passing under those trees, be
careful!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How I can be careful? – because I don’t see anything. I
don’t see the sins.” Ramakrishna said, “It is up to you. It is a very
dangerous thing that you are doing. If you hear me, think it over. There
is no hurry; you can go tomorrow. The Ganges will be there, and those
trees will be there.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man remained awake the whole night. He thought again and again,
and the idea looked meaningful – although it was a pure device; there
was no truth in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither is there is any truth in the idea that by taking a dip in the
Ganges your sins are washed away. If it was so cheap then you could do
every kind of thing you wanted to do for twelve years, and then after
twelve years just for one day go to the Ganges, and take a dip.</p><p><br></p><p>And particularly now there is no need even to go to the Ganges. The
Ganges water can be supplied by pipes throughout the country. So just in
your bathroom, take a shower. And why wait for twelve years? Every day
keep yourself fresh for new sins to commit.</p><p><br></p><p>Devices can be helpful. And devices need not be true or false; if
they are helpful they are true. And I say, the theory of recurrence can
be of immense help to many people; hence it has a truth.</p><p><br></p><p>’BEHOLD, WE KNOW WHAT YOU TEACH: THAT ALL THINGS RECUR ETERNALLY AND
WE OURSELVES WITH THEM, AND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXISTED AN INFINITE
NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE AND ALL THINGS WITH US.</p><p><br></p><p>’YOU TEACH THAT THERE IS A GREAT YEAR OF BECOMING, A COLOSSUS OF A
YEAR: THIS YEAR MUST, LIKE AN HOUR-GLASS, TURN ITSELF OVER AGAIN AND
AGAIN, SO THAT IT MAY RUN DOWN AND RUN OUT ANEW.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen an ancient device for measuring time. Just a glass made
in the shape of a drum is filled with sand, and the sand goes on falling
through slowly, slowly. The passage is very narrow. In one hour the
upper glass is empty; the lower glass is full. And the device is made in
such a way that when the upper glass is empty, completely empty, the
lower glass moves up and the upper glass moves down. Again, the same
sand, the same glass and the same recurrence.</p><p><br></p><p>The animals are saying...</p><p><br></p><p>LIKE AN HOUR-GLASS, TURN ITSELF OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN, SO THAT IT MAY
RUN DOWN AND RUN OUT ANEW:</p><p><br></p><p>’SO THAT ALL THESE YEARS RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER, IN THE GREATEST THINGS
AND IN THE SMALLEST, SO THAT WE OURSELVES RESEMBLE OURSELVES IN EACH
GREAT YEAR, IN THE GREATEST THINGS AND IN THE SMALLEST.</p><p><br></p><p>’AND IF YOU SHOULD DIE NOW, O ZARATHUSTRA: BEHOLD, WE KNOW TOO WHAT
YOU WOULD THEN SAY TO YOURSELF – BUT YOUR ANIMALS ASK YOU NOT TO DIE
YET!</p><p>’YOU WOULD SAY – AND WITHOUT TREMBLING, BUT RATHER GASPING FOR
HAPPINESS: FOR A GREAT WEIGHT AND OPPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM
YOU, MOST PATIENT OF MEN!</p><p><br></p><p>’“NOW I DIE AND DECAY,” YOU WOULD SAY, “AND IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE
NOTHINGNESS. SOULS ARE AS MORTAL AS BODIES.</p><p><br></p><p>’“BUT THE COMPLEX OF CAUSES IN WHICH I AM ENTANGLED WILL RECUR – IT
WILL CREATE ME AGAIN! I MYSELF AM PART OF THESE CAUSES OF THE ETERNAL
RECURRENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>’“I SHALL RETURN, WITH THIS SUN, WITH THIS EARTH, WITH THIS EAGLE,
WITH THIS SERPENT – NOT TO A NEW LIFE OR A BETTER LIFE OR A SIMILAR
LIFE:</p><p><br></p><p>’“I SHALL RETURN ETERNALLY TO THIS IDENTICAL AND SELF-SAME LIFE, IN
THE GREATEST THINGS AND IN THE SMALLEST, TO TEACH ONCE MORE THE ETERNAL
RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS,</p><p><br></p><p>’“TO SPEAK ONCE MORE THE TEACHINGS OF THE GREAT NOONTIDE OF EARTH AND
MAN, TO TELL MAN OF THE SUPERMAN ONCE MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>’“I SPOKE MY TEACHING, I BROKE UPON MY TEACHING: THUS MY ETERNAL FATE
WILL HAVE IT – AS PROPHET DO I PERISH!</p><p><br></p><p>‘“NOW THE HOUR HAS COME WHEN HE WHO IS GOING DOWN SHALL BLESS
HIMSELF. THUS – ENDS ZARATHUSTRA’S DOWN-GOING.”’</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE ANIMALS HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THEY FELL SILENT AND EXPECTED
THAT ZARATHUSTRA WOULD SAY SOMETHING TO THEM: BUT ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT
HEAR THAT THEY WERE SILENT. ON THE CONTRARY, HE LAY STILL WITH CLOSED
EYES LIKE A SLEEPER, ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT ASLEEP: FOR HE WAS CONVERSING
WITH HIS SOUL. THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE, HOWEVER, WHEN THEY FOUND HIM
THUS SILENT, RESPECTED THE GREAT STILLNESS AROUND HIM AND DISCREETLY
WITHDREW.</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing the animals is symbolic. It means as if the universal life,
the anima itself, spoke to Zarathustra: “This is your destiny, to go to
men and to teach them the theory of eternal recurrence. But remember,
your destiny is also very dangerous.” Listening to these animals
Zarathustra closed his eyes, and it seemed as if he had fallen asleep.
But he was not asleep. He was in deep meditation, consulting with his
own soul. About what was he consulting with his own soul?</p><p><br></p><p>“Is it the right hour for me to take this dangerous path and to go to
men, whom I know perfectly well are deaf and blind and are not going to
see any truth, and are not going to listen about any truth? Is it time
for me? Has my hour come? Is it the noontide I have been waiting for? If
the hour has come then I will take the challenge and I will go to men –
to be laughed at or to be crucified, but I will deliver the message that
existence itself has given to me.</p><p><br></p><p>“These animals, who have never spoken, who never speak, seem to have
become vehicles of existence, and what they are saying is absolutely
true. This is my finding. In those seven days</p><p>I have come across the discovery of eternal recurrence. But the
question is, is the time ripe? – because I don’t want to reach humanity
before the right time. I want to reach exactly at the time when at least
a few people will be ready to hear me, and to understand me.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what he was conversing about with his own soul. And the
parable ends with a beautiful and graceful expression of his animals.
The serpent and the eagle, seeing him silent... RESPECTED THE GREAT
STILLNESS THAT WAS SURROUNDING HIM AND DISCREETLY WITHDREW. Even</p><p>man is not so discreet, is not so respectful of the silence of a
master, of the silence of the meditator.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of one instance of this century. One of the greatest
enlightened men was Raman Maharshi, in South India, on the mountain of
Arunachal. He was not a man of many words; he was not very educated
either. He was only seventeen when he escaped into the mountains in
search of himself. He was a very silent man, and people used to go
particularly to have a taste of his silence.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing very miraculous was watched by every comer: whenever he sat
in the veranda of the temple, waiting for people who wanted to sit with
him in silence, a cow used to come without fail, exactly at the right
time. She would sit there, and people could not believe it: “What kind
of cow is that?” And when Raman Maharshi moved inside his room, and
everybody dispersed, the cow would come close to the window and put her
head inside – just to say goodbye, every day. And then she would go
back. Then tomorrow she would come again.</p><p><br></p><p>It went on continually for years. But one day she did not turn up,
and Raman Maharshi said, “She must be either very ill or she must be
dead. I must go in search of her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people said, “It doesn’t look right for a man of your heights to
go in search of a cow.” But Raman Maharshi did not listen to the people,
he went. People followed, and the cow was found. She had fallen in a
ditch.</p><p><br></p><p>She had become old. She was coming, she was on the way, but she had
slipped and had fallen into the ditch.</p><p><br></p><p>But she was still alive, and as Raman Maharshi reached her, sat by
her side, the cow had tears in her eyes. And she put her head into Raman
Maharshi’s lap and died.</p><p><br></p><p>Raman Maharshi told his people,“A great temple should be made in her
memory here, because she has died enlightened – she will not be born
even as a human being.” And even today the temple stands there, with a
statue of the cow inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps we have not made much effort to communicate with animals,
with trees, with mountains, with rivers. Certainly their language cannot
be our language; some other ways have to be found. But in silence many
people have experienced a harmony with the trees, with the animals, with
the birds.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not only a parable, it is also an indication of a
possibility for the future. Man just has to explore... there is so much
to explore! But we are engaged in trivia. We are not concerned with the
real and great values of life. We are not concerned even with life
itself and its different forms. All these are different forms of the
same life which we are made of – the same stuff. There must be some way
of communion.</p><p>Zarathustra was in silence, conversing with himself, searching for a
decision to go down from the mountains, from the animals and their
innocence to the men who are full of self-conceit and cunningness and
who think that they know, although they know nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>This fragment does not say what was the conclusion of the communion
with his own soul, but the coming fragment is concerned with his going
down from the mountains to humanity. So it must have been that he had
heard the still, small voice of his own soul, saying, “Don’t hesitate.
It is a difficult destiny and dangerous too, but you have to go, because
whatever you have known and seen and experienced, you have to share
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Eternal recurrence can become a great blessing if people understand
it and start changing their life from the mechanical to a more conscious
and alert awareness. It is possible, because it has happened to many
people. It can happen to everybody. The only question is to gather
courage and to accept the challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Somewhere else Zarathustra says, “Unless you gather courage to
transcend yourself and your mechanicalness, your robot-like behavior,
the superman, which is going to be your fulfillment, cannot be
born.”</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

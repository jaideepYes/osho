ONE OF THE SO-CALLED HIGHER MEN, THE KING, ADDRESSES ZARATHUSTRA:
JUST TO SEE THIS WOULD WE CLIMB HIGHER MOUNTAINS THAN THIS MOUNTAIN. FOR WE HAVE COME AS SIGHTSEERS, WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT MAKES SAD EYES BRIGHT.…

BELOVED OSHO, OF REDEMPTION
TRULY, MY FRIENDS, I WALK AMONG MEN AS AMONG THE FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS OF MEN!
THE TERRIBLE THING TO MY EYE IS TO FIND MEN SHATTERED IN PIECES AND SCATTERED AS IF OVER A BATTLE-FIELD OF SLAUGHTER.
AND WHEN MY EYE FLEES FROM THE PRESENT TO THE PAST, IT ALWAYS DISCOVERS THE SAME THING: FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS AND DREADFUL CHANCES – BUT NO MEN!</description>

IT IS NOT THE HEIGHT, IT IS THE ABYSS THAT IS TERRIBLE!
THE ABYSS WHERE THE GLANCE PLUNGES DOWNWARD AND THE HAND GRASPS UPWARD. THERE THE HEART GROWS GIDDY THROUGH ITS TWOFOLD WILL.
AH, FRIENDS, HAVE YOU, TOO, DIVINED MY HEART’S TWOFOLD WILL?...
MY WILL CLINGS TO MANKIND, I BIND MYSELF TO MANKIND WITH FETTERS, BECAUSE I AM DRAWN UP TO THE SUPERMAN: FOR MY OTHER WILL WANTS TO DRAW ME UP TO THE SUPERMAN.</description>

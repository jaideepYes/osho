TEST IN EARNEST WHETHER I HAVE CREPT INTO THE HEART OF LIFE ITSELF AND DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF ITS HEART!\nWHERE I FOUND A LIVING CREATURE, THERE I FOUND WILL TO POWER; AND EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT I FOUND THE WILL TO BE MASTER.\nTHE WILL OF THE WEAKER PERSUADES IT TO SERVE THE STRONGER; ITS WILL WANTS TO BE MASTER OVER THOSE WEAKER STILL: THIS DELIGHT ALONE IT IS UNWILLING TO FORGO.\nAND AS THE LESSER SURRENDERS TO THE GREATER, THAT IT MAY HAVE DELIGHT AND POWER OVER THE LEAST OF ALL, SO THE GREATEST, TOO, SURRENDERS AND FOR THE SAKE OF POWER STAKES – LIFE.\nTHIS DEVOTION OF THE GREATEST IS TO ENCOUNTER RISK AND DANGER AND PLAY DICE FOR DEATH.\nAND WHERE SACRIFICE AND SERVICE AND LOVING GLANCES ARE, THERE TOO IS WILL TO BE MASTER. THERE THE WEAKER STEALS BY SECRET PATHS INTO THE CASTLE AND EVEN INTO THE HEART OF THE MORE POWERFUL – AND STEALS THE POWER.\nAND LIFE ITSELF TOLD ME THIS SECRET: ‘BEHOLD,’ IT SAID, ’I AM THAT WHICH MUST OVERCOME ITSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN.\n’TO BE SURE, YOU CALL IT WILL TO PROCREATE OR IMPULSE TOWARDS A GOAL, TOWARDS THE HIGHER, MORE DISTANT, MORE MANIFOLD: BUT ALL THIS IS ONE AND ONE SECRET.\n’I WOULD RATHER PERISH THAN RENOUNCE THIS ONE THING; AND TRULY, WHERE THERE IS PERISHING AND THE FALLING OF LEAVES, BEHOLD, THERE LIFE SACRIFICES ITSELF – FOR THE SAKE OF POWER!\n’THAT I HAVE TO BE STRUGGLE AND BECOMING AND GOAL AND CONFLICT OF GOALS: AH, HE WHO DIVINES MY WILL SURELY DIVINES, TOO, ALONG WHAT CROOKED PATHS IT HAS TO GO!\n’WHATEVER I CREATE AND HOWEVER MUCH I LOVE IT – SOON I HAVE TO OPPOSE IT AND MY LOVE: THUS WILL MY WILL HAVE IT.\n’AND YOU TOO, ENLIGHTENED MAN, ARE ONLY A PATH AND A FOOTSTEP OF MY WILL: TRULY, MY WILL TO POWER WALKS WITH THE FEET OF YOUR WILL TO TRUTH!\n’HE WHO SHOT THE DOCTRINE OF “WILL TO EXISTENCE” AT TRUTH CERTAINLY DID NOT HIT THE TRUTH: THIS WILL – DOES NOT EXIST!\n’FOR WHAT DOES NOT EXIST CANNOT WILL; BUT THAT WHICH IS IN EXISTENCE, HOW COULD IT STILL WANT TO COME INTO EXISTENCE?\n’ONLY WHERE LIFE IS, THERE IS ALSO WILL: NOT WILL TO LIFE, BUT – SO I TEACH YOU – WILL TO POWER!...\n‘THE LIVING CREATURE VALUES MANY THINGS HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF; YET OUT OF THIS EVALUATION ITSELF SPEAKS – THE WILL TO POWER!’...\nTRULY, I SAY TO YOU: UNCHANGING GOOD AND EVIL DOES NOT EXIST! FROM OUT OF THEMSELVES THEY MUST OVERCOME THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nYOU EXERT POWER WITH YOUR VALUES AND DOCTRINES OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU ASSESSORS OF VALUES; AND THIS IS YOUR HIDDEN LOVE AND THE GLITTERING, TREMBLING, AND OVERFLOWING OF YOUR SOULS.\nBUT A MIGHTIER POWER AND A NEW OVERCOMING GROW FROM OUT YOUR VALUES: EGG AND EGG-SHELL BREAK AGAINST THEM.\nAND HE WHO HAS TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL, TRULY, HAS FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES.\nTHUS THE GREATEST EVIL BELONGS WITH THE GREATEST GOOD: THIS, HOWEVER, IS THE CREATIVE GOOD.\nLET US SPEAK OF THIS, YOU WISEST MEN, EVEN IF IT IS A BAD THING. TO BE SILENT IS WORSE; ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS.\nAND LET EVERYTHING THAT CAN BREAK UPON OUR TRUTHS – BREAK! THERE IS MANY A HOUSE STILL TO BUILD!\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOne of the great psychologists of this age, Alfred Adler, based his whole doctrine on the will to power, and it was thought that he had discovered something new in human beings. But the people who were aware of Alfred Adler and his psychology of will to power were not aware of the ancient seer, Zarathustra. Zarathustra has given all the fundamentals of the psychology of will to power. It is not something new – Alfred Adler rediscovered it; and he did not even improve upon it.\nZarathustra has looked from every aspect, in detail, and with great insight. His psychology is not only a psychology – because it is not confined to the mind only – it is also a philosophy of life. Its area, its territory, is far vaster than Alfred Adler’s conception. Alfred Adler looks very childish compared to Zarathustra.\nI would like you to understand the most fundamental thing first, then we can go into the details of what Zarathustra has to say. The first thing is: life is a constant overcoming. Everything is trying to go beyond itself. Everything is trying to become better, to be more beautiful, to be more powerful, to be more authentic. This overcoming is not something that becomes complete, ever.\nYou reach a goal, and suddenly you see: that goal is only a stepping-stone for a future goal. And the horizon in front of you always remains calling you, challenging you, pulling you towards unknown spaces.\nThis principle of overcoming is the very foundation of evolution; otherwise there would have been no evolution at all. Things would have remained static, things would have been just things – dead, complete, no longer growing, no longer going higher, no longer trying to transcend themselves. Evolution is the religion that Zarathustra teaches.\nZarathustra is in many ways a pioneer. Charles Darwin thought that he had found the idea of evolution – he was wrong. Two thousand years before him, this man Zarathustra had laid all the foundations of the philosophy of evolution.\nLife can remain alive only if it goes on overcoming itself. The moment it stops overcoming itself, it disappears. The only death in the world is when something comes to a full stop. Life never comes to a full stop; hence, there is no death in reality.\nZarathustra says, THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND MY TEACHING ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL, I SHALL RELATE TO YOU MY TEACHING ABOUT LIFE AND ABOUT THE NATURE OF ALL LIVING CREATURES.\nI HAVE FOLLOWED THE LIVING CREATURE, I HAVE FOLLOWED THE GREATEST AND THE SMALLEST PATHS, THAT I MIGHT UNDERSTAND ITS NATURE.\nI CAUGHT ITS GLANCE IN A HUNDREDFOLD MIRROR WHEN ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED, THAT ITS EYE MIGHT SPEAK TO ME. AND ITS EYE DID SPEAK TO ME.\nBUT WHEREVER I FOUND LIVING CREATURES, THERE TOO I HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF OBEDIENCE. ALL LIVING CREATURES ARE OBEYING CREATURES.\nBut the concept of obedience in Zarathustra’s philosophy is not the ordinary idea of obedience that religions have been teaching to us. Religions also teach obedience. But obedience to whom? Their obedience is always to someone outside yourself – to some god, to some messenger, to some prophet, to some holy scripture.\nZarathustra’s obedience is obedience to life; it is not to something outside yourself. It is the nature, very nature of your life, to obey. Life obeys itself.\nAll the religions have been trying to distract you from this obedience. They are telling you, “Don’t listen to life, listen to God. Don’t listen to your own heart, listen to the holy book. Don’t listen to your own body and its wisdom, but listen to some dead saint, some fictitious, mythological figure.”\nSo remember, Zarathustra and his obedience are just the opposite of what religions call obedience. Zarathustra says, “Obey yourself! Obey your instincts as far as your body is concerned. Obey your feelings as far as your heart is concerned. Obey your intelligence as far as your mind is concerned, and obey your intuition as far as your being is concerned. You are the holy scripture. Your body has every knowledge that it needs. Your heart knows perfectly well all the ways of love, and your\nintelligence is capable of understanding the most hidden secrets of existence. Your intuition is capable of exploring your own interiority to the very center of your being.”\nThese four principles, Zarathustra has found, are the basic pillars of all life. But religions have been taking people astray. They are teaching a totally different kind of obedience, which is really disobedience to nature.\nBUT WHEREVER I FOUND LIVING CREATURES, THERE TOO I HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF OBEDIENCE. ALL LIVING CREATURES ARE OBEYING CREATURES.\nAND THIS IS THE SECOND THING: HE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE COMMANDED.\nZarathustra is so clear and so simple: if you cannot obey your own life, somebody is going to command you. You are responsible for all those who have become commanders, who are giving ten commandments to you. Don’t throw the responsibility on others’ shoulders.\nYou are unable to obey yourself; you are a coward, you are afraid. Who knows? – you may be right, you may be wrong. It is better to listen to the wiser ones, it is better to listen to the ancient knowledge, to the scriptures, to the principles of life preached for thousands of years. It seems they are more reliable than your own body, which is millions of years old – no scripture is as old as your body. Religions tell you, “Listen to the ancient seers.” But your own consciousness is far older, far more ancient than any seers.\nJesus was asked once, “What do you think about Abraham?” And Jesus said something immensely valuable: “Why should I think about Abraham? I was before he was.” Abraham lived almost three thousand years before Jesus Christ, but what he was saying is immensely true – “I was before Abraham was. I have always been here. My consciousness is part of the eternal consciousness of existence. Why should I bother about any Abraham?\n“If I can listen to my own consciousness, I have listened to all the seers of the world, because it is the same source from where they quenched their thirst. Why should I go anywhere else? I have my own fresh sources – fresh in a way, because I have never been there, and ancient in a way, because they have always been there, waiting for me.”\nHE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE COMMANDED.\nYou see in the world, Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians and Buddhists and Jews. These are the people who have not obeyed their own lives, who have not listened to their own hearts, who have not followed their own beings. They need organized religions, holy scriptures, prophets and messiahs to command them.\nLife is enough unto itself. But if you cannot trust yourself, if you are not courageous enough to follow your own nature, then obviously you will have to be commanded. You will need some discipline, you will need some moral code, you will need some idea of good and evil.\nThe moment you start allowing yourself to be commanded you have become a slave, a spiritual slave. And you are distracted from your original being, you are distracted from your own god. Your\nauthentic god is being replaced by a stone statue in some temple, which is dead. And cunning priests pretend to represent that they are your saviors. They convince you that you cannot save yourself, that you need a savior, that you cannot find what is right and what is wrong through your own insight, through your own intuition – you need tuition for it, and tuition comes from the outside. All religions are nothing but tuitions.\nAnd slowly, slowly the more you are burdened by commandments from outside, you forget completely that you had a right to live your life according to your own self. You are living a false life, something pseudo, which is not going to satisfy you, which is not going to give you any contentment, any joy, any truth – which is simply going to destroy you, and waste a great opportunity that existence has given to you.\nHE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE COMMANDED. THAT IS THE NATURE OF LIVING CREATURES.\nBUT THIS IS THE THIRD THING I HEARD: THAT COMMANDING IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN OBEYING. AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE COMMANDER BEARS THE BURDEN OF ALL WHO OBEY, AND THAT THIS BURDEN CAN EASILY CRUSH HIM.\nCommanding is not easy, because you are taking responsibility for other people, you are becoming burdened. But that is not the only problem; the greater problem is:\nIN ALL COMMANDING THERE APPEARED TO ME TO BE AN EXPERIMENT AND A RISK: AND THE LIVING CREATURE ALWAYS RISKS HIMSELF WHEN HE COMMANDS.\nAnybody who takes the responsibility of commanding is taking a risk. He does not know your nature, he does not know your destiny, he does not know what you are going to become if you are left alone, if you are left to your own nature – he has no idea. And he is commanding thousands and millions of people, who all have unique natures and unique destinies. Obviously, his commandments are going to be average, standardized ideologies. And there is a problem: the average person does not exist.\nFor example, you are here. Everybody’s height can be measured – somebody is six and somebody is five, and somebody is five-five, and somebody is five-seven, and somebody is six-two. They can all be added together, and the average height can be found. But do you think you will be able to find any single person here of the average height? Somebody will be a little higher, somebody will be a little lowerAverage height is a mathematical thing – it does not happen in life.\nAnd the same is true about standardized moral codes, ethics, ideas about good and evil – they are average. Nobody fits with them, and they fit with nobody.\nIt is good that you can get shoes according to your feet, not according to the average; otherwise everybody would be miserable! Just a simple thing and the whole world could be made miserable. Give all of them average size shoes: somebody will have such big shoes that he is carrying them, cannot even walk, and somebody will have such small shoes that he is dying.how to reach home?\nI have heard about a philosopher: he always purchased shoes which were one size smaller than he needed. Every shopkeeper was puzzled, “What is the matter with you? You are a well-known person, you are not an idiot. This shoe is too small for you.”\nAnd he used to say, “You don’t understand, this shoe is such a great help to me. When I wear this shoe I forget all the miseries of life – all problems, all anxieties disappear – this shoe is too much! And when I reach home at night and take off the shoes, I say, ‘My God! What a day, and what a relief,’ and I sleep so soundly. This is one of my discoveries,” he used to say, “otherwise life is unbearable.”\nIt always happens: if you are miserable, create some bigger misery and the smaller will disappear.\nBut remember, anybody who takes the responsibility of commanding people is being very inhuman. He is degrading people – their uniqueness, their differences – and he is putting the same size shoes on everyone. Nobody fits. Everybody suffers. All your principles are of the same kind.\nIn Greek mythology there is a story of a king who was a little crazy. He had a very beautiful guest house, and the bed was made of pure gold. In the beginning, a few guests stayed there, but then nobody was coming out that way, from his capital, because it became known to everybody that the man is very dangerous.\nHe had made such a beautiful guest house, but he had his principles – the guest has to fit with the length of the bed. He is so crazy, and you are so alone. And he keeps four wrestlers ready. If you are a little too long, they will make you a little shorter – from both sides, they start boxing you until you are of the same size as the bed. If you are a little too long, he will simply order, “Cut his feet off!” And whatever you say to him, he says, “I have made the bed the average height of human beings, and I believe in equality. It is your problem if you are not the size of the bed; it is not the problem of the bed.”\nBut this has been done, in such a subtle way, with your whole life. Moses decides the Ten Commandments for you – how can he decide? Jesus gives you the principles, in the Sermon on the Mount. Even principles which look so beautiful don’t turn out to be beautiful in reality, because principles are principles, and life is a living phenomenon, continuously changing.\nFor example, Jesus says, “Do unto others what you would like them to do to you.” Perhaps you may have never thought that there can be anything wrong in this principle. It is such a golden principle, so sweet, what can be wrong in it? Zarathustra says there is something wrong in it, although he had no idea of Jesus. But the principle is very much older than Jesus. Zarathustra was aware of the principle, and that there have been teachers before who have told to you, “Do unto others what you would like them to do to you.”\nZarathustra says, “But remember, their tastes may be different.” Nobody has thought about it – their tastes may be different. You are saying, “Do unto others what you would like to be done to you.” You are not giving freedom to the other person and his taste. In the first place, what you are doing he may not like. It is not necessarily true that your liking will be his liking too. And in the second place, how he responds will depend upon how he likes what you have done to him. It is unpredictable.\nThe principle looks very beautiful in words, but in actuality it will simply create more problems – it has created.All our religions and all our philosophies have created more problems for people than\nthey have solved. They have not solved a single thing.\nA commander is taking a great risk. He is playing with human beings, risking their lives according to his ideas and opinions. Who is he? From where does he have the authority? No man of understanding will be a man who commands. No man of understanding will try to mold your life, try to give your life a certain style, a certain character, a certain morality. The man of understanding will simply help you to find your own nature.\nThe language of your body he will teach you, the language of intelligence he will teach you, the language of love he will teach you, the language of intuition he will teach you; but he will leave you totally free to go on your own way and to move towards your own destiny. Your star may be different. Your goal may be different. And in fact, no two persons have to be fulfilled in the same way – they cannot be.\nSo much misery in the world is caused by simple stupidity: we are being forced to follow certain standards. Those standards have no respect for individuals. They are derived from average understanding, but the average is a mathematical concept; it has nothing to do with life. Mathematics is the most dead science of all sciences, because mathematics is the only science which is man- made. Every other science is a discovery. Mathematics is an invention – and a very arbitrary invention.\nYou don’t think about everything; otherwise everything would point to a single point: that your nature is not respected by any religion. They have already fixed formulas to be imposed on you, and those principles are more important than you. For them, you are made for those principles, not vice versa; not that those principles are made for you.\nIf they are made for you, then they should be made according to you. But then, each man would have his own morality and his own religion and his own philosophy. I don’t think that there is any harm in it – life would be far richer. There would be great variety and there would be great joy, because everybody would be absolutely free to follow his own body, his own heart, his own mind, his own being. The society of the superman will allow every man unconditional and total freedom to be himself.\nHOW HAS THIS COME ABOUT? THUS I ASK MYSELF. WHAT PERSUADES THE LIVING CREATURE TO OBEY AND TO COMMAND AND TO PRACTISE OBEDIENCE EVEN IN COMMANDING?\nLISTEN NOW TO MY TEACHING, YOU WISEST MEN! TEST IN EARNEST WHETHER I HAVE CREPT INTO THE HEART OF LIFE ITSELF AND DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF ITS HEART!\nWHERE I FOUND A LIVING CREATURE, THERE I FOUND WILL TO POWER; AND EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT I FOUND THE WILL TO BE MASTER.\nIt is certainly a great discovery. It is because of this will to power that those who are strong become commanders and those who are weak become slaves. But even the lowest slave dreams that one day he will also be the master. And even the greatest master is always afraid of his own slaves, that somebody may betray him.\nAdolf Hitler never allowed anybody to sleep in his room. Just to avoid somebody’s presence in the room while he is asleep, he remained a bachelor almost his whole life – except for three hours before\nhe committed suicide. What was the fear? He had no friends – even people who were thought to be very close to him, he kept as far away as possible.\nHe followed Machiavelli’s advice with totality: “Whoever is close to you one day will topple you. Beware of the friend. The enemy is not so dangerous, because the enemy is far away; the real danger is the friend, because he is so close. Any moment, his sword can be at your neck.”\nThere is a hierarchy in the world in many ways. That hierarchy fulfills a double role: somebody is higher than you – he commands you; somebody is lower than you – you command him.\nI am reminded of a beautiful storyOne of the great emperors of India was Akbar. He had chosen\nthe wisest people for his court. From all over the country great poets, painters, dancersanybody\nwho was a genius in any dimension was picked up by him for his court. And he rewarded them immensely.\nOne day he was talking with his nine greatest friends. They were called “the nine jewels of Akbar’s court.” They were the nine most intelligent, creative people. And Akbar was a little whimsical;he used to do thingsand of course you cannot ask the emperor, “Why?” He was not answerable to\nanybody.\nSuddenly he hit the face of the man standing by his side. He was the most intelligent man in the court – his name was Birbal. Birbal waited for a moment, perhaps considering what to do. He could not ask the emperor, “Why have you slapped me?” – that would be too dangerous – but something had to be done. In front of so many people, he had been slapped – this could not be tolerated.\nSo he slapped the next man who was standing by his side. And he did a good job; that man could not believe: “What is happening, and what kind of thing is this? I have done nothing.” But now there was no need to bother about it, Birbal had opened the door. That man didn’t think much, he slapped the next man. It is said that that slapping went on all over the capital – whoever was lower was hit.\nAnd in the night, the queen suddenly hit Akbar. He said, “What are you doing?” She said, “I don’t know what is happening, but it is going on all over in the capital. Somebody has hit me, and of course, she was one of your wives” – Akbar had five hundred wives – “and she was a senior one, so I could not hit her back.”\nThe queen was the youngest wife – of course she had more power over Akbar than any other wife; she was the most beautiful. She said, “I cannot hit anybody else but you.” Akbar said, “This is strange. This is my own slap that has come back to me, having taken a round all over the city!”\nHierarchies serve a purpose. And there are not only hierarchies in the government, in the church, in political parties; there are hierarchies in the house, in the family. If you look closely, you will find you are almost a standing member of many hierarchies. Many roads pass through you.somebody\nis higher, somebody is lower.\nThis whole game that goes on is because of the will to power. All are under it. It is life’s intrinsic law.\nThe husband comes from the office – the boss has been angry. And although he was abusing and humiliating him, he had to continue to smile, although he wanted to hit him or kill him. But that is too\nrisky, too dangerous – he cannot afford it. Full of anger he comes home and starts fighting with his wife. And she cannot believe it; she has not done anything. The whole day she has been working – preparing his food, his clothes, his house, taking care of the children – and then he comes and starts shouting and insulting her.\nBut she cannot say anything to him; she is financially dependent on him. She will have to wait a little. Her boy will be coming home from school, and she can find some fault – and it is not difficult to find fault. Every day she could have found fault, but today is a special day: “You have been fighting with somebody again. I can see your face is scratched, your shirt is torn.” And she beats the boy. This is a hierarchy.\nAnd the boy cannot understand it. The whole day in school the teacher was torturing him – perhaps that’s why they are called teachers; they torture! – then, on the way home, a stronger boy was harassing him. And now his mother isHe goes into his room and beats his teddy bear. Somebody\nhas to do something!\nTeddy bears don’t exist without any reason. They are part of your hierarchy, where one line ends – because the teddy bear is unmarried and... one line has come to an end. But lines and more lines.… Just look at yourself and you will see everywhereeven animals living with human beings learn the\nlanguage of power.\nYou go to a stranger’s house and his dog starts barking. But you will see a strange phenomenon: the dog has also become a politician. He is barking, and he is also wagging his tail – this is a welcome sign – because he is not certain whether you are welcome in the home or not. So he is doing both things – just being diplomatic. And as the master comes out and shakes hands, he stops barking, and just the tail continues to wag. Or if the master says, “Why you are bothering my dog?” then the tail stops. Then he starts really barking and is ready to attack. Even animals become part of your power hunger.\nThere is certainly a deep will to power. But you cannot be always on the top; and even if you are on the top, how long can you stay there? There are others who are pulling your legs. You are trying hard to cling to your chair, but others also need to sit on the chair. So even if you reach to a powerful state, fear continues. Deep in your heart you are trembling. Your power is not reliable – just as you have taken it from somebody else, somebody is going to take it away from you.\nAnd the lowest slave also dreams, “It is not going to be always night. One day I will also see my dawn, I will also be on my trip.” He is continuously preparing. Whenever he has a chance to torture someone, to insult someone, to humiliate someone who is weaker than him, he never misses the chance.\nWhen Nirvano came to India for the first time, she was very puzzled: people walking on the street unnecessarily, for no reason at all, will take a rock and hit some stray dog. Her first question to me was, “Why do people hit stray dogs? They are not doing anything to anybody.”\nI said, “You don’t understand. Those people are being hit, and there is nobody else except stray dogs below them. It is a question of hierarchy. Those people are not to be blamed – although I have all sympathy with stray dogs. But those people are also very poor, just one step ahead of the\nstray dogs. The stray dog will also take its revenge sooner or later on some smaller, weaker dog, or maybe a cat, or maybe a beggar – there must be someone, somewhere in the world, who is lower in the hierarchy than the stray dog.\nThe whole world is boiling in one pot. Zarathustra’s understanding is absolutely correct:\nWHERE I FOUND A LIVING CREATURE, THERE I FOUND WILL TO POWER; AND EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT I FOUND THE WILL TO BE MASTER.\nPeople ask, “Why did Judas betray Jesus?” – because he also wanted to be the master. And if Jesus remains alive, there is no chance for Judas to be the master. In fact, he was the only educated follower of Jesus. Amongst all his apostles, Judas was the most intelligent, most articulate. He was next to Jesus – and that was the problem.\nAnd it is not only Jesus; every master has been betrayed. The greater the master, the more are his betrayers, because the more are his followers. And they all want to be masters. Even if they can become a mini-master somewhere, they will feel great joy.\nTHE WILL OF THE WEAKER PERSUADES IT TO SERVE THE STRONGER; ITS WILL WANTS TO BE MASTER OVER THOSE WEAKER STILL: THIS DELIGHT ALONE IT IS UNWILLING TO FORGO.\nAND AS THE LESSER SURRENDERS TO THE GREATER, THAT IT MAY HAVE DELIGHT AND POWER OVER THE LEAST OF ALL, SO THE GREATEST, TOO, SURRENDERS AND FOR THE SAKE OF POWER STAKES – LIFE.\nEven the people who have the greatest power in the world are still hankering for more. Even if they have to stake their life it is worth it; otherwise, what is the reason for so many wars? – thousands of wars, so many riots, religions clashing with each other, nations fighting with each other, political parties struggling with each other. There must be a tremendous reason, an instinct which is even ready to sacrifice life – even the greatest stakes his life – for more power.\nTHIS DEVOTION OF THE GREATEST IS TO ENCOUNTER RISK AND DANGER AND PLAY DICE FOR DEATH.\nWhen Edmund Hillary climbed the greatest Himalayan peak, Everest... for almost one century, hundreds of mountaineers had tried to climb it, and failed. Not only had they failed, almost seventy- five percent of the mountaineers died; they never returned. Still, new mountaineers went on trying, knowing perfectly well that many, many people had died. And there is nothing to be found on Everest; it is eternal snow.\nEdmund Hillary, when descended from the mountain, was addressing his first press conference, and a journalist asked, “Why have you taken such a risk? What is the motive?”\nEdmund Hillary said, “Motive? There is no question of motive. Just the very presence of Everest is a challenge and I wanted to be the first who has climbed the mountain.”\nYou cannot see that he has gained anything, but certainly a tremendous will to power, will to be the first... now nobody can take his place in the whole of history. In the vast future, anybody who reaches the top of Everest will be second; there is now no way to be first. This is his gain. You cannot see it, it is not visible, but a great power... just being the first.\nAND WHERE SACRIFICE AND SERVICE AND LOVING GLANCES ARE, THERE TOO IS WILL TO\nBE MASTER. Even lovers are continually trying to dominate each other. They may be playing the game of love, but deep down it is the game of will to power; otherwise, why do lovers continuously fight? They fight more than they love; the times of fight are longer than the moments of love. It seems they love only to fight. And for what are they fighting? – a domination.\nTHERE THE WEAKER STEALS BY SECRET PATHS INTO THE CASTLE AND EVEN INTO THE\nHEART OF THE MORE POWERFUL – AND STEALS THE POWER. The man fights directly. The woman has her own feminine way of fighting; she fights through more secretive paths. And more often, almost always, she is the winner – because man is so tired of fighting outside in the world, in the office, with the customers, with the people, with the politics, that he wants, at least in the house, some peace of mind. And that peace of mind is possible only if he becomes a henpecked husband.\nIt is rare, almost impossible, to find a man who is not henpecked. It is simply an absolute necessity; otherwise he will have no rest. The wife is resting the whole day, she is ready. By the time he comes home, tattered and battered, he is almost finished. Just a little push is needed and he will be flat on the floor. Every husband enters the house as if he is a thief, not a master as he pretends to be outside.\nAND LIFE ITSELF TOLD ME THIS SECRET: ‘BEHOLD,’ IT SAID, ’I AM THAT WHICH MUST\nOVERCOME ITSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN.’ Life is the energy, just like the waves of the ocean, that will come again and again and go on shattering on the beach, on the rocks, being followed by other waves. Eternally it has been so.\nLife is also an invisible energy which goes on and on with only one desire – to overcome itself. It wants to be higher; it wants to be more powerful; it wants to be more successful. Whatever it is, it wants to reach higher than that point. The energy of life’s ocean is exactly the same. The waves go on – don’t ask the motive. It is the very nature of the ocean, and it is the very nature of life.\n’TO BE SURE, YOU CALL IT WILL TO PROCREATE OR IMPULSE TOWARDS A GOAL, TOWARDS THE HIGHER, MORE DISTANT, MORE MANIFOLD: BUT ALL THIS IS ONE AND ONE SECRET.\n’I WOULD RATHER PERISH THAN RENOUNCE THIS ONE THING; AND TRULY, WHERE THERE IS PERISHING AND THE FALLING OF LEAVES, BEHOLD, THERE LIFE SACRIFICES ITSELF – FOR THE SAKE OF POWER!\n’THAT I HAVE TO BE STRUGGLE AND BECOMING AND GOAL AND CONFLICT OF GOALS: AH, HE WHO DIVINES MY WILL SURELY DIVINES, TOO, ALONG WHAT CROOKED PATHS IT HAS TO GO!\n‘WHATEVER I CREATE AND HOWEVER MUCH I LOVE IT – SOON I HAVE TO OPPOSE IT AND MY LOVE: THUS WILL MY WILL HAVE IT.’\nAlthough I create – and whatever I create I create with love – I also destroy, because I want to go beyond.\n‘AND YOU TOO, ENLIGHTENED MEN, ARE ONLY A PATH AND A FOOTSTEP OF MY WILL; TRULY, MY WILL TO POWER WALKS WITH THE FEET OF YOUR WILL TO TRUTH!’\nZarathustra says, “Even the will to truth is nothing but the will to power, because by knowing the truth you will have the greatest power in existence.” He reduces every desire and every longing, even the longing of enlightenment, to the will to power – because the moment you are enlightened, you have immense power over yourself, absolute power over your consciousness. Zarathustra cannot be said to be wrong. He has found a very key word, “will to power.”\n’HE WHO SHOT THE DOCTRINE OF “WILL TO EXISTENCE” AT TRUTH CERTAINLY DID NOT\nHIT THE TRUTH: THIS WILL – DOES NOT EXIST!’ “Will to existence” does not exist... unless will to existence serves the will to power; otherwise it has no meaning. You would not like just to vegetate and go on living. You would not like to be a mere survivor.\n’FOR WHAT DOES NOT EXIST CANNOT WILL; BUT THAT WHICH IS IN EXISTENCE, HOW\nCOULD IT STILL WANT TO COME INTO EXISTENCE?’ You are already in existence, so what is the point of will to existence?\nHe is contradicting those philosophers who call themselves existentialists. Although they have come into being in this century only, fragments of their teaching were available in Zarathustra’s time, too. There were a few thinkers here and there – not of great importance. It never became that important a philosophy as it became in this century.\nBut Zarathustra says, “You are already in existence; hence there is no point for the will to existence.” Existence certainly is needed, but it is needed only for the will to power; otherwise, who wants to exist?\n’ONLY WHERE LIFE IS, THERE IS ALSO WILL: NOT WILL TO LIFE, BUT – SO I TEACH YOU – WILL TO POWER!\n‘THE LIVING CREATURE VALUES MANY THINGS HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF; YET OUT OF THIS EVALUATION ITSELF SPEAKS – THE WILL TO POWER!’\nTRULY, I SAY TO YOU: UNCHANGING GOOD AND EVIL DOES NOT EXIST! FROM OUT OF THEMSELVES THEY MUST OVERCOME THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nYOU EXERT POWER WITH YOUR VALUES AND DOCTRINES OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU ASSESSORS OF VALUES; AND THIS IS YOUR HIDDEN LOVE AND THE GLITTERING, TREMBLING, AND OVERFLOWING OF YOUR SOULS.\nBUT A MIGHTIER POWER AND A NEW OVERCOMING GROW FROM OUT YOUR VALUES: EGG AND EGG-SHELL BREAK AGAINST THEM.\nAND HE WHO HAS TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL, TRULY, HAS FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES.\nTHUS THE GREATEST EVIL BELONGS WITH THE GREATEST GOOD: HOWEVER, IS THE CREATIVE GOOD?\nLET US speak OF THIS, YOU WISEST MEN, EVEN IF IT IS A BAD THING. TO BE SILENT IS WORSE; ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS.\nHe is saying, “I may not be understood. There is every possibility I may be misunderstood. But I have to speak it, because to be silent is worse.”\n... ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS.\nAND LET EVERYTHING THAT CAN BREAK UPON OUR TRUTHS – BREAK! THERE IS MANY A HOUSE STILL TO BE BUILT!\nHe is saying that on the path of creativity you have to be destructive too; and if you want higher values, you will have to destroy lower values. If you want to create better houses, you will have to destroy the old ones. The real creator is almost always a destroyer.\nHe is saying it because he is destroying old values, and he is creating a new value. The new value is will to power. For that new value everything else can be sacrificed. Even life, even all your concepts of good and evil, your morality, your religion, your philosophy – nothing matters.\nThe superman has only one religion: the religion of the will to power.\n...

MANY A HOUSE STILL TO BUILD!</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great psychologists of this age, Alfred Adler, based his
whole doctrine on the will to power, and it was thought that he had
discovered something new in human beings. But the people who were aware
of Alfred Adler and his psychology of will to power were not aware of
the ancient seer, Zarathustra. Zarathustra has given all the
fundamentals of the psychology of will to power. It is not something new
– Alfred Adler rediscovered it; and he did not even improve upon it.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has looked from every aspect, in detail, and with great
insight. His psychology is not only a psychology – because it is not
confined to the mind only – it is also a philosophy of life. Its area,
its territory, is far vaster than Alfred Adler’s conception. Alfred
Adler looks very childish compared to Zarathustra.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to understand the most fundamental thing first, then
we can go into the details of what Zarathustra has to say. The first
thing is: life is a constant overcoming. Everything is trying to go
beyond itself. Everything is trying to become better, to be more
beautiful, to be more powerful, to be more authentic. This overcoming is
not something that becomes complete, ever.</p><p>You reach a goal, and suddenly you see: that goal is only a
stepping-stone for a future goal. And the horizon in front of you always
remains calling you, challenging you, pulling you towards unknown
spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>This principle of overcoming is the very foundation of evolution;
otherwise there would have been no evolution at all. Things would have
remained static, things would have been just things – dead, complete, no
longer growing, no longer going higher, no longer trying to transcend
themselves. Evolution is the religion that Zarathustra teaches.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is in many ways a pioneer. Charles Darwin thought that he
had found the idea of evolution – he was wrong. Two thousand years
before him, this man Zarathustra had laid all the foundations of the
philosophy of evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>Life can remain alive only if it goes on overcoming itself. The
moment it stops overcoming itself, it disappears. The only death in the
world is when something comes to a full stop. Life never comes to a full
stop; hence, there is no death in reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND MY TEACHING ABOUT GOOD AND
EVIL, I SHALL RELATE TO YOU MY TEACHING ABOUT LIFE AND ABOUT THE NATURE
OF ALL LIVING CREATURES.</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE FOLLOWED THE LIVING CREATURE, I HAVE FOLLOWED THE GREATEST AND
THE SMALLEST PATHS, THAT I MIGHT UNDERSTAND ITS NATURE.</p><p><br></p><p>I CAUGHT ITS GLANCE IN A HUNDREDFOLD MIRROR WHEN ITS MOUTH WAS
CLOSED, THAT ITS EYE MIGHT SPEAK TO ME. AND ITS EYE DID SPEAK TO ME.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WHEREVER I FOUND LIVING CREATURES, THERE TOO I HEARD THE LANGUAGE
OF OBEDIENCE. ALL LIVING CREATURES ARE OBEYING CREATURES.</p><p><br></p><p>But the concept of obedience in Zarathustra’s philosophy is not the
ordinary idea of obedience that religions have been teaching to us.
Religions also teach obedience. But obedience to whom? Their obedience
is always to someone outside yourself – to some god, to some messenger,
to some prophet, to some holy scripture.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra’s obedience is obedience to life; it is not to something
outside yourself. It is the nature, very nature of your life, to obey.
Life obeys itself.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been trying to distract you from this
obedience. They are telling you, “Don’t listen to life, listen to God.
Don’t listen to your own heart, listen to the holy book. Don’t listen to
your own body and its wisdom, but listen to some dead saint, some
fictitious, mythological figure.”</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, Zarathustra and his obedience are just the opposite of
what religions call obedience. Zarathustra says, “Obey yourself! Obey
your instincts as far as your body is concerned. Obey your feelings as
far as your heart is concerned. Obey your intelligence as far as your
mind is concerned, and obey your intuition as far as your being is
concerned. You are the holy scripture. Your body has every knowledge
that it needs. Your heart knows perfectly well all the ways of love, and
your</p><p>intelligence is capable of understanding the most hidden secrets of
existence. Your intuition is capable of exploring your own interiority
to the very center of your being.”</p><p><br></p><p>These four principles, Zarathustra has found, are the basic pillars
of all life. But religions have been taking people astray. They are
teaching a totally different kind of obedience, which is really
disobedience to nature.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WHEREVER I FOUND LIVING CREATURES, THERE TOO I HEARD THE LANGUAGE
OF OBEDIENCE. ALL LIVING CREATURES ARE OBEYING CREATURES.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THIS IS THE SECOND THING: HE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE
COMMANDED.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is so clear and so simple: if you cannot obey your own
life, somebody is going to command you. You are responsible for all
those who have become commanders, who are giving ten commandments to
you. Don’t throw the responsibility on others’ shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>You are unable to obey yourself; you are a coward, you are afraid.
Who knows? – you may be right, you may be wrong. It is better to listen
to the wiser ones, it is better to listen to the ancient knowledge, to
the scriptures, to the principles of life preached for thousands of
years. It seems they are more reliable than your own body, which is
millions of years old – no scripture is as old as your body. Religions
tell you, “Listen to the ancient seers.” But your own consciousness is
far older, far more ancient than any seers.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was asked once, “What do you think about Abraham?” And Jesus
said something immensely valuable: “Why should I think about Abraham? I
was before he was.” Abraham lived almost three thousand years before
Jesus Christ, but what he was saying is immensely true – “I was before
Abraham was. I have always been here. My consciousness is part of the
eternal consciousness of existence. Why should I bother about any
Abraham?</p><p><br></p><p>“If I can listen to my own consciousness, I have listened to all the
seers of the world, because it is the same source from where they
quenched their thirst. Why should I go anywhere else? I have my own
fresh sources – fresh in a way, because I have never been there, and
ancient in a way, because they have always been there, waiting for
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE COMMANDED.</p><p><br></p><p>You see in the world, Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians and
Buddhists and Jews. These are the people who have not obeyed their own
lives, who have not listened to their own hearts, who have not followed
their own beings. They need organized religions, holy scriptures,
prophets and messiahs to command them.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is enough unto itself. But if you cannot trust yourself, if you
are not courageous enough to follow your own nature, then obviously you
will have to be commanded. You will need some discipline, you will need
some moral code, you will need some idea of good and evil.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you start allowing yourself to be commanded you have
become a slave, a spiritual slave. And you are distracted from your
original being, you are distracted from your own god. Your</p><p>authentic god is being replaced by a stone statue in some temple,
which is dead. And cunning priests pretend to represent that they are
your saviors. They convince you that you cannot save yourself, that you
need a savior, that you cannot find what is right and what is wrong
through your own insight, through your own intuition – you need tuition
for it, and tuition comes from the outside. All religions are nothing
but tuitions.</p><p><br></p><p>And slowly, slowly the more you are burdened by commandments from
outside, you forget completely that you had a right to live your life
according to your own self. You are living a false life, something
pseudo, which is not going to satisfy you, which is not going to give
you any contentment, any joy, any truth – which is simply going to
destroy you, and waste a great opportunity that existence has given to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO CANNOT OBEY HIMSELF WILL BE COMMANDED. THAT IS THE NATURE OF
LIVING CREATURES.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THIS IS THE THIRD THING I HEARD: THAT COMMANDING IS MORE
DIFFICULT THAN OBEYING. AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE COMMANDER BEARS THE
BURDEN OF ALL WHO OBEY, AND THAT THIS BURDEN CAN EASILY CRUSH HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Commanding is not easy, because you are taking responsibility for
other people, you are becoming burdened. But that is not the only
problem; the greater problem is:</p><p><br></p><p>IN ALL COMMANDING THERE APPEARED TO ME TO BE AN EXPERIMENT AND A
RISK: AND THE LIVING CREATURE ALWAYS RISKS HIMSELF WHEN HE COMMANDS.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody who takes the responsibility of commanding is taking a risk.
He does not know your nature, he does not know your destiny, he does not
know what you are going to become if you are left alone, if you are left
to your own nature – he has no idea. And he is commanding thousands and
millions of people, who all have unique natures and unique destinies.
Obviously, his commandments are going to be average, standardized
ideologies. And there is a problem: the average person does not
exist.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are here. Everybody’s height can be measured –
somebody is six and somebody is five, and somebody is five-five, and
somebody is five-seven, and somebody is six-two. They can all be added
together, and the average height can be found. But do you think you will
be able to find any single person here of the average height? Somebody
will be a little higher, somebody will be a little lower<span class=s4></span>Average height is a mathematical thing – it does not
happen in life.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same is true about standardized moral codes, ethics, ideas
about good and evil – they are average. Nobody fits with them, and they
fit with nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you can get shoes according to your feet, not
according to the average; otherwise everybody would be miserable! Just a
simple thing and the whole world could be made miserable. Give all of
them average size shoes: somebody will have such big shoes that he is
carrying them, cannot even walk, and somebody will have such small shoes
that he is dying.<span class=s4></span>how to reach home?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a philosopher: he always purchased shoes which
were one size smaller than he needed. Every shopkeeper was puzzled,
“What is the matter with you? You are a well-known person, you are not
an idiot. This shoe is too small for you.”</p><p>And he used to say, “You don’t understand, this shoe is such a great
help to me. When I wear this shoe I forget all the miseries of life –
all problems, all anxieties disappear – this shoe is too much! And when
I reach home at night and take off the shoes, I say, ‘My God! What a
day, and what a relief,’ and I sleep so soundly. This is one of my
discoveries,” he used to say, “otherwise life is unbearable.”</p><p><br></p><p>It always happens: if you are miserable, create some bigger misery
and the smaller will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, anybody who takes the responsibility of commanding
people is being very inhuman. He is degrading people – their uniqueness,
their differences – and he is putting the same size shoes on everyone.
Nobody fits. Everybody suffers. All your principles are of the same
kind.</p><p><br></p><p>In Greek mythology there is a story of a king who was a little crazy.
He had a very beautiful guest house, and the bed was made of pure gold.
In the beginning, a few guests stayed there, but then nobody was coming
out that way, from his capital, because it became known to everybody
that the man is very dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>He had made such a beautiful guest house, but he had his principles –
the guest has to fit with the length of the bed. He is so crazy, and you
are so alone. And he keeps four wrestlers ready. If you are a little too
long, they will make you a little shorter – from both sides, they start
boxing you until you are of the same size as the bed. If you are a
little too long, he will simply order, “Cut his feet off!” And whatever
you say to him, he says, “I have made the bed the average height of
human beings, and I believe in equality. It is your problem if you are
not the size of the bed; it is not the problem of the bed.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this has been done, in such a subtle way, with your whole life.
Moses decides the Ten Commandments for you – how can he decide? Jesus
gives you the principles, in the Sermon on the Mount. Even principles
which look so beautiful don’t turn out to be beautiful in reality,
because principles are principles, and life is a living phenomenon,
continuously changing.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Jesus says, “Do unto others what you would like them to
do to you.” Perhaps you may have never thought that there can be
anything wrong in this principle. It is such a golden principle, so
sweet, what can be wrong in it? Zarathustra says there is something
wrong in it, although he had no idea of Jesus. But the principle is very
much older than Jesus. Zarathustra was aware of the principle, and that
there have been teachers before who have told to you, “Do unto others
what you would like them to do to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, “But remember, their tastes may be different.”
Nobody has thought about it – their tastes may be different. You are
saying, “Do unto others what you would like to be done to you.” You are
not giving freedom to the other person and his taste. In the first
place, what you are doing he may not like. It is not necessarily true
that your liking will be his liking too. And in the second place, how he
responds will depend upon how he likes what you have done to him. It is
unpredictable.</p><p><br></p><p>The principle looks very beautiful in words, but in actuality it will
simply create more problems – it has created.<span class=s4></span>All
our religions and all our philosophies have created more problems for
people than</p><p>they have solved. They have not solved a single thing.</p><p>A commander is taking a great risk. He is playing with human beings,
risking their lives according to his ideas and opinions. Who is he? From
where does he have the authority? No man of understanding will be a man
who commands. No man of understanding will try to mold your life, try to
give your life a certain style, a certain character, a certain morality.
The man of understanding will simply help you to find your own
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>The language of your body he will teach you, the language of
intelligence he will teach you, the language of love he will teach you,
the language of intuition he will teach you; but he will leave you
totally free to go on your own way and to move towards your own destiny.
Your star may be different. Your goal may be different. And in fact, no
two persons have to be fulfilled in the same way – they cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>So much misery in the world is caused by simple stupidity: we are
being forced to follow certain standards. Those standards have no
respect for individuals. They are derived from average understanding,
but the average is a mathematical concept; it has nothing to do with
life. Mathematics is the most dead science of all sciences, because
mathematics is the only science which is man- made. Every other science
is a discovery. Mathematics is an invention – and a very arbitrary
invention.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t think about everything; otherwise everything would point to
a single point: that your nature is not respected by any religion. They
have already fixed formulas to be imposed on you, and those principles
are more important than you. For them, you are made for those
principles, not vice versa; not that those principles are made for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>If they are made for you, then they should be made according to you.
But then, each man would have his own morality and his own religion and
his own philosophy. I don’t think that there is any harm in it – life
would be far richer. There would be great variety and there would be
great joy, because everybody would be absolutely free to follow his own
body, his own heart, his own mind, his own being. The society of the
superman will allow every man unconditional and total freedom to be
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW HAS THIS COME ABOUT? THUS I ASK MYSELF. WHAT PERSUADES THE LIVING
CREATURE TO OBEY AND TO COMMAND AND TO PRACTISE OBEDIENCE EVEN IN
COMMANDING?</p><p><br></p><p>LISTEN NOW TO MY TEACHING, YOU WISEST MEN! TEST IN EARNEST WHETHER I
HAVE CREPT INTO THE HEART OF LIFE ITSELF AND DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF ITS
HEART!</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE I FOUND A LIVING CREATURE, THERE I FOUND WILL TO POWER; AND
EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT I FOUND THE WILL TO BE MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>It is certainly a great discovery. It is because of this will to
power that those who are strong become commanders and those who are weak
become slaves. But even the lowest slave dreams that one day he will
also be the master. And even the greatest master is always afraid of his
own slaves, that somebody may betray him.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler never allowed anybody to sleep in his room. Just to
avoid somebody’s presence in the room while he is asleep, he remained a
bachelor almost his whole life – except for three hours before</p><p>he committed suicide. What was the fear? He had no friends – even
people who were thought to be very close to him, he kept as far away as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>He followed Machiavelli’s advice with totality: “Whoever is close to
you one day will topple you. Beware of the friend. The enemy is not so
dangerous, because the enemy is far away; the real danger is the friend,
because he is so close. Any moment, his sword can be at your neck.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a hierarchy in the world in many ways. That hierarchy
fulfills a double role: somebody is higher than you – he commands you;
somebody is lower than you – you command him.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a beautiful story<span class=s4></span>One of the
great emperors of India was Akbar. He had chosen</p><p>the wisest people for his court. From all over the country great
poets, painters, dancers<span class=s4></span>anybody</p><p>who was a genius in any dimension was picked up by him for his court.
And he rewarded them immensely.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was talking with his nine greatest friends. They were
called “the nine jewels of Akbar’s court.” They were the nine most
intelligent, creative people. And Akbar was a little whimsical;he used
to do things<span class=s4></span>and of course you cannot ask the
emperor, “Why?” He was not answerable to</p><p>anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he hit the face of the man standing by his side. He was the
most intelligent man in the court – his name was Birbal. Birbal waited
for a moment, perhaps considering what to do. He could not ask the
emperor, “Why have you slapped me?” – that would be too dangerous – but
something had to be done. In front of so many people, he had been
slapped – this could not be tolerated.</p><p><br></p><p>So he slapped the next man who was standing by his side. And he did a
good job; that man could not believe: “What is happening, and what kind
of thing is this? I have done nothing.” But now there was no need to
bother about it, Birbal had opened the door. That man didn’t think much,
he slapped the next man. It is said that that slapping went on all over
the capital – whoever was lower was hit.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the night, the queen suddenly hit Akbar. He said, “What are
you doing?” She said, “I don’t know what is happening, but it is going
on all over in the capital. Somebody has hit me, and of course, she was
one of your wives” – Akbar had five hundred wives – “and she was a
senior one, so I could not hit her back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The queen was the youngest wife – of course she had more power over
Akbar than any other wife; she was the most beautiful. She said, “I
cannot hit anybody else but you.” Akbar said, “This is strange. This is
my own slap that has come back to me, having taken a round all over the
city!”</p><p><br></p><p>Hierarchies serve a purpose. And there are not only hierarchies in
the government, in the church, in political parties; there are
hierarchies in the house, in the family. If you look closely, you will
find you are almost a standing member of many hierarchies. Many roads
pass through you.<span class=s4></span>somebody</p><p>is higher, somebody is lower.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole game that goes on is because of the will to power. All are
under it. It is life’s intrinsic law.</p><p><br></p><p>The husband comes from the office – the boss has been angry. And
although he was abusing and humiliating him, he had to continue to
smile, although he wanted to hit him or kill him. But that is too</p><p>risky, too dangerous – he cannot afford it. Full of anger he comes
home and starts fighting with his wife. And she cannot believe it; she
has not done anything. The whole day she has been working – preparing
his food, his clothes, his house, taking care of the children – and then
he comes and starts shouting and insulting her.</p><p><br></p><p>But she cannot say anything to him; she is financially dependent on
him. She will have to wait a little. Her boy will be coming home from
school, and she can find some fault – and it is not difficult to find
fault. Every day she could have found fault, but today is a special day:
“You have been fighting with somebody again. I can see your face is
scratched, your shirt is torn.” And she beats the boy. This is a
hierarchy.</p><p><br></p><p>And the boy cannot understand it. The whole day in school the teacher
was torturing him – perhaps that’s why they are called teachers; they
torture! – then, on the way home, a stronger boy was harassing him. And
now his mother is<span class=s4></span>He goes into his room and beats
his teddy bear. Somebody</p><p>has to do something!</p><p><br></p><p>Teddy bears don’t exist without any reason. They are part of your
hierarchy, where one line ends – because the teddy bear is unmarried
and... one line has come to an end. But lines and more lines.… Just look
at yourself and you will see everywhere<span class=s4></span>even
animals living with human beings learn the</p><p>language of power.</p><p><br></p><p>You go to a stranger’s house and his dog starts barking. But you will
see a strange phenomenon: the dog has also become a politician. He is
barking, and he is also wagging his tail – this is a welcome sign –
because he is not certain whether you are welcome in the home or not. So
he is doing both things – just being diplomatic. And as the master comes
out and shakes hands, he stops barking, and just the tail continues to
wag. Or if the master says, “Why you are bothering my dog?” then the
tail stops. Then he starts really barking and is ready to attack. Even
animals become part of your power hunger.</p><p><br></p><p>There is certainly a deep will to power. But you cannot be always on
the top; and even if you are on the top, how long can you stay there?
There are others who are pulling your legs. You are trying hard to cling
to your chair, but others also need to sit on the chair. So even if you
reach to a powerful state, fear continues. Deep in your heart you are
trembling. Your power is not reliable – just as you have taken it from
somebody else, somebody is going to take it away from you.</p><p><br></p><p>And the lowest slave also dreams, “It is not going to be always
night. One day I will also see my dawn, I will also be on my trip.” He
is continuously preparing. Whenever he has a chance to torture someone,
to insult someone, to humiliate someone who is weaker than him, he never
misses the chance.</p><p><br></p><p>When Nirvano came to India for the first time, she was very puzzled:
people walking on the street unnecessarily, for no reason at all, will
take a rock and hit some stray dog. Her first question to me was, “Why
do people hit stray dogs? They are not doing anything to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t understand. Those people are being hit, and there
is nobody else except stray dogs below them. It is a question of
hierarchy. Those people are not to be blamed – although I have all
sympathy with stray dogs. But those people are also very poor, just one
step ahead of the</p><p>stray dogs. The stray dog will also take its revenge sooner or later
on some smaller, weaker dog, or maybe a cat, or maybe a beggar – there
must be someone, somewhere in the world, who is lower in the hierarchy
than the stray dog.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world is boiling in one pot. Zarathustra’s understanding is
absolutely correct:</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE I FOUND A LIVING CREATURE, THERE I FOUND WILL TO POWER; AND
EVEN IN THE WILL OF THE SERVANT I FOUND THE WILL TO BE MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>People ask, “Why did Judas betray Jesus?” – because he also wanted to
be the master. And if Jesus remains alive, there is no chance for Judas
to be the master. In fact, he was the only educated follower of Jesus.
Amongst all his apostles, Judas was the most intelligent, most
articulate. He was next to Jesus – and that was the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not only Jesus; every master has been betrayed. The greater
the master, the more are his betrayers, because the more are his
followers. And they all want to be masters. Even if they can become a
mini-master somewhere, they will feel great joy.</p><p><br></p><p>THE WILL OF THE WEAKER PERSUADES IT TO SERVE THE STRONGER; ITS WILL
WANTS TO BE MASTER OVER THOSE WEAKER STILL: THIS DELIGHT ALONE IT IS
UNWILLING TO FORGO.</p><p><br></p><p>AND AS THE LESSER SURRENDERS TO THE GREATER, THAT IT MAY HAVE DELIGHT
AND POWER OVER THE LEAST OF ALL, SO THE GREATEST, TOO, SURRENDERS AND
FOR THE SAKE OF POWER STAKES – LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the people who have the greatest power in the world are still
hankering for more. Even if they have to stake their life it is worth
it; otherwise, what is the reason for so many wars? – thousands of wars,
so many riots, religions clashing with each other, nations fighting with
each other, political parties struggling with each other. There must be
a tremendous reason, an instinct which is even ready to sacrifice life –
even the greatest stakes his life – for more power.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS DEVOTION OF THE GREATEST IS TO ENCOUNTER RISK AND DANGER AND
PLAY DICE FOR DEATH.</p><p><br></p><p>When Edmund Hillary climbed the greatest Himalayan peak, Everest...
for almost one century, hundreds of mountaineers had tried to climb it,
and failed. Not only had they failed, almost seventy- five percent of
the mountaineers died; they never returned. Still, new mountaineers went
on trying, knowing perfectly well that many, many people had died. And
there is nothing to be found on Everest; it is eternal snow.</p><p><br></p><p>Edmund Hillary, when descended from the mountain, was addressing his
first press conference, and a journalist asked, “Why have you taken such
a risk? What is the motive?”</p><p><br></p><p>Edmund Hillary said, “Motive? There is no question of motive. Just
the very presence of Everest is a challenge and I wanted to be the first
who has climbed the mountain.”</p><p>You cannot see that he has gained anything, but certainly a
tremendous will to power, will to be the first... now nobody can take
his place in the whole of history. In the vast future, anybody who
reaches the top of Everest will be second; there is now no way to be
first. This is his gain. You cannot see it, it is not visible, but a
great power... just being the first.</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHERE SACRIFICE AND SERVICE AND LOVING GLANCES ARE, THERE TOO IS
WILL TO</p><p>BE MASTER. Even lovers are continually trying to dominate each other.
They may be playing the game of love, but deep down it is the game of
will to power; otherwise, why do lovers continuously fight? They fight
more than they love; the times of fight are longer than the moments of
love. It seems they love only to fight. And for what are they fighting?
– a domination.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE THE WEAKER STEALS BY SECRET PATHS INTO THE CASTLE AND EVEN INTO
THE</p><p>HEART OF THE MORE POWERFUL – AND STEALS THE POWER. The man fights
directly. The woman has her own feminine way of fighting; she fights
through more secretive paths. And more often, almost always, she is the
winner – because man is so tired of fighting outside in the world, in
the office, with the customers, with the people, with the politics, that
he wants, at least in the house, some peace of mind. And that peace of
mind is possible only if he becomes a henpecked husband.</p><p><br></p><p>It is rare, almost impossible, to find a man who is not henpecked. It
is simply an absolute necessity; otherwise he will have no rest. The
wife is resting the whole day, she is ready. By the time he comes home,
tattered and battered, he is almost finished. Just a little push is
needed and he will be flat on the floor. Every husband enters the house
as if he is a thief, not a master as he pretends to be outside.</p><p><br></p><p>AND LIFE ITSELF TOLD ME THIS SECRET: ‘BEHOLD,’ IT SAID, ’I AM THAT
WHICH MUST</p><p>OVERCOME ITSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN.’ Life is the energy, just like the
waves of the ocean, that will come again and again and go on shattering
on the beach, on the rocks, being followed by other waves. Eternally it
has been so.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is also an invisible energy which goes on and on with only one
desire – to overcome itself. It wants to be higher; it wants to be more
powerful; it wants to be more successful. Whatever it is, it wants to
reach higher than that point. The energy of life’s ocean is exactly the
same. The waves go on – don’t ask the motive. It is the very nature of
the ocean, and it is the very nature of life.</p><p><br></p><p>’TO BE SURE, YOU CALL IT WILL TO PROCREATE OR IMPULSE TOWARDS A GOAL,
TOWARDS THE HIGHER, MORE DISTANT, MORE MANIFOLD: BUT ALL THIS IS ONE AND
ONE SECRET.</p><p><br></p><p>’I WOULD RATHER PERISH THAN RENOUNCE THIS ONE THING; AND TRULY, WHERE
THERE IS PERISHING AND THE FALLING OF LEAVES, BEHOLD, THERE LIFE
SACRIFICES ITSELF – FOR THE SAKE OF POWER!</p><p><br></p><p>’THAT I HAVE TO BE STRUGGLE AND BECOMING AND GOAL AND CONFLICT OF
GOALS: AH, HE WHO DIVINES MY WILL SURELY DIVINES, TOO, ALONG WHAT
CROOKED PATHS IT HAS TO GO!</p><p><br></p><p>‘WHATEVER I CREATE AND HOWEVER MUCH I LOVE IT – SOON I HAVE TO OPPOSE
IT AND MY LOVE: THUS WILL MY WILL HAVE IT.’</p><p>Although I create – and whatever I create I create with love – I also
destroy, because I want to go beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>‘AND YOU TOO, ENLIGHTENED MEN, ARE ONLY A PATH AND A FOOTSTEP OF MY
WILL; TRULY, MY WILL TO POWER WALKS WITH THE FEET OF YOUR WILL TO
TRUTH!’</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, “Even the will to truth is nothing but the will to
power, because by knowing the truth you will have the greatest power in
existence.” He reduces every desire and every longing, even the longing
of enlightenment, to the will to power – because the moment you are
enlightened, you have immense power over yourself, absolute power over
your consciousness. Zarathustra cannot be said to be wrong. He has found
a very key word, “will to power.”</p><p><br></p><p>’HE WHO SHOT THE DOCTRINE OF “WILL TO EXISTENCE” AT TRUTH CERTAINLY
DID NOT</p><p>HIT THE TRUTH: THIS WILL – DOES NOT EXIST!’ “Will to existence” does
not exist... unless will to existence serves the will to power;
otherwise it has no meaning. You would not like just to vegetate and go
on living. You would not like to be a mere survivor.</p><p><br></p><p>’FOR WHAT DOES NOT EXIST CANNOT WILL; BUT THAT WHICH IS IN EXISTENCE,
HOW</p><p>COULD IT STILL WANT TO COME INTO EXISTENCE?’ You are already in
existence, so what is the point of will to existence?</p><p><br></p><p>He is contradicting those philosophers who call themselves
existentialists. Although they have come into being in this century
only, fragments of their teaching were available in Zarathustra’s time,
too. There were a few thinkers here and there – not of great importance.
It never became that important a philosophy as it became in this
century.</p><p><br></p><p>But Zarathustra says, “You are already in existence; hence there is
no point for the will to existence.” Existence certainly is needed, but
it is needed only for the will to power; otherwise, who wants to
exist?</p><p><br></p><p>’ONLY WHERE LIFE IS, THERE IS ALSO WILL: NOT WILL TO LIFE, BUT – SO I
TEACH YOU – WILL TO POWER!</p><p><br></p><p>‘THE LIVING CREATURE VALUES MANY THINGS HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF; YET
OUT OF THIS EVALUATION ITSELF SPEAKS – THE WILL TO POWER!’</p><p><br></p><p>TRULY, I SAY TO YOU: UNCHANGING GOOD AND EVIL DOES NOT EXIST! FROM
OUT OF THEMSELVES THEY MUST OVERCOME THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU EXERT POWER WITH YOUR VALUES AND DOCTRINES OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU
ASSESSORS OF VALUES; AND THIS IS YOUR HIDDEN LOVE AND THE GLITTERING,
TREMBLING, AND OVERFLOWING OF YOUR SOULS.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT A MIGHTIER POWER AND A NEW OVERCOMING GROW FROM OUT YOUR VALUES:
EGG AND EGG-SHELL BREAK AGAINST THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE WHO HAS TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVIL, TRULY, HAS FIRST TO
BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES.</p><p>THUS THE GREATEST EVIL BELONGS WITH THE GREATEST GOOD: HOWEVER, IS
THE CREATIVE GOOD?</p><p><br></p><p>LET US speak OF THIS, YOU WISEST MEN, EVEN IF IT IS A BAD THING. TO
BE SILENT IS WORSE; ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, “I may not be understood. There is every possibility I
may be misunderstood. But I have to speak it, because to be silent is
worse.”</p><p><br></p><p>... ALL SUPPRESSED TRUTHS BECOME POISONOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>AND LET EVERYTHING THAT CAN BREAK UPON OUR TRUTHS – BREAK! THERE IS
MANY A HOUSE STILL TO BE BUILT!</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying that on the path of creativity you have to be
destructive too; and if you want higher values, you will have to destroy
lower values. If you want to create better houses, you will have to
destroy the old ones. The real creator is almost always a destroyer.</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying it because he is destroying old values, and he is
creating a new value. The new value is will to power. For that new value
everything else can be sacrificed. Even life, even all your concepts of
good and evil, your morality, your religion, your philosophy – nothing
matters.</p><p><br></p><p>The superman has only one religion: the religion of the will to
power.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

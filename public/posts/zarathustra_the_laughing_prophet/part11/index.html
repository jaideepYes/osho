THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nZarathustra has not any doctrine to preach, he has not any ideal that every man has to become. He has no fixed morality; his trust is in spontaneous consciousness. His trust in his own consciousness is so great that he can deny God without any difficulty. On the path of truth, one has to choose either God, or one’s own being.\nIf you choose God, you have chosen your slavery, and you can never become more than a preacher and a victim of a whimsical God.But if you choose yourself you have to deny God. God is the greatest bondage for those who want to be themselves. Because humanity has chosen God, it has denied itself. And you can see the ultimate mess into which man has fallen.\nOnce you are a slave, you forget all responsibilities for yourself; then God takes care of you. And if God is just a hypothesis, just a belief, then you are in real trouble. You were a reality, your consciousness could have grown if you had trusted it, but you denied the reality in favor of the fiction, because the fiction is more comfortable. It relieves you of responsibilities, but it also takes away your freedom.\nRemember this, that freedom and responsibilities are always together. You cannot just choose freedom, or just responsibilities. Either you have to choose them both, or you have to deny them both.\nZarathustra denies God because he loves man. Zarathustra denies God because he can see clearly that man himself can become a god. The only hindrance of his becoming a god is a belief in some other god; then he remains simply a worshiper, a believer. His insight is clear, and these twenty-five centuries that have passed between him and us have proved everything that he is going to say in this morning’s statements.\nMan has become very small. He cannot grow in the shadow of an almighty God. Just a small rosebush cannot grow under the shadow of a huge tree. And when you decide for anything fictitious invented by man himself, this becomes the beginning of your fall. This becomes the shattering of your dignity.\nA man of dignity trusts in himself, and through himself he trusts in existence. He is real, existence is real, but God is just a creation of the priests to lead you astray from your reality. And once you have gone away from your nature and your reality, you are going to be more and more miserable, more and more mean, more and more jealous.\nThe very hypothesis of God has made man’s life a tragedy. He has forgotten to sing, he has forgotten to dance, he has forgotten himself. He does not know who he is, what are his potentials, and what are his basic rights given by nature. He lives in darkness – and he is not a creature of darkness. He lives unnaturally, in a perverted way that destroys his all grace and all his beauty and all the possibilities for his growth.\nThese words have to be understood very clearly, because they are almost prophetic. They are about you! They are about the world that has come to be in these twenty-five centuries.\nI GO AMONG THIS PEOPLE AND LET FALL MANY A WORD; BUT THEY KNOW NEITHER HOW\nTO TAKE NOR TO KEEP.Man listens only if something supports his prejudices; then he feels good that he has always been right. He listens only if you speak the language of fictions, which he thinks is the ultimate truth. But if you speak the truth he becomes completely closed. He does not allow any truth to enter in his being, to disturb his comfortable beliefs. He listens only to what he wants to listen to, and he takes into himself only what fits with all kinds of garbage that he has been carrying down the ages.\nAnything new – and truth is always new – freaks him out. Anything new creates a disturbance in him. If he keeps it, then what to do with the old ideas, ancient mythologies, half-baked truths? He has to throw them out – that is too risky.\nHe is part of a crowd. If he keeps the new he becomes a stranger to his own crowd. He will be laughed at, he will be condemned. And if he is insistent, he can also be crucified. The crowd does not like the strangers. The crowd is very much against anybody disturbing its sleep – although its sleep is nothing but a nightmare. But it is the only thing that the crowd has got. It has no idea, not even a distant echo, that life can be something else too, that this is not the only way of living; life can have a different style.\nRight now he lives in a sad, miserable, torturous style. But this style has been supported by millions of people for thousands of years, and this is thought to be religious, spiritual. This is thought to be a necessary sacrifice if you want to realize God.\nZarathustra is a stranger. Obviously his words cannot be taken and cannot be kept. In fact, people like Zarathustra are nothing but a nuisance to the miserable crowd – although they bring the good news. But nobody is ready to listen to them.\nIt is one of the most miserable facts about humanity that it has become accustomed to chains, superstitions, slavery, commandments. And it has forgotten completely that it has a soul, a sensitivity, an intelligence, which can be refined and which can become his only religion.\nReligion is not in the scriptures, and not in the words of the priest; religion is a flowering of your own intelligence, of your own consciousness. It is not in the churches, nor in the temples, nor in the synagogues. Unless you become a temple, unless you become spacious enough – pure and clean, just like the sky, unbounded – you will not know anything of religious experience.\nAnd this is the whole message of Zarathustra: how man can become a superman. God is not his message, his message is that you are carrying the seeds of superman but you are not taking any care about them. You have the right soil in your heart, you have the right love and the tenderness; just you have to be a gardener of your own inner world, and your life will become a festivity, a celebration. And this festiveness, this ecstasy, this celebration is the only religion there is. All else is just the profession of the priests to exploit you.\nAnd they have exploited badly. They have taken away all your blood, they have taken away everything that was important in you. They have destroyed you completely, and they have left only corpses behind.\nTHEY ARE SURPRISED – when they listen to Zarathustra – THAT I HAVE NOT COME TO RAIL AT THEIR LUSTS AND VICES. That’s what the priests have always been doing – condemning their lust, condemning their vices, condemning their desires. They have become accustomed to that. The priests never praise anything in the inner world of man. Everything is wrong – you are a born sinner. They have convinced you, through thousands of years of conditioning, that it is impossible for you to listen to any other kind of message.\nTHEY ARE SURPRISED THAT I HAVE NOT COME TO RAIL AT THEIR LUSTS AND VICES; AND TRULY, I HAVE NOT COME TO WARN AGAINST PICKPOCKETS, EITHER!\nAND WHEN I CRY: ‘CURSE ALL THE COWARDLY DEVILS WITHIN YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO WHIMPER AND CLASP THEIR HANDS AND WORSHIP,’ THEN THEY CRY: ‘ZARATHUSTRA IS GODLESS.’\nWho worships in you? Have you ever pondered over the problem? Is it not something cowardly in you that kneels down before stone statues made by man? It cannot be something courageous. One that worships is hiding his cowardliness in a beautiful word.\nWho is it in you that surrenders, becomes a Christian or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan? Is it a lion in you, or a sheep?\nJesus used to say to his people, “You are my sheep and I am your shepherd.” And not a single one of his followers ever raised the question, “You are insulting us. Why should we be sheep? Why should we not be lions, and why should we not bear in us a lion’s roar?”\nNaturally, lions don’t need shepherds – that is the problem. If people are really awakened to their bravery, then they don’t need any shepherd, they don’t need any savior, they don’t need any messiah. They are their own saviors; and that gives pride and dignity and beauty to human beings.\nTo call human beings sheep is so insulting, so humiliating that one wonders how people listened to all this. And even today millions of Christians around the world – and that is the greatest religion as far as numbers are concerned – think of themselves as the sheep of Jesus Christ. If somebody wants to be a shepherd, he has to reduce the whole of humanity into an ugly state, into cowards.\nWhenever you are in difficulty, why do you start immediately praying to God? – although you know your prayers are never heard; there is nobody to hear them. It is possible, just by coincidence, you may think that your prayer has been heard.\nA man used to come to me – he had no child, and he said to me, “I cannot believe in God unless I have a child. And I hope that if God wants a believer, he should give me a child.”\nNow there is no need... even if there is a God, what is the use of having this fellow as a believer – to fulfill his demands?\nA child was born to him, and he came to me with sweets and fruits. He was distributing them in the whole neighborhood. I said, “What has happened?”\nHe said, “God has heard me.”\nI said to him, “Just wait a little. God cannot be so much concerned about you.” The universe is big, and this beautiful planet earth is such a small thing. Even our own sun is thousands of times bigger than this earth, and even this great sun that is our life is a very mediocre star in the universe. There are millions of times bigger stars than this sun. And scientists guess that there must be at least fifty thousand planets in the whole universe where life exists. And this poor fellow is thinking that God has heard his prayer!\nI told him a story by Bertrand Russell. The Vatican pope dies. Obviously he knocks on the doors of heaven, because heaven and hell are just in front of each other. Hours of knocking... because the door is so big, he cannot see its end. He tries hard – it is so vast.\nBut finally a window opens in the door, and Saint Peter looks out. With great difficulty, he finds this pope standing there – just as you can find an ant standing on your door. It is very difficult to have a dialogue. The pope shouts. Saint Peter says, “Say it a little louder, because you are too small.”\nHe says, “You don’t understand. I am the representative of Jesus Christ; I am coming from the earth. I was the pope in the Vatican, and what kind of reception is this?”\nAnd Saint Peter says to him, “We have never heard of any earth. You will have to give me the index number.”\nThe pope says, “Index number?”\nSaint Peter says, “There are so many planets that unless I get the index number of your earth, I cannot go to the library to find out where you come from. What do you mean by the Vatican, and who is this Jesus Christ?”\nThe pope shouts, “Are you kidding? Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of God.”\nSaint Peter said, “Do you think he finished after only one son, in the whole eternity he could produce only one son? I will go to the library, but without an index number it is very difficult to find out... which earth do you mean?”\nThe pope says, “I am coming from the solar system.”\nHe says, “That’s perfectly good, but there are millions of solar systems. Which solar system? What Index number?”\nThe pope says, “It is better you take me directly to God.”\nSaint Peter said, “I myself have not seen Him. I am just a doorkeeper, and God is too big. I have only heard about Him. You will have to forgive me. But I will do my best to find the index number, find out about Jesus Christ and about this Vatican.”\nHe goes off and after hours he returns. And he says, “It is almost impossible. Millions of planets... there is no way to pinpoint where your earth is, where your solar system is. And anyway, what right do you have to enter into heaven? The easiest way is... on the other side of the road... there they don’t ask who you are, they are nice people. They don’t ask whether you deserve hell or not; the moment they see you, they grab you. You just try the other place.”\nHe was woken up by the very idea that he has to go to hell, and the devils will grab him – they don’t even ask who you are. And then he remembered all the tortures, the hellfire... and the most difficult thing about the Christian hell is that it has no exit. You can enter, but you cannot get out. Otherwise, just as a tourist one could enjoy. But once you get in, you become an eternal resident without any application to leave. He woke up out of fear; he was perspiring all over. He was not dead, he was dreaming.\nI told this man, “The very idea is egoistic – that God should hear your prayer, should give proof by giving you a child. Just wait for a few more proofs, because one proof is not enough. No science will allow a single proof; it has to be repeatedly proved.\n“You ask something else. You suffer from migraine, now start asking, ‘Take my migraine away; otherwise I will not believe in you.’ And you have a good strategy to blackmail God. He wants you to\nbelieve in Him, so exploit him as much as you can. Your brother is unemployed, ask for employment. Your father has cancer, ask for his cancer to be removed... you have so many problems. The child was not a problem at all. And are you certain the child is yours?”\nHe said, “I never thought that you will be so rude with me.”\nI said, “I am not being rude, because you have been trying for years, and there was no child coming, and suddenly it has come. Just look around the neighborhood, some rascal is doing it. Don’t jump to God, first look around. There are so many rascals in the neighborhood.”\nHe said, “That I know – there are rascals.”\nI said, “Go back home. Don’t waste your money in distributing sweets and fruits, first find out whose son has been born. Is it yours?”\nHe said, “To meet you is always a trouble. Now you have created a suspicion in my mind. I already have a migraine. Instead of being a help, now I will look with suspicion at every person who is connected with my family – the servants, the neighbors, the relatives. And to tell you the truth,” he whispered, “I had my suspicions, because the doctor has been telling me, ‘You cannot have a child.’\n“But you should not be so harsh. I was happy that God has given me the child. And God is all-powerful; even if the doctor says I cannot have a child... God can change my chemistry, my hormones, my sperm. But I will go back. Now I cannot go on distributing sweets. I am afraid that you are right – you may be right!”\nThe people who worship are cowards. The people who pray are naggers. Prayer is nothing but nagging God, “Do this!” – every morning and evening. Mohammedans are the best nagging people; they nag God five times a day! Hindus don’t let Him even sleep in the beautiful mornings. They get up early, at three o’clock, and start praying. Sufis pray in the middle of the night.\nEven if there had been a God in the beginning, He must have gone mad by now! So many people, and so many demands.… But you don’t see that when you pray you are simply demanding. And a prayer cannot be a demand; it can only be a gratefulness.\nWhen you worship, it cannot be out of your cowardliness; it can only be a lion’s roar. The sheer joy, the overflowing energy.…\nAND WHEN I CRY: ’CURSE ALL THE COWARDLY DEVILS... THEY ALL CRY: ’ZARATHUSTRA IS\nGODLESS.’ They don’t listen. On the contrary, they start abusing Zarathustra.\nAND THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CRY OF THEIR TEACHERS OF SUBMISSION; BUT IT IS INTO PRECISELY THEIR EARS THAT I LOVE TO SHOUT: YES! I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS!\nZarathustra respects what is evolving in man so deeply, so profoundly that he can sacrifice all gods for its growth.\nTHIS IS MY SERMON FOR THEIR EARS: I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS, WHO SAYS ’WHO IS MORE GODLESS THAN I, THAT I MAY REJOICE IN HIS TEACHING?’I am more godless\nthan Zarathustra; but it is very difficult to bridge the gap, twenty-five centuries, because at least Zarathustra goes on denying God... I don’t even care to deny him.\nEven to deny God is, in a negative way, keeping his name alive.\nI want humanity simply to forget that nightmare of thousands of years that is associated with God. I don’t think it is even necessary to say, “There is no God.” It simply is not.\nI would have given Zarathustra good company, but perhaps twenty-five centuries ago it was difficult to find a man... particularly in Iran, where Zarathustra was teaching his tremendously important philosophy. But in India at that very time there was Mahavira who denies God, and there was Gautam Buddha who denies God. But their denial is very sophisticated.\nZarathustra is very raw and very wild, and that is his beauty. He does not speak in a polished way; he speaks like a child, utterly innocent. He does not speak in a roundabout way, he does not speak in a sophisticated way. Buddha and Mahavira both speak in such a way that many people may not understand that they don’t believe in God.\nBut Zarathustra is straight. He simply calls a spade a spade. And that’s what I love in him – his rawness. He is not a diamond – cut, polished; he is directly from the mine – uncut, unpolished. Therein lies his beauty and his truth.\nI AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS: WHERE SHALL I FIND MY EQUAL? ALL THOSE WHO GIVE THEMSELVES THEIR OWN WILL AND RENOUNCE ALL SUBMISSION, THEY ARE MY\nEQUALS. Those who renounce all submission, surrendering to any god, being obedient to any scriptures.…\nThe other-world teachers have been insisting, “Renounce the world.” Zarathustra is saying, “Renounce your scriptures, and the renouncers! Renounce submission, renounce your cowardliness.” Be authentically yourself, and only then your life sources can start flowing.\nBUT WHY DO I SPEAK WHERE NO ONE HAS MY KIND OF EARS? AND SO I WILL SHOUT\nIT OUT TO ALL THE WINDS. One can understand the difficulty. Particularly I can understand the difficulty. Many mystics have found the same problem.\nBodhidharma, one of the greatest masters, who became the source of the tradition of Zen, remained for nine years facing the wall. He would not face his audience. People would ask questions and he would answer to the wall.\nEmperor Wu of China asked him, “This is a little strange. I have never seen such meetings. The speaker has to face the audience; you keep your back towards the audience. What kind of behavior is this?”\nBodhidharma said, “I used to keep, just like other speakers, the audience in front of me. But I found just a wall, and it was hurting, so I decided that it is better to keep the audience behind me and face the wall. The wall does not hurt, because it is a wall. It does not listen, but you cannot expect a wall to listen. But when I talk to people, and I see just walls around, it hurts. And I cannot stop speaking, because that which has grown in me is overflowing, and I cannot control it.\nZarathustra says, BUT WHY DO I SPEAK WHERE NO ONE HAS MY KIND OF EARS? AND SO\nI WILL SHOUT IT OUT TO ALL THE WINDS. I will not bother about people, whether they hear or not, I will talk to the winds. Perhaps they may carry the word, perhaps they may carry the message to the right kind of ears.\nBut it is very unfortunate that people like Zarathustra and Bodhidharma should feel so frustrated with our so-called humanity – and the intelligentsia particularly are more dead, because they already think they know.\nYOU WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER.This is something so prophetic that it has come\nto be true.\nYOU WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER, YOU SMALL PEOPLE! YOU WILL CRUMBLE AWAY, YOU COMFORTABLE PEOPLE! YOU WILL YET PERISH –\nTHROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL VIRTUES, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL OMISSIONS, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL SUBMISSIONS!\nWhat are our virtues? Is what our so-called religions teach virtuous? In the eyes of Zarathustra they are so small that your virtues – rather than making you greater, giving you a grandeur – make you even smaller.\nI have heard about a woman who was a miser. In her whole life, she had only given a rotten carrot to a beggar – that was all you could call virtuous in her. She died, and the angels came to take her. The problem was the carrot – she has done a virtuous act; you cannot send her to hell.\nSo they told the woman, “This is your carrot that you gave to a beggar. This is your only virtue, so hold onto it, and it will go like a rocket towards heaven. Remember not to lose the grip.”\nThe people who had gathered – hearing that the old woman, the old miser, has died – were surprised that the woman was being uplifted by something they could not see. But she was going upwards! They could not lose such a chance, so somebody took hold of her legs.\nIt became a long queue. And the carrot was going up and the woman was very angry – angry naturally because it was her virtue, and all these neighbors hanging in a long queueshe could not\ntolerate it. When they reached near heaven, she shouted, “You idiots. You have never done anything virtuous. This carrot is MINE!” But at that moment the carrot was lost, and with the woman the whole queue fell down to earth. The woman was dead, but she killed almost two hundred people.\nWhat are our virtues: that you have given something to eat to a beggar, that you have donated for a temple to be raised. But do you think these are virtues?\nI have heard, a man had just won a lottery, and he was so happy. Coming home he had to pass a bridge, and on the side of the bridge there was sitting an old blind beggar, who had always been sitting there. He had never given anything to him, but today was a different day; he had got such a big lump sum of money. He gave one rupee to the beggar.\nThe beggar looked at it and said, “Sir, it is fake.”\nThe man said, “My God! You are blind, and you can see whether the coin is fake or authentic.”\nHe said, “To tell you the truth, this is not my place; it belongs to my friend who is blind. Today he has gone to see the matinee show. I am the other fellow who sits on the other side of the bridge. I am just keeping his place, so nobody else gets into it. It is a very good corner.\n“First I also used to be blind, but people were cheating, and I could not even say to them that they are cheating, so I dropped that idea. Now I have become deaf. Right now I am not, but when you see me in my place I am completely deaf – because I saw that at least I can prevent people cheating me.”\nYou think you are doing virtue by giving to a beggar; the beggar thinks he is cheating you, the beggar thinks that you are a fool. What are your virtues? Your virtues make you... but you are not great, you are not enjoying your virtues. They must be too small.\nZarathustra says, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL VIRTUES, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL OMISSIONS, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL SUBMISSIONS!\nTOO INDULGENT, TOO YIELDING: THAT IS THE STATE OF YOUR SOIL! BUT IN ORDER TO GROW BIG, A TREE WANTS TO STRIKE HARD ROOTS INTO HARD ROCKS!\nThis small, so-called religiousness will not help. Because you fasted one day, you pray every day, you go to the temple every day, you kneel down before statues of God... just think what value all these things have. They keep you small.\nTO GROW BIG, A TREE WANTS TO STRIKE HARD ROOTS INTO HARD ROCKS!\n‘IT IS GIVEN’ – THAT IS ALSO A DOCTRINE OF SUBMISSION. BUT I TELL YOU, YOU COMFORTABLE PEOPLE: IT IS TAKEN.\nA very important point to be remembered. It has been said by all the teachers, without exception, that truth is given to you – given by God. Zarathustra says, “It is not given, it is taken.”\nOnly one man in this century, George Gurdjieff, had a similar idea, even more rough and more hard. He used to say, “Unless you are ready to steal the truth you will not get it.” It is not only a question of taking; you have to steal it, you have to risk everything – even your respectability, even your so-called virtue, your morality.\nTruth cannot be given by anyone to anybody else. Zarathustra is right: it has to be taken.And to take it, you need to be not a coward, not a slave, not a beggar, but a lion: strong, able to take it.\nA given truth is just a lie. And all your truths are given truths. Who has given you your God? Who has given you your truth? Who has given you your religion?\nJust check one thing: has it been given to you, or have you taken it? If it has been given to you, throw it away – it means nothing, it is self-deception. You have to be strong enough to take it.\nOH, THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD MY SAYING: ’ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL – BUT FIRST BE\nSUCH AS CAN WILL!’ – a very subtle difference, but very great. He is saying, ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL. You understand it, there is nothing difficult in understanding it – ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL – but are you capable of willing?\nBUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL! – because willing needs a non-submissive, strong, independent individuality; otherwise you cannot will. You can only pray; you can ask, you can beg. Your will will remain impotent. Become more crystallized, more of an individual, less a part of the crowd, so that you can will.\nALWAYS LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES. This is a famous statement, later on made by Jesus. But Zarathustra’s insights are far deeper.\nHe says – he had no idea about Jesus, Jesus came five hundred years afterwards; but the saying must have been in existence – ALWAYS LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES – BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS LOVE THEMSELVES. That is more difficult. Love them as they are – not as yourselves.\nLoving your neighbor as yourself is simply loving your own image in the mirror. It is not a great virtue, it is a small virtue.\nLove the neighbor as he is. Whether he fulfills your ideas or is against them, whether he looks moral to you or immoral, these are unimportant things. He is a human being, and he has every right to be himself. Love him as he is. Your love should not become a demand, your love should not ask him to be different than he is.\nThis statement, LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES, has another implication also which Zarathustra has not mentioned, which I have come across almost every day.\nAnd this is how man remains blind.\nLOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES... and you have forgotten one thing: Do you love yourself? It is very rare to find a person who loves himself. People hate themselves. They don’t want to be the way they are; they want to be somebody else... somebody else has a better nose, somebody else has better eyes, somebody else has a better body, somebody is more proportionate, somebody has better intelligence.\nPeople hate themselves. And your religions have been teaching you contradictory things, which have created confusion and a chaos in your mind. On the one hand they say, “You have to become like Gautam Buddha.” Then how can you love yourself? You have to hate yourself, you have to destroy yourself, dismantle yourself, and try to be like Gautam Buddha or Jesus or Krishna.\nOn the one hand they say, “Be like the great religious leaders, saints,” and on the other hand they go on saying, “Love your neighbor as yourself.”\nIf you really love your neighbor as yourself, you will have to hate him, because you hate yourself. You don’t find anything in yourself which is worth loving. In fact, when people fall in love with each\nother, both are surprised: “My God, what has this man found in me which I have not found myself?” And the man also thinks, “This woman is a little bit crazy – she loves me, who has lived with himself for all these thirty years and has not found a single thing worth any value.”\nLovers surprise each other. Although nobody says it, both feel, deep down, really strange – such a beautiful woman... a beauty loving a beast! And the beautiful woman knows perfectly well that she is a bitch – such a young fellow, so beautiful falling in love with a bitch!\nBut these are inside things. They will become apparent after the honeymoon – then they will come to know each other – but then it is too late. They have promised to each other, “I will love you for my whole life. And not only in this life, if I am born again I will love you again. My love is not the ordinary love that changes, it is love eternal.”\nNow, what to do with your promises when you discover who the other person is in reality? Then they go on accumulating hate for each other – pretending, acting love, but it becomes just acting.\nAMONG THIS PEOPLE I AM MY OWN FORERUNNER, MY OWN COCK-CROW THROUGH DARK\nLANES. Every great mystic has been a forerunner to himself, because every great mystic has come before his time. You can see it – Zarathustra is even today not our contemporary. He is still ahead of us; he had come too soon, too early.\nBUT THEIR HOUR IS COMING! AND MINE TOO IS COMING! HOURLY WILL THEY BECOME SMALLER, POORER, MORE BARREN – POOR WEEDS! POOR SOIL!\nAND SOON THEY SHALL STAND BEFORE ME LIKE ARID GRASS AND STEPPE, AND TRULY! WEARY OF THEMSELVES – AND LONGING FOR FIRE RATHER THAN FOR WATER!\nPerhaps we have come to the point... his prophecy seems to be coming true. Man is preparing more for war than for peace. Man is creating more for death than for life. Seventy percent of all the wealth of the world is devoted to creating nuclear weapons.\nWEARY OF THEMSELVES... perhaps humanity is tired now of being small, being too mean, being too jealous, being too ugly, and has lost all hope of growing out of this muddy state, has forgotten that lotuses are born in mud... AND LONGING FOR FIRE RATHER THAN FOR WATER!\nIt seems that people are deep-down ready to commit a global suicide; otherwise there is no reason why so much money should be wasted, and so much energy should be wasted for war.\nAll that money and all that energy and all that scientific genius can make this earth a paradise. But nobody is interested in that. Everybody is interested in finding more and more dangerous weapons. And now it is absolutely clear that nobody can be the victor, nobody can be the defeated; all will be dead. Still man goes on accumulating.\nEven poorer countries, like Pakistan or India, are dying to create nuclear weapons. And the scientific surveys show that by the end of this century... right now only five nations have nuclear weapons, but by the end of this century twenty-five more nations will have joined in the nuclear club. Thirty nations will be nuclear powers.\nWhat has happened to man’s intelligence, that it is only devoted to a single cause – death?\nO BLESSED HOUR OF THE LIGHTNING! O MYSTERY BEFORE NOONTIDE! ONE DAY I SHALL TURN THEM INTO RUNNING FIRE AND HERALDS WITH TONGUES OF FLAME –\nONE DAY THEY SHALL PROCLAIM WITH TONGUES OF FLAME: IT IS COMING, IT IS NEAR, THE GREAT NOONTIDE!\nBut Zarathustra still hopes that we can even transform fire into a creative energy. You cook your food on fire and you can also burn your house with fire. Fire is neutral. All energies are neutral; it depends on you to what use you want to put them.\nZarathustra is not weary of himself. He still hopes that one day he will be able to declare... THE GREAT NOONTIDE.\nThat is his symbolic expression for the greatest explosion of light, love, individuality, freedom. All these he calls, THE GREAT NOONTIDE – the highest peak in human consciousness.\n... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6212","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zarathustra_the_laughing_prophet/>Zarathustra.

–</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY THEY SHALL PROCLAIM WITH TONGUES OF FLAME: IT IS COMING, IT
IS NEAR, THE GREAT NOONTIDE!</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra has not any doctrine to preach, he has not any ideal that
every man has to become. He has no fixed morality; his trust is in
spontaneous consciousness. His trust in his own consciousness is so
great that he can deny God without any difficulty. On the path of truth,
one has to choose either God, or one’s own being.</p><p><br></p><p>If you choose God, you have chosen your slavery, and you can never
become more than a preacher and a victim of a whimsical God.But if you
choose yourself you have to deny God. God is the greatest bondage for
those who want to be themselves. Because humanity has chosen God, it has
denied itself. And you can see the ultimate mess into which man has
fallen.</p><p>Once you are a slave, you forget all responsibilities for yourself;
then God takes care of you. And if God is just a hypothesis, just a
belief, then you are in real trouble. You were a reality, your
consciousness could have grown if you had trusted it, but you denied the
reality in favor of the fiction, because the fiction is more
comfortable. It relieves you of responsibilities, but it also takes away
your freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this, that freedom and responsibilities are always together.
You cannot just choose freedom, or just responsibilities. Either you
have to choose them both, or you have to deny them both.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra denies God because he loves man. Zarathustra denies God
because he can see clearly that man himself can become a god. The only
hindrance of his becoming a god is a belief in some other god; then he
remains simply a worshiper, a believer. His insight is clear, and these
twenty-five centuries that have passed between him and us have proved
everything that he is going to say in this morning’s statements.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has become very small. He cannot grow in the shadow of an
almighty God. Just a small rosebush cannot grow under the shadow of a
huge tree. And when you decide for anything fictitious invented by man
himself, this becomes the beginning of your fall. This becomes the
shattering of your dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of dignity trusts in himself, and through himself he trusts in
existence. He is real, existence is real, but God is just a creation of
the priests to lead you astray from your reality. And once you have gone
away from your nature and your reality, you are going to be more and
more miserable, more and more mean, more and more jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>The very hypothesis of God has made man’s life a tragedy. He has
forgotten to sing, he has forgotten to dance, he has forgotten himself.
He does not know who he is, what are his potentials, and what are his
basic rights given by nature. He lives in darkness – and he is not a
creature of darkness. He lives unnaturally, in a perverted way that
destroys his all grace and all his beauty and all the possibilities for
his growth.</p><p><br></p><p>These words have to be understood very clearly, because they are
almost prophetic. They are about you! They are about the world that has
come to be in these twenty-five centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>I GO AMONG THIS PEOPLE AND LET FALL MANY A WORD; BUT THEY KNOW
NEITHER HOW</p><p>TO TAKE NOR TO KEEP.Man listens only if something supports his
prejudices; then he feels good that he has always been right. He listens
only if you speak the language of fictions, which he thinks is the
ultimate truth. But if you speak the truth he becomes completely closed.
He does not allow any truth to enter in his being, to disturb his
comfortable beliefs. He listens only to what he wants to listen to, and
he takes into himself only what fits with all kinds of garbage that he
has been carrying down the ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything new – and truth is always new – freaks him out. Anything new
creates a disturbance in him. If he keeps it, then what to do with the
old ideas, ancient mythologies, half-baked truths? He has to throw them
out – that is too risky.</p><p>He is part of a crowd. If he keeps the new he becomes a stranger to
his own crowd. He will be laughed at, he will be condemned. And if he is
insistent, he can also be crucified. The crowd does not like the
strangers. The crowd is very much against anybody disturbing its sleep –
although its sleep is nothing but a nightmare. But it is the only thing
that the crowd has got. It has no idea, not even a distant echo, that
life can be something else too, that this is not the only way of living;
life can have a different style.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now he lives in a sad, miserable, torturous style. But this
style has been supported by millions of people for thousands of years,
and this is thought to be religious, spiritual. This is thought to be a
necessary sacrifice if you want to realize God.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is a stranger. Obviously his words cannot be taken and
cannot be kept. In fact, people like Zarathustra are nothing but a
nuisance to the miserable crowd – although they bring the good news. But
nobody is ready to listen to them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the most miserable facts about humanity that it has
become accustomed to chains, superstitions, slavery, commandments. And
it has forgotten completely that it has a soul, a sensitivity, an
intelligence, which can be refined and which can become his only
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is not in the scriptures, and not in the words of the
priest; religion is a flowering of your own intelligence, of your own
consciousness. It is not in the churches, nor in the temples, nor in the
synagogues. Unless you become a temple, unless you become spacious
enough – pure and clean, just like the sky, unbounded – you will not
know anything of religious experience.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the whole message of Zarathustra: how man can become a
superman. God is not his message, his message is that you are carrying
the seeds of superman but you are not taking any care about them. You
have the right soil in your heart, you have the right love and the
tenderness; just you have to be a gardener of your own inner world, and
your life will become a festivity, a celebration. And this festiveness,
this ecstasy, this celebration is the only religion there is. All else
is just the profession of the priests to exploit you.</p><p><br></p><p>And they have exploited badly. They have taken away all your blood,
they have taken away everything that was important in you. They have
destroyed you completely, and they have left only corpses behind.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY ARE SURPRISED – when they listen to Zarathustra – THAT I HAVE
NOT COME TO RAIL AT THEIR LUSTS AND VICES. That’s what the priests have
always been doing – condemning their lust, condemning their vices,
condemning their desires. They have become accustomed to that. The
priests never praise anything in the inner world of man. Everything is
wrong – you are a born sinner. They have convinced you, through
thousands of years of conditioning, that it is impossible for you to
listen to any other kind of message.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY ARE SURPRISED THAT I HAVE NOT COME TO RAIL AT THEIR LUSTS AND
VICES; AND TRULY, I HAVE NOT COME TO WARN AGAINST PICKPOCKETS,
EITHER!</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN I CRY: ‘CURSE ALL THE COWARDLY DEVILS WITHIN YOU WHO WOULD
LIKE TO WHIMPER AND CLASP THEIR HANDS AND WORSHIP,’ THEN THEY CRY:
‘ZARATHUSTRA IS GODLESS.’</p><p>Who worships in you? Have you ever pondered over the problem? Is it
not something cowardly in you that kneels down before stone statues made
by man? It cannot be something courageous. One that worships is hiding
his cowardliness in a beautiful word.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is it in you that surrenders, becomes a Christian or a Hindu, or
a Mohammedan? Is it a lion in you, or a sheep?</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus used to say to his people, “You are my sheep and I am your
shepherd.” And not a single one of his followers ever raised the
question, “You are insulting us. Why should we be sheep? Why should we
not be lions, and why should we not bear in us a lion’s roar?”</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, lions don’t need shepherds – that is the problem. If
people are really awakened to their bravery, then they don’t need any
shepherd, they don’t need any savior, they don’t need any messiah. They
are their own saviors; and that gives pride and dignity and beauty to
human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>To call human beings sheep is so insulting, so humiliating that one
wonders how people listened to all this. And even today millions of
Christians around the world – and that is the greatest religion as far
as numbers are concerned – think of themselves as the sheep of Jesus
Christ. If somebody wants to be a shepherd, he has to reduce the whole
of humanity into an ugly state, into cowards.</p><p>Whenever you are in difficulty, why do you start immediately praying
to God? – although you know your prayers are never heard; there is
nobody to hear them. It is possible, just by coincidence, you may think
that your prayer has been heard.</p><p><br></p><p>A man used to come to me – he had no child, and he said to me, “I
cannot believe in God unless I have a child. And I hope that if God
wants a believer, he should give me a child.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is no need... even if there is a God, what is the use of
having this fellow as a believer – to fulfill his demands?</p><p><br></p><p>A child was born to him, and he came to me with sweets and fruits. He
was distributing them in the whole neighborhood. I said, “What has
happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “God has heard me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “Just wait a little. God cannot be so much concerned
about you.” The universe is big, and this beautiful planet earth is such
a small thing. Even our own sun is thousands of times bigger than this
earth, and even this great sun that is our life is a very mediocre star
in the universe. There are millions of times bigger stars than this sun.
And scientists guess that there must be at least fifty thousand planets
in the whole universe where life exists. And this poor fellow is
thinking that God has heard his prayer!</p><p>I told him a story by Bertrand Russell. The Vatican pope dies.
Obviously he knocks on the doors of heaven, because heaven and hell are
just in front of each other. Hours of knocking... because the door is so
big, he cannot see its end. He tries hard – it is so vast.</p><p><br></p><p>But finally a window opens in the door, and Saint Peter looks out.
With great difficulty, he finds this pope standing there – just as you
can find an ant standing on your door. It is very difficult to have a
dialogue. The pope shouts. Saint Peter says, “Say it a little louder,
because you are too small.”</p><p>He says, “You don’t understand. I am the representative of Jesus
Christ; I am coming from the earth. I was the pope in the Vatican, and
what kind of reception is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Saint Peter says to him, “We have never heard of any earth. You
will have to give me the index number.”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope says, “Index number?”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter says, “There are so many planets that unless I get the
index number of your earth, I cannot go to the library to find out where
you come from. What do you mean by the Vatican, and who is this Jesus
Christ?”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope shouts, “Are you kidding? Jesus Christ is the only begotten
son of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter said, “Do you think he finished after only one son, in
the whole eternity he could produce only one son? I will go to the
library, but without an index number it is very difficult to find out...
which earth do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope says, “I am coming from the solar system.”</p><p><br></p><p>He says, “That’s perfectly good, but there are millions of solar
systems. Which solar system? What Index number?”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope says, “It is better you take me directly to God.”</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter said, “I myself have not seen Him. I am just a
doorkeeper, and God is too big. I have only heard about Him. You will
have to forgive me. But I will do my best to find the index number, find
out about Jesus Christ and about this Vatican.”</p><p><br></p><p>He goes off and after hours he returns. And he says, “It is almost
impossible. Millions of planets... there is no way to pinpoint where
your earth is, where your solar system is. And anyway, what right do you
have to enter into heaven? The easiest way is... on the other side of
the road... there they don’t ask who you are, they are nice people. They
don’t ask whether you deserve hell or not; the moment they see you, they
grab you. You just try the other place.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was woken up by the very idea that he has to go to hell, and the
devils will grab him – they don’t even ask who you are. And then he
remembered all the tortures, the hellfire... and the most difficult
thing about the Christian hell is that it has no exit. You can enter,
but you cannot get out. Otherwise, just as a tourist one could enjoy.
But once you get in, you become an eternal resident without any
application to leave. He woke up out of fear; he was perspiring all
over. He was not dead, he was dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>I told this man, “The very idea is egoistic – that God should hear
your prayer, should give proof by giving you a child. Just wait for a
few more proofs, because one proof is not enough. No science will allow
a single proof; it has to be repeatedly proved.</p><p><br></p><p>“You ask something else. You suffer from migraine, now start asking,
‘Take my migraine away; otherwise I will not believe in you.’ And you
have a good strategy to blackmail God. He wants you to</p><p>believe in Him, so exploit him as much as you can. Your brother is
unemployed, ask for employment. Your father has cancer, ask for his
cancer to be removed... you have so many problems. The child was not a
problem at all. And are you certain the child is yours?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I never thought that you will be so rude with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not being rude, because you have been trying for years,
and there was no child coming, and suddenly it has come. Just look
around the neighborhood, some rascal is doing it. Don’t jump to God,
first look around. There are so many rascals in the neighborhood.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That I know – there are rascals.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Go back home. Don’t waste your money in distributing sweets
and fruits, first find out whose son has been born. Is it yours?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “To meet you is always a trouble. Now you have created a
suspicion in my mind. I already have a migraine. Instead of being a
help, now I will look with suspicion at every person who is connected
with my family – the servants, the neighbors, the relatives. And to tell
you the truth,” he whispered, “I had my suspicions, because the doctor
has been telling me, ‘You cannot have a child.’</p><p><br></p><p>“But you should not be so harsh. I was happy that God has given me
the child. And God is all-powerful; even if the doctor says I cannot
have a child... God can change my chemistry, my hormones, my sperm. But
I will go back. Now I cannot go on distributing sweets. I am afraid that
you are right – you may be right!”</p><p><br></p><p>The people who worship are cowards. The people who pray are naggers.
Prayer is nothing but nagging God, “Do this!” – every morning and
evening. Mohammedans are the best nagging people; they nag God five
times a day! Hindus don’t let Him even sleep in the beautiful mornings.
They get up early, at three o’clock, and start praying. Sufis pray in
the middle of the night.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if there had been a God in the beginning, He must have gone mad
by now! So many people, and so many demands.… But you don’t see that
when you pray you are simply demanding. And a prayer cannot be a demand;
it can only be a gratefulness.</p><p><br></p><p>When you worship, it cannot be out of your cowardliness; it can only
be a lion’s roar. The sheer joy, the overflowing energy.…</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN I CRY: ’CURSE ALL THE COWARDLY DEVILS... THEY ALL CRY:
’ZARATHUSTRA IS</p><p>GODLESS.’ They don’t listen. On the contrary, they start abusing
Zarathustra.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CRY OF THEIR TEACHERS OF SUBMISSION; BUT
IT IS INTO PRECISELY THEIR EARS THAT I LOVE TO SHOUT: YES! I AM
ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS!</p><p>Zarathustra respects what is evolving in man so deeply, so profoundly
that he can sacrifice all gods for its growth.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS IS MY SERMON FOR THEIR EARS: I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS, WHO
SAYS ’WHO IS MORE GODLESS THAN I, THAT I MAY REJOICE IN HIS TEACHING?’I
am more godless</p><p>than Zarathustra; but it is very difficult to bridge the gap,
twenty-five centuries, because at least Zarathustra goes on denying
God... I don’t even care to deny him.</p><p><br></p><p>Even to deny God is, in a negative way, keeping his name alive.</p><p><br></p><p>I want humanity simply to forget that nightmare of thousands of years
that is associated with God. I don’t think it is even necessary to say,
“There is no God.” It simply is not.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have given Zarathustra good company, but perhaps twenty-five
centuries ago it was difficult to find a man... particularly in Iran,
where Zarathustra was teaching his tremendously important philosophy.
But in India at that very time there was Mahavira who denies God, and
there was Gautam Buddha who denies God. But their denial is very
sophisticated.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is very raw and very wild, and that is his beauty. He
does not speak in a polished way; he speaks like a child, utterly
innocent. He does not speak in a roundabout way, he does not speak in a
sophisticated way. Buddha and Mahavira both speak in such a way that
many people may not understand that they don’t believe in God.</p><p><br></p><p>But Zarathustra is straight. He simply calls a spade a spade. And
that’s what I love in him – his rawness. He is not a diamond – cut,
polished; he is directly from the mine – uncut, unpolished. Therein lies
his beauty and his truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM ZARATHUSTRA THE GODLESS: WHERE SHALL I FIND MY EQUAL? ALL THOSE
WHO GIVE THEMSELVES THEIR OWN WILL AND RENOUNCE ALL SUBMISSION, THEY ARE
MY</p><p>EQUALS. Those who renounce all submission, surrendering to any god,
being obedient to any scriptures.…</p><p><br></p><p>The other-world teachers have been insisting, “Renounce the world.”
Zarathustra is saying, “Renounce your scriptures, and the renouncers!
Renounce submission, renounce your cowardliness.” Be authentically
yourself, and only then your life sources can start flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WHY DO I SPEAK WHERE NO ONE HAS MY KIND OF EARS? AND SO I WILL
SHOUT</p><p>IT OUT TO ALL THE WINDS. One can understand the difficulty.
Particularly I can understand the difficulty. Many mystics have found
the same problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma, one of the greatest masters, who became the source of
the tradition of Zen, remained for nine years facing the wall. He would
not face his audience. People would ask questions and he would answer to
the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Emperor Wu of China asked him, “This is a little strange. I have
never seen such meetings. The speaker has to face the audience; you keep
your back towards the audience. What kind of behavior is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma said, “I used to keep, just like other speakers, the
audience in front of me. But I found just a wall, and it was hurting, so
I decided that it is better to keep the audience behind me and face the
wall. The wall does not hurt, because it is a wall. It does not listen,
but you cannot expect a wall to listen. But when I talk to people, and I
see just walls around, it hurts. And I cannot stop speaking, because
that which has grown in me is overflowing, and I cannot control it.</p><p>Zarathustra says, BUT WHY DO I SPEAK WHERE NO ONE HAS MY KIND OF
EARS? AND SO</p><p>I WILL SHOUT IT OUT TO ALL THE WINDS. I will not bother about people,
whether they hear or not, I will talk to the winds. Perhaps they may
carry the word, perhaps they may carry the message to the right kind of
ears.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is very unfortunate that people like Zarathustra and
Bodhidharma should feel so frustrated with our so-called humanity – and
the intelligentsia particularly are more dead, because they already
think they know.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER.<span class=s4></span>This is
something so prophetic that it has come</p><p>to be true.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER, YOU SMALL PEOPLE! YOU WILL
CRUMBLE AWAY, YOU COMFORTABLE PEOPLE! YOU WILL YET PERISH –</p><p><br></p><p>THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL VIRTUES, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL OMISSIONS,
THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL SUBMISSIONS!</p><p><br></p><p>What are our virtues? Is what our so-called religions teach virtuous?
In the eyes of Zarathustra they are so small that your virtues – rather
than making you greater, giving you a grandeur – make you even
smaller.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a woman who was a miser. In her whole life, she
had only given a rotten carrot to a beggar – that was all you could call
virtuous in her. She died, and the angels came to take her. The problem
was the carrot – she has done a virtuous act; you cannot send her to
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>So they told the woman, “This is your carrot that you gave to a
beggar. This is your only virtue, so hold onto it, and it will go like a
rocket towards heaven. Remember not to lose the grip.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people who had gathered – hearing that the old woman, the old
miser, has died – were surprised that the woman was being uplifted by
something they could not see. But she was going upwards! They could not
lose such a chance, so somebody took hold of her legs.</p><p><br></p><p>It became a long queue. And the carrot was going up and the woman was
very angry – angry naturally because it was her virtue, and all these
neighbors hanging in a long queue<span class=s4></span>she could
not</p><p>tolerate it. When they reached near heaven, she shouted, “You idiots.
You have never done anything virtuous. This carrot is MINE!” But at that
moment the carrot was lost, and with the woman the whole queue fell down
to earth. The woman was dead, but she killed almost two hundred
people.</p><p><br></p><p>What are our virtues: that you have given something to eat to a
beggar, that you have donated for a temple to be raised. But do you
think these are virtues?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, a man had just won a lottery, and he was so happy.
Coming home he had to pass a bridge, and on the side of the bridge there
was sitting an old blind beggar, who had always been sitting there. He
had never given anything to him, but today was a different day; he had
got such a big lump sum of money. He gave one rupee to the beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar looked at it and said, “Sir, it is fake.”</p><p>The man said, “My God! You are blind, and you can see whether the
coin is fake or authentic.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “To tell you the truth, this is not my place; it belongs to
my friend who is blind. Today he has gone to see the matinee show. I am
the other fellow who sits on the other side of the bridge. I am just
keeping his place, so nobody else gets into it. It is a very good
corner.</p><p><br></p><p>“First I also used to be blind, but people were cheating, and I could
not even say to them that they are cheating, so I dropped that idea. Now
I have become deaf. Right now I am not, but when you see me in my place
I am completely deaf – because I saw that at least I can prevent people
cheating me.”</p><p><br></p><p>You think you are doing virtue by giving to a beggar; the beggar
thinks he is cheating you, the beggar thinks that you are a fool. What
are your virtues? Your virtues make you... but you are not great, you
are not enjoying your virtues. They must be too small.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra says, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL VIRTUES, THROUGH YOUR MANY
SMALL OMISSIONS, THROUGH YOUR MANY SMALL SUBMISSIONS!</p><p><br></p><p>TOO INDULGENT, TOO YIELDING: THAT IS THE STATE OF YOUR SOIL! BUT IN
ORDER TO GROW BIG, A TREE WANTS TO STRIKE HARD ROOTS INTO HARD
ROCKS!</p><p><br></p><p>This small, so-called religiousness will not help. Because you fasted
one day, you pray every day, you go to the temple every day, you kneel
down before statues of God... just think what value all these things
have. They keep you small.</p><p><br></p><p>TO GROW BIG, A TREE WANTS TO STRIKE HARD ROOTS INTO HARD ROCKS!</p><p><br></p><p>‘IT IS GIVEN’ – THAT IS ALSO A DOCTRINE OF SUBMISSION. BUT I TELL
YOU, YOU COMFORTABLE PEOPLE: IT IS TAKEN.</p><p><br></p><p>A very important point to be remembered. It has been said by all the
teachers, without exception, that truth is given to you – given by God.
Zarathustra says, “It is not given, it is taken.”</p><p><br></p><p>Only one man in this century, George Gurdjieff, had a similar idea,
even more rough and more hard. He used to say, “Unless you are ready to
steal the truth you will not get it.” It is not only a question of
taking; you have to steal it, you have to risk everything – even your
respectability, even your so-called virtue, your morality.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth cannot be given by anyone to anybody else. Zarathustra is
right: it has to be taken.And to take it, you need to be not a coward,
not a slave, not a beggar, but a lion: strong, able to take it.</p><p><br></p><p>A given truth is just a lie. And all your truths are given truths.
Who has given you your God? Who has given you your truth? Who has given
you your religion?</p><p><br></p><p>Just check one thing: has it been given to you, or have you taken it?
If it has been given to you, throw it away – it means nothing, it is
self-deception. You have to be strong enough to take it.</p><p>OH, THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD MY SAYING: ’ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL – BUT
FIRST BE</p><p>SUCH AS CAN WILL!’ – a very subtle difference, but very great. He is
saying, ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL. You understand it, there is nothing
difficult in understanding it – ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WILL – but are you
capable of willing?</p><p><br></p><p>BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL! – because willing needs a
non-submissive, strong, independent individuality; otherwise you cannot
will. You can only pray; you can ask, you can beg. Your will will remain
impotent. Become more crystallized, more of an individual, less a part
of the crowd, so that you can will.</p><p><br></p><p>ALWAYS LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES. This is a famous statement,
later on made by Jesus. But Zarathustra’s insights are far deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>He says – he had no idea about Jesus, Jesus came five hundred years
afterwards; but the saying must have been in existence – ALWAYS LOVE
YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES – BUT FIRST BE SUCH AS LOVE THEMSELVES. That
is more difficult. Love them as they are – not as yourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Loving your neighbor as yourself is simply loving your own image in
the mirror. It is not a great virtue, it is a small virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>Love the neighbor as he is. Whether he fulfills your ideas or is
against them, whether he looks moral to you or immoral, these are
unimportant things. He is a human being, and he has every right to be
himself. Love him as he is. Your love should not become a demand, your
love should not ask him to be different than he is.</p><p><br></p><p>This statement, LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES, has another
implication also which Zarathustra has not mentioned, which I have come
across almost every day.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is how man remains blind.</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELVES... and you have forgotten one thing:
Do you love yourself? It is very rare to find a person who loves
himself. People hate themselves. They don’t want to be the way they are;
they want to be somebody else... somebody else has a better nose,
somebody else has better eyes, somebody else has a better body, somebody
is more proportionate, somebody has better intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>People hate themselves. And your religions have been teaching you
contradictory things, which have created confusion and a chaos in your
mind. On the one hand they say, “You have to become like Gautam Buddha.”
Then how can you love yourself? You have to hate yourself, you have to
destroy yourself, dismantle yourself, and try to be like Gautam Buddha
or Jesus or Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>On the one hand they say, “Be like the great religious leaders,
saints,” and on the other hand they go on saying, “Love your neighbor as
yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you really love your neighbor as yourself, you will have to hate
him, because you hate yourself. You don’t find anything in yourself
which is worth loving. In fact, when people fall in love with each</p><p>other, both are surprised: “My God, what has this man found in me
which I have not found myself?” And the man also thinks, “This woman is
a little bit crazy – she loves me, who has lived with himself for all
these thirty years and has not found a single thing worth any
value.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lovers surprise each other. Although nobody says it, both feel, deep
down, really strange – such a beautiful woman... a beauty loving a
beast! And the beautiful woman knows perfectly well that she is a bitch
– such a young fellow, so beautiful falling in love with a bitch!</p><p><br></p><p>But these are inside things. They will become apparent after the
honeymoon – then they will come to know each other – but then it is too
late. They have promised to each other, “I will love you for my whole
life. And not only in this life, if I am born again I will love you
again. My love is not the ordinary love that changes, it is love
eternal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what to do with your promises when you discover who the other
person is in reality? Then they go on accumulating hate for each other –
pretending, acting love, but it becomes just acting.</p><p><br></p><p>AMONG THIS PEOPLE I AM MY OWN FORERUNNER, MY OWN COCK-CROW THROUGH
DARK</p><p>LANES. Every great mystic has been a forerunner to himself, because
every great mystic has come before his time. You can see it –
Zarathustra is even today not our contemporary. He is still ahead of us;
he had come too soon, too early.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THEIR HOUR IS COMING! AND MINE TOO IS COMING! HOURLY WILL THEY
BECOME SMALLER, POORER, MORE BARREN – POOR WEEDS! POOR SOIL!</p><p><br></p><p>AND SOON THEY SHALL STAND BEFORE ME LIKE ARID GRASS AND STEPPE, AND
TRULY! WEARY OF THEMSELVES – AND LONGING FOR FIRE RATHER THAN FOR
WATER!</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps we have come to the point... his prophecy seems to be coming
true. Man is preparing more for war than for peace. Man is creating more
for death than for life. Seventy percent of all the wealth of the world
is devoted to creating nuclear weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>WEARY OF THEMSELVES... perhaps humanity is tired now of being small,
being too mean, being too jealous, being too ugly, and has lost all hope
of growing out of this muddy state, has forgotten that lotuses are born
in mud... AND LONGING FOR FIRE RATHER THAN FOR WATER!</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that people are deep-down ready to commit a global suicide;
otherwise there is no reason why so much money should be wasted, and so
much energy should be wasted for war.</p><p><br></p><p>All that money and all that energy and all that scientific genius can
make this earth a paradise. But nobody is interested in that. Everybody
is interested in finding more and more dangerous weapons. And now it is
absolutely clear that nobody can be the victor, nobody can be the
defeated; all will be dead. Still man goes on accumulating.</p><p><br></p><p>Even poorer countries, like Pakistan or India, are dying to create
nuclear weapons. And the scientific surveys show that by the end of this
century... right now only five nations have nuclear weapons, but by the
end of this century twenty-five more nations will have joined in the
nuclear club. Thirty nations will be nuclear powers.</p><p>What has happened to man’s intelligence, that it is only devoted to a
single cause – death?</p><p><br></p><p>O BLESSED HOUR OF THE LIGHTNING! O MYSTERY BEFORE NOONTIDE! ONE DAY I
SHALL TURN THEM INTO RUNNING FIRE AND HERALDS WITH TONGUES OF FLAME
–</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY THEY SHALL PROCLAIM WITH TONGUES OF FLAME: IT IS COMING, IT
IS NEAR, THE GREAT NOONTIDE!</p><p><br></p><p>But Zarathustra still hopes that we can even transform fire into a
creative energy. You cook your food on fire and you can also burn your
house with fire. Fire is neutral. All energies are neutral; it depends
on you to what use you want to put them.</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra is not weary of himself. He still hopes that one day he
will be able to declare... THE GREAT NOONTIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>That is his symbolic expression for the greatest explosion of light,
love, individuality, freedom. All these he calls, THE GREAT NOONTIDE –
the highest peak in human consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>... THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Sunita) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Sunita. Anand means bliss. Sunita means virtue.\nMy message is simple: bliss is virtue, misery is sin. Avoid being miserable. Don't get into those traps which your mind goes on creating. If you can avoid the traps of the mind that create misery, jealousy, possessiveness, ego, then there is bliss. Bliss is your nature and out of bliss is all virtue, out of bliss is all holiness.\n(To Sharon) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Sharon. Deva means god. Sharon means beloved.\nThe word 'sharon' appears in THE SONG OF SOLOMON, as the rose of sharon;\nit symbolizes the beloved. The whole existence loves you, but we are insensitive to that love; hence we never become aware of it and we go on remaining miserable. We go on seeking and searching for somebody to love us while the whole existence is ready to shower all kinds of love on us. but you need to be open, available.\nThat's what sannyas is: being open, being available, being vulnerable, so that existence can go through you, through and through, so that the wind and the rain and the sun can all pass through you, dancing.\nWhen you allow existence to penetrate you to the very core bliss arises. The meeting of existence with you, the meeting of the individual with the universal, is bliss. And that is the search of all beings.\n(To Loredana) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Loredana. Anand means bliss. Loredana means victorious spirit.\nOne is victorious only when one has become blissful, otherwise life is a failure and a frustration. Keep on reminding yourself: you can possess the whole world but if your heart is not dancing with joy all those possessions are useless, they are burdens. They will make you a captive, a prisoner. They will not help you, they will hinder your growth. One can have all the riches, power, prestige and yet be immensely poor, terribly poor, totally poor.\nThe only real richness is bliss, and bliss is something which can happen within you without your possessing anything, because it is something that is already there, we have only to discover it. We have lost track of it but it is there, just a little digging is needed.\nWe go on searching on the outside. We will not find it there, it is not there. It is in your interiority. It is the fragrance of your subjectivity.\nSoren Kierkegaard says: 'God is subjectivity'. He is right, god is interiority. The interiority of the whole existence is god, When you enter into your interiority, you are entering from a door into existence itself.\nYou disappear, as you go deeper into yourself you disappear. Then the vast sky remains, and the joy and the freedom of that vastness, of the infinity.…\n(To Kiran) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Kiran. Anand means bliss; kiran\nmeans a ray -- a ray of bliss. And that's enough: just a ray of bliss is enough to liberate us, and just a ray of bliss is enough to destroy all our darkness and misery.\nDarkness has no power, so when you bring a small candle into a dark room the darkness simply disappears. It was so much, so thick, and the candle is so small, but it is enough. The darkness may have been very ancient, maybe for years nobody had entered the room, yet the newly lit candle can destroy the darkness of millions of years. So is the case with the ray of bliss. One just has to be open to receive it. It comes from the beyond or from the within... which both means the same.\nIn the dictionaries the word \"beyond\" and the word \"within\" are different, but in existence itself the beyond is the within and the within is the beyond. They are the same, they are not different.\nOne has to learn to be silent so that one can be capable of receiving the ray of light, the ray of bliss.\nLearn to be silent. Sit in silence every day for one hour at least. Slowly slowly the knack is learned.\n(To Giovanni) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Giovanni. Anand means bliss. Giovanni means a gift of god.\nBliss is never our achievement, it cannot be because it happens only when we have disappeared. If we 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare still there to claim that we have achieved it, it is a pseudo bliss, it is not true. It is just a dream, soon it will be gone and you will fall back into misery. Mind has played a trick on you. And mind is very cunning, very political, very diplomatic. It goes on finding ways and means to keep you hanging around it. And the ultimate trick, the last trick that it can play is to create a false sense of bliss.\nThe real bliss is always a gift from god. And it can happen only when the ego dies. The ego is the barrier. The moment you are not, god is, and the experience of god happening in your total silence and nothingness is bliss. That dance of god in your absolutely silent space, with nothing to interfere-no mind, no ego to distort it, to hamper it, to hinder it -- that is bliss.\nThe work of meditation is negative. It is to destroy the ego. Then bliss comes on its own.\n(To Claudine) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Claudine. Anand means bliss. Claudine means humble heart.\nBliss is possible only in absolute humbleness, but the humbleness should not be a practiced one, otherwise it is pseudo. It is just ego playing the game of being humble. And it can be detected very easily: If in your humbleness there is still some competition, if you still think that you are the most humble person, nobody is as humble as you are, that you are the humblest person in the world, then it is not humbleness.\nThen it is just ego standing upside down; not claiming that 'I am the greatest', but claiming that \"I am the humblest.' It is the same.\nThe claim can never be humble. That's what happens to so-called saints: they cultivate humbleness, they decorate their ego, they make the ego stand upside down. They teach the ego a headstand, but then you can see it in their eyes. They say that they are just dust, that they are nothing, but you can see in their eyes that they are waiting for you to say that 'We have seen many saints, but you are the most humble. You are great because you are humble.' Their humbleness is again just a strategy coming in from the backdoor to be grat.\nReal humbleness comes only when you have seen in deep meditation that the ego is a false entity, that it exists not. Not that you make it humble. When you see that it is just imagination, it has no reality, in that seeing the ego evaporates, and when the ego is not found then true humbleness arises in you. It has no claim, it has no comparison, it has no competition. You don't even know that you are humble, you simply are. That natural humbleness is the real treasure, the kingdom of god.\nJesus is right when he says; Blessed are the meek, blessed are the humble, for theirs is the kingdom of god.\n(To Tine) -- This is your name: Ma Prem Tine. Prem means love. Tine means a follower of Christ.\nLove is the message not only of Jesus Christ, but of all the awakened ones of all the ages. It has been so in the past and it is going to be so in the future too because love is the method to transform the lower o you into the higher, the base metal into gold. Love is alchemy. It is the basic methodology of transforming consciousness\nLove all, for nor reason at all. If there is a reason then it is not love. Love all unconditionally, just for the sheer joy of love. Feel grateful that they received your love, they accepted it; they could have rejected. And when I say all I really mean all, not only human beings but animals, birds, trees, rocks, because the whole existence is overflowing with go's presence. So whatever we pour our love, we are offering it to god. This is the only real prayer.\n(To Shabda Nur) -- This is your name: Swami Shabda Nur. Shabda means the word; nur means the light\n-- the light of the word. But the word has a specific meaning, exactly the meaning that it has in the Old Testament when it says 'In the beginning there was the word and god was with the word and god was the word.\nIn the East we call it omkar, the soundless sound. It is vibrating in the whole universe, it is vibrating in you. On just has to become attuned to listen to it\nIt is because of this vibrating sound that music has such tremendous appeal. The higher the music is in the same proportion the closer it comes to this inner soundless sound.\nIn Taoist scriptures they say: When the musician has attained the ultimate, when he has known the ultimate music, he throws the instrument away, because that is now a disturbance. The ultimate music cannot be created, it can only be heard. It is already there; you need not create it.\nShabda means the word that was in the beginning and that is now and that is going to be always there. it is not meaningful. It has tremendous music but no meaning. If you can hear this, your life will become full 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- of light\nThe mystics have always said that if on can listen to the innermost sound, one starts radiating light. That very experience becomes an explosion of light. Now modern scientists also agree from a totally different angle. They also say that light and sound are deeply related. In act they say that sound is nothing but a formation of light. Sound is electricity. they are not two separate phenomena, they are one.\nMystics have always experienced it... that whenever that inner sound is heard, light is simultaneously experience. They happen together, instantly both are there, so that no distinction can be made. And that is the ultimate experience of ecstasy: you are full of harmony and light. This is the goal of all meditations, this is the goal of sannyas too.\n(To Piet) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Piet. Anand means bliss. Piet means a rock.\nBefore the bliss can happen, you have to become integrated like a rock. People are like sand, just thousands of fragments, a crowd, a multitude; they are not one. And bliss can happen only when you are one, otherwise your inner crowd will go on creating noise, conflict, struggle, tension, anguish. The whole crowd has to be melted into one unity.\nWhen that integration happens bliss naturally comes as a by-product. Bliss is a by-product of inner integrity, and the rock represents integration.\n(To Dick) -- This is your new name: Swami Amiteshwar. Amiteshwar means god is infinite, god is unbounded.\nEverything is infinite because everything is divine. Everything is unbounded because everything participates in the nature of god. Boundaries are created by our senses, they are not there at all. Everything is joined with everything else, but our senses create boundaries. It is as if you look from a window and it gives a frame to the sky. The sky is unframed but the frame of the window becomes the frame of the sky.\nYour eyes are windows, whatsoever you see through the eyes becomes framed. Your ears are windows, whatsoever you hear from the ears is immediately framed. All our senses are continuously framing things which are basically without frame.\nTo remember it will give you tremendous insight. Then the dewdrop becomes the ocean, then the pebble on the seashore is as big as the whole universe, then in a small leaf is the whole biography of the universe.\nThen wherever you go you encounter god, both within and without. And to live in that infinity consciously is the greatest joy possible. More than that cannot be conceived, more than that is not possible. That is the ultimate peak.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2186","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2186 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

to say that 'We have seen many saints, but you are the most humble. You
are great because you are humble.' Their humbleness is again just a
strategy coming in from the backdoor to be grat.</p><p>Real <span class=p>humbleness comes only when you have seen in deep
meditation that the ego is a false entity, that it exists not. Not that
you make it humble. When you see that it is just imagination, it has no
reality, in that seeing the ego evaporates, and when the ego is not
found then true humbleness arises in you. It has no claim, it has no
comparison, it has no competition. You don't even know that you are
humble, you simply are. That natural humbleness is the real treasure,
the kingdom of god.</span></p><p>Jesus is right when he says; Blessed are the meek, blessed are the
humble, for theirs is the kingdom of god.</p><p>(To Tine) -- This is your name: Ma Prem Tine. Prem means love. Tine
means a follower of Christ.</p><p>Love is the message not only of Jesus Christ, but of all the awakened
ones of all the ages. It has been so in the past and it is going to be
so in the future too because love is the method to transform the lower o
you into the higher, the base metal into gold. Love is alchemy. It is
the basic methodology of transforming consciousness</p><p>Love all, for nor reason at all. If there is a reason then it is not
love. Love all unconditionally, just for the sheer joy of love. Feel
grateful that they received your love, they accepted it; they could have
rejected. And when I say all I really mean all, not only human beings
but animals, birds, trees, rocks, because the whole existence is
overflowing with go's presence. So whatever we pour our love, we are
offering it to god. This is the only real prayer.</p><p>(To Shabda Nur) -- This is your name: Swami Shabda Nur. Shabda means
the word; nur means the light</p><p>-- the light of the word. But the word has a specific meaning,
exactly the meaning that it has in the Old Testament when it says 'In
the beginning there was the word and god was with the word and god was
the word.</p><p>In the East we call it omkar, the soundless sound. It is vibrating in
the whole universe, it is vibrating in you. On just has to become
attuned to listen to it</p><p>It is because of this vibrating sound that music has such tremendous
appeal. The higher the music is in the same proportion the closer it
comes to this inner soundless sound.</p><p>In Taoist scriptures they say: When the musician has attained the
ultimate, when he has known the ultimate music, he throws the instrument
away, because that is now a disturbance. The ultimate music cannot be
created, it can only be heard. It is already there; you need not create
it.</p><p>Shabda means the word that was in the beginning and that is now and
that is going to be always there. it is not meaningful. It has
tremendous music but no meaning. If you can hear this, your life will
become full 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- of light</p><p>The mystics have always said that if on can listen to the innermost
sound, one starts radiating light. That very experience becomes an
explosion of light. Now modern scientists also agree from a totally
different angle. They also say that light and sound are deeply related.
In act they say that sound is nothing but a formation of light. Sound is
electricity. they are not two separate phenomena, they are one.</p><p>Mystics have always experienced it... that whenever that inner sound
is heard, light is simultaneously experience. They happen together,
instantly both are there, so that no distinction can be made. And that
is the ultimate experience of ecstasy: you are full of harmony and
light. This is the goal of all meditations, this is the goal of sannyas
too.</p><p>(To Piet) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Piet. Anand means bliss.
Piet means a rock.</p><p>Before the bliss can happen, you have to become integrated like a
rock. People are like sand, just thousands of fragments, a crowd, a
multitude; they are not one. And bliss can happen only when you are one,
otherwise your inner crowd will go on creating noise, conflict,
struggle, tension, anguish. The whole crowd has to be melted into one
unity.</p><p>When that integration happens bliss naturally comes as a by-product.
Bliss is a by-product of inner integrity, and the rock represents
integration.</p><p>(To Dick) -- This is your new name: Swami Amiteshwar. Amiteshwar
means god is infinite, god is unbounded.</p><p>Everything is infinite because everything is divine. Everything is
unbounded because everything participates in the nature of god.
Boundaries are created by our senses, they are not there at all.
Everything is joined with everything else, but our senses create
boundaries. It is as if you look from a window and it gives a frame to
the sky. The sky is unframed but the frame of the window becomes the
frame of the sky.</p><p>Your eyes are windows, whatsoever you see through the eyes becomes
framed. Your ears are windows, whatsoever you hear from the ears is
immediately framed. All our senses are continuously framing things which
are basically without frame.</p><p>To remember it will give you tremendous insight. Then the dewdrop
becomes the ocean, then the pebble on the seashore is as big as the
whole universe, then in a small leaf is the whole biography of the
universe.</p><p>Then wherever you go you encounter god, both within and without. And
to live in that infinity consciously is the greatest joy possible. More
than that cannot be conceived, more than that is not possible. That is
the ultimate peak.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

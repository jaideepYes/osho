It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis will be your new name: Swami Juno\nIt is a beautiful name so there is no need to change it. And it is also of tremendous meaning. It means purity. But remember that purity has nothing to do with morality. A moral person is pure only from the outside. He has cultivated a certain character but his inside is as unclean as anybody else's. He has a beautiful facade but it is just a facade. The so-called saints and the sinners differ only in their faces.\nReal purity is something totally different from morality. It cannot be cultivated. It has nothing to do with character, it has something to do with consciousness. It is a transformation of consciousness. When one becomes very alert in one's innermost core, aware and meditative, then a purity arises which is beyond morality and immorality, which is beyond sinners and saints. It is a kind of innocence. The mirror is absolutely without any dust. And when the mirror is pure it reflects god.\nThis is your name: Ma Aki. Aki means early morning -- and that's what sannyas is, the beginning of the day. The night is over, the sun has not yet risen. A sannyasin is just in the middle of these two. He has left the old and he is waiting\nfor the new to arrive. The new comes inevitably, but patience is needed This interval between the night and the day is of immense beauty, of great silence, because it is a passage where darkness becomes light, death becomes life, matter disappears and there is only god left behind.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nCome here. Close your eyes... close your eyes. Good. Ruth, come here. Just look at me. Good.\nThis is your name: Ma Ruth. Ruth means compassionate. It has other meaning too: beauty, a vision of beauty, the capacity to see. But I will choose compassionate.\nSannyas is the alchemy of transforming passion into compassion. Passion is the lowest state of consciousness and compassion the highest. The lower has not to be denied but to be transforms. The lower has to be used as a stepping stone. In the past the so-called religious people have been very much against it, and because of their centuries of teachings they have created a schizophrenic humanity. They have divided man into two, the lower and the higher, and that division is the cause of misery, anguish, anxiety.\nWhen you start thinking in terms of yourself as being two, the lower and the higher, there is constant conflict. You are trying to overcome the lower, to fight with it, to destroy it -- and it is not possible to destroy it. Transformation is possible, destruction is not possible. Nothing can be destroyed in existence.\nYes, things can be changed. Water can become vapor or water can become ice, but this is just a change. You cannot make water disappear totally. You can analyze it, then it will become hydrogen and oxygen, but is remains. There is no way to annihilate it. Nothing can ever be annihilated and nothing new can ever be created. Only combinations change.\nSo because of this long long tradition of dividing man into two the whole humanity is suffering. My effort is to help you to drop the division, to drop this schizophrenia which as been perpetuated in the name of religion.\nReligion has not proved a blessing. It has proved to be the greatest calamity. Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra\n-- they are blessings, but Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism -- they are not blessings.\nAll the great masters of the world were teaching methods to move your inner being into higher planes.\nThey were helping people to grow wings. And all the churches have been trying to divide you, because that is the fundamental way to rule over people: divide and rule. You can divide easily, and once a person is divided he becomes powerless, his energies start fighting within him, he becomes a chaos, then you can rule him. And all the churches are interested not in transforming you but in enslaving you, in ruling you, in exploiting you.\nPassion is the lowest rung and compassion is the highest rung of the ladder, but both belong to the same ladder. Remember, when passion becomes conscious it becomes compassion. When passion is unconscious it is cruel, it is ugly, it is animal.\nJust bring more consciousness to your being and you start moving toward divinity; from the animal to god. Man is only a ladder stretched between these two eternities.\nThis is your name: Ma Anne. Anne has many meanings: prayer, mercy... but the most beautiful is grace.\nSo remember grace. Grace is something that descends from above. You cannot create it, you can only receive it. You can be open to the beyond, available, in a state of let-go, and something starts showering on you. It is invisible but one can feel it and the freshness that it brings and the rejuvenation.\nPrayer is only a method to help you to attain grace. And mercy is only an expression of the achievement of grace. These are the three meanings of the word: prayer, grace, mercy. Attain to grace, use prayer as a method and then\nmercy as an expression. Prayer precedes, mercy follows, but the real phenomenon is grace.\nAnd the only way to attain it is to drop the ego. That is the only barrier. We are closed to god because of it.\nThe moment the ego is put aside we are one with god. He starts flowing in us and we start flowing in him.\nAnd that is the state of grace.\nThis is your name: Ma Gudrun. Gudrun means divine wisdom. It is a repetition because in fact all wisdom is divine. There is no other wisdom in the world. Knowledge is human, wisdom is divine.\nKnowledge is concerned with the facts, wisdom is concerned with the truth. Facts are superficial things.\nIt is a fact that you are a woman, but it is not a truth. Truth is that you are a pure consciousness, neither man or woman. The fact is that you are a body, the truth is that you are not the body, you are the spirit. But the fact is easily available, it is objective, and the truth is subjective.\nSoren Kierkegaard says 'Truth is subjectivity.' His definition is of great significance. Fact is objective --\nit can be proved, experimented with. That's why science only believes in facts and that's why science and religion cannot communicate with each other: their dimensions are different. Science talks about the facts, religion talks about the truth.\nScience has no idea of truth because truth is something invisible. You can feel it, you can experience it, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbut you cannot show it to others, while objective facts can be shown to others, they can be proved. Wisdom is not possible through learning. Through learning only knowledge is possible. Wisdom is possible only thought a state of not- knowing, a state of innocence. By the process of unlearning one comes to wisdom and by the process of learning one comes to knowledge, hence there can be no school, no university for wisdom.\nFor knowledge all kinds of schools are possible.\nWhat's why wisdom has disappeared from the world slowly slowly: the world has become too burdened with knowledge.\nTo be a sannyasins means taking a quantum leap from knowledge to wisdom, from the objective to the subjective, from the outer to the inner, from the fast to the truth, from the visible to the invisible, from the known to the unknown. It is the greatest adventure of life, and unless one comes to know one's innermost being, the truth, the subjectivity, one has not known anything. One can accumulate much knowledge but that is all rubbish. It is only wisdom that liberates, it is only wisdom that transforms. It is only wisdom that becomes the door to the divine, hence all wisdom is divine.\nYour name: Swami Alan. Alan means harmony, and harmony is the goal of all true religious enquiry.\nMan live in discord. Man lives like a crowd; there are many people inside you, not one, and they are all fighting, quarrelling and they all pretend to be the master.\nGurdjieff used to say: Man is like a house whose master has gone away or has fallen asleep and all the servants are drunk. In their drunken state every servant thinks that he is the master and there is great quarrel and fighting going on.\nHe was right. That's generally the situation of a human being. All is fragmentary and each fragment wants to go its own way and no two fragments are in any agreement. That's why ordinary human beings cannot make a promise. If they promise they cannot keep it, because the person who promises 'Tomorrow I will meet you,' may not be in power tomorrow. The wheel goes on moving, another spoke come up.\nIn the evening you decide 'Tomorrow morning I am going to get up at four and\nmeditate' and the decision seems to be total and you are determined and you are happy that you are determined. But when the alarm goes at four, you throw away the alarm, you pull the blanket over you and you say 'We will see tomorrow.' Now this is somebody else. And when you get up at eight o'clock in the morning you are miserable, repentant, feeling guilty that you could not keep promise given to yourself -- and you really wanted it, you had meant it. Now this is another person... and so on, so forth, it goes on.\nMan needs integration, an integration of all these fragments into one whole, into one harmony. And that is the whole effort of religion. The very word 'religion' means that which binds you together. That's exactly the meaning of yoga too; yoga means union. Religion and yoga are synonymous.\nWhen you become crystallized, when you become one, when all these parts that are falling apart melt and merge into one unity a tremendous joy arises because all the conflict is gone. And when the conflict is gone celebration begins. All the meditative techniques are devised in such a way that they; can bring your quarrelling fragments closer to each other, into a friendship, into harmony, into accord.\nThis is your new name: Swami Narayano. Narayano means god. The whole existence is made of god: the rocks, the trees, the animals, man. God is the only stuff. There is nothing else available. We differ only in forms.\nThe tree is green but is is god who is green in the tree, and the red in the flowers. He is the mud, he is the water and he is the lotus. He is in the lowest and he is in the highest.\nSo there is no question of any inferiority or superiority; we are part of the whole. To remember it is to become holy.\nThis is your name: Swami Bhagwato. Bhagwato means divine.\nMan has forgotten only one thing, and that is the door to the divine. He has become lost in so many things and there are millions of things that one can get lost in. And one can forget god very easily. One can forget god easily because god is already the case. There is no gap between you and god, hence it is easy to forget.\nIt is just like the fish in the ocean. The fish in the ocean does not know the ocean\nunless somebody pulls the fish out of the ocean and the distance is created. Then the fish remembers, then she longs for the ocean.\nNow the fish understands what has been missed.\nThat can be done as far as a fish is concerned but that cannot be done with man, because all is god. You 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncannot be pulled out of god. A distance cannot be created, so that is not the way to remind you. The only way to remind you is to make you aware that all that you are involved with is trivia, mundane, superfluous.\nEven if you achieve it nothing is achieved. And death will take everything away from you anyway.\nBefore death comes, attain something of eternity, have a taste of something which is timeless, deathless, then death cannot destroy you. Then you can die dancing, singing, laughing. And to be able to die singing, laughing, dancing, is the greatest achievement of life. That is the very culmination of life, that is the goal of sannyas. And one who can die joyously, naturally is bound to live joyously.\nSo live joyously, live with a deep enquiry within yourself 'Who am I?', because there is the door to the divine. You are the temple of god. Just don't go on running hither and tither, come back home. Look within!\nIt is not far away. It is very close. In act even to say that it is close is not right, because closeness is also a kind of distance.\nHe exists in you as you, so you have to know who you are. The moment that you know who you are, you have known god too, simultaneously.\nThis is your new name: Ma Vimal. Vimal means purity, innocence. Literally it means without any dust, without any mud.\nMan is a mirror -- and we go on collecting dust on the mirror. Thoughts, memories, desires -- they are all dust. Layers and layers of dust are there, and the mirror is completely lost, it mirrors nothing, it cannot, because so many layers of dust are upon it.\nThe whole effort here is to help you to clean the mirror. Nothing else is needed, just a little cleaning inside. And once the mirror is clean you need not be told that god is, you will know.\nI don't expect you to believe in god, because all beliefs are false. My function is to help you see god, to know god. Seeing is of importance, not believing. Belief is again another layer of dust -- religious dust, holy dust, but dust is dust. And one has to clean the mind totally, completely.\nWhen the mind is without any thoughts, memories, imagination, even for a single moment, you immediately become aware of god. That awareness fulfils you, makes your life meaningful. Your song bursts forth, a great ecstasy for which we have been searching and searching for many many lives, arises in your being.\nThis is your new name: Swami Nirmal. Nirmal means innocence.\nJesus is right when he says: Unless a man is born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of god. And he also says: Unless you are like small children you will not enter into my kingdom of god.\nOne day he is standing in the marketplace, a crowd has gathered to listen to him, and a rabbi asks him: Who is entitled to enter the kingdom of god that you go on talking about? Jesus looks around, finds a small child, takes him up on his shoulders, and says, Those who are like this small child.\nThe rabbi was offended, obviously, because he was thinking that Jesus would point towards him; he was the most knowledgeable person in the town. And others were also offended. Somebody was the most virtuous and somebody else was the most saintly and somebody else was the most respectable. All kinds of people were there, and he has chosen just an ordinary child! But Jesus is right: man has to learn to be a child again.\nThe first childhood is bound to be lost. The first childhood is a natural thing. It is like something of which you are not aware and cannot be aware unless you lose\nit. You have to lose it, and only later on when you become aware what have you done? What have you gained by losing it?... Then you start searching for it again. A second childhood is needed.\nThat is the meaning of your name: a second childhood. One has to be twice- born, it is a spiritual birth.\nAnd then all is possible, even the impossible is possible. This is your new name: Swami Satyamo.\nSatyamo means the ultimate truth. Truth is not available through the intellect. Truth is available only through intuition. Truth cannot be found by logic, by thinking, by the head; it can only be found by the heart, by feeling, by love.\nSo the whole problem before a seeker is how to shift the energy from the head to the heart. The whole gestalt has to be changed. Our society teaches us how to take the whole energy to the head. It excludes all other centers, it denies energy to all other centers, it takes everything towards the head.\nOur society is head-oriented, so it is not an accident that millions of people are crazy, mad, insane. Their 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nheads are boiling with too much energy and their hearts are empty because no energy moves there. The heart remains undernourished, goes on shrinking -- and it is through the heart that one can be bridged with life, with god. Only through the heart is there a possibility of rejoicing, of becoming sane, of attaining to the ultimate truth.\nSannyas is only a beginning, a small beginning, of changing the gestalt, of moving the energy from the head to the heart. It can be done, energy can be moved to any center. It is only a question of understanding what our problem is. Once we know the problem the solution is not far away. In fact the problem contains the solution. Understood rightly, you will find the solution in the\nproblem, you will find the answer in the question itself.\nSo now this is going to be your work: shifting your energy from the head to the heart. Feel more, sing, dance, participate in music; watch the stars, the sunset, the sunrise, the flowers, the trees, and you will feel yourself coming closer to the heart. And avoid argumentation, logic-chopping, hair-splitting. Avoid that, it leads nowhere. It takes you more and more into the desert, more and more away from you and your truth.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #15\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3164","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3164 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The lower has not to be denied but to be transforms. The lower has to be
used as a stepping stone. In the past the so-called religious people
have been very much against it, and because of their centuries of
teachings they have created a schizophrenic humanity. They have divided
man into two, the lower and the higher, and that division is the cause
of misery, anguish, anxiety.</p><p>When you start thinking in terms of yourself as being two, the lower
and the higher, there is constant conflict. You are trying to overcome
the lower, to fight with it, to destroy it -- and it is not possible to
destroy it. Transformation is possible, destruction is not possible.
Nothing can be destroyed in existence.</p><p>Yes, things can be changed. Water can become vapor or water can
become ice, but this is just a change. You cannot make water disappear
totally. You can analyze it, then it will become hydrogen and oxygen,
but is remains. There is no way to annihilate it. Nothing can ever be
annihilated and nothing new can ever be created. Only combinations
change.</p><p>So because of this long long tradition of dividing man into two the
whole humanity is suffering. My effort is to help you to drop the
division, to drop this schizophrenia which as been perpetuated in the
name of religion.</p><p>Religion has not proved a blessing. It has proved to be the greatest
calamity. Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra</p><p>-- they are blessings, but Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism
-- they are not blessings.</p><p>All the great masters of the world were teaching methods to move your
inner being into higher planes.</p><p>They were helping people to grow wings. And all the churches have
been trying to divide you, because that is the fundamental way to rule
over people: divide and rule. You can divide easily, and once a person
is divided he becomes powerless, his energies start fighting within him,
he becomes a chaos, then you can rule him. And all the churches are
interested not in transforming you but in enslaving you, in ruling you,
in exploiting you.</p><p>Passion is the lowest rung and compassion is the highest rung of the
ladder, but both belong to the same ladder. Remember, when passion
becomes conscious it becomes compassion. When passion is unconscious it
is cruel, it is ugly, it is animal.</p><p>Just bring more consciousness to your being and you start moving
toward divinity; from the animal to god. Man is only a ladder stretched
between these two eternities.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anne. Anne has many meanings: prayer, mercy...
but the most beautiful is grace.</p><p>So remember grace. Grace is something that descends from above. You
cannot create it, you can only receive it. You can be open to the
beyond, available, in a state of let-go, and something starts showering
on you. It is invisible but one can feel it and the freshness that it
brings and the rejuvenation.</p><p>Prayer is only a method to help you to attain grace. And mercy is
only an expression of the achievement of grace. These are the three
meanings of the word: prayer, grace, mercy. Attain to grace, use prayer
as a method and then</p><p>mercy as an expression. Prayer precedes, mercy follows, but the real
phenomenon is grace.</p><p>And the only way to attain it is to drop the ego. That is the only
barrier. We are closed to god because of it.</p><p>The moment the ego is put aside we are one with god. He starts
flowing in us and we start flowing in him.</p><p>And that is the state of grace.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Gudrun. Gudrun means divine wisdom. It is a
repetition because in fact all wisdom is divine. There is no other
wisdom in the world. Knowledge is human, wisdom is divine.</p><p>Knowledge is concerned with the facts, wisdom is concerned with the
truth. Facts are superficial things.</p><p>It is a fact that you are a woman, but it is not a truth. Truth is
that you are a pure consciousness, neither man or woman. The fact is
that you are a body, the truth is that you are not the body, you are the
spirit. But the fact is easily available, it is objective, and the truth
is subjective.</p><p>Soren Kierkegaard says 'Truth is subjectivity.' His definition is of
great significance. Fact is objective --</p><p>it can be proved, experimented with. That's why science only believes
in facts and that's why science and religion cannot communicate with
each other: their dimensions are different. Science talks about the
facts, religion talks about the truth.</p><p>Science has no idea of truth because truth is something invisible.

to others, they can be proved. Wisdom is not possible through learning.
Through learning only knowledge is possible. Wisdom is possible only
thought a state of not- knowing, a state of innocence. By the process of
unlearning one comes to wisdom and by the process of learning one comes
to knowledge, hence there can be no school, no university for
wisdom.</p><p>For knowledge all kinds of schools are possible.</p><p>What's why wisdom has disappeared from the world slowly slowly: the
world has become too burdened with knowledge.</p><p>To be a sannyasins means taking a quantum leap from knowledge to
wisdom, from the objective to the subjective, from the outer to the
inner, from the fast to the truth, from the visible to the invisible,
from the known to the unknown. It is the greatest adventure of life, and
unless one comes to know one's innermost being, the truth, the
subjectivity, one has not known anything. One can accumulate much
knowledge but that is all rubbish. It is only wisdom that liberates, it
is only wisdom that transforms. It is only wisdom that becomes the door
to the divine, hence <em>all</em> wisdom is divine.</p><p>Your name: Swami Alan. Alan means harmony, and harmony is the goal of
all true religious enquiry.</p><p>Man live in discord. Man lives like a crowd; there are many people
inside you, not one, and they are all fighting, quarrelling and they all
pretend to be the master.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say: Man is like a house whose master has gone away
or has fallen asleep and all the servants are drunk. In their drunken
state every servant thinks that he is the master and there is great
quarrel and fighting going on.</p><p>He was right. That's generally the situation of a human being. All is
fragmentary and each fragment wants to go its own way and no two
fragments are in any agreement. That's why ordinary human beings cannot
make a promise. If they promise they cannot keep it, because the person
who promises 'Tomorrow I will meet you,' may not be in power tomorrow.
The wheel goes on moving, another spoke come up.</p><p>In the evening you decide 'Tomorrow morning I am going to get up at
four and</p><p>meditate' and the decision seems to be total and you are determined
and you are happy that you are determined. But when the alarm goes at
four, you throw away the alarm, you pull the blanket over you and you
say 'We will see tomorrow.' Now this is somebody else. And when you get
up at eight o'clock in the morning you are miserable, repentant, feeling
guilty that you could not keep promise given to yourself -- and you
really wanted it, you had meant it. Now this is another person... and so
on, so forth, it goes on.</p><p>Man needs integration, an integration of all these fragments into one
whole, into one harmony. And that is the whole effort of religion. The
very word 'religion' means that which binds you together. That's exactly
the meaning of yoga too; yoga means union. Religion and yoga are
synonymous.</p><p>When you become crystallized, when you become one, when all these
parts that are falling apart melt and merge into one unity a tremendous
joy arises because all the conflict is gone. And when the conflict is
gone celebration begins. All the meditative techniques are devised in
such a way that they; can bring your quarrelling fragments closer to
each other, into a friendship, into harmony, into accord.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Narayano. Narayano means god. The whole
existence is made of god: the rocks, the trees, the animals, man. God is
the only stuff. There is nothing else available. We differ only in
forms.</p><p>The tree is green but is is god who is green in the tree, and the red
in the flowers. He is the mud, he is the water and he is the lotus. He
is in the lowest and he is in the highest.</p><p>So there is no question of any inferiority or superiority; we are
part of the whole. To remember it is to become holy.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Bhagwato. Bhagwato means divine.</p><p>Man has forgotten only one thing, and that is the door to the divine.
He has become lost in so many things and there are millions of things
that one can get lost in. And one can forget god very easily. One can
forget god easily because god is already the case. There is no gap
between you and god, hence it is easy to forget.</p><p>It is just like the fish in the ocean. The fish in the ocean does not
know the ocean</p><p>unless somebody pulls the fish out of the ocean and the distance is
created. Then the fish remembers, then she longs for the ocean.</p><p>Now the fish understands what has been missed.</p><p>That can be done as far as a fish is concerned but that cannot be
done with man, because all is god. You 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

not the way to remind you. The only way to remind you is to make you
aware that all that you are involved with is trivia, mundane,
superfluous.</p><p>Even if you achieve it nothing is achieved. And death will take
everything away from you anyway.</p><p>Before death comes, attain something of eternity, have a taste of
something which is timeless, deathless, then death cannot destroy you.
Then you can die dancing, singing, laughing. And to be able to die
singing, laughing, dancing, is the greatest achievement of life. That is
the very culmination of life, that is the goal of sannyas. And one who
can die joyously, naturally is bound to live joyously.</p><p>So live joyously, live with a deep enquiry within yourself 'Who am
I?', because there is the door to the divine. You are the temple of god.
Just don't go on running hither and tither, come back home. Look
within!</p><p>It is not far away. It is <em>very</em> close. In act even to say
that it is close is not right, because closeness is also a kind of
distance.</p><p>He exists in you as you, so you have to know who you are. The moment
that you know who you are, you have known god too, simultaneously.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Vimal. Vimal means purity, innocence.
Literally it means without any dust, without any mud.</p><p>Man is a mirror -- and we go on collecting dust on the mirror.
Thoughts, memories, desires -- they are all dust. Layers and layers of
dust are there, and the mirror is completely lost, it mirrors nothing,
it cannot, because so many layers of dust are upon it.</p><p>The whole effort here is to help you to clean the mirror. Nothing
else is needed, just a little cleaning inside. And once the mirror is
clean you need not be told that god is, you will know.</p><p>I don't expect you to believe in god, because all beliefs are false.
My function is to help you see god, to know god. Seeing is of
importance, not believing. Belief is again another layer of dust --
religious dust, holy dust, but dust is dust. And one has to clean the
mind totally, completely.</p><p>When the mind is without any thoughts, memories, imagination, even
for a single moment, you immediately become aware of god. That awareness
fulfils you, makes your life meaningful. Your song bursts forth, a great
ecstasy for which we have been searching and searching for many many
lives, arises in your being.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Nirmal. Nirmal means innocence.</p><p>Jesus is right when he says: Unless a man is born again he cannot
enter into the kingdom of god. And he also says: Unless you are like
small children you will not enter into my kingdom of god.</p><p>One day he is standing in the marketplace, a crowd has gathered to
listen to him, and a rabbi asks him: Who is entitled to enter the
kingdom of god that you go on talking about? Jesus looks around, finds a
small child, takes him up on his shoulders, and says, Those who are like
this small child.</p><p>The rabbi was offended, obviously, because he was thinking that Jesus
would point towards him; he was the most knowledgeable person in the
town. And others were also offended. Somebody was the most virtuous and
somebody else was the most saintly and somebody else was the most
respectable. All kinds of people were there, and he has chosen just an
ordinary child! But Jesus is right: man has to learn to be a child
again.</p><p>The first childhood is bound to be lost. The first childhood is a
natural thing. It is like something of which you are not aware and
cannot be aware unless you lose</p><p>it. You have to lose it, and only later on when you become aware what
have you done? What have you gained by losing it?... Then you start
searching for it again. A second childhood is needed.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name: a second childhood. One has to be
twice- born, it is a spiritual birth.</p><p>And then all is possible, even the impossible is possible. This is
your new name: Swami Satyamo.</p><p>Satyamo means the ultimate truth. Truth is not available through the
intellect. Truth is available only through intuition. Truth cannot be
found by logic, by thinking, by the head; it can only be found by the
heart, by feeling, by love.</p><p>So the whole problem before a seeker is how to shift the energy from
the head to the heart. The whole gestalt has to be changed. Our society
teaches us how to take the whole energy to the head. It excludes all
other centers, it denies energy to all other centers, it takes
everything towards the head.</p><p>Our society is head-oriented, so it is not an accident that millions
of people are crazy, mad, insane. Their 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

because no energy moves there. The heart remains undernourished, goes on
shrinking -- and it is through the heart that one can be bridged with
life, with god. Only through the heart is there a possibility of
rejoicing, of becoming sane, of attaining to the ultimate truth.</p><p>Sannyas is only a beginning, a small beginning, of changing the
gestalt, of moving the energy from the head to the heart. It can be
done, energy can be moved to any center. It is only a question of
understanding what our problem is. Once we know the problem the solution
is not far away. In fact the problem contains the solution. Understood
rightly, you will find the solution in the</p><p>problem, you will find the answer in the question itself.</p><p>So now this is going to be your work: shifting your energy from the
head to the heart. Feel more, sing, dance, participate in music; watch
the stars, the sunset, the sunrise, the flowers, the trees, and you will
feel yourself coming closer to the heart. And avoid argumentation,
logic-chopping, hair-splitting. Avoid that, it leads nowhere. It takes
you more and more into the desert, more and more away from you and your
truth.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

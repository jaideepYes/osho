Veronica means true hearted.\nThe heart is always seeking and searching for truth, because truth is its nourishment. Without truth the heart starts dying. It can live only in the climate of truth.\nThe head lives in all kinds of lies. It is very cunning, diplomatic. In fact it cannot live with truth at all.\nTruth is poison to the head and elixir for the heart. Lies are food for the head and poison for the heart. And the whole question of inner transformation can be reduced to a single point, the jump from the head to the heart. It is a quantum\nleap.\nThe head cannot decide to jump because that is going to be suicidal to the head. The head is bound to condemn it. It will call it illogical, mad, insane, crazy... all kinds of names. For centuries it has called love madness. For centuries the head has been against the Buddhas, the awakened ones. It has crucified Jesus.\nIt is not the Jews, it is the head that crucified Jesus. It is the head that poisoned Socrates. It is the head that tried to murder Buddha. They are both in a deep inner conflict, the head and the heart. Only one can live. Either the heart can live, then the head has to disappear, or the head can live, then the heart starts shrinking, dying. Millions of people have decided to live with the head because the head is very successful in the world. If you are after money, power, prestige, then the head is very successful. The heart will be a failure there. But in the inner world just the opposite is the case: the heart wins, the head is doomed. It is bound to fail.\nSannyas means that you are moving from the head to the heart. In spite of all the condemnation of the head, you are still moving towards the heart. Once you start tasting the beauty of the heart and the blessings and the fragrance that arises out of it, once you start seeing the truth of the heart, then there is no problem.\nThe whole difficulty is that before you have tasted it the head can go on saying things against the heart.\nOnce you have tasted the nectar then the head simply escapes, it cannot say anything against the heart any more. Now you know what it is and you cannot be deceived. The head can deceive only if you have not tasted the heart.\nMy work here consists in helping you to taste something of the heart. Just a little glimpse and it sets off a process of inner revolution.\nThis is your name: Swami Veet Thomas. Veet means going beyond. Thomas is the name of one of the disciples of Jesus who became associated with doubt, who in the scriptures has been called doubting Thomas.\nHe loved Jesus, he surrendered to Jesus, but the doubt persisted. The surrender was not total, the trust was not total. And it is natural -- he cannot be condemned for that. How can one expect somebody to be total from the very beginning? Even to be partially involved with a man like Jesus of Buddha is more than can\nbe expected. So there is no condemnation of doubt, but doubt had to be transformed into trust.\nIt is all right to begin with doubt, but to remain there stuck, is bad. One has to go beyond, one has to transcend doubting.\nDoubt is a good beginning but not a good end. One can use doubt as a stepping stone towards truth, trust, surrender, love, but one should use it as a stepping stone, one should not be blocked by it. And that's what Thomas did: finally he overcame his doubt. His trust became total., he became one of the apostles of Jesus.\nThe story of Thomas is the story of every human being. Everybody has to begin with doubt, because the mind cannot say yes easily. No is very easy because the say no is not against the ego, to say yes goes against the ego. To say no is an attitude of fight, resistance, defence. To say yes is surrender. And naturally we are brought up in such a way that we don't know the beauty of surrender and we don't know the joy of love and we don't know the splendor of trust.\nWe know only doubt. Our schools, colleges, universities they all cultivate doubt in us. Our whole scientific structure depends on doubt. And the more you can doubt, the more you are thought to be a clever person, an intelligent person. And that is true as far as science is concerned: science is rooted in doubt. And it is good also in the outer world because doubt keeps you on guard, otherwise you will be cheated, you will be deceived by everybody, you will be lost, robbed by everything. Doubt helps you. So nothing is wrong in doubt. But as you move inwards it is useless. It is more harmful than helpful. It becomes a rock around your neck.\nIn the inner world trust is needed, just as in the outer world doubt is needed. In science doubt is needed, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nin religion trust in needed; hence the conflict between religion and science... That is very fundamental, it is not superficial. It is not about this theory or that.\nThose things can be settled -- and they are not important either.\nWhether the earth is flat or round, who bothers? How does it matter? Nobody's life depends on it. It may be flat, it may be round, it is okay. Who bothers whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun goes around the earth? It is all the same for you.\nIf the sun goes round the earth it is not going to change your life. You will remain the same, just as you were before, when the earth used to go around the sun.\nAbout these futile things settlements can be reached, that is not of much importance. But there is a fundamental problem and there is no compromise about that. Science is rooted in doubt and religion is rooted in trust. Religion grows only when you start saying yes and the yes has to be total, not partial.\nSo slowly slowly grow beyond doubt. use it as a stepping stone, but don't be used by it.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Lex. Dhyan means meditation.\nMeditation is a state of no-mind, when you are utterly silent, when not even a single thought is moving inside you, when the constant chattering of the mind has stopped, when there is no desire, no memory, no imagination. When all is quiet, utterly still, as if the whole world has stopped, time has stopped, all movement inside has topped, you have come to a still point.\nThat still point is the goal of meditation. And out of the experience of that still point within you everything else arises as a by-product: bliss, love, compassion... all that is beautiful, all that really makes you meaningful, all that gives you music and poetry, all that makes your heart dance with joy, all that transforms your life from misery into a celebration.\nLex is part of Alexander. Alexander means a helper of mankind. That is also the meaning of lex: one who helps. But you can help only if you have arrived at that still point, otherwise you cannot help. You cannot help if you are miserable, you will only contaminate people's lives with your misery. You cannot help if you are full of darkness, you will create shadows in other people's lives. If you are stinking you cannot share your fragrance with others. What fragrance? -- there is no fragrance at all. You are simply stinking! you will be sharing whatsoever you\nhave.\nIf you are angry you will share anger, if you are greedy you will share greed, if you are full of lust you will share your lust. We can share only that which we have, we cannot share that which we don't have. This has to be the fundamental thing to be remembered; hence the first step is meditation and the second step is compassion.\nFirst help yourself. I teach absolute selfishness, because this is my observation, my experience, that if you can be truly selfish, out of that true selfishness altruism is born and only out of that. There is no other way. A truly selfish person is one who tries in every possible way to be blissful, to be peaceful. The truly selfish person is one who first tries to find god for himself. His concern is absolutely selfish. He is not concerned with anybody -- the poverty in the world and the ill people and the old people and this and that --\nhe is simply concerned with one thing, his effort is one-pointed. Like an arrow he goes withinwards to find that still point from where life goes trough a radical change.\nOne that point is reached then it is going to be a simple phenomenon -- compassion, service, help. You can help then. It will be a joy to be shared. You won't feel any ego, that you are helping people, you won't feel holier-than-thou, you will be simply rejoicing. You won't gather any kind of ego out of you compassion. The ego is already gone, it is dead. It died in your meditation, now it cannot come back. And a man without the ego can be of tremendous help. Otherwise the so-called helpers of mankind and missionaries and servants of people, they are all mischievous people. They have created more mischief in the world than anybody else. Beware!\nThis is your new name: Swami Prem Agnivesh. Prem means love; agnivesh means attired in fire, aflame\n-- aflame with love.\nLove is fire. It burns all that is gross in you. It burns all that is non-essential in you. It burns all that is accidental in you. Only that which is pure gold remains. Hence people are afraid of love. They talk about love, they even deceive themselves that they are loving. They call many kinds of games love. But real love is passing through fire. It is not child's play. It is one of the greatest\nchallenges in life, in fact there is not greater adventure than love. It is easier to climb the Himalayas and easier to reach the moon than to be in love, because climbing and reaching to the moon needs technology, but it leaves you intact. You remain the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- same.\nLove is not science, love is not technology, love is not craft. It is a death, but a death that brings resurrection. It is a cross, and everybody has to carry their own cross. Nobody else can do it for you.\nAnd we are so attached to the non-essential, we are so identified with all kinds of stupidities that they all hinder the growth of love. We are so jealous, so full of possessiveness, that it is impossible for us to be in love.\nAnd we have heard so much about love, we know so much about love... that too is one of the greatest barriers, because to know about love is not to know love. The word 'about' means around. So one goes about and about, around and around, but one never penetrates the center. And love belongs to the center, not to the circumference.\nSo we have to move inwards to the very center of our being. And whatsoever it costs it is worth it. It is a higher value than life itself. So even if live has to be sacrificed for it one should not give it a second thought, one should simply jump into the fire of love. And one comes out purified, one comes out totally transformed. It is a new birth... a new being.\nFor sannyas we have chosen the color of fire for the simple reason that sannyas is nothing but another name for love, love for existence itself.\nThis is your new name: Swami Anand Pardeshi. Anand means bliss. Pardeshi means a stranger.\nMisery is very common. Misery seems to be part of our earthly experience. It\nseems to be natural. Bliss seems to be something of a stranger, that's why we have not understood Jesus, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Buddha. These were blissful beings. We could not absorb them. There was a gap between us and them, something unbridgeable, for the simple reason that they were talking a totally different kind of language.\nThey were talking a totally different kind of language. They were talking as if from some other world, from some other plane of existence, from some other dimension of which we are not at all aware, not even in our dreams.\nWe live in misery and we understand the language of misery. We have only heard the word 'bliss' but we don't understand what exactly it is. It is not our experience. It remains an empty word. But it can become an experience. We are potentially capable of bringing the beyond to the earth, of bringing eternity into time, of bringing eternal life into this momentary, temporary existence.\nWe can manage to make bliss start moving on the earth, at least in our hearts. It will remain a stranger here because the world will remain drowned in its misery. But if you are blissful you can help a few people because you can become a proof for them that bliss is possible, that bliss is not impossible. If this is experienced by people as happening in somebody's life, then they start seeking and searching for it. Then it is no more an empty word, somebody has given substance to it.\nAnd that's what my sannyasins have to do. They have to make bliss walk on earth, dance on earth. They have to bring the greatest stranger into the world -- and bliss is that greatest stranger. We have to provoke bliss, we have to bring it into the physical body. We have to create the space so that it can pulsate and can reach many people.\nThe earth has loved so long in misery that it appears as if misery is natural. It is only a chronic disease of millions of years but because it has persisted for so long, we think it is natural.\nThere is a valley in Mexico where a small tribe lives. The whole tribe is blind. Every child is born with eyes but within three months time he goes blind, because a certain fly there exists. Once the child is bitten by the fly he goes blind. So the tribe believed that everybody is born blind and that to be blind is a natural thing. Until they came in contact with people who had eyes they never\nsuspected. In their whole history everybody had been blind. They have become adjusted to their blindness. They work in their blindness.\nThey go to their fields, they take care of their cattle, and they bring up children and they have become adjusted. It is difficult, very difficult, but what to do? -- if this is life, then this is life.\nBut once they came across people who had eyes, then problems started arising in their minds. Then something is wrong with them, and something has to be done immediately.\nThis is what the situation is in the world: everybody is living in misery. We have to create a few blissful people so that they can become proofs that bliss can exist on the earth.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #30\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2740","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part29/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2740 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part29.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

we don't know the splendor of trust.</p><p>We know only doubt. Our schools, colleges, universities they all
cultivate doubt in us. Our whole scientific structure depends on doubt.
And the more you can doubt, the more you are thought to be a clever
person, an intelligent person. And that is true as far as science is
concerned: science is rooted in doubt. And it is good also in the outer
world because doubt keeps you on guard, otherwise you will be cheated,
you will be deceived by everybody, you will be lost, robbed by
everything. Doubt helps you. So nothing is wrong in doubt. But as you
move inwards it is useless. It is more harmful than helpful. It becomes
a rock around your neck.</p><p>In the inner world trust is needed, just as in the outer world doubt
is needed. In science doubt is needed, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

science... That is very fundamental, it is not superficial. It is not
about this theory or that.</p><p>Those things can be settled -- and they are not important either.</p><p>Whether the earth is flat or round, who bothers? How does it matter?
Nobody's life depends on it. It may be flat, it may be round, it is
okay. Who bothers whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun goes
around the earth? It is all the same for you.</p><p>If the sun goes round the earth it is not going to change your life.
You will remain the same, just as you were before, when the earth used
to go around the sun.</p><p>About these futile things settlements can be reached, that is not of
much importance. But there is a fundamental problem and there is no
compromise about that. Science is rooted in doubt and religion is rooted
in trust. Religion grows only when you start saying yes and the yes has
to be total, not partial.</p><p>So slowly slowly grow beyond doubt. use it as a stepping stone, but
don't be used by it.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Lex. Dhyan means meditation.</p><p>Meditation is a state of no-mind, when you are utterly silent, when
not even a single thought is moving inside you, when the constant
chattering of the mind has stopped, when there is no desire, no memory,
no imagination. When all is quiet, utterly still, as if the whole world
has stopped, time has stopped, all movement inside has topped, you have
come to a still point.</p><p>That still point is the goal of meditation. And out of the experience
of that still point within you everything else arises as a by-product:
bliss, love, compassion... all that is beautiful, all that really makes
you meaningful, all that gives you music and poetry, all that makes your
heart dance with joy, all that transforms your life from misery into a
celebration.</p><p>Lex is part of Alexander. Alexander means a helper of mankind. That
is also the meaning of lex: one who helps. But you can help only if you
have arrived at that still point, otherwise you cannot help. You cannot
help if you are miserable, you will only contaminate people's lives with
your misery. You cannot help if you are full of darkness, you will
create shadows in other people's lives. If you are stinking you cannot
share your fragrance with others. What fragrance? -- there is no
fragrance at all. You are simply stinking! you will be sharing
whatsoever you</p><p>have.</p><p>If you are angry you will share anger, if you are greedy you will
share greed, if you are full of lust you will share your lust. We can
share only that which we have, we cannot share that which we don't have.
This has to be the fundamental thing to be remembered; hence the first
step is meditation and the second step is compassion.</p><p>First help yourself. I teach absolute selfishness, because this is my
observation, my experience, that if you can be truly selfish, out of
that true selfishness altruism is born and only out of that. There is no
other way. A truly selfish person is one who tries in every possible way
to be blissful, to be peaceful. The truly selfish person is one who
first tries to find god for himself. His concern is absolutely selfish.
He is not concerned with anybody -- the poverty in the world and the ill
people and the old people and this and that --</p><p>he is simply concerned with one thing, his effort is one-pointed.
Like an arrow he goes withinwards to find that still point from where
life goes trough a radical change.</p><p>One that point is reached then it is going to be a simple phenomenon
-- compassion, service, help. You can help then. It will be a joy to be
shared. You won't feel any ego, that you are helping people, you won't
feel holier-than-thou, you will be simply rejoicing. You won't gather
any kind of ego out of you compassion. The ego is already gone, it is
dead. It died in your meditation, now it cannot come back. And a man
without the ego can be of tremendous help. Otherwise the so-called
helpers of mankind and missionaries and servants of people, they are all
mischievous people. They have created more mischief in the world than
anybody else. Beware!</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Prem Agnivesh. Prem means love; agnivesh
means attired in fire, aflame</p><p>-- aflame with love.</p><p>Love <em>is</em> fire. It burns all that is gross in you. It burns
all that is non-essential in you. It burns all that is accidental in
you. Only that which is pure gold remains. Hence people are afraid of
love. They talk about love, they even deceive themselves that they are
loving. They call many kinds of games love. But real love is passing
through fire. It is not child's play. It is one of the greatest</p><p>challenges in life, in fact there is not greater adventure than love.
It is easier to climb the Himalayas and easier to reach the moon than to
be in love, because climbing and reaching to the moon needs technology,
but it leaves you intact. You remain the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

a death, but a death that brings resurrection. It is a cross, and
everybody has to carry their own cross. Nobody else can do it for
you.</p><p>And we are so attached to the non-essential, we are so identified
with all kinds of stupidities that they all hinder the growth of love.
We are so jealous, so full of possessiveness, that it is impossible for
us to be in love.</p><p>And we have heard so much about love, we know so much about love...
that too is one of the greatest barriers, because to know about love is
not to know love. The word 'about' means around. So one goes about and
about, around and around, but one never penetrates the center. And love
belongs to the center, not to the circumference.</p><p>So we have to move inwards to the very center of our being. And
whatsoever it costs it is worth it. It is a higher value than life
itself. So even if live has to be sacrificed for it one should not give
it a second thought, one should simply jump into the fire of love. And
one comes out purified, one comes out totally transformed. It is a new
birth... a new being.</p><p>For sannyas we have chosen the color of fire for the simple reason
that sannyas is nothing but another name for love, love for existence
itself.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anand Pardeshi. Anand means bliss.
Pardeshi means a stranger.</p><p>Misery is very common. Misery seems to be part of our earthly
experience. It</p><p>seems to be natural. Bliss seems to be something of a stranger,
that's why we have not understood Jesus, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Buddha.
These were blissful beings. We could not absorb them. There was a gap
between us and them, something unbridgeable, for the simple reason that
they were talking a totally different kind of language.</p><p>They were talking a totally different kind of language. They were
talking as if from some other world, from some other plane of existence,
from some other dimension of which we are not at all aware, not even in
our dreams.</p><p>We live in misery and we understand the language of misery. We have
only heard the word 'bliss' but we don't understand what exactly it is.
It is not our experience. It remains an empty word. But it <em>can</em>
become an experience. We are potentially capable of bringing the beyond
to the earth, of bringing eternity into time, of bringing eternal life
into this momentary, temporary existence.</p><p>We can manage to make bliss start moving on the earth, at least in
our hearts. It will remain a stranger here because the world will remain
drowned in its misery. But if you are blissful you can help a few people
because you can become a proof for them that bliss <em>is</em> possible,
that bliss is not impossible. If this is experienced by people as
happening in somebody's life, then they start seeking and searching for
it. Then it is no more an empty word, somebody has given substance to
it.</p><p>And that's what my sannyasins have to do. They have to make bliss
walk on earth, dance on earth. They have to bring the greatest stranger
into the world -- and bliss is that greatest stranger. We have to
provoke bliss, we have to bring it into the physical body. We have to
create the space so that it can pulsate and can reach many people.</p><p>The earth has loved so long in misery that it appears as if misery is
natural. It is only a chronic disease of millions of years but because
it has persisted for so long, we think it is natural.</p><p>There is a valley in Mexico where a small tribe lives. The whole
tribe is blind. Every child is born with eyes but within three months
time he goes blind, because a certain fly there exists. Once the child
is bitten by the fly he goes blind. So the tribe believed that everybody
is born blind and that to be blind is a natural thing. Until they came
in contact with people who had eyes they never</p><p>suspected. In their <em>whole</em> history everybody had been blind.
They have become adjusted to their blindness. They work in their
blindness.</p><p>They go to their fields, they take care of their cattle, and they
bring up children and they have become adjusted. It is difficult, very
difficult, but what to do? -- if this is life, then this is life.</p><p>But once they came across people who had eyes, then problems started
arising in their minds. Then something is wrong with them, and something
has to be done immediately.</p><p>This is what the situation is in the world: everybody is living in
misery. We have to create a few blissful people so that they can become
proofs that bliss can exist on the earth.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

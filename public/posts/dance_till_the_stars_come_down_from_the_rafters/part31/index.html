Deva means divine, peter means rock -- divine rock.\nA rock seems to be the most material thing in existence, the most undivine. But it is only an appearance.\neven the rock has its heart, even the rock has its soul. even the rock has its own interiority. It is divine.\nTo symbolize this in the east we have made images of Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, out of rocks. It is a tremendously significant metaphor. It says that even a rock can be transformed into god, so there is no need to feel hopeless.\nWherever you are, you are always above the rock. If even a rock can become a Buddha, why not you?\nAnd to see god in rocks means that you can see god everywhere. One who is capable of seeing the divinity of a rock cannot condemn anybody as a sinner. It will be impossible, because even in the sinner he will see god. God is all that is. All are his forms.\nTo remember it is to become enlightened. So this is good: Ma Suni.\nThe sun symbolizes many things. The most important is that it is the center of the solar system. Just as the sun is the center of the solar system, god is the center of the whole universe. And just as the sun is the center of the solar system, inside you also is a sun. At the very center of your being it is also light. There is only one difference: the sun is exhaustible, but the inner light is inexhaustible.\nThis is the German meaning, but there is an Indian meaning to the word which is far more important.\nSuni means empty, utterly empty, a state of no-mind.\nThe constantly chattering mind keeps you always full of garbage. Once the chattering mind stops all garbage disappears. For the first time you start feeling spacious... yes, spaced out! You start feeling as if you contain the whole sky. And the moment you are absolutely empty something of the beyond starts penetrating you.\nGod can be a guest inside you only when you are empty, because he needs all the space. If you are too full of yourself there is no space inside you. To be utterly empty is to be ready to receive god.\nRemember both meanings: become a light unto yourself and become absolutely empty. If these two things can be fulfilled, life is fulfilled.\nThis is your new name: Swami Abol. Abol means an inner state of no-thought, of absolute silence, nothing to say, nothing to express: As if one is so much full of awe that the mind has stopped, the words have disappeared, and one has\ntasted for the first time the primordial silence that prevailed before the world was created. It can still be tasted, it can still be lived. All that is needed is the art of dispersing the crowd inside you.\nWe go on inviting. Rather than dispersing the crowd we go on accumulating more and more crowds inside. All the information that you collect, all the knowledge that you accumulate, all the memories, the whole past, they are crowding you. And it is not only that the past is there, the future also -- you go on imagining about it. You are crushed between the past and the future... so many memories and so many imaginations, fantasies. You never know a single moment when the mind stops speaking. Even in sleep it goes on talking to itself. In the night it dreams, in the day it thinks -- both are the same processes.\nThinking is verbal; it is verbal dreaming. And dreaming is non-verbal. It is thinking in a pictorial way.\nTwo sides of the same coin. One has to learn how to stop this nuisance called mind; and once you know how to stop it, then you can even use it, because you become the master. Then the mind is a beautiful slave, it can do many things. It can serve the master, but the master is asleep and the servant is pretending to be the master: This is the situation.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are getting involved in a process where the whole situation has to be put right. The master has to be the master and the slave has to be the slave. When everybody is in his own place great harmony arises and great joy if followed. It comes on its own accord. All that is needed is to put things right inside you. Everything is there but upside down. All that is needed to make you cosy, comfortable, joyous. Bliss is there, but everything is jumbled. It is like a room after an earthquake: all the furniture is there but nothing is in its place. It needs a new arrangement, a re-arrangement rather. And that's the function of sannyas, to create a new arrangement into your being, otherwise nothing is missing. Things are just in the wrong places. They have to be put right.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe mind has to function as a slave and you have to come out of your sleep. You have to become conscious, you have to be more aware.\nOnly by becoming more aware can you reclaim your mastery.\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Moha. Veet means going beyond, moha means attachment.\nSannyas simply means that: going beyond attachment. We become too easily attached, we become attached to everything. Life is a flux, nothing remains the same, but we hope and we desire that it will remain the same. There is so much frustration in the world because all our expectations remain unfulfilled.\nEach expectation brings a disaster.\nAttachment means clinging to something, wanting it the way it is forever. That is asking for the impossible. The young person wants to remain young forever, and that is impossible, sooner or later he has to become old. But then old age, rather than bringing joy, brings suffering. Otherwise old age should be the very crescendo of life. It should be the highest peak, snow-covered -- but it is a dark hole. It is a dark hole because we have been clinging to youth. We cling to the body, but the body has to go one day. Live in it, love it, respect it, take care of it, but don't become attached. Remember it is a caravanserai, an overnight's stay. But in the morning we have to go.\nAnd so is the case with everything. You fall in love with a person, you become attached, and immediately misery starts. You become possessive, you are afraid he may fall in love with somebody else.\nYou start hindering, obstructing his freedom, you start reducing him to a thing. All respect and love starts disappearing. It becomes only a continuous fight between two egos. You want to possess him and he wants to possess you. How can love exist in such a constant war? Attachment destroys love. It is poison to love.\nLove deeply, profoundly, but don't bring possessiveness and jealousy in. They are bound to come in if you become attached. The greatest art to learn in life is to float unattached. Pass through life but be untouched by anything. Things will come and go, you remain centered in your being, undistracted, undisturbed.\nThat's what sannyas is. And if a person can manage this state all bliss is his. He can have the whole universe.\nThis is a miracle: the universe belongs to those people who are non-possessive. Love belongs to those who are non-jealous.\nThis is your new name: Swami Amitrup. Amitrup means infinite beauty.\nGod is truth, god is beauty, god is bliss, god is music. God is all the possible values, the ultimate values.\nNo single value defines him, neither truth nor beauty nor bliss -- he is all. But to conceive the infinity, that multi-dimensionality go god is very difficult. It is better to focus yourself on one aspect of god. If you attain that, that becomes the door. By entering into the temple the whole temple is yours -- and there are many doors to the temple.\nA few people enter from truth, they seek and search for truth. A few people enter trough love, a few people enter through virtue and so on, so forth. A few people have entered though beauty too -- and that is going to be your meditation, you path. Contemplate the beauty of people. The more you can feet the beauty, the closer you will come to dog.\nWhen you see the beauty in a flower or in a star... the flower and star are just excuses, vehicles, the beauty belongs to god. The beauty is equivalent to god, that's why science cannot find it anywhere. And it immeasurable, it cannot be measured. It is infinite, it has no boundaries. So one who is lost in the beauty of existence is lost into infinity.\nLose yourself more and more in the sunset, in the sunrise, in the laughter of a child, in the rearing waves of the ocean. Lose yourself more and more wherever you encounter beauty. Let that be your encounter with god.\nThis is your new name: Ma Amito. Amito means the immeasurable.\nThe English word 'matter' means the measurable. It comes from the root which means measure. That which can be measured is matter. Science believes only in matter because it believes only in the measurable.\nThat which cannot be measured, science simply denies. That denying is just in\nself-defense, because to allow the immeasurable means you are allowing mysteries in. And science is very much afraid of the mysterious. It is very disturbing.\nThe mysterious is bound to be paradoxical. It cannot be reduced to logical statements. You cannot make a system out of it. It is illusive, it escapes all formulations. The more you try to catch hold of it, the farther 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\naway it is. It is mercurial, you cannot catch hold of it, you cannot have it in your fist. You can have it in an open hand but not in a fist. And science is a fist, religion is an open hand.\nReligion is not afraid of the immeasurable. In fact, on the contrary, it is enchanted by the immeasurable.\nIt takes the challenge of the immeasurable; it goes on that adventure. It risks all.\nThe moment you are ready to risk for that which is invisible, for that which is beyond words, beyond logic, beyond mind, for that which can never be measured, for that which can never be reduced to a system, you are taking a quantum leap. The mind will call it mad, but that madness is real sanity. That madness is the most precious phenomenon in existence.\nIt is because of a few mad people that humanity has not lost contact with God. A Buddha here, a Jesus there, a Mohammed somewhere else -- just a few people, but they remained in contact with God. And through them, the whole of humanity has remained in contact with God.\nSannyas means taking the jump into the unknown, into the immeasurable, into the unbounded. It needs courage because the boat is very small and you are going into the infinite ocean. But even if you are lost in the infinity of the ocean, you will have gained. Even if you are drowned in it you will be gaining not losing, you will be resurrected. You will attain to a higher plane of being.\nAnd those who go on clinging to the shore, afraid of the ocean -- so much so that they deny it -- say,\n\"There is no ocean at all. This is all imagination -- poetic, mystic imagination. There is no ocean. This shore is all.\" They may live in comfort, in a little cozy, small world of their own, but they are losing every moment. They are losing the great opportunity of growing up, of becoming mature, of going beyond death, of entering into God.\nSannyas is a challenge. It is accepting the invitation of the infinite.\nThis is your new name: Ma Haritama. Haritama means the green one, greenery.\nGreen represents the trees, the forest, the wild jungles. It represents nature -- and god is closest when you are in communion with nature. Talk with the trees, with rivers, with rocks. In the beginning it is very embarrassing, a little awkward, you feel as if you are going mad. But soon things settle, soon you start feeling responses. It is not you talking alone to the tree, the tree responds in its own way. Of course nature cannot speak human languages, it knows only one language, the language of silence. So to commune with nature you have to be utterly silent. Just being present to nature is enough, the nature start responding to you. And between these two silences, your silence and the silence of nature, something mysterious transpires. That mysterious phenomenon is god.\nIt is because green represents nature that Sufis have chosen green as their color. It also represents peace, because nature is peaceful. Just look at trees and you eyes start feeling a subtle peace.\nSo come closer and closer to nature and you will be coming closer and closer to ourselves in a very indirect way. Soon you will see god in flowers, in trees, in rivers, in clouds. And that god is not Christian, not Hindu, not Mohammedan. That god is simply god.\nThis is your new name: Swami Devaprem. Devaprem means divine love.\nEverything is divine, but love is more divine than anything else. Love is the highest quality a man can have pulsating around him. It is the greatest music that you can play upon your heart. More people have arrived home through love than by any other path.\nSo let this become your very center. Don't try to understand nature or existence. Try to love. Love brings its own understanding, not that of the intellect but of the heart. And when you understand something by the heart, though the heart, you really understand.\nWhen you understand only intellectually your understanding is very superficial, it is not real understanding. You understand words, language, grammar, but that is not the real point. For example if you are listening to poetry and you understand all the words and the grammar and the language and the metre, that does not mean that you understand poetry. Poetry is something more than all that. Poetry is more than the sum total of its parts. And that is available only through the heart.\nGod is the poetry of existence and love is the poetry of your inner being. When you are full of love you are in a poetic mood, your windows are open. You are open to the sun, to the wind, to the rain. And when you are full of love suddenly you see the whole existence full of love. It is a synchronicity: when you are full of love existence responds. It rises to meet you, it immediately comes close to you. It starts pulsating with you.\nAnd to pulsate with nature is to know what life is, what god is, what truth is, what beauty is. Meaning is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfelt for the first time when you pulsate with existence.\nMy whole effort here is to help you so that you can be in harmony, not in conflict with the world. It is a beautiful world. It is as perfect as it can be, it cannot be improved upon. But we are not in tune. We are lagging behind, we are not in step.\nTo be a sannyasins simply means to decide that now you will not try to conquer the world, but will be conquered by it. And that's what love is too, a desire to be conquered, a desire to dissolve into the whole.\nDeep down love is a let-go, but in that let-go comes victory. When you are ready to be conquered by existence, existence crowns you, because for the first time you know that you are not separate. The whole existence celebrates. the moment.\nThis is your new name: Ma Yasha. Yasha means the glorious one.\nWe all come with a glory hidden in our being, but it remains hidden. We never work to make it manifest. We remain like seeds and we die like seeds. We never become trees, we never bloom, we never come to flower. We take life for granted, as if this were all. This is not all. This is not even the beginning.\nThe life we ordinarily live is just keeping ourselves occupied. Between birth and death nothing really happens. People go on keeping themselves occupied, that's another matter, but nothing really happens.\nNeither love nor truth nor god -- nothing really happens. They hope, they desire, they expect, but hose are not the ways for real happenings. For real happenings some inner work is needed -- and the most important work is meditation.\nMeditation is the art of manifesting that which is unmanifest in you, of expressing that which is just a potential. Meditation is the art of self- actualization.\nMan is born only as an opportunity, just as an opportunity. One can miss the opportunity. And the majority of people go on missing it. Don't miss it, then only will you be a true sannyasin. The work to enter in is hard. Everything great is difficult, everything great is an uphill task. But if a few people have managed you can also manage it, because essentially we are not different. If a Buddha can manage, a Jesus can manage, you can manage, because essentially we are not different. They were people exactly like us, but they worked, they worked hard to grow. They poured their whole energy into one phenomenon, and that is meditation.\nSo while you are here go deeper into meditation. Learn at least one method so deeply that when you go away from here you can continue that method. It takes time and patience, but great is the fulfillment when it happens, great is the joy when meditation matures.\nThis is your new name: Swami Yoga Vigyan. Yoga means meeting, meeting with god, the ultimate meeting, and vigyan means the science -- the science of the\nultimate meeting.\nThat's what sannyas is. It is a science of the inner world. It is not objective, it is subjective. It has nothing to do with things but is has everything to do with your consciousness. It is an effort to raise your consciousness to its absolute potential. And when your consciousness has risen to its highest possible peak, bliss descends on you, peace descends on you, god starts hovering around you. And for the first time you know that you are immortal, eternal, that nothing can destroy you, that there is no need to be afraid. And when all fear disappears one starts living, only then can one start living. Fear paralyzes people -- and all the religions have tried to exploit fear.\nI am giving you a totally new vision of religion. It is not based on fear, it is rooted in fearlessness. So I don't teach you any dogma, any belief system, any philosophy. I simply give you the science of going in, of waking up your soul. And nobody else can do it for you. Nobody can do it on your behalf, you have to do it.\nThe master can only indicate the way -- you have to follow it.\nOnce even a little stirring in your consciousness starts happening the process is triggered. Then it goes on growing on its own. The first step is the most difficult. The seed falling into the soil, ready to die, that is the most difficult step. Once that has ben taken and the seed has died in the soil, the sprout starts growing.\nJust two leaves come in the beginning and then soon a great foliage and many branches and a huge tree with millions of flowers.…\nInitiation into sannyas is just like a seed falling into the soil. The disciple has to die in the master, he has to disappear as an ego, and then the work starts. Then you are really born. The first birth is through the mother and the father, the second, the true birth, is through the master.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"3512","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3512 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark60>‌</span>Chapter title:

rock -- divine rock.</p><p>A rock seems to be the most material thing in existence, the most
undivine. But it is only an appearance.</p><p>even the rock has its heart, even the rock has its soul. even the
rock has its own interiority. It is divine.</p><p>To symbolize this in the east we have made images of Buddha,
Mahavira, Krishna, out of rocks. It is a tremendously significant
metaphor. It says that even a rock can be transformed into god, so there
is no need to feel hopeless.</p><p>Wherever you are, you are always above the rock. If even a rock can
become a Buddha, why not you?</p><p>And to see god in rocks means that you can see god everywhere. One
who is capable of seeing the divinity of a rock cannot condemn anybody
as a sinner. It will be impossible, because even in the sinner he will
see god. God is all that is. All are his forms.</p><p>To remember it is to become enlightened. So this is good: Ma
Suni.</p><p>The sun symbolizes many things. The most important is that it is the
center of the solar system. Just as the sun is the center of the solar
system, god is the center of the whole universe. And just as the sun is
the center of the solar system, inside you also is a sun. At the very
center of your being it is also light. There is only one difference: the
sun is exhaustible, but the inner light is inexhaustible.</p><p>This is the German meaning, but there is an Indian meaning to the
word which is far more important.</p><p>Suni means empty, utterly empty, a state of no-mind.</p><p>The constantly chattering mind keeps you always full of garbage. Once
the chattering mind stops all garbage disappears. For the first time you
start feeling spacious... yes, spaced out! You start feeling as if you
contain the whole sky. And the moment you are absolutely empty something
of the beyond starts penetrating you.</p><p>God can be a guest inside you only when you are empty, because he
needs all the space. If you are too full of yourself there is no space
inside you. To be utterly empty is to be ready to receive god.</p><p>Remember both meanings: become a light unto yourself and become
absolutely empty. If these two things can be fulfilled, life is
fulfilled.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Abol. Abol means an inner state of
no-thought, of absolute silence, nothing to say, nothing to express: As
if one is so much full of awe that the mind has stopped, the words have
disappeared, and one has</p><p>tasted for the first time the primordial silence that prevailed
before the world was created. It can still be tasted, it can still be
lived. All that is needed is the art of dispersing the crowd inside
you.</p><p>We go on inviting. Rather than dispersing the crowd we go on
accumulating more and more crowds inside. All the information that you
collect, all the knowledge that you accumulate, all the memories, the
whole past, they are crowding you. And it is not only that the past is
there, the future also -- you go on imagining about it. You are crushed
between the past and the future... so many memories and so many
imaginations, fantasies. You never know a single moment when the mind
stops speaking. Even in sleep it goes on talking to itself. In the night
it dreams, in the day it thinks -- both are the same processes.</p><p>Thinking is verbal; it is verbal dreaming. And dreaming is
non-verbal. It is thinking in a pictorial way.</p><p>Two sides of the same coin. One has to learn how to stop this
nuisance called mind; and once you know how to stop it, then you can
even use it, because you become the master. Then the mind is a beautiful
slave, it can do many things. It can serve the master, but the master is
asleep and the servant is pretending to be the master: This is the
situation.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are getting involved in a process where
the <em>whole</em> situation has to be put right. The master has to be
the master and the slave has to be the slave. When everybody is in his
own place great harmony arises and great joy if followed. It comes on
its own accord. All that is needed is to put things right inside you.
Everything is there but upside down. All that is needed to make you
cosy, comfortable, joyous. Bliss is there, but everything is jumbled. It
is like a room after an earthquake: all the furniture is there but
nothing is in its place. It needs a new arrangement, a
<em>re</em>-arrangement rather. And that's the function of sannyas, to
create a new arrangement into your being, otherwise nothing is missing.
Things are just in the wrong places. They have to be put right.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The mind has to function as a slave and <em>you</em> have to come out
of your sleep. You have to become conscious, you have to be more
aware.</p><p>Only by becoming more aware can you reclaim your mastery.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Veet Moha. Veet means going beyond, moha
means attachment.</p><p>Sannyas simply means that: going beyond attachment. We become too
easily attached, we become attached to everything. Life is a flux,
nothing remains the same, but we hope and we desire that it will remain
the same. There is so much frustration in the world because all our
expectations remain unfulfilled.</p><p>Each expectation brings a disaster.</p><p>Attachment means clinging to something, wanting it the way it is
forever. That is asking for the impossible. The young person wants to
remain young forever, and that is impossible, sooner or later he has to
become old. But then old age, rather than bringing joy, brings
suffering. Otherwise old age should be the very crescendo of life. It
should be the highest peak, snow-covered -- but it is a dark hole. It is
a dark hole because we have been clinging to youth. We cling to the
body, but the body has to go one day. Live in it, love it, respect it,
take care of it, but don't become attached. Remember it is a
caravanserai, an overnight's stay. But in the morning we have to go.</p><p>And so is the case with everything. You fall in love with a person,
you become attached, and immediately misery starts. You become
possessive, you are afraid he may fall in love with somebody else.</p><p>You start hindering, obstructing his freedom, you start reducing him
to a thing. All respect and love starts disappearing. It becomes only a
continuous fight between two egos. You want to possess him and he wants
to possess you. How can love exist in such a constant war? Attachment
destroys love. It is poison to love.</p><p>Love deeply, profoundly, but don't bring possessiveness and jealousy
in. They are bound to come in if you become attached. The greatest art
to learn in life is to float unattached. Pass through life but be
untouched by anything. Things will come and go, you remain centered in
your being, undistracted, undisturbed.</p><p>That's what sannyas is. And if a person can manage this state all
bliss is his. He can have the whole universe.</p><p>This is a miracle: the universe belongs to those people who are
non-possessive. Love belongs to those who are non-jealous.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Amitrup. Amitrup means infinite
beauty.</p><p>God is truth, god is beauty, god is bliss, god is music. God is all
the possible values, the ultimate values.</p><p>No single value defines him, neither truth nor beauty nor bliss -- he
is all. But to conceive the infinity, that multi-dimensionality go god
is very difficult. It is better to focus yourself on one aspect of god.
If you attain that, that becomes the door. By entering into the temple
the whole temple is yours -- and there are many doors to the temple.</p><p>A few people enter from truth, they seek and search for truth. A few
people enter trough love, a few people enter through virtue and so on,
so forth. A few people have entered though beauty too -- and that is
going to be <em>your</em> meditation, you path. Contemplate the beauty
of people. The more you can feet the beauty, the closer you will come to
dog.</p><p>When you see the beauty in a flower or in a star... the flower and
star are just excuses, vehicles, the beauty belongs to god. The beauty
is equivalent to god, that's why science cannot find it anywhere. And it
immeasurable, it cannot be measured. It is infinite, it has no
boundaries. So one who is lost in the beauty of existence is lost into
infinity.</p><p>Lose yourself more and more in the sunset, in the sunrise, in the
laughter of a child, in the rearing waves of the ocean. Lose yourself
more and more wherever you encounter beauty. Let that be your encounter
with god.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Amito. Amito means the immeasurable.</p><p>The English word 'matter' means the measurable. It comes from the
root which means measure. That which can be measured is matter. Science
believes only in matter because it believes only in the measurable.</p><p>That which cannot be measured, science simply denies. That denying is
just in</p><p>self-defense, because to allow the immeasurable means you are
allowing mysteries in. And science is very much afraid of the
mysterious. It is very disturbing.</p><p>The mysterious is bound to be paradoxical. It cannot be reduced to
logical statements. You cannot make a system out of it. It is illusive,
it escapes all formulations. The more you try to catch hold of it, the
farther 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

have it in your fist. You can have it in an open hand but not in a fist.
And science is a fist, religion is an open hand.</p><p>Religion is not afraid of the immeasurable. In fact, on the contrary,
it is enchanted by the immeasurable.</p><p>It takes the challenge of the immeasurable; it goes on that
adventure. It risks all.</p><p>The moment you are ready to risk for that which is invisible, for
that which is beyond words, beyond logic, beyond mind, for that which
can never be measured, for that which can never be reduced to a system,
you are taking a quantum leap. The mind will call it mad, but that
madness is real sanity. That madness is the most precious phenomenon in
existence.</p><p>It is because of a few mad people that humanity has not lost contact
with God. A Buddha here, a Jesus there, a Mohammed somewhere else --
just a few people, but they remained in contact with God. And through
them, the whole of humanity has remained in contact with God.</p><p>Sannyas means taking the jump into the unknown, into the
immeasurable, into the unbounded. It needs courage because the boat is
very small and you are going into the infinite ocean. But even if you
are lost in the infinity of the ocean, you will have gained. Even if you
are drowned in it you will be gaining not losing, you will be
resurrected. You will attain to a higher plane of being.</p><p>And those who go on clinging to the shore, afraid of the ocean -- so
much so that they deny it -- say,</p><p>"There is no ocean at all. This is all imagination -- poetic, mystic
imagination. There is no ocean. This shore is all." They may live in
comfort, in a little cozy, small world of their own, but they are losing
every moment. They are losing the great opportunity of growing up, of
becoming mature, of going beyond death, of entering into God.</p><p>Sannyas is a challenge. It is accepting the invitation of the
infinite.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Haritama. Haritama means the green one,
greenery.</p><p>Green represents the trees, the forest, the wild jungles. It
represents nature -- and god is closest when you are in communion with
nature. Talk with the trees, with rivers, with rocks. In the beginning
it is very embarrassing, a little awkward, you feel as if you are going
mad. But soon things settle, soon you start feeling responses. It is not
you talking alone to the tree, the tree responds in its own way. Of
course nature cannot speak human languages, it knows only one language,
the language of silence. So to commune with nature you have to be
utterly silent. Just being present to nature is enough, the nature start
responding to you. And between these two silences, your silence and the
silence of nature, something mysterious transpires. That mysterious
phenomenon is god.</p><p>It is because green represents nature that Sufis have chosen green as
their color. It also represents peace, because nature is peaceful. Just
look at trees and you eyes start feeling a subtle peace.</p><p>So come closer and closer to nature and you will be coming closer and
closer to ourselves in a very indirect way. Soon you will see god in
flowers, in trees, in rivers, in clouds. And that god is not Christian,
not Hindu, not Mohammedan. That god is simply god.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Devaprem. Devaprem means divine
love.</p><p>Everything is divine, but love is more divine than anything else.
Love is the highest quality a man can have pulsating around him. It is
the greatest music that you can play upon your heart. More people have
arrived home through love than by any other path.</p><p>So let this become your very center. Don't try to understand nature
or existence. Try to love. Love brings its own understanding, not that
of the intellect but of the heart. And when you understand something by
the heart, though the heart, you really understand.</p><p>When you understand only intellectually your understanding is very
superficial, it is not real understanding. You understand words,
language, grammar, but that is not the real point. For example if you
are listening to poetry and you understand all the words and the grammar
and the language and the metre, that does not mean that you understand
poetry. Poetry is something more than all that. Poetry is more than the
sum total of its parts. And that is available only through the
heart.</p><p>God is the poetry of existence and love is the poetry of your inner
being. When you are full of love you are in a poetic mood, your windows
are open. You are open to the sun, to the wind, to the rain. And when
you are full of love suddenly you see the whole existence full of love.
It is a synchronicity: when you are full of love existence responds. It
rises to meet you, it immediately comes close to you. It starts
pulsating with you.</p><p>And to pulsate with nature is to know what life is, what god is, what
truth is, what beauty is. Meaning is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

not in conflict with the world. It is a beautiful world. It is as
perfect as it can be, it cannot be improved upon. But we are not in
tune. We are lagging behind, we are not in step.</p><p>To be a sannyasins simply means to decide that now you will not try
to conquer the world, but will be conquered by it. And that's what love
is too, a desire to be conquered, a desire to dissolve into the
whole.</p><p>Deep down love is a let-go, but in that let-go comes victory. When
you are ready to be conquered by existence, existence crowns you,
because for the first time you know that you are not separate. The whole
existence celebrates. the moment.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Yasha. Yasha means the glorious one.</p><p>We all come with a glory hidden in our being, but it remains hidden.
We never work to make it manifest. We remain like seeds and we die like
seeds. We never become trees, we never bloom, we never come to flower.
We take life for granted, as if this were all. This is not all. This is
not even the beginning.</p><p>The life we ordinarily live is just keeping ourselves occupied.
Between birth and death nothing really happens. People go on keeping
themselves occupied, that's another matter, but nothing really
happens.</p><p>Neither love nor truth nor god -- nothing really happens. They hope,
they desire, they expect, but hose are not the ways for real happenings.
For real happenings some inner work is needed -- and the most important
work is meditation.</p><p>Meditation is the art of manifesting that which is unmanifest in you,
of expressing that which is just a potential. Meditation is the art of
self- actualization.</p><p>Man is born only as an opportunity, just as an opportunity. One can
miss the opportunity. And the majority of people go on missing it. Don't
miss it, then only will you be a true sannyasin. The work to enter in is
hard. Everything great is difficult, everything great is an uphill task.
But if a few people have managed you can also manage it, because
essentially we are not different. If a Buddha can manage, a Jesus can
manage, you can manage, because essentially we are not different. They
were people exactly like us, but they worked, they worked hard to grow.
They poured their whole energy into one phenomenon, and that is
meditation.</p><p>So while you are here go deeper into meditation. Learn at least one
method so deeply that when you go away from here you can continue that
method. It takes time and patience, but great is the fulfillment when it
happens, great is the joy when meditation matures.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Yoga Vigyan. Yoga means meeting, meeting
with god, the ultimate meeting, and vigyan means the science -- the
science of the</p><p>ultimate meeting.</p><p><a href=part1 class=a>That's what sannyas is. It is a science of
the inner world. It is not objective, it is subjective. It has nothing
to do with things but is has everything to do with your consciousness.
It is an effort to raise your consciousness to its absolute
potential</a><a href=part5 class=a>. And when your consciousness has
risen to its highest possible peak, bliss descends on you, peace
descends on you, god starts hovering around you. And for the first time
you know that you are immortal, eternal, that nothing can destroy you,
that there is no need to be afraid. And when all fear disappears on</a>e
starts living, only then can one start living. Fear paralyzes people --
and all the religions have tried to exploit fear.</p><p>I am giving you a totally new vision of religion. It is not based on
fear, it is rooted in fearlessness. So I don't teach you any dogma, any
belief system, any philosophy. I simply give you the science of going
in, of waking up your soul. And nobody else can do it for you. Nobody
can do it on your behalf, you have to do it.</p><p>The master can only indicate the way -- you have to follow it.</p><p>Once even a little stirring in your consciousness starts happening
the process is triggered. Then it goes on growing on its own. The first
step is the most difficult. The seed falling into the soil, ready to
die, that is the most difficult step. Once that has ben taken and the
seed has died in the soil, the sprout starts growing.</p><p>Just two leaves come in the beginning and then soon a great foliage
and many branches and a huge tree with millions of flowers.…</p><p>Initiation into sannyas is just like a seed falling into the soil.
The disciple has to die in the master, he has to disappear as an ego,
and then the work starts. Then you are really born. The first birth is
through the mother and the father, the second, the true birth, is
through the master.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part30/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: None</span>

It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Jivano Jeannine. Jivano means life. Jeannine means grace of god.\nLife is a gift. It is given to us for no reason at all. It is not that we have earned it, it is not that we deserve it. In fact we are very undeserving, unworthy, but still god has given it to us.\nWhy he has given life to us is one of the most significant questions to be asked. He gives because he has too much... not that we deserve but because he is overflowing. God is overflowing energy, and energy delights in sharing. God is not a person but pure energy, a flood of energy; hence this whole existence, this multi-dimensional expression... So many flowers, so many trees, so many birds, animals, stars, people -- it is unbelievable how many forms he has taken.\nThe moment you start seeing this unbelievable mystery, this incredible phenomenon that we call life, you are bound to feel grateful. And that gratefulness is the beginning of sannyas because it is the beginning of prayer.\nThis is your name: Ma Deva Donja. Deva means divine. Donja means worthy.\nWe may not know it but we have infinite potential. We may be absolutely oblivious to it but we have contain the seeds of god. We can become gods, and unless we do there can never be any contentment in our hearts.\nContentment comes only as a by-product. When one achieves one's potential, when the seed becomes the flower, there is contentment, there is great rejoicing.\nReligion is the art of the seed growing towards the flower, of removing hindrances, obstacles, of dropping all that hinders and co-operating with all that helps. It is a subtle art and it comes only slowly slowly.\nOnce you have got the hang of it life starts moving very quickly. It jumps in leaps and bounds. But the preparation is long an arduous. And the greatest problem is patience.\nBe patient and learn the ways of growth, learn the ways of going in. They are all available here.\nWhatsoever is needed is available here. Not it is up to you to imbibe the spirit of it. So don't be a spectator.\nParticipate, and participate totally, because if sannyas means anything it means trust.\nYou are entering into the world of trust, you are leaving doubt behind. You are leaving mind itself behind. You are moving into the dimension of the heart. It is only through love that one grows, not through logic.\nThis is your name: Ma Anando Daniela. Anando means rejoice. Daniela means god is my judge because god is love and love cannot harm.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove knows how to forgive. Love can only forgive, because the essential core of\nlove is compassion. So all the ideas of hell and punishment are inventions of cruel human minds, inventions of religious sadists.\nThey were trying to hide their sadism behind hole garbage, but they were simply pathological.\nIf god is, there can be no hell, if god is, there can be no punishment. If god is, then there are only rewards and rewards because god is love!\nThat is my essential message: don't live out of fear, because there is no question of being punished. Live fearlessly because only then do you live totally. Fear naturally closes you, it does not allow you to open up.\nYou have to consider a thousand and one things before you can do a single thing\n-- whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, according to the church or not, whether the scriptures favor it or is against it. And you will get more and more confused the more you think about it.\nEven a very simple thing can be converted into a confusion. There ar Jaina monks in India who are afraid to breathe because their scriptures say that when you breath you kill small cells that live in the air. So they are afraid to breaths. Now such a small thing, such a natural thing has become a problem. They cannot run because then they will be breathing fast, so they have to walk slowly. And they continuously wear a strip of cloth on their noses so that the flow of the air is not strong. Now how can these people live at all?\nThey cannot even breathe!\nIf you look around in the so-called religious lives one thing is certain, every religion has been destructive. It has hampered them, obstructed them, made them so afraid of everything that small joys of life, drinking tea, becomes sin. Drinking water in the night becomes sin. And once you start moving in that direction, of making things into sins, you cannot live, you only drag.\nMy approach is totally different. There are mistakes but there is no sin at all. There are errors but no sin.\nAnd one can commit errors because it is only through committing errors that one learns. Only one thing has to be remembered, don't commit the same error again and again because that is stupid.\nOne should explore life, and in exploring sometimes you go astray. If you are too afraid of going astray you cannot explore. Then the whole adventure of life is crushed, killed, destroyed. And that's what so-called religious people have done: they have made religion so serious, so sombre, they have given religion such a long face.\nMy effort is to give you joy, gusto for life, courage to adventure, to move fearlessly, exploring all possibilities that life makes available, fearless in expanding and being open and vulnerable. Because god is our judge we need not be afraid.\nFinally at the judgement day when you see god, you can tell him, \"Yes, I have been drinking tea, please forgive me. I have tried a few other things also.\" And I think he will understand -- don't be worried!\nThis is your new name: Swami Anand Jayen. Anand means bliss. Jayen means victory.\nThe inward journey is the only way to find bliss. And when you have reached to the center of your being for the first time, you feel victorious; otherwise you are a failure. On the outside nobody ever is victorious.\nOn the outside there is only defeat and defeat and defeat, because what we are searching is not there at all, so we are doomed; our very search is doomed. Even a man like Alexander the Great died as a failure.\nOnly very few people have died victorious: a Jesus, a Buddha, a Kabir.\nAnd the reason for their victory was not that they were great conquerors of the world -- they conquered themselves. They had the greatest adventure of life: they moved to their center.\nWe live on the circumference. Sannyas means a decision, a commitment to move from the circumference to the center. At the center is bliss, at the center is victory. On the circumference is misery and defeat. It is up to you whether to make your life a joy, a work of art, a piece of music, or to just go on collecting junk.\nThis is your new name: Ma Usho. Usho means the dawn, just those beautiful moments when the night is over and the sun has not yet arrived, when it is just\nabout to arrive. The East is becoming orange and the earth is getting ready to welcome the sun. The birds have started singing, the trees are waking up. The whole earth is excited, life is again stirring out if its slumber. A new day is just to begin. Those are the most beautiful moments.\nAnd sannyas is exactly like that in the inner world. It is a dawn, the early moments, the interval between the night and the day, the gap. Hence the orange color has been chosen. It is the color if the morning sun. It is the color of the flowers, it is the color of blood, of life. It is the color of the spring in the East because the whole of nature become so colorful... and so many flowers. There are forests which look as if they ar on 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfire... so many red flowers.\nMake as much use as possible of these potential moments. These are very pregnant moments. The sun is not very far, but the night also has not gone very far away. One can turn back and move into the dark night again, one can close one's eyes and may not see the sun. Our habits die hard and we have lived in darkness long, too long; we have become accustomed to darkness, to blindness. To receive something absolutely new needs courage, needs tremendous courage, needs the heart of a gambler.\nSo be ready for it! remember not to turn back. Remember that one has to go ahead, whatsoever the risk and whatsoever the cost because growth is possible only if we risk all. If we are miserly in risking, growth cannot happen.\nThis is your new name: Swami Gitama. Gitama means song.\nLive life as a song. Make ordinary life as joyful as possible. Make something extraordinary out of it.\nDon't condemn the ordinary -- that is the way of the foolish person. Transform the ordinary -- that is the way of the wise. The mundane is not against the sacred, the mundane is only a stepping stone towards the sacred.\nReligions have condemned life too much; hence they have been destructive towards all joy, singing, dancing, celebrating. They praise the other world and the condemn this world. To me this and that are one.\nThere are not two worlds, there is only one world, and if you condemn this world you cannot praise the other. If you want to praise the other, you have to praise this. And once you learn how to live on this earth beautifully, joyously, you will become aware of the presence of god everywhere.\nSo live life as a song -- that is my message for you.\nThis is your new name: Swami Visarjan. Visarjan means dissolution, disappearing, evaporating.\nMan has to disappear for god to be. One has to be ready to die as an ego, as a separate entity, only then can one feel the totality, the whole. And to feel the whole is to be holy. To allow the whole to take possession of you totally is sannyas. It is like a river disappearing into the ocean. It will lose its identity, it will love its name and form, but it will gain much. It will gain the whole ocean.\nSannyas means a river dissolving, ready to dissolve into the ocean. In the real sense it is a suicide. Not the ordninary suicide in which one kills one's body. That is stupid because one will be entering into another body within seconds. And because on has been destructive towards the body one will get a far worse body than on had before... because one has not been grateful, one had shown one's ungratefulness.\nSannyas is a real suicide. One drops the ego, one no more thinks of oneself as separate, one becomes part of the whole. Then there is no anxiety. How can there be anxiety then? You are no more -- who is going to be anxious? There is no anguish possible. All anguish is a shadow of the ego -- the bigger the ego, the bigger the anguish. There can be no fear any more, not even the fear of death. It is the ego that is afraid of death, and you have already dropped that. Now there is no death for you. You have moved into eternal life.\nA river is afraid to die, but not the ocean. A dewdrop is bound to be afraid, sooner or later it has to die.\nBut not the ocean, the ocean is forever.\nWe are like dewdrops. Becoming a sannyasin means that we are taking the greatest quantum leap possible, we are ready to disappear as we are to become that which is our real destiny -- the whole.. And with that comes all benediction. Infinite joys start showering on you, and they go on showering. Then there is no end to it.\nThis is your new name: Ma Sangitama. Sangitama means music, harmony, melody.\nMan lives in a very unharmonious way because his whole effort is to live an an entity separate form the whole. He wants to live as a person. He is trying the impossible. He is part of the whole and can only be part of the whole. The very effort, the very idea that 'I am separate,' creates disharmony between you and the whole. That is misery. You start lagging behind the whole, you are never in tune with the whole. Something is always missing, something seems to be standing between you and the whole. And that which stands between you and the whole is your own ego, your own projection, your own idea of being separate.\nLet that ego die and great music explodes, because you are then in harmony with the whole. Then you live in tune and to be in tune with the whole is bliss. Not to be in tune with the whole is misery.\nA sannyasin has to do only one thing, that is, he has to die as a person to be reborn as part of the whole.\nAnd the paradox is that a part of the whole is not less than the whole. A part of the whole is as big as the whole, because the part is the whole.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis goes against ordinary mathematics, but this is part of a higher mathematics. That higher mathematics is religion. And religion is capable of living all kinds of paradoxes, of understanding all kinds of paradoxes. Science tries to explain away those paradoxes, religion accepts them. It never tries to explain them away\nbut it absorbs them, it tries to live the whole paradox without any choice, without choosing this part or that.\nLiving choicelessly, accepting the whole with all its contradictions, its polarities, makes one aware that the part is equal to the whole, the whole is equal to the part, and that by disappearing into the whole you don't lose anything. You gain everything, you gain the whole. Then stars start moving within you, then the whole sky is yours. You become spread all over existence. You are no more confined in a small body, you become unbounded, you become infinite.\nAnd that is the goal of sannyas, to become unbounded, to become infinite, because only then is there freedom, is there bliss, is there ecstasy.\nThis is your new name: Swami Ramo. Ramo means god.\nEveryone is god, everything is god. Existence and god are two words for the same phenomenon. so don't think of god in terms of a person who created the world, who controls the world, who manages the whole affair. Don't think of him as a supreme boss -- there is nobody like that. God is not somebody, god is a quality. It is far better to call it godliness. It is a fragrance. It simply says one thing, that the world does not consist only of the visible, it also contains the invisible. The world does not consist only of the measurable\n-- the world also contains the immeasurable. The world does not consist only of the outside, it also has the dimension of interiority. That's all that is meant by god, the dimension of the interiority.\nAnd you have to explore it now. That's what sannyas is all about: going into a deep exploration of who you are, of what this consciousness inside you is, who this witness is inside you that can witness the body, that can witness the mind. Who is this witness? From this moment that question should become suprememost. That should be your first priority. Your whole energy should start moving around it.\nAnd once it becomes your deepest concern, you ultimate concern, doors start opening. suddenly inside you, you start finding ways and means and paths that you have never travelled. They are all there, everything is ready, it is just that you are not moving in. You are focussed on the outside. Your back is towards your interiority.\nTurn in. A one-hundred-eighty-degree turn is needed. And once you start knowing who you are -- just little glimpses.\nEach moment you are in for surprise. Life becomes a dance, a celebration. Your eyes become full of wonder and awe. And that's what religiousness, true religiousness, is.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #31\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2871","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2871 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

you live totally. Fear naturally closes you, it does not allow you to
open up.</p><p>You have to consider a thousand and one things before you can do a
single thing</p><p>-- whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, according to the
church or not, whether the scriptures favor it or is against it. And you
will get more and more confused the more you think about it.</p><p>Even a very simple thing can be converted into a confusion. There ar
Jaina monks in India who are afraid to breathe because their scriptures
say that when you breath you kill small cells that live in the air. So
they are afraid to breaths. Now such a small thing, such a natural thing
has become a problem. They cannot run because then they will be
breathing fast, so they have to walk slowly. And they continuously wear
a strip of cloth on their noses so that the flow of the air is not
strong. Now how can these people live at all?</p><p>They cannot even breathe!</p><p>If you look around in the so-called religious lives one thing is
certain, every religion has been destructive. It has hampered them,
obstructed them, made them so afraid of everything that small joys of
life, drinking tea, becomes sin. Drinking water in the night becomes
sin. And once you start moving in that direction, of making things into
sins, you cannot live, you only drag.</p><p>My approach is totally different. There are mistakes but there is no
sin at all. There are errors but no sin.</p><p>And one can commit errors because it is only through committing
errors that one learns. Only one thing has to be remembered, don't
commit the same error again and again because that is stupid.</p><p>One should explore life, and in exploring sometimes you go astray. If
you are too afraid of going astray you cannot explore. Then the whole
adventure of life is crushed, killed, destroyed. And that's what
so-called religious people have done: they have made religion so
serious, so sombre, they have given religion such a long face.</p><p>My effort is to give you joy, gusto for life, courage to adventure,
to move fearlessly, exploring all possibilities that life makes
available, fearless in expanding and being open and vulnerable. Because
god is our judge we need not be afraid.</p><p>Finally at the judgement day when you see god, you can tell him,
"Yes, I have been drinking tea, please forgive me. I have tried a few
other things also." And I think he will understand -- don't be
worried!</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anand Jayen. Anand means bliss. Jayen
means victory.</p><p>The inward journey is the only way to find bliss. And when you have
reached to the center of your being for the first time, you feel
victorious; otherwise you are a failure. On the outside nobody ever is
victorious.</p><p>On the outside there is only defeat and defeat and defeat, because
what we are searching is not there at all, so we are doomed; our very
search is doomed. Even a man like Alexander the Great died as a
failure.</p><p>Only very few people have died victorious: a Jesus, a Buddha, a
Kabir.</p><p>And the reason for their victory was not that they were great
conquerors of the world -- they conquered themselves. They had the
greatest adventure of life: they moved to their center.</p><p>We live on the circumference. Sannyas means a decision, a commitment
to move from the circumference to the center. At the center is bliss, at
the center is victory. On the circumference is misery and defeat. It is
up to you whether to make your life a joy, a work of art, a piece of
music, or to just go on collecting junk.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Usho. Usho means the dawn, just those
beautiful moments when the night is over and the sun has not yet
arrived, when it is just</p><p>about to arrive. The East is becoming orange and the earth is getting
ready to welcome the sun. The birds have started singing, the trees are
waking up. The whole earth is excited, life is again stirring out if its
slumber. A new day is just to begin. Those are the most beautiful
moments.</p><p>And sannyas is exactly like that in the inner world. It is a dawn,
the early moments, the interval between the night and the day, the gap.
Hence the orange color has been chosen. It is the color if the morning
sun. It is the color of the flowers, it is the color of blood, of life.
It is the color of the spring in the East because the whole of nature
become so colorful... and so many flowers. There are forests which look
as if they ar on 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

very pregnant moments. The sun is not very far, but the night also has
not gone very far away. One can turn back and move into the dark night
again, one can close one's eyes and may not see the sun. Our habits die
hard and we have lived in darkness long, too long; we have become
accustomed to darkness, to blindness. To receive something absolutely
new needs courage, needs tremendous courage, needs the heart of a
gambler.</p><p>So be ready for it! remember not to turn back. Remember that one has
to go ahead, whatsoever the risk and whatsoever the cost because growth
is possible only if we risk <em>all</em>. If we are miserly in risking,
growth cannot happen.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Gitama. Gitama means song.</p><p>Live life as a song. Make ordinary life as joyful as possible. Make
something extraordinary out of it.</p><p>Don't condemn the ordinary -- that is the way of the foolish person.
Transform the ordinary -- that is the way of the wise. The mundane is
not against the sacred, the mundane is only a stepping stone towards the
sacred.</p><p>Religions have condemned life too much; hence they have been
destructive towards all joy, singing, dancing, celebrating. They praise
the other world and the condemn this world. To me this and that are
one.</p><p>There are not two worlds, there is only one world, and if you condemn
this world you cannot praise the other. If you want to praise the other,
you have to praise this. And once you learn how to live on this earth
beautifully, joyously, you will become aware of the presence of god
everywhere.</p><p>So live life as a song -- that is my message for you.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Visarjan. Visarjan means dissolution,
disappearing, evaporating.</p><p>Man has to disappear for god to be. One has to be ready to die as an
ego, as a separate entity, only then can one feel the totality, the
whole. And to feel the whole is to be holy. To allow the whole to take
possession of you totally is sannyas. It is like a river disappearing
into the ocean. It will lose its identity, it will love its name and
form, but it will gain much. It will gain the whole ocean.</p><p>Sannyas means a river dissolving, ready to dissolve into the ocean.
In the real sense it is a suicide. Not the ordninary suicide in which
one kills one's body. That is stupid because one will be entering into
another body within seconds. And because on has been destructive towards
the body one will get a far worse body than on had before... because one
has not been grateful, one had shown one's ungratefulness.</p><p>Sannyas is a real suicide. One drops the ego, one no more thinks of
oneself as separate, one becomes part of the whole. Then there is no
anxiety. How can there be anxiety then? You are no more -- who is going
to be anxious? There is no anguish possible. All anguish is a shadow of
the ego -- the bigger the ego, the bigger the anguish. There can be no
fear any more, not even the fear of death. It is the ego that is afraid
of death, and you have already dropped that. Now there is no death for
you. You have moved into eternal life.</p><p>A river is afraid to die, but not the ocean. A dewdrop is bound to be
afraid, sooner or later it has to die.</p><p>But not the ocean, the ocean is forever.</p><p>We are like dewdrops. Becoming a sannyasin means that we are taking
the greatest quantum leap possible, we are ready to disappear as we are
to become that which is our real destiny -- the whole.. And with that
comes all benediction. Infinite joys start showering on you, and they go
on showering. Then there is no end to it.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Sangitama. Sangitama means music, harmony,
melody.</p><p>Man lives in a very unharmonious way because his whole effort is to
live an an entity separate form the whole. He wants to live as a person.
He is trying the impossible. He is part of the whole and can only be
part of the whole. The very effort, the very idea that 'I am separate,'
creates disharmony between you and the whole. That is misery. You start
lagging behind the whole, you are never in tune with the whole.
Something is always missing, something seems to be standing between you
and the whole. And that which stands between you and the whole is your
own ego, your own projection, your own idea of being separate.</p><p>Let that ego die and great music explodes, because you are then in
harmony with the whole. Then you live in tune and to be in tune with the
whole is bliss. Not to be in tune with the whole is misery.</p><p>A sannyasin has to do only one thing, that is, he has to die as a
person to be reborn as part of the whole.</p><p>And the paradox is that a part of the whole is not less than the
whole. A part of the whole is as big as the whole, because the part
<em>is</em> the whole.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This goes against ordinary mathematics, but this is part of a higher
mathematics. That higher mathematics is religion. And religion is
capable of living all kinds of paradoxes, of understanding all kinds of
paradoxes. Science tries to explain away those paradoxes, religion
accepts them. It never tries to explain them away</p><p>but it absorbs them, it tries to live the whole paradox without any
choice, without choosing this part or that.</p><p>Living choicelessly, accepting the whole with all its contradictions,
its polarities, makes one aware that the part is equal to the whole, the
whole is equal to the part, and that by disappearing into the whole you
don't lose anything. You gain everything, you gain the whole. Then stars
start moving within you, then the whole sky is yours. You become spread
all over existence. You are no more confined in a small body, you become
unbounded, you become infinite.</p><p>And that is the goal of sannyas, to become unbounded, to become
infinite, because only then is there freedom, is there bliss, is there
ecstasy.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Ramo. Ramo means god.</p><p>Everyone is god, everything is god. Existence and god are two words
for the same phenomenon. so don't think of god in terms of a person who
created the world, who controls the world, who manages the whole affair.
Don't think of him as a supreme boss -- there is nobody like that. God
is not somebody, god is a quality. It is far better to call it
godliness. It is a fragrance. It simply says one thing, that the world
does not consist only of the visible, it also contains the invisible.
The world does not consist only of the measurable</p><p>-- the world also contains the immeasurable. The world does not
consist only of the outside, it also has the dimension of interiority.
That's all that is meant by god, the dimension of the interiority.</p><p>And you have to explore it now. That's what sannyas is all about:
going into a deep exploration of who you are, of what this consciousness
inside you is, who this witness is inside you that can witness the body,
that can witness the mind. Who is this witness? From this moment that
question should become suprememost. That should be your first priority.
Your whole energy should start moving around it.</p><p>And once it becomes your deepest concern, you ultimate concern, doors
start opening. suddenly inside you, you start finding ways and means and
paths that you have never travelled. They are all there, everything is
ready, it is just that you are not moving in. You are focussed on the
outside. Your back is towards your interiority.</p><p>Turn in. A one-hundred-eighty-degree turn is needed. And once you
start knowing who you are -- just little glimpses.</p><p>Each moment you are in for surprise. Life becomes a dance, a
celebration. Your eyes become full of wonder and awe. And that's what
religiousness, true religiousness, is.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

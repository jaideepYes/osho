It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Deva Glorianda. Deva means divine, glorianda means glory.\nAll glory is god's. The moment we start thinking that it is ours we start falling, falling from grace, and soon the glory disappears. The glory exists only in those moments when you are not. The moment you come back, the glory is no more. The glory and the ego exist together, their co-existence is impossible. One has to choose either one or the other.\nIf one chooses the ego one chooses a life without glory, without fragrance, without joy. If you are ready to choose egolessness then all glory starts descending on you, starts radiating through you. You become a vehicle of god, a medium, a hollow bamboo flute, and a song starts flowing through you.\nThe whole art of sannyas is that -- not to be, because that is the way of being divine.\nMa Deva Eileen. Deva means divine. Eileen means ever joyful, cheerful, blissful, ecstatic.\nMan alone is misery. Man plus god, and all misery disappears; misery is transformed into ecstasy. But man has to become part of god, man has to dissolve into god. One has to learn the art of dying in god, because that is the way of resurrection.\nEcstasy is possible. Each moment can be ecstatic and each moment can be a higher ecstasy than the preceding one. One can go on from one peak to a higher peak, from peak to peak. Only one requirement has to be fulfilled and that is that we should not think of ourselves as separate. We are not separate.\nTo think of ourselves as separate from existence is illusory, and that illusion creates fear, anxiety, anguish. That illusion gives us the idea of birth and death, and with birth and death we are crushed. Between these two rocks we can't be ecstatic, it is impossible. When death is there, how can you be overflowing with joy? It's impossible. How can you ignore death?\nBut the moment you start learning that you are not separate from the whole there is no death. You have always been here before your birth, and you will always be here after your death. You are an intrinsic part of the totality, of the cosmos. Then immediately all fear, all misery, all sadness, disappears. And what is left behind is ecstasy.\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Lynn. Anand means bliss. Lynn has two meanings; both are beautiful and significant. One is Welsh, then Lynn means idol, an idol of bliss, an image of bliss. The other meaning is Anglo-Saxon, then it means waterfall. That is far more beautiful: a waterfall of bliss.\nBliss has some qualities of the waterfall. One, Lao Tzu has said that the way towards god is a watercourse way. The water always seeks the humblest place. It always goes to the place which is the lowest. It is non-ambitious. It stands at the back. It has no ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJesus says: Those who are first in the world will be the last in my kingdom of god, and those who are the last here will be the first in my kingdom of god.\nA sannyasin has to be like water: humble, egoless, a nobody. Yes, that is exactly the definition of sannyas, the quality of nobodiness. Everybody is trying to brag that they are somebody -- through money, power, prestige. A sannyasin has nothing to brag about. He is simply ordinary, a nobody. But the miracle is that when you are nobody you become extraordinary. The miracle is that when you can stand at the back, suddenly you have become the first, at least for those who understand. And only their opinion has any meaning. Those who don't understand, their opinion has no significance.\nBliss is also a waterfall because it comes from the beyond, it showers on you. You are at the receiving end, You cannot create it, you can only be open to it. You can open your doors, your heart, and wait patiently. Whenever the right moment is there, whenever you are ready -- and by ready I mean whenever you are really a nobody -- it immediately starts falling on you. It falls like a waterfall. You are bathed, purified, transformed through it. But it comes from the beyond. It is not of the earth, it is divine, it is godly.\nThis is your name: Ma Deva Agnete. Deva means divine, Agnete means meek.\nJesus says: \"Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god.\" In that simple statement he has stated the whole truth. Nothing more can be added to it, it contains all the scriptures. But one thing has to be understood, by meek, neither Jesus nor I mean cultivated meekness, not something practised, because then it is no more meek. Then it is simply a facade... a beautiful facade but hidden behind it is the ego and that's what you will find in the so-called religious people. They walk -- that glint in their eyes if you watch and observe -- you can see, that holier-than-thou look. And they are trying to prove that they are the meekest, nobody can compare with them. That is again the same game -- the old game of the ego -- played now in the name of meekness, humbleness.\nOne has to be very watchful because mind is so cunning that it can cultivate a certain quality which will be only on the surface, just like a painted smile.\nReal meekness arises out of meditativeness, not out of cultivation. It arises out of understanding, it arises by seeing the falsity of the ego.\nThe moment you see that the ego is false, it disappears. You don't have to\ncultivate meekness. Simply, the ego is no more there. And when the ego is no more there, you are meek, without any cultivation, without any practise. Then one is truly meek, unself-consciously meek.\nIf you are self-consciously meek, it is false. When you are unself-consciously meek, then it has tremendous beauty. It opens the door to all the mysteries of life.\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Eberhard. Prem means love. Eberhard means as strong as the wild bear.\nLove needs tremendous strength. It cannot exist in a cowardly heart, it cannot grow in fear. It needs courage, guts. And the greatest courage in the world is in merging with the other, losing oneself in the other.\nThe ego is very afraid of it, because once you know the taste of being egoless, even for a moment, you can never be the same again. You can never get back into your ego again with the same identity, the same old gestalt.\nEven if for a moment you have seen that the ego is not a necessity, that it can be put aside, you would not like to carry it any more, because it is only a burden, unnecessary, futile. It is as if one is trying to swim with a rock around one's neck.\nOnce you have seen that the ego can be put aside you feel so free. Such a great freedom starts happening to you that you would not like to get into the old prison again. Once you have seen an egoless moment you will feel so blissful that instantly you will understand that all the misery, the whole hell, was created by the ego.\nEgo is hell and egolessness is heaven. Once this has been understood life starts moving into a new dimension.\nThat dimension is sannyas.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Bernhard. Anand means bliss. Bernhard means the same as eberhard: bear-strong.\nLove, bliss, meditation, truth -- they all need a great strength. One has to be together. Ordinarily people are just fragments. Thousands of pieces are there but\nthere is not any integrity. To be weak means to be divided, to be undivided is strength. And whenever you are undivided you become an individual, literally; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nindividual means indivisible. It brings strength, and strength becomes the foundation of god.\nAll the meditations are devices to bring your fragments together, to melt into each other, to create a kind of oneness in you, to bring a center to your being. Once that center starts growing you will have enough courage to go into the unknown, then you will risk all. And god asks: Risk all -- only then can you be blissful, loving, truthful, divine. Only then can you be a real, authentic sannyasin.\nThis is your new name: Swami Visarjano. Visarjano means dissolution.\nMan has to dissolve himself into the whole, but we go on doing just the contrary: we go on protecting ourselves, safeguarding. We go on continuously avoiding any merger, meeting. We go on becoming harder and harder and closed. That's how we have become rocklike. And that was your old name, Peter. Peter means rock. It is good that you have decided to change the old name. Now become waterlike, fluid, flowing, vulnerable, open.\nThe moment one is ready to die in the whole there is the beginning of a new birth. That's the whole meaning of Jesus' resurrection: fist the crucifixion and then resurrection.\nDissolution means crucifixion. If you can pass through it then resurrection is inevitable. What you loose is meaningless and what you gain has tremendous meaning. What you lose is only illusory, what you gain is the reality itself. What you lose is hell, what you gain is heaven.\nThis is your new name: Ma Narayani. Narayani means divine, godly. From this moment start thinking in terms of being divine.\nScience goes on telling people \"You are nothing but animals. Human beings are only a species of animal,\" they say. And for three hundred years they have been propagating the idea. It has penetrated very deeply into our blood and bones and marrow. We are not animals. In fact animals themselves are not animals. We are divine, so are the animals.\nReligion is rooted in this vision of man being divine, of the universe being divine. Science reduces everything to the lowest denominator. If you bring a lotus flower to the scientist, he will say, \"It is nothing but mud; because it grows in mud, it comes out of mud.\"\nIf you bring mud to a mystic he will say, \"Don't be worried -- there are thousands of lotuses hidden in it, because lotuses grow out of mud.\"\nThe world needs again religious vision. My effort here is to give you this perspective that you are not mud, that you are lotuses. Even mud is not mud, because it contains lotuses, because it can be transformed into lotuses; it is only a raw form of lotus.\nReligion looks from the highest point and makes the highest point the decisive factor. Science looks at the lowest and makes it the decisive factor.\nFrom this moment this has to be your vision: you are divine, so is the whole universe. With that vision it is easy to move upwards, because if there is nothing upward, no possibility of anything higher, then one forgets all about transforming oneself. If there is a possibility then one starts groping for it. The possibility is there; the buddhas are enough proof, enough evidence for it.\nThis is your new name: Swami Devapriyo. Devapriyo means beloved of god.\nStart your journey of sannyas with this as a seed: God loves you. We are not orphans. God fathers and mothers existence. He is both father and mother, because he is not a person but a presence. The whole existence is surrounded by a divine energy that protects you, cares for you, is always available. If you go on missing it, it is only because of you. If you keep your doors closed, the sun may be outside but you will live in darkness. Even if the doors are open and the sun is there, you can keep your eyes closed and you will still live in darkness. So is the case with god: his love is always there but our hearts are not open, our hearts are closed.\nSannyas means the opening of the heart, making your heart available to god so that you can receive, so that you can pulsate with the whole, in accord with the whole. The art of meditation is nothing but the art of pulsating with the whole, in tune with the whole.\nAnd then great benediction is yours.\nThis is your new name: Ma Prabhu Mayo. Prabhu means god, mayo means magic -- god's magic.\nThe whole existence is a magical phenomenon. It is miracle, it is mystery, it is unfathomable. It is really unknowable -- not only unknown, but unknowable. The more wise a person becomes, the more he knows 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthat he knows nothing. And when everything starts becoming mysterious and you are surrounded by all kinds of mysteries... which is the fact. We are surrounded by all kinds of mysteries. It is just that we are so much enclosed in our heads that we go on overlooking, ignoring, and that impoverishes our life. Ignoring the mysteries of life becomes our ignorance.\nOne has to be available to life's mysteries, its magic, and then suddenly one is again a child -- innocent, full of wonder and awe. That wonder and awe is the fundamental quality of a religious person. A Jesus lives with that wonder and awe, a Buddha lives with that wonder and awe. In their lives all the Buddhas are illogical, paradoxical, for the simple reason that they are surrounded by magic, not by mathematics; they are surrounded by love, not by logic.\nStart unlearning the ways of the calculating mind and start learning the ways of the uncalculating heart.\nAnd any moment, suddenly the door is open. In fact it has always remained open. It is just that we are not looking at it. We go on looking at the wall.\nThis is your new name: Swami Ramaprem. It means love for god.\nGod cannot be reduced to a question. If you reduce god to a question you miss the whole point. Then you will get many answers but no answer will quench your thirst. God is a thirst, not a question. It is a hunger. It is the hunger of the heart, and the hunger of the heart is called love. One has to be hungry for god.\nMy work here is to create an appetite in you. All these meditations, dances, music, are nothing but appetizers. Slowly slowly a tremendous hunger takes possession of you. Then god becomes your quest.\nThen without god you cannot live. Then life seems to be meaningless without him. God is met only at that point when you are ready to sacrifice life for him, never before it.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #19\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2578","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2578 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

be added to it, it contains all the scriptures. But one thing has to be
understood, by meek, neither Jesus nor I mean cultivated meekness, not
something practised, because then it is no more meek. Then it is simply
a facade... a beautiful facade but hidden behind it is the ego and
that's what you will find in the so-called religious people. They walk
-- that glint in their eyes if you watch and observe -- you can see,
that holier-than-thou look. And they are trying to prove that they are
the meekest, nobody can compare with them. That is again the same game
-- the old game of the ego -- played now in the name of meekness,
humbleness.</p><p>One has to be very watchful because mind is so cunning that it can
cultivate a certain quality which will be only on the surface, just like
a painted smile.</p><p>Real meekness arises out of meditativeness, not out of cultivation.
It arises out of understanding, it arises by seeing the falsity of the
ego.</p><p>The moment you see that the ego is false, it disappears. You don't
have to</p><p>cultivate meekness. Simply, the ego is no more there. And when the
ego is no more there, you are meek, without any cultivation, without any
practise. Then one is truly meek, unself-consciously meek.</p><p>If you are self-consciously meek, it is false. When you are
unself-consciously meek, then it has tremendous beauty. It opens the
door to all the mysteries of life.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Prem Eberhard. Prem means love. Eberhard
means as strong as the wild bear.</p><p>Love needs tremendous strength. It cannot exist in a cowardly heart,
it cannot grow in fear. It needs courage, guts. And the greatest courage
in the world is in merging with the other, losing oneself in the
other.</p><p>The ego is very afraid of it, because once you know the taste of
being egoless, even for a moment, you can never be the same again. You
can never get back into your ego again with the same identity, the same
old gestalt.</p><p>Even if for a moment you have seen that the ego is not a necessity,
that it can be put aside, you would not like to carry it any more,
because it is only a burden, unnecessary, futile. It is as if one is
trying to swim with a rock around one's neck.</p><p>Once you have seen that the ego <em>can</em> be put aside you feel so
free. Such a great freedom starts happening to you that you would not
like to get into the old prison again. Once you have seen an egoless
moment you will feel so blissful that instantly you will understand that
all the misery, the whole hell, was created by the ego.</p><p>Ego is hell and egolessness is heaven. Once this has been understood
life starts moving into a new dimension.</p><p>That dimension is sannyas.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Bernhard. Anand means bliss. Bernhard
means the same as eberhard: bear-strong.</p><p>Love, bliss, meditation, truth -- they all need a great strength. One
has to be together. Ordinarily people are just fragments. Thousands of
pieces are there but</p><p>there is not any integrity. To be weak means to be divided, to be
undivided is strength. And whenever you are undivided you become an
individual, literally; 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>individual means indivisible. It brings strength, and strength
becomes the foundation of god.</p><p>All the meditations are devices to bring your fragments together, to
melt into each other, to create a kind of oneness in you, to bring a
center to your being. Once that center starts growing you will have
enough courage to go into the unknown, then you will risk all. And god
asks: Risk all -- only then can you be blissful, loving, truthful,
divine. Only then can you be a real, authentic sannyasin.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Visarjano. Visarjano means
dissolution.</p><p>Man has to dissolve himself into the whole, but we go on doing just
the contrary: we go on protecting ourselves, safeguarding. We go on
continuously avoiding any merger, meeting. We go on becoming harder and
harder and closed. That's how we have become rocklike. And that was your
old name, Peter. Peter means rock. It is good that you have decided to
change the old name. Now become waterlike, fluid, flowing, vulnerable,
open.</p><p>The moment one is ready to die in the whole there is the beginning of
a new birth. That's the whole meaning of Jesus' resurrection: fist the
crucifixion and then resurrection.</p><p>Dissolution means crucifixion. If you can pass through it then
resurrection is inevitable. What you loose is meaningless and what you
gain has tremendous meaning. What you lose is only illusory, what you
gain is the reality itself. What you lose is hell, what you gain is
heaven.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Narayani. Narayani means divine, godly.
From this moment start thinking in terms of being divine.</p><p>Science goes on telling people "You are nothing but animals. Human
beings are only a species of animal," they say. And for three hundred
years they have been propagating the idea. It has penetrated very deeply
into our blood and bones and marrow. We are not animals. In fact animals
themselves are not animals. We are divine, so are the animals.</p><p>Religion is rooted in this vision of man being divine, of the
universe being divine. Science reduces everything to the lowest
denominator. If you bring a lotus flower to the scientist, he will say,
"It is nothing but mud; because it grows in mud, it comes out of
mud."</p><p>If you bring mud to a mystic he will say, "Don't be worried -- there
are thousands of lotuses hidden in it, because lotuses grow out of
mud."</p><p>The world needs again religious vision. My effort here is to give you
this perspective that you are not mud, that you are lotuses. Even mud is
not mud, because it contains lotuses, because it can be transformed into
lotuses; it is only a raw form of lotus.</p><p>Religion looks from the highest point and makes the highest point the
decisive factor. Science looks at the lowest and makes it the decisive
factor.</p><p>From this moment this has to be your vision: you are divine, so is
the whole universe. With that vision it is easy to move upwards, because
if there is nothing upward, no possibility of anything higher, then one
forgets all about transforming oneself. If there is a possibility then
one starts groping for it. The possibility is there; the buddhas are
enough proof, enough evidence for it.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Devapriyo. Devapriyo means beloved of
god.</p><p>Start your journey of sannyas with this as a seed: God loves you. We
are not orphans. God fathers and mothers existence. He is both father
and mother, because he is not a person but a presence. The whole
existence is surrounded by a divine energy that protects you, cares for
you, is always available. If you go on missing it, it is only because of
you. If you keep your doors closed, the sun may be outside but you will
live in darkness. Even if the doors are open and the sun is there, you
can keep your eyes closed and you will still live in darkness. So is the
case with god: his love is always there but our hearts are not open, our
hearts are closed.</p><p>Sannyas means the opening of the heart, making your heart available
to god so that you can receive, so that you can pulsate with the whole,
in accord with the whole. The art of meditation is nothing but the art
of pulsating with the whole, in tune with the whole.</p><p>And then great benediction is yours.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Prabhu Mayo. Prabhu means god, mayo means
magic -- god's magic.</p><p>The whole existence is a magical phenomenon. It is miracle, it is
mystery, it is unfathomable. It is really unknowable -- not only
unknown, but unknowable. The more wise a person becomes, the more he
knows 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>that he knows nothing. And when everything starts becoming mysterious
and you are surrounded by all kinds of mysteries... which is the fact.
We are surrounded by all kinds of mysteries. It is just that we are so
much enclosed in our heads that we go on overlooking, ignoring, and that
impoverishes our life. Ignoring the mysteries of life becomes our
ignorance.</p><p>One has to be available to life's mysteries, its magic, and then
suddenly one is again a child -- innocent, full of wonder and awe. That
wonder and awe is the fundamental quality of a religious person. A Jesus
lives with that wonder and awe, a Buddha lives with that wonder and awe.
In their lives all the Buddhas are illogical, paradoxical, for the
simple reason that they are surrounded by magic, not by mathematics;
they are surrounded by love, not by logic.</p><p>Start unlearning the ways of the calculating mind and start learning
the ways of the uncalculating heart.</p><p>And any moment, suddenly the door is open. In fact it has always
remained open. It is just that we are not looking at it. We go on
looking at the wall.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Ramaprem. It means love for god.</p><p>God cannot be reduced to a question. If you reduce god to a question
you miss the whole point. Then you will get many answers but no answer
will quench your thirst. God is a thirst, not a question. It is a
hunger. It is the hunger of the heart, and the hunger of the heart is
called love. One has to be hungry for god.</p><p>My work here is to create an appetite in you. All these meditations,
dances, music, are nothing but appetizers. Slowly slowly a tremendous
hunger takes possession of you. Then god becomes your quest.</p><p>Then without god you cannot live. Then life seems to be meaningless
without him. God is met only at that point when you are ready to
sacrifice life for him, never before it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

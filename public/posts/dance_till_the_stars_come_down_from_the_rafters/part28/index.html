Barbara means stranger. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSannyas is a homesickness. Here, we are strangers. In the body, in the mind, we are not at home. We reside in the bodymind complex, we even become identified with it. And we suffer much because of that identification, because basically it is wrong, false. We don't belong to the earth, we belong to the beyond.\nReligion as such is this feeling, that although we are here, it is only for the time being. And this time has to be used for preparation for the real journey towards home.\nMind is going away from home, meditation is going towards home. It is a one-\nhundred-degree turn.\nMind is extrovert, meditation is introversion. The moment you reach your own center, which is neither body nor mind, which is only pure consciousness, you have arrived home. Then you are no more a stranger.\nThis is your name: Swami Antar Dieter. Antar means inner; dieter means ruler -- the inner ruler.\nOur kingdom is of the inner. On the outside we are bound to remain beggars. Whatsoever we do that fundamental fact cannot be changed. We can have much money, power, prestige, but behind all that facade the beggar will be hiding, the beggar will remain there.\nLook deeply into rich peoples' eyes and you can see the beggar. Look into the eyes of politicians, the powerful people, and you will see the beggar. They are hiding, they are trying in every possible way not to allow anybody to know who they are. They are creating a camouflage around themselves, but they know, and everybody else who has any intelligence is bound to know, that the beggar is there.\nAs you turn inwards the beggar disappears. You enter into the kingdom of god and for the first time you are really a king. For his whole life Jesus was talking about this inner kingdom, but he was misunderstood.\nAs has always been the case with all the awakened persons; they have been misunderstood.\nThe politicians, the rulers, thought that he was talking about this world and this worldly kingdom. They thought that he was a politician and was provoking people into rebellion. They were utterly wrong. They were just proving themselves stupid.\nJesus had nothing to do with this world or the kingdom of this world or the power of this world. He was talking of something else, he was using these words as metaphors.\nThe real kingdom is inside you. And it is already there, you have not to create it, it has only to be remembered. All techniques of meditation are techniques of self-remembering.\nThis is your name: Ma Antar Tomiko. Antar means inner. Tomiko means treasure.\nThe treasure is within. Don't look without any more. The treasure has not to be achieved. It is your innermost nature. It has only to be discovered or, better, rediscovered. We have only forgotten about it.\nHence the spiritual journey in only a journey in the metaphorical sense, in the symbolic sense. It is not a real journey. You are not going from one point to another. You are not going anywhere, you are simply becoming awakened at the same point where you had always been. It is an awakening.\nIt is as when you wake up in the morning. You don't have to come back home, though in the dreams you had gone far far away, maybe to the moon. But you don't have to come back, you don't wake up on the moon. In the morning you wake up in your room and all those dreams simply fade away.\nThe world is nothing but our dreams... because we are asleep and we are dreaming many kinds of dreams. Now it is time to wake up. Enough you have dreamt and enough you have slept. It is only a question of deciding that \"enough is enough and now I decide to wake up.\" In that very decision, if it is intense, passionate, total, the awakening happens and one finds oneself where one has always been. And then you have the inexhaustible treasure of joy, of love, of celebration. It is a multi-splendored phenomenon. All the colors of the rainbow and all the notes of music are there.\nAnd it is not something separate from you so it cannot be taken away. You cannot lose it, even if you want to lose it, you cannot. You are it.\nThis is your name: Swami Veet Agyan. Veet means going beyond; Agyan means ignorance -- going beyond ignorance.\nThere is only one ignorance and that is not knowing yourself.\nThe word 'ignorance' is beautiful. It comes from ignoring. To ignore oneself is ignorance. And we are all ignoring. We become so much occupied with the non- essential that the essential is ignored. We become so much concerned with the outside that the inner is ignored, so much so that slowly slowly we completely forget about it; that it even exists.\nWe start living on the outside. We live in the marketplace, in the crowds, in the clubs, in the hotels, in the theaters. We never come back to our own self. We don't give even little gaps, intervals, to have a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nglimpse of who we are. And that is the fundamental question for a sannyasin to ask -- who am I? And nobody can answer it for you. You have to find it yourself.\nEverybody has to find it on one's own. And it is beautiful that nobody else can answer it, otherwise you will never be able to rejoice in finding yourself. A borrowed answer is bound to be a borrowed answer. It will not penetrate to the very core of your being. It will remain in the head, in the memory.\nAnd it has been answered -- in the Vedas, in the Koran, in the Bible -- you can learn all those things but that learning is not knowing. Knowledge is not knowing. In fact one can also use knowledge to ignore oneself. Knowledge can become one of the most deceptive things in life, because it can give you a false feeling of knowing while you know nothing. It can give you a false feeling that you have arrived while really you are fast asleep and snoring. You are only dreaming that you have arrived. Knowledge is dreaming that \"I have arrived.\" It is not dispersion of ignorance.\nIgnorance disappears only through meditation; there is no other way. Not by knowledge, not by mind.\nMind is incapable of destroying ignorance. On the contrary it covers it up.\nBeing a sannyasin means you are entering in the world of meditation and that is the greatest adventure in life: going beyond mind, going beyond thoughts, and becoming more and more centered in pure consciousness. Just a witnessing -- that's what you are. The day you experience that you have gone beyond ignorance is a day of great blessings, great benediction.\nThis is your new name: Swami Surodaya. Surodaya means sunrise.\nSannyas is the beginning of the day, sannyas is the dawn. Let the night disappear, don't cling to it.\nBecome more alert so that the night cannot take possession of you again. Night means unawareness, day means awareness. Night means living a life mechanically, day means living a life with awareness, consciously.\nEach act has to become a meditation. The ordinary acts of life have to be transformed. Walking, walk more consciously. Breathing, be more alert; see the breath going in, coming out. Just don't move in life like a zombie. Start destroying that zombiness, and slowly slowly, chunk by chunk it disappears.\nAnd when your heart is full of light, life has arrived for the first time. You are really born, spiritually born. Jesus calls it rebirth. In the East we call such a person a dvija, twice-born.\nThis is your new name: Ma Apurvo. Apurvo means the unique one.\nEach individual is unique, no two individuals are alike. God is very original. He never repeats himself, he creates one person only once. Through the whole of the past, in the long long past, there has never been a person like you, and in the whole infinite future there will never be a person like you.\nRespect yourself. God has given you so much respect, god has showered so many blessings. And the greatest is that he makes you unique.\nA sannyasin is one who has no ego but tremendous self-respect. He thinks the ego is all. It is not.\nSelf-respect is very humble, very simple. Ego is comparative, it says, \"I am higher than you.\"\nSelf-respect simply says, \"I am unique, you are unique -- there is no comparison.\" It is a non-comparative phenomenon. And the moment you respect yourself, you start respecting the whole existence: the people, the trees, the animals, because they are all unique. and seeing this unique universe you start feeling the presence of a great creator. It is not the work of an assembly line, it is not the work of a manufacturer. It is the work of a creator, and a creator who must be infinite, inexhaustible. Otherwise, sooner or later one starts repeating. But god never repeats.\nSeeing this universe it is impossible not to feel the presence of a great creator. And only with that feeling of the presence of god, of the presence of creator, does one start feeling prayer arising in the heart, gratitude arising in the heart, thankfulness arising in the heart. And to be thankful is to be religious. To feel gratitude is the most glorious experience of life because it is live in its absolute profundity, depth and height.\nThis is your new name: Ma Prem Smrati. Prem leaves love. Smrati means remembrance.\nRemember that you are love. The society makes everybody forget. The society creates all kinds of conditionings which don't allow you to remember that you are love.…\nJesus says: God is love. If god is love then all is love because all comes from him. If the source is love then we can't be anything else. But the society loves on hate, anger, greed, ambition, violence, war. Up to now that has been the way of the society. It is very animalistic. Even animals are not so ugly, even animals 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhave some grace. Man has lost even that.\nTo be initiated into sannyas means to be initiated into love. For me sannyas and love are synonymous. If you can love totally, unconditionally, then god is not far away. Then god is in the very heartbeat of your being.\nWherever love is, god is. Love is the fragrance of god's presence.\nSo remember it and destroy all that society has created in you to prevent you from remembering your reality. We are made of love and we are made for love.\nThis is your new name: Swami Dinesh. Dinesh means the sun.\nThe sun is not only the source of light, the sun also represents in a visible form\nthe ultimate light -- god.\nHence sun-worship... In all parts of the world the sun has been worshipped as god. It is symbolic: god is light and sun is the visible source of light. The sun is an image of god.\nThe outer light indicates the inner. Just as there is a sun in the outer sky there is a sun in the inner sky.\nBut we have to begin with the outer because we know only the outer. The inner has disappeared from our vision.\nFor sannyasins we have chosen the color of the sun, the color of the sunrise for the simple reason that god is light, that god is a sunrise.\nStart meditating more and more on light and that will be immensely helpful to you. Early in the morning when the sun is rising look at it for a few seconds, then close your eyes and look at it with closed eyes. In the night look at the moon or the stars, or inside your room, at just a small candle... That too represents god in its own small way, like a dewdrop represents the ocean... Look at the candle flame for a few minutes, then close your eyes and see it with closed eyes. Soon you will be able to see it inside. The outer will only trigger a process in you and you will be able to see light inside.\nThe day it happen that one starts seeing one's inner being, full of light, radiating, one has taken a turn.\nYou have moved towards the inner, you have taken the first essential step and the most important step.\nEverything else then is easy. The first step is the most difficult because one has to take a total turn.\nFor centuries and centuries we have ben going out and out and now suddenly to turn in... our mechanism does not work. Hence it takes a little time, a little practicing, so that the mechanism starts functioning again.\nIt becomes flexible and a little liquid and you can move inwards.\nOne day it happens that one can see the inner sun. That day is the day of\nliberation, hence it is called enlightenment. You become light.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #29\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2318","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2318 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the head, in the memory.</p><p>And it has been answered -- in the Vedas, in the Koran, in the Bible
-- you can learn all those things but that learning is not knowing.
Knowledge is not knowing. In fact one can also use knowledge to ignore
oneself. Knowledge can become one of the most deceptive things in life,
because it can give you a false feeling of knowing while you know
nothing. It can give you a false feeling that you have arrived while
really you are fast asleep and snoring. You are only dreaming that you
have arrived. Knowledge is dreaming that "I have arrived." It is not
dispersion of ignorance.</p><p>Ignorance disappears only through meditation; there is no other way.
Not by knowledge, not by mind.</p><p>Mind is incapable of destroying ignorance. On the contrary it covers
it up.</p><p>Being a sannyasin means you are entering in the world of meditation
and that is the greatest adventure in life: going beyond mind, going
beyond thoughts, and becoming more and more centered in pure
consciousness. Just a witnessing -- that's what you are. The day you
experience that you have gone beyond ignorance is a day of great
blessings, great benediction.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Surodaya. Surodaya means sunrise.</p><p>Sannyas is the beginning of the day, sannyas is the dawn. Let the
night disappear, don't cling to it.</p><p>Become more alert so that the night cannot take possession of you
again. Night means unawareness, day means awareness. Night means living
a life mechanically, day means living a life with awareness,
consciously.</p><p>Each act has to become a meditation. The ordinary acts of life have
to be transformed. Walking, walk more consciously. Breathing, be more
alert; see the breath going in, coming out. Just don't move in life like
a zombie. Start destroying that zombiness, and slowly slowly, chunk by
chunk it disappears.</p><p>And when your heart is full of light, life has arrived for the first
time. You are really born, spiritually born. Jesus calls it rebirth. In
the East we call such a person a dvija, twice-born.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Apurvo. Apurvo means the unique one.</p><p>Each individual is unique, no two individuals are alike. God is very
original. He never repeats himself, he creates one person only once.
Through the whole of the past, in the long long past, there has never
been a person like you, and in the whole infinite future there will
never be a person like you.</p><p>Respect yourself. God has given you so much respect, god has showered
so many blessings. And the greatest is that he makes you unique.</p><p>A sannyasin is one who has no ego but tremendous self-respect. He
thinks the ego is all. It is not.</p><p>Self-respect is very humble, very simple. Ego is comparative, it
says, "I am higher than you."</p><p>Self-respect simply says, "I am unique, you are unique -- there is no
comparison." It is a non-comparative phenomenon. And the moment you
respect yourself, you start respecting the whole existence: the people,
the trees, the animals, because they are all unique. and seeing this
unique universe you start feeling the presence of a great creator. It is
not the work of an assembly line, it is not the work of a manufacturer.
It is the work of a creator, and a creator who must be infinite,
inexhaustible. Otherwise, sooner or later one starts repeating. But god
never repeats.</p><p>Seeing this universe it is impossible not to feel the presence of a
great creator. And only with that feeling of the presence of god, of the
presence of creator, does one start feeling prayer arising in the heart,
gratitude arising in the heart, thankfulness arising in the heart. And
to be thankful is to be religious. To feel gratitude is the most
glorious experience of life because it is live in its absolute
profundity, depth and height.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Prem Smrati. Prem leaves love. Smrati means
remembrance.</p><p>Remember that you are love. The society makes everybody forget. The
society creates all kinds of conditionings which don't allow you to
remember that you are love.…</p><p>Jesus says: God is love. If god is love then all is love because all
comes from him. If the source is love then we can't be anything else.
But the society loves on hate, anger, greed, ambition, violence, war. Up
to now that has been the way of the society. It is very animalistic.
Even animals are not so ugly, even animals 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

sannyas and love are synonymous. If you can love totally,
unconditionally, then god is not far away. Then god is in the very
heartbeat of your being.</p><p>Wherever love is, god is. Love is the fragrance of god's
presence.</p><p>So remember it and destroy all that society has created in you to
prevent you from remembering your reality. We are made of love and we
are made for love.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Dinesh. Dinesh means the sun.</p><p>The sun is not only the source of light, the sun also represents in a
visible form</p><p>the ultimate light -- god.</p><p>Hence sun-worship... In all parts of the world the sun has been
worshipped as god. It is symbolic: god is light and sun is the visible
source of light. The sun is an image of god.</p><p>The outer light indicates the inner. Just as there is a sun in the
outer sky there is a sun in the inner sky.</p><p>But we have to begin with the outer because we know only the outer.
The inner has disappeared from our vision.</p><p>For sannyasins we have chosen the color of the sun, the color of the
sunrise for the simple reason that god is light, that god is a
sunrise.</p><p>Start meditating more and more on light and that will be immensely
helpful to you. Early in the morning when the sun is rising look at it
for a few seconds, then close your eyes and look at it with closed eyes.
In the night look at the moon or the stars, or inside your room, at just
a small candle... That too represents god in its own small way, like a
dewdrop represents the ocean... Look at the candle flame for a few
minutes, then close your eyes and see it with closed eyes. Soon you will
be able to see it inside. The outer will only trigger a process in you
and you will be able to see light inside.</p><p>The day it happen that one starts seeing one's inner being, full of
light, radiating, one has taken a turn.</p><p>You have moved towards the inner, you have taken the first essential
step and the most important step.</p><p>Everything else then is easy. The first step is the most difficult
because one has to take a total turn.</p><p>For centuries and centuries we have ben going out and out and now
suddenly to turn in... our mechanism does not work. Hence it takes a
little time, a little practicing, so that the mechanism starts
functioning again.</p><p>It becomes flexible and a little liquid and you can move inwards.</p><p>One day it happens that one can see the inner sun. That day is the
day of</p><p>liberation, hence it is called enlightenment. You become light.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

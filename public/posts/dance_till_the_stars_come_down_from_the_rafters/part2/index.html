It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Zina) -- Your name: Ma Zina. Zina is from Persian. It simply means the feminine. It is significant, particularly in the search for truth. One has to be feminine. By feminine I mean receptive, open. One has to be a woman. By woman I mean just like a womb. Whether one is male or female is irrelevant.\nUnless one becomes a womb one never becomes pregnant with god. One cannot conquer god, one can't be aggressive -- that is the sure way to fail. One can only surrender and allow god to happen. That's what the quality of being feminine really is. That is the essential core of meditation.\n(To Regina-Celia) -- This is your name: Ma Regina Celia. Regina comes from Latin; it means the queen.\nCelia also comes from Latin; it comes from a woman saint, Cecilia, who was tortured, killed. But she went on singing while she was being tortured and killed. She died singing, hence she became the patron saint of music.\nBoth words are beautiful. Everyone is born as a king or a queen, but we have to discover it. It is not apparent, not on the surface. It is hidden deep inside; our kingdom is there.\nAnd music is of immense importance for a sannyasin, because music is the most natural door to meditation. All other meditations are more artificial. Music is natural because nature is full of music: the sound of running water and the wind passing through the trees and the birds singing and the bees humming.\nThe whole of existence is a deep melody: one has to learn to listen to it.\nThe way to listen to it is to be simply available, open, vulnerable, not thinking about it. Thinking is a disturbance, a distraction. It is just listening without any thinking. Then it penetrates to your very core and it can become the first glimpse of your inner kingdom. Music can reveal the queen in you, music can confer queenship, kingship. It releases you from all kinds of bondage because it releases you from mind and mind is the only prison there is.\n(To Regina) -- This is your name: Ma Regina. Regina can have two meanings: one from Latin, then it means the queen, the other from the Teutonic, then it means purity. Both meanings can be joined together.\nOnly purity will make you a queen, nothing else; not the riches of the world, not wealth, not political power.\nThose are all ego trips and basically they keep you a beggar because you go on desiring more and more.\nThat's what the state of a beggar is.\nThe state of a king or a queen is when there is no desire left and that's exactly what purity is. when all desires are gone the gold is pure. When all the desires are gone the mind is gone, the ego is gone; there is noting which can make you impure any more. And that lotuslike purity, that innocence is divine, That's what gives you the first evidence of god, the first proof that god is not only a concept bu a reality that permeates the whole.\n(To Keith) -- This is your name: Swami Keith. Keith means wind.\nThe life of a sannyasin can be most appropriately represented by the wind. It is freedom: freedom from all conditioning, freedom from all ideology, freedom from words, theories, freedom from min. One becomes just like the wind; then the whole sky is yours.\nOrdinarily people are living in cages: Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, German, English, Indian, Communist, Fascist, Socialist, all kinds of cages -- political, religious, social. A Sannyasin has to come out of all prisons and be just like the wind. then all directions are your, the whole of existence is yours. And 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfreedom is the highest value in life. There is nothing higher, more sacred than freedom.\n(To Allan) -- This is your name: Swami Allan. Allan has two meanings; both are beautiful, significant.\nOne is cheerfulness and the other is harmony.\nHarmony can be achieved only by the cheerful one. The sad person can never attain to harmony. Misery means nothing but disharmony. When you are not in accord with yourself and with existence that is misery.\nWhen you are deep in accord within yourself and with the without too, bliss arises.\nCheerfulness is a by-product of harmony and also a stepping stone towards harmony. One can either begin by being cheerful, and harmony is attained, or one can begin from the other end by being harmonious\n, and cheerfulness is attained, But both always happen together. you cannot have one. The harmonious person is bound to be cheerful, overflowing with joy and the joyous person cannot be but harmonious.\nMy effort here is to give you methods of both kinds. It sirs a few to start by being cheerful; those who are alert enough to snap out of their settled misery -- which is just a mind-phenomenon, which is just like a dream, a nightmare. Those who are capable of snapping our of it can start be being cheerful, by singing, by dancing, and they will become harmonious. If it is not possible ... For a few people the nightmare seems so real that they go round and round but they cannot come out to it. It seems impossible for them to come it.\nWhatsoever they do feeds the nightmare. Then they have to start by being harmonious. Then dancing and singing are not,, and cannot be their beginning. Then they have to so something like zazen, vipassana...\nSome silent meditation which creates harmony first. Once it is there they can dance and they can sing.\nFor you it will be good to start being cheerful. You can manage it!\n(To Ingo) -- This is your name: Swami Ingo. Ingo comes from eng. Ing is a mythological god of peace and prosperity.\nBe peaceful and you are prosperous... but not in the ordinary sense of the word 'prosperity'. Not that you will become wealthy, not that you will have many possessions by being peaceful, but one thing is certain: by being peaceful, whatsoever you have will be more than enough, you will be contented with it. That is prosperity.\nThere was one Indian mystic who used to call himself 'Emperor'; his name was Rama but he always called himself Emperor Rama. The first book that he wrote, he entitled SIX ORDERS OF EMPEROR\nRAMA. When he went to America people used to ask him 'Why do you call yourself Emperor? We don't see anything in you, in fact you seem to be just a beggar.' A begging bowl was his only possession. He would laugh and we would say 'That's why I call myself an emperor because I desire nothing and I possess the whole of existence!'\nWhen you don't desire, a tremendous prosperity happens; that of non-desire. Peace brings prosperity, prosperity of the inner, prosperity not on the material plane but on the spiritual plane.\nLearn how to be peaceful. That is the most secret art to be learned. The only thing worth learning in life is peace. Meditate, sing, dance, and learn to be more peaceful. As you become peaceful you will be surprised that immense prosperity starts surrounding you.\nYou may be a beggar on the surface but deep down you become the emperor and that is real richness because it cannot be taken away from you. Not even death can take it away from you.\n(To Nanni) This is your new name: Ma Vijayo. Vijayo means victory.\nThere are two kinds of victory. One is violent, aggressive -- you have to attack, you have to be destructive. But that victory remains superficial. The other can be killed, destroyed, reduced to a slave, but deep down he still remains unconquered. You can conquer the body of a person but you cannot conquer his soul.\nThere is a totally different kind of victory that comes through love, not through violence. That is true victory. It conquers the soul. But the problem with true victory is that you have to surrender to conquer. It is very paradoxical. You have to be ready to be defeated, joyously, willingly. And that's what sannyas is.\n(To June) This is your new name: Ma Sadhyo. Sadhyo means the end, the goal. The goal is not outside\n-- you are the goal. The target is not somewhere else -- you are the target. You are both the means and you are the end.\nUnless one discovers oneself one remains just a means. The moment one has discovered oneself one has found the end. The circumference of your being is the means: the body, the mind, the heart. Use all of them 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nto reach the innermost core, the very center -- and that is the end. In finding it one finds everything that is needed to be found. In knowing it all is known. In\nreaching it one reaches god.\n(To Elmy): -- This is your new name: Yogo means the meeting -- the meeting of the dewdrop with the ocean, the meeting of the individual with the universal, the meeting of the part with the whole... and that's what we are seeking and searching for.\nSannyas is nothing but a bridge, a rainbow bridge, a bridge between the part and the whole, a bridge between you and god. But one thing has to be fulfilled: you have to slowly slowly disappear. In the same proportion as you disappear, god starts appearing. As the ultimate meeting point you are not found at all, only god is found.\nSannyas is a death and a resurrection: death of the small ego and rebirth of the ultimate, death of the momentary and birth of the eternal.\n(To Henk): -- This is your new name: Swami Pravasi. Pravasi means stranger.\nWe are all strangers here. This is not our home, our home is somewhere else. We are in a foreign land.\nTo remain outside oneself is to remain homeless; to come in is to be back home.\nNow ever effort has to be made to come in. No stone is to be left unturned, everything has to be risked, because nothing is more precious than this turning in. everything can be lost for it, sacrificed for it, because all else is trivia.\nRemember that sannyas simply means the beginning of a long inward journey. But to take the first step is almost half the journey.\n(To Peter): This is your new name: Swami Surodaya. Surodaya means the sunrise.\nSannyas is the beginning of a new day, it is sunrise; hence the color orange. It is the color of the morning when the east starts turning orange, ready for the sun, ready to welcome it. It is like spreading a red carpet for the sun.\nPrepare the way for god to come in, be ready to receive the sun, the light. and the only thing that is needed is to become more and more aware, less and less in the mind and more and more outside the mind, watching it, not getting involved, just\nbecome a detached observer. That's exactly the meaning of the word 'ecstasy' -- to stand out.\nLearn to stand out of the mind and you have learned all that there is to learn. All the religions, in different ways, in different languages, teach only one secret: how to stand out of your own mind. And the day you succeed is the greatest day in your life. That day you are reborn. That day you are no more part of the physical world, you become part of god.\n(To Julia): -- This is your new name: Ma Nartana. Nartana means the dance. Dance is a very symbolic activity, the most significant to be understood by a spiritual seeker, because in dance the actor and the action become one: the dancer disappears into the dance, he becomes the dance. And that is the whole secret of meditation, the meditator has to become meditation, the singer has to become the song. Dance represents that merger, that melting, more prominently than any other activity.\nKrishnamurti says: In the ultimate moment of meditation the observer becomes the observed. he is right.\nThat's actually the definition of meditation.\nDance more and more, and remember to be lost in it, don't hold back. Go wholeheartedly into it so that only dance remains and there is no dancer. Whenever that happens you have come to know the very secret of all meditations. Then you can use the same key in any other activity: cooking food or taking a shower or going for a walk. You can use the same key to unlock all the doors. It is a master key.\nTo Grant: This is your new name: Swami Daso. Daso means the surrendered one. That's what sannyas is: a deep, total surrender, a surrender of all that is false, a surrender of all that is untrue, a surrender of the ego, a surrender of unconsciousness, a surrender of the mind, a surrender of misery, a surrender of past and a surrender of future -- all that is basically untrue, which is not really there. You only imagine that it is there, you believe it, and by believing it you make it real. Belief is a way to make unreal things real.\nGive all your beliefs to me so that knowing can be yours. Give your ego to me so that you can attain to your self. Give your mind tome so that the no-mind\nbecomes available to you.\n-- How long will you be here? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n-- Three days.\n-- That's great! In three days you can do three things: They are known as the three great shelters in Buddhism: Buddham, sharanam, gachchammi.\nFirst day: I go to the feet of Buddha. And the second day: Sangam sharanam gachchami -- I go to the feet of the Buddha's commune. And the third day, the last shelter: dhammam sharanam gachchami -- I go to the feet of the eternal law, the dhamma, tao. So three days will do! (much laughter) Have you lost three teeth?\nThat is symbolic. Do these three things! Good!

towards harmony. One can either begin by being cheerful, and harmony is
attained, or one can begin from the other end by being harmonious</p><p>, and cheerfulness is attained, But both always happen together. you
cannot have one. The harmonious person is bound to be cheerful,
overflowing with joy and the joyous person cannot be but harmonious.</p><p>My effort here is to give you methods of both kinds. It sirs a few to
start by being cheerful; those who are alert enough to snap out of their
settled misery -- which is just a mind-phenomenon, which is just like a
dream, a nightmare. Those who are capable of snapping our of it can
start be being cheerful, by singing, by dancing, and they will become
harmonious. If it is not possible ... For a few people the nightmare
seems so real that they go round and round but they cannot come out to
it. It seems impossible for them to come it.</p><p>Whatsoever they do feeds the nightmare. Then they have to start by
being harmonious. Then dancing and singing are not,, and cannot be their
beginning. Then they have to so something like zazen, vipassana...</p><p>Some silent meditation which creates harmony first. Once it is there
they can dance and they can sing.</p><p>For you it will be good to start being cheerful. You can manage
it!</p><p>(To Ingo) -- This is your name: Swami Ingo. Ingo comes from eng. Ing
is a mythological god of peace and prosperity.</p><p>Be peaceful and you are prosperous... but not in the ordinary sense
of the word 'prosperity'. Not that you will become wealthy, not that you
will have many possessions by being peaceful, but one thing is certain:
by being peaceful, whatsoever you have will be more than enough, you
will be contented with it. That is prosperity.</p><p>There was one Indian mystic who used to call himself 'Emperor'; his
name was Rama but he always called himself Emperor Rama. The first book
that he wrote, he entitled SIX ORDERS OF EMPEROR</p><p>RAMA. When he went to America people used to ask him 'Why do you call
yourself Emperor? We don't see anything in you, in fact you seem to be
just a beggar.' A begging bowl was his only possession. He would laugh
and we would say 'That's why I call myself an emperor because I desire
nothing and I possess the whole of existence!'</p><p>When you don't desire, a tremendous prosperity happens; that of
non-desire. Peace brings prosperity, prosperity of the inner, prosperity
not on the material plane but on the spiritual plane.</p><p>Learn how to be peaceful. That is the most secret art to be learned.
The only thing worth learning in life is peace. Meditate, sing, dance,
and learn to be more peaceful. As you become peaceful you will be
surprised that immense prosperity starts surrounding you.</p><p>You may be a beggar on the surface but deep down you become the
emperor and that is real richness because it cannot be taken away from
you. Not even death can take it away from you.</p><p>(To Nanni) This is your new name: Ma Vijayo. Vijayo means
victory.</p><p>There are two kinds of victory. One is violent, aggressive -- you
have to attack, you have to be destructive. But that victory remains
superficial. The other can be killed, destroyed, reduced to a slave, but
deep down he still remains unconquered. You can conquer the body of a
person but you cannot conquer his soul.</p><p>There is a totally different kind of victory that comes through love,
not through violence. That is true victory. It conquers the soul. But
the problem with true victory is that you have to surrender to conquer.
It is very paradoxical. You have to be ready to be defeated, joyously,
willingly. And that's what sannyas is.</p><p>(To June) This is your new name: Ma Sadhyo. Sadhyo means the end, the
goal. The goal is not outside</p><p>-- you are the goal. The target is not somewhere else -- you are the
target. You are both the means and you are the end.</p><p>Unless one discovers oneself one remains just a means. The moment one
has discovered oneself one has found the end. The circumference of your
being is the means: the body, the mind, the heart. Use all of them

In finding it one finds everything that is needed to be found. In
knowing it all is known. In</p><p>reaching it one reaches god.</p><p>(To Elmy): -- This is your new name: Yogo means the meeting -- the
meeting of the dewdrop with the ocean, the meeting of the individual
with the universal, the meeting of the part with the whole... and that's
what we are seeking and searching for.</p><p>Sannyas is nothing but a bridge, a rainbow bridge, a bridge between
the part and the whole, a bridge between you and god. But one thing has
to be fulfilled: you have to slowly slowly disappear. In the same
proportion as you disappear, god starts appearing. As the ultimate
meeting point you are not found at all, only god is found.</p><p>Sannyas is a death and a resurrection: death of the small ego and
rebirth of the ultimate, death of the momentary and birth of the
eternal.</p><p>(To Henk): -- This is your new name: Swami Pravasi. Pravasi means
stranger.</p><p>We are all strangers here. This is not our home, our home is
somewhere else. We are in a foreign land.</p><p>To remain outside oneself is to remain homeless; to come in is to be
back home.</p><p>Now ever effort has to be made to come in. No stone is to be left
unturned, everything has to be risked, because nothing is more precious
than this turning in. everything can be lost for it, sacrificed for it,
because all else is trivia.</p><p>Remember that sannyas simply means the beginning of a long inward
journey. But to take the first step is almost half the journey.</p><p>(To Peter): This is your new name: Swami Surodaya. Surodaya means the
sunrise.</p><p>Sannyas is the beginning of a new day, it is sunrise; hence the color
orange. It is the color of the morning when the east starts turning
orange, ready for the sun, ready to welcome it. It is like spreading a
red carpet for the sun.</p><p>Prepare the way for god to come in, be ready to receive the sun, the
light. and the only thing that is needed is to become more and more
aware, less and less in the mind and more and more outside the mind,
watching it, not getting involved, just</p><p>become a detached observer. That's exactly the meaning of the word
'ecstasy' -- to stand out.</p><p>Learn to stand out of the mind and you have learned all that there is
to learn. All the religions, in different ways, in different languages,
teach only one secret: how to stand out of your own mind. And the day
you succeed is the greatest day in your life. That day you are reborn.
That day you are no more part of the physical world, you become part of
god.</p><p>(To Julia): -- This is your new name: Ma Nartana. Nartana means the
dance. Dance is a very symbolic activity, the most significant to be
understood by a spiritual seeker, because in dance the actor and the
action become one: the dancer disappears into the dance, he becomes the
dance. And that is the whole secret of meditation, the meditator has to
become meditation, the singer has to become the song. Dance represents
that merger, that melting, more prominently than any other activity.</p><p>Krishnamurti says: In the ultimate moment of meditation the observer
becomes the observed. he is right.</p><p>That's actually the definition of meditation.</p><p>Dance more and more, and remember to be lost in it, don't hold back.
Go wholeheartedly into it so that only dance remains and there is no
dancer. Whenever that happens you have come to know the very secret of
all meditations. Then you can use the same key in any other activity:
cooking food or taking a shower or going for a walk. You can use the
same key to unlock all the doors. It is a master key.</p><p>To Grant: This is your new name: Swami Daso. Daso means the
surrendered one. That's what sannyas is: a deep, total surrender, a
surrender of all that is false, a surrender of all that is untrue, a
surrender of the ego, a surrender of unconsciousness, a surrender of the
mind, a surrender of misery, a surrender of past and a surrender of
future -- all that is basically untrue, which is not really there. You
only imagine that it is there, you believe it, and by believing it you
make it real. Belief is a way to make unreal things real.</p><p>Give all your beliefs to me so that knowing can be yours. Give your
ego to me so that you can attain to your self. Give your mind tome so
that the no-mind</p><p>becomes available to you.</p><p>-- How long will you be here? 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

known as the three great shelters in Buddhism: Buddham, sharanam,
gachchammi.</p><p>First day: I go to the feet of Buddha. And the second day: Sangam
sharanam gachchami -- I go to the feet of the Buddha's commune. And the
third day, the last shelter: dhammam sharanam gachchami -- I go to the

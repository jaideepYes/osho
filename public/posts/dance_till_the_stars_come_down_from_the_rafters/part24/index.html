It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Satyam Johannes. Satyam means the truth. Johannes means god's gift.\nTruth is never an achievement, it is always a gift from the beyond. We cannot come to truth trough our own efforts, because whatsoever we do we will be doing out of all kinds limitations, imperfections, unconsciousness, we will be doing it out of our minds. And mind has no capacity to know the unknown.\nMind can only mechanically repeat that which is already known. It is a mechanism. No machine can ever know truth.\nThe body is a machine and the mind is a machine, but something in you is\nbeyond both body and mind.\nThat is the capacity to be aware, when there is only awareness and nothing else, when you are not tethered to the bodymind complex at all, truth descends upon you. It comes like a bird descending on a tree.\nThat is the meaning of the beautiful story of when Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the river Jordan a white dove descended on Jesus from the above. That is not literally true, it is a metaphor. That white dove represents truth.\nRemember that we have to be more receptive, more open, more sensitive. That's all that is needed on your part. When you are ripe, ready, truth always comes, inevitably, without fail. It always comes from the beyond, and the name of the beyond is god.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Alastair. Dhyan means meditation. Alastair is a form of Alexander. It means helper of mankind.\nThe only help for you and for others too, comes from meditation, because it is meditation that gives you roots in the earth and wings in the sky. It is meditation that creates that space in which your potential can become actual. It is meditation that functions like a soil for the seed to sprout. And you can be a blessing to others only if you have first been a blessing to yourself. You can help others only if you have helped yourself. If you are not rooted, centered, mature enough, even if you want to do good to others you are bound to do harm.\nThat's what all do-gooders do: they are all mischievous people. More mischief has been perpetuated by the so-called servants of humanity than by anybody else. And the reason is not that their intention is bad -- I never doubt their intention, their intention is sincere -- but they are not in that kind of space themselves.\nWhat they want to bring to others they themselves don't have. They want to share love but love is not there in their hearts. They want to be compassionate but compassion comes only after meditation, it is a shadow of meditation. They want to serve people, but service is possible only when the ego has disappeared.\nOtherwise in the name of service you will be simply going on an ego trip, a very subtle ego trip.\nHence my effort here is not to make you servants of humanity, helpers of humanity... Not that I am against serving people and helping people, but because first you need to be helped. And once you are settled in your being and the chaos has disappeared, once you have become really grown up, you will serve. There is no need to say anything about it, it has not even to be mentioned. It is a by- product.\nIf you grow trees and they bloom they are bound to release fragrance. You need not go and tell the flowers 'Please, now release your fragrance'. And if they are plastic flowers you can go on telling them but they can't do it.\nMeditation has to become the center of your life, and then on the circumference, ten thousand things become possible. Ten thousand things is a Chinese metaphor; it means millions of things become possible.\nIn fact everything becomes possible. Even the impossible is no more impossible. Meditation is the greatest miracle there is. Devote all your energies to meditation.\nThis is your name: Ma Antar Laura. Antar means inner. Laura means victory.\nThe real victory is always inner. It is victory over yourself. The unreal victory is over others and it is ugly. To conquer somebody else is to destroy, is to reduce him to a thing, because by conquering you become the possessor and he becomes the possessed. The very effort to conquer somebody else is basically 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ninhuman. But there is a desire to be victorious. It needs the right direction.\nDesire in itself is not wrong, but if it moves outwards it will bring misery to others and misery to you too, because whenever you are trying to conquer others they are bound to react; sooner or later they will take revenge, and with a vengeance. It brings violence to life, it brings conflict. And to live in violence and conflict is to live in misery.\nThe desire to be victorious has to be directed inwards. And there there are real enemies to be conquered: anger, greed, jealousy, and so on, so forth. These are the real enemies. They can all be reduced to a single enemy, that is unconsciousness. They all grow out of it.\nThe unconscious has to be conquered, the unconscious has to be made conscious. That is victory, true victory. And when you are full of consciousness, when not even a small pocket of unconsciousness remains in you, when not even in nooks and corners is any darkness left behind, then life is known for the first time with all its beauty, with all its splendor. And to know that is to know god.\nGod is nothing but life in its true colors, life in its true music, life in its true celebration.\nThis is your name: Ma Anne Marie. Anne means prayer. Marie means fragrance.\nPrayer is a flower, the ultimate flowering of consciousness. There is nothing higher than that, it is love at its crescendo. And naturally great fragrance is released.\nA man of prayer is a man of great love. He is in total love with existence. His whole life is a love affair.\nEach moment is a joy because each moment brings new surprises, each moment brings great gifts. No moment is ever empty.\nIt is because of our blindness that we cannot see the beauty. It is because of our deafness that we cannot hear the music, otherwise the music is all around, the beauty is surrounding you. But you have to rise to a higher level to experience it.\nThese are the three planes that human energy can give rise to take. The first is sex, the second is love, the third is prayer. It is the same energy moving higher, becoming less and less gross, becoming more and more subtle.\nSex is energy moving downwards. It functions under the law of gravitation. The earth pulls it down. It is earthy, it is physiological, biological, chemical. Science can study it. It is available to scientific methodology. It is material.\nLove is higher. It is exactly in the middle of sex and prayer. a little bit of it is available, just a little bit penetrates times. A part of it is available to all human\nbeings, but the other part is available only to those who start moving into the inner search, only to the religious people.\nThe first part that is available to ordinary human beings is unconscious. The second part is conscious.\nWhen love becomes conscious then you experience for the first time something that is beyond gravitation, that does not go downwards but goes upwards.\nAnd the third is prayer.\nSex goes downwards, love goes upwards, prayer goes nowhere. It is a state of being. Sex is movement, so is love; they move is polar opposite directions. But prayer is a still point, there is no movement, no journey, no pilgrimage. You simply are.\nIn that profound silence and stillness when you simply are, you become aware of god. The whole existence becomes full of godliness. And it is not only that you experience godliness. People who will come close to you, people who are open to you, will also feel something strange, mysterious, miraculous. They will have a whiff of the unknown. In some moments they may become aware of a certain aura around you.\nThat is the fragrance of prayer.\nWe have depicted it as a white aura around Buddhas, Krishnas, Christs, just to give an indication that something mysterious surrounds these people. Of course not everybody becomes aware if it. The people who crucified Jesus were not aware of it, otherwise they would not have been able to kill him. They were blind, utterly blind.\nOne needs a certain sensitivity. The higher the phenomenon, the more sensitivity is needed. And prayer is the highest phenomenon, nothing is higher than that. Everything is lover than that.\nSo a few people who are open, available, who can look upwards towards the sky full of stars, who can see the beauty of the sunset, who can see the beauty of a sunrise, these are the people who will be able to feel. It is a feeling. You cannot grasp it, you cannot cling to it. It is not matter, not measurable, it is not visible. But it is a feeling. The heart starts dancing. That is the fragrance.\nAnne Marie is a beautiful name... But you have to change it, you have to give it to Laura. Right?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your new name: Swami Anutoshen. Anutoshen means contentment.\nMind lives in discontentment. That is its food. To be discontented is its nourishment. If you become contented mind dies out of starvation... and the mind has to die, only then you can know who you are. So learn the ways of being contented.\nWhatsoever is, feel grateful for it. Don't ask for more and you will be cutting the very roots of the mind.\nMind lives in the more. If you have money it says, \"Have more.\" If you have knowledge it says, \"Have more.\" Whatsoever you have -- it doesn't matter what it is -- mind says \"More\", and it goes on saying\n\"More, more...\" When you have attained that, again it is there asking for more. That more is unquenchable.\nSeeing the absurdity of it, one drops it. One no more runs after the horizon because one knows there is no horizon. It only appears. It looks so close by, just ten, fifteen miles away. If you run you can reach within two hours, but by the time you reach there, it is not there; it is again fifteen miles ahead. It is always fifteen miles ahead. There is no way to bridge the gap.\nThe more is the horizon and mind is always asking for it; hence mind lives in misery. Mind is hell. And the best way to cut its roots is: to drop asking for more. Rather start enjoying that which is available. Rather than being miserable because you don't have more, be blissful for whatsoever you have and enjoy it, relish it, rejoice in it. And you will be surprised that immediately you are the richest person in the world, immediately you are no more a beggar.\nAnd once the more disappears, the mind disappears. Mind is equivalent to more and more and more. Let the mind die so that you can be reborn.\nThis is your new name: Swami Anugiten. Anugiten means a little song, a small song -- and that's all that is required to a sannyasin: a little singing, a little dance, a little of the art and knack of rejoicing in life.\nLife consists of small things, but if one knows the art of transforming them then small things start becoming extraordinary.\nSannyas is a magic touch. It transforms dust into gold, dust into divine. And the art is simple, it is not complicated. The fundamental is to cut yourself from the past. It hangs around your neck like a heavy weight. There are many rocks and you are carrying them, it is such a burden. Drop them and immediately you feel a great relief. You would like to sing and dance for the sheer joy of being relieved of all that burden.\nThe second part of the secret is, don't imagine the future, don't project in the future, because that also creates a burden. Once you expect something you arr creating difficulties for yourself. It is never going to happen the way you expect it for the simple reason that you are a small part of such a vast universe and the universe cannot follow your whims. It goes its own way, unconcerned about what you expect, that you want. It is absolutely neutral about your wants and desired. It cares for you but it does not care for your desires, no, not at all, because if it starts caring about everybody's desires the whole universe will be in a chaos. It will never be at rest again. There will be no cosmos. All harmony will disappear.\nSo it cares for you, but is does not care for all kinds of insane desires and expectations and plans. So whenever you desire you are creating a situation in which you will feel frustrated. Expect, and you are bound to feel frustrated. Cut yourself off from the past and the future and live in the present, and your life becomes a song and a dance. Then just eating, drinking, taking a bath, going for a morning walk... and all is suddenly golden, and so many flowers shower on you for no reason at all. You can't contain it -- so much bliss arrives. You become overflooded, you have to share it.\nThat's what a song is -- sharing your bliss, expressing your bliss, inviting others to partake of your bliss.\nThis is your new name: Swami Anutosho. Anutosho means absolutely satisfied, utterly satisfied, no desire for anything else, a state of non-desire.\nDesire means that you are not satisfied with the way things are. You would like things according to you.… Satisfaction means that you are surrendered to existence so whatsoever it gives, you are grateful. If it gives nothing you are grateful that it gives nothing.\nA Sufi mystic used to thank god every day. After his prayers he would almost shout with joy 'God, how much you give me, how much you take care of me, how much you love me! How can I ever repay?' And he would cry tears of joy.\nHis disciples were a little worried because they could not see why he was thanking god so much. But they could not say anything, in the East the master has to be respected, obeyed. But deep down in their 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nminds the question was always there, and a situation arose in which they felt that now it was absolutely right to ask. They were travelling, going to Kaaba for the holy pilgrimage, and for three days they could not get any food, and no village was ready to give them shelter because the master was a known revolutionary and the people ware very orthodox.\nSo for three nights they has to sleep in the desert, and the desert was very cold. Without food, without water, they were utterly tired. And the third day again, after his prayer the mystic started crying with joy and said 'God, how much you do for me! How can I ever repay it? How much care you take? How can you remember me? You have to take care of such a vast universe -- still you remember me.'\nThe disciples gathered together and they said 'Enough is enough. Now what are you thanking him for?\nFor three days we have no food, no water, no shelter. We are dying from the cold nights... and you are thinking god and crying tears of joy. For what?'\nThe master said 'It is good that you have asked. I always know that you carried this question within you but you were not courageous enough to ask. Now I can answer it. I am thanking him for keeping me for three days without food, without water, without shelter, because this is what I needed. He always gives that which is needed. It is not a question of my expectations being fulfilled, it is his will that has to be fulfilled and whatsoever he wills is right. We may understand it, we may not. But this was my need and he has fulfilled it and I am grateful.'\nThis is what I mean by true contentment. And if one can be in such a space, nothing else is needed.\nMeditation arrives on its own, because mind dies. You need not do anything to destroy it, it disappears of its own accord.\nMind is like darkness and contentment is like light. Bring contentment in and the darkness disappears.\nAnd then you can see. For the first time you can see and for the first time you can hear and for the first time you can feel. Because mind is hindering everything, it does not allow you to see, it does not allow you to hear. It is standing between you and existence. Once it is not there you are available to god and god is available to you. That is liberation, nirvana, enlightenment.\nThis is your name: Swami Anugito. It means a song.\nMy approach towards life is of total affirmation. I don't teach renunciation, I teach rejoicing. I want you to love life with you total heart. When you are in life with a total heart thousands of songs will arise out of you. Each moment brings a song. Slowly slowly your whole life becomes just an instrument of music. And once you have known that great music is possible through you, you have come to recognize your potential.\nThen there is no end to it. You can go on playing new songs, new music. You can go on creating.\nThat creativity is sannyas. Creating music out of your heart is sannyas. Becoming a song is sannyas.\nThis is your new name: Ma Vipassana. Vipassana is one of the most significant methods of meditation.\nBuddha became enlightened through it and many more people have become enlightened through it than through any other method. It is tremendously beautiful and yet very simple. Even a child can do it.\nThe method consists of watching your breath. Whenever you have time, when you have nothing to do, just sit silently, seeing the breath coming in. Follow it. It goes to the very depth. Then there is a pause, for a moment there is no movement, the breath stops there. Watch that pause. That is very important because that is the door into your being. Then the breath starts coming out. Watch it again. It goes out completely, then again there is a pause, for a moment breathing stops. That too is a door.\nOne is the door into the inner reality, the other is the door into the outer reality. If you enter from the inner door you enter from the self into god. If you enter from the outer door you enter through god into the self. They are two aspects of the same coin.\nBut remember, the breathing is not to be changed, it has to be natural as it is always. You are not to make any effort to make it longer, deeper. There should be no change at all, leave it as it is. The only thing that has to be introduced is a witness, a watcher.\nSo you name is going to be your method of liberation. First do it sitting and then slowly slowly you will manage to do it walking, then finally you will manage to do it while doing other kinds of things: cooking, taking your bath, cleaning the floor. Only one thing has to be remembered: never to it in the night -- only between sunrise and sunset.\nIf you do it in the night you will not be able to sleep, because it creats such wakefulness. So only between sunrise and sunset... And if you feel that your sleep is being disturbed, then reduce the time. Then do it not even between sunset and sunrise, but for two hours after sunrise or for two hours before sunset, just 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbetween that time. You have to find out... because it differs from person to person.\nThere are a few people who can enjoy it even in the night, but it is very rare.\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Dhyano. Prem means love. Dhyano means meditation.\nLove is a path unto itself, and so is meditation. One can follow either love or meditation; both lead to the same goal. But there are a few people who can follow both, and of course their journey is far richer. And that is going to be the work for you: love as deeply as possible and meditate as deeply as possible and go on moving between the two. Remain fluid, flexible.\nThe lover finds it difficult to meditate because he needs the other and meditation means to be alone. The meditator finds it difficult to love because he becomes accustomed to being alone and the freedom of being alone. The very presence of the other seems to be a transgression, an interference, a disturbance.\nSo ordinarily it is simple to follow one, but if you can manage both then your life will have more richness. The meditator knows only the beauty of aloneness. He knows nothing of the beauty of togetherness. The lover knows the beauty of togetherness but is unaware of the beauty of being alone. And there is no necessity that one should miss the beauty of the other, just one has to be a little more intelligent to follow both, because things become complicated. You are handling a more complicated process.\nSo when you are with somebody -- with a friend, with a beloved, with the trees, with the clouds, with the moon -- dissolve yourself totally into it; forget yourself, as if you are not, be drunk. And when you close your eyes, forget the clouds, the woman, the friend, the stars, as if the world has disappeared. You are alone and there exists nothing else; all else is illusory. Go on moving between these two with a natural ease, and you will be surprised that then they enhance each other.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>This is your name: Swami Satyam Johannes. Satyam means the truth.
Johannes means god's gift.</p><p>Truth is never an achievement, it is always a gift from the beyond.
We cannot come to truth trough our own efforts, because whatsoever we do
we will be doing out of all kinds limitations, imperfections,
unconsciousness, we will be doing it out of our minds. And mind has no
capacity to know the unknown.</p><p>Mind can only mechanically repeat that which is already known. It is
a mechanism. No machine can ever know truth.</p><p>The body is a machine and the mind is a machine, but something in you
is</p><p>beyond both body and mind.</p><p>That is the capacity to be aware, when there is only awareness and
nothing else, when you are not tethered to the bodymind complex at all,
truth descends upon you. It comes like a bird descending on a tree.</p><p>That is the meaning of the beautiful story of when Jesus was baptized
by John the Baptist in the river Jordan a white dove descended on Jesus
from the above. That is not literally true, it is a metaphor. That white
dove represents truth.</p><p>Remember that we have to be more receptive, more open, more
sensitive. That's all that is needed on your part. When you are ripe,
ready, truth always comes, inevitably, without fail. It always comes
from the beyond, and the name of the beyond is god.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Alastair. Dhyan means meditation.
Alastair is a form of Alexander. It means helper of mankind.</p><p>The only help for you and for others too, comes from meditation,
because it is meditation that gives you roots in the earth and wings in
the sky. It is meditation that creates that space in which your
potential can become actual. It is meditation that functions like a soil
for the seed to sprout. And you can be a blessing to others only if you
have first been a blessing to yourself. You can help others only if you
have helped yourself. If you are not rooted, centered, mature enough,
even if you want to do good to others you are bound to do harm.</p><p>That's what all do-gooders do: they are all mischievous people. More
mischief has been perpetuated by the so-called servants of humanity than
by anybody else. And the reason is not that their intention is bad -- I
never doubt their intention, their intention is sincere -- but they are
not in that kind of space themselves.</p><p>What they want to bring to others they themselves don't have. They
want to share love but love is not there in their hearts. They want to
be compassionate but compassion comes only after meditation, it is a
shadow of meditation. They want to serve people, but service is possible
only when the ego has disappeared.</p><p>Otherwise in the name of service you will be simply going on an ego
trip, a very subtle ego trip.</p><p>Hence my effort here is not to make you servants of humanity, helpers
of humanity... Not that I am against serving people and helping people,
but because first you need to be helped. And once you are settled in
your being and the chaos has disappeared, once you have become really
grown up, you will serve. There is no need to say anything about it, it
has not even to be mentioned. It is a by- product.</p><p>If you grow trees and they bloom they are bound to release fragrance.
You need not go and tell the flowers 'Please, now release your
fragrance'. And if they are plastic flowers you can go on telling them
but they can't do it.</p><p>Meditation has to become the center of your life, and then on the
circumference, ten thousand things become possible. Ten thousand things
is a Chinese metaphor; it means millions of things become possible.</p><p>In fact everything becomes possible. Even the impossible is no more
impossible. Meditation is the greatest miracle there is. Devote all your
energies to meditation.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Antar Laura. Antar means inner. Laura means
victory.</p><p>The real victory is always inner. It is victory over yourself. The
unreal victory is over others and it is ugly. To conquer somebody else
is to destroy, is to reduce him to a thing, because by conquering you
become the possessor and he becomes the possessed. The very effort to
conquer somebody else is basically 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>inhuman. But there is a desire to be victorious. It needs the right
direction.</p><p>Desire in itself is not wrong, but if it moves outwards it will bring
misery to others and misery to you too, because whenever you are trying
to conquer others they are bound to react; sooner or later they will
take revenge, and with a vengeance. It brings violence to life, it
brings conflict. And to live in violence and conflict is to live in
misery.</p><p>The desire to be victorious has to be directed inwards. And there
there are real enemies to be conquered: anger, greed, jealousy, and so
on, so forth. These are the real enemies. They can all be reduced to a
single enemy, that is unconsciousness. They all grow out of it.</p><p>The unconscious has to be conquered, the unconscious has to be made
conscious. That is victory, true victory. And when you are full of
consciousness, when not even a small pocket of unconsciousness remains
in you, when not even in nooks and corners is any darkness left behind,
then life is known for the first time with all its beauty, with all its
splendor. And to know that is to know god.</p><p>God is nothing but life in its true colors, life in its true music,
life in its true celebration.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anne Marie. Anne means prayer. Marie means
fragrance.</p><p>Prayer is a flower, the ultimate flowering of consciousness. There is
nothing higher than that, it is love at its crescendo. And naturally
great fragrance is released.</p><p>A man of prayer is a man of great love. He is in total love with
existence. His whole life is a love affair.</p><p>Each moment is a joy because each moment brings new surprises, each
moment brings great gifts. No moment is ever empty.</p><p>It is because of our blindness that we cannot see the beauty. It is
because of our deafness that we cannot hear the music, otherwise the
music is all around, the beauty is surrounding you. But you have to rise
to a higher level to experience it.</p><p>These are the three planes that human energy can give rise to take.
The first is sex, the second is love, the third is prayer. It is the
same energy moving higher, becoming less and less gross, becoming more
and more subtle.</p><p>Sex is energy moving downwards. It functions under the law of
gravitation. The earth pulls it down. It is earthy, it is physiological,
biological, chemical. Science can study it. It is available to
scientific methodology. It is material.</p><p>Love is higher. It is exactly in the middle of sex and prayer. a
little bit of it is available, just a little bit penetrates times. A
part of it is available to all human</p><p>beings, but the other part is available only to those who start
moving into the inner search, only to the religious people.</p><p>The first part that is available to ordinary human beings is
unconscious. The second part is conscious.</p><p>When love becomes conscious then you experience for the first time
something that is beyond gravitation, that does not go downwards but
goes upwards.</p><p>And the third is prayer.</p><p>Sex goes downwards, love goes upwards, prayer goes nowhere. It is a
state of being. Sex is movement, so is love; they move is polar opposite
directions. But prayer is a still point, there is no movement, no
journey, no pilgrimage. You simply are.</p><p>In that profound silence and stillness when you simply are, you
become aware of god. The whole existence becomes full of godliness. And
it is not only that <em>you</em> experience godliness. People who will
come close to you, people who are open to you, will also feel something
strange, mysterious, miraculous. They will have a whiff of the unknown.
In some moments they may become aware of a certain aura around you.</p><p>That is the fragrance of prayer.</p><p>We have depicted it as a white aura around Buddhas, Krishnas,
Christs, just to give an indication that something mysterious surrounds
these people. Of course not everybody becomes aware if it. The people
who crucified Jesus were not aware of it, otherwise they would not have
been able to kill him. They were blind, utterly blind.</p><p>One needs a certain sensitivity. The higher the phenomenon, the more
sensitivity is needed. And prayer is the highest phenomenon, nothing is
higher than that. Everything is lover than that.</p><p>So a few people who are open, available, who can look upwards towards
the sky full of stars, who can see the beauty of the sunset, who can see
the beauty of a sunrise, these are the people who will be able to feel.
It is a feeling. You cannot grasp it, you cannot cling to it. It is not
matter, not measurable, it is not visible. But it is a feeling. The
heart starts dancing. That is the fragrance.</p><p>Anne Marie is a beautiful name... But you have to change it, you have
to give it to Laura. Right?</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anutoshen. Anutoshen means
contentment.</p><p>Mind lives in discontentment. That is its food. To be discontented is
its nourishment. If you become contented mind dies out of starvation...
and the mind has to die, only then you can know who you are. So learn
the ways of being contented.</p><p>Whatsoever is, feel grateful for it. Don't ask for more and you will
be cutting the very roots of the mind.</p><p>Mind lives in the more. If you have money it says, "Have more." If
you have knowledge it says, "Have more." Whatsoever you have -- it
doesn't matter what it is -- mind says "More", and it goes on saying</p><p>"More, more..." When you have attained that, again it is there asking
for more. That more is unquenchable.</p><p>Seeing the absurdity of it, one drops it. One no more runs after the
horizon because one knows there is no horizon. It only appears. It looks
so close by, just ten, fifteen miles away. If you run you can reach
within two hours, but by the time you reach there, it is not there; it
is again fifteen miles ahead. It is always fifteen miles ahead. There is
no way to bridge the gap.</p><p>The more is the horizon and mind is always asking for it; hence mind
lives in misery. Mind is hell. And the best way to cut its roots is: to
drop asking for more. Rather start enjoying that which is available.
Rather than being miserable because you don't have more, be blissful for
whatsoever you have and enjoy it, relish it, rejoice in it. And you will
be surprised that immediately you are the richest person in the world,
immediately you are no more a beggar.</p><p>And once the more disappears, the mind disappears. Mind is equivalent
to more and more and more. Let the mind die so that you can be
reborn.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anugiten. Anugiten means a little song,
a small song -- and that's all that is required to a sannyasin: a little
singing, a little dance, a little of the art and knack of rejoicing in
life.</p><p>Life consists of small things, but if one knows the art of
transforming them then small things start becoming extraordinary.</p><p>Sannyas is a magic touch. It transforms dust into gold, dust into
divine. And the art is simple, it is not complicated. The fundamental is
to cut yourself from the past. It hangs around your neck like a heavy
weight. There are many rocks and you are carrying them, it is such a
burden. Drop them and immediately you feel a great relief. You would
like to sing and dance for the sheer joy of being relieved of all that
burden.</p><p>The second part of the secret is, don't imagine the future, don't
project in the future, because that also creates a burden. Once you
expect something you arr creating difficulties for yourself. It is never
going to happen the way you expect it for the simple reason that you are
a small part of such a vast universe and the universe cannot follow your
whims. It goes its own way, unconcerned about what you expect, that you
want. It is absolutely neutral about your wants and desired. It
<em>cares</em> for you but it does not care for your desires, no, not at
all, because if it starts caring about everybody's desires the whole
universe will be in a chaos. It will never be at rest again. There will
be no cosmos. All harmony will disappear.</p><p>So it cares for you, but is does not care for all kinds of insane
desires and expectations and plans. So whenever you desire you are
creating a situation in which you will feel frustrated. Expect, and you
are bound to feel frustrated. Cut yourself off from the past and the
future and live in the present, and your life becomes a song and a
dance. Then just eating, drinking, taking a bath, going for a morning
walk... and all is suddenly golden, and so many flowers shower on you
for no reason at all. You can't contain it -- so much bliss arrives. You
become overflooded, you have to share it.</p><p>That's what a song is -- sharing your bliss, expressing your bliss,
inviting others to partake of your bliss.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anutosho. Anutosho means absolutely
satisfied, utterly satisfied, no desire for anything else, a state of
non-desire.</p><p>Desire means that you are not satisfied with the way things are. You
would like things according to you.… Satisfaction means that you are
surrendered to existence so whatsoever it gives, you are grateful. If it
gives nothing you are grateful that it gives nothing.</p><p>A Sufi mystic used to thank god every day. After his prayers he would
almost shout with joy 'God, how much you give me, how much you take care
of me, how much you love me! How can I ever repay?' And he would cry
tears of joy.</p><p>His disciples were a little worried because they could not see why he
was thanking god so much. But they could not say anything, in the East
the master has to be respected, obeyed. But deep down in their
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>minds the question was always there, and a situation arose in which
they felt that now it was absolutely right to ask. They were travelling,
going to Kaaba for the holy pilgrimage, and for three days they could
not get any food, and no village was ready to give them shelter because
the master was a known revolutionary and the people ware very
orthodox.</p><p>So for three nights they has to sleep in the desert, and the desert
was very cold. Without food, without water, they were utterly tired. And
the third day again, after his prayer the mystic started crying with joy
and said 'God, how much you do for me! How can I ever repay it? How much
care you take? How can you remember me? You have to take care of such a
vast universe -- still you remember me.'</p><p>The disciples gathered together and they said 'Enough is enough. Now
what are you thanking him for?</p><p>For three days we have no food, no water, no shelter. We are dying
from the cold nights... and you are thinking god and crying tears of
joy. For what?'</p><p>The master said 'It is good that you have asked. I always know that
you carried this question within you but you were not courageous enough
to ask. Now I can answer it. I am thanking him for keeping me for three
days without food, without water, without shelter, because this is what
I needed. He always gives that which is needed. It is not a question of
my expectations being fulfilled, it is <em>his</em> will that has to be
fulfilled and whatsoever he wills is right. We may understand it, we may
not. But this was my need and he has fulfilled it and I am
grateful.'</p><p>This is what I mean by <em>true</em> contentment. And if one can be
in such a space, nothing else is needed.</p><p>Meditation arrives on its own, because mind dies. You need not do
anything to destroy it, it disappears of its own accord.</p><p>Mind is like darkness and contentment is like light. Bring
contentment in and the darkness disappears.</p><p>And then you can see. For the first time you can see and for the
first time you can hear and for the first time you can feel. Because
mind is hindering everything, it does not allow you to see, it does not
allow you to hear. It is standing between you and existence. Once it is
not there you are available to god and god is available to you. That is
liberation, nirvana, enlightenment.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anugito. It means a song.</p><p>My approach towards life is of total affirmation. I don't teach
renunciation, I teach rejoicing. I want you to love life with you total
heart. When you are in life with a total heart thousands of songs will
arise out of you. Each moment brings a song. Slowly slowly your whole
life becomes just an instrument of music. And once you have known that
great music is possible through you, you have come to recognize your
potential.</p><p>Then there is no end to it. You can go on playing new songs, new
music. You can go on creating.</p><p>That creativity is sannyas. Creating music out of your heart is
sannyas. Becoming a song is sannyas.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Vipassana. Vipassana is one of the most
significant methods of meditation.</p><p>Buddha became enlightened through it and many more people have become
enlightened through it than through any other method. It is tremendously
beautiful and yet very simple. Even a child can do it.</p><p>The method consists of watching your breath. Whenever you have time,
when you have nothing to do, just sit silently, seeing the breath coming
in. Follow it. It goes to the very depth. Then there is a pause, for a
moment there is no movement, the breath stops there. Watch that pause.
That is very important because that is the door into your being. Then
the breath starts coming out. Watch it again. It goes out completely,
then again there is a pause, for a moment breathing stops. That too is a
door.</p><p>One is the door into the inner reality, the other is the door into
the outer reality. If you enter from the inner door you enter from the
self into god. If you enter from the outer door you enter through god
into the self. They are two aspects of the same coin.</p><p>But remember, the breathing is not to be changed, it has to be
natural as it is always. You are not to make any effort to make it
longer, deeper. There should be no change at all, leave it as it is. The
only thing that has to be introduced is a witness, a watcher.</p><p>So you name is going to be your method of liberation. First do it
sitting and then slowly slowly you will manage to do it walking, then
finally you will manage to do it while doing other kinds of things:
cooking, taking your bath, cleaning the floor. Only one thing has to be
remembered: never to it in the night -- only between sunrise and
sunset.</p><p>If you do it in the night you will not be able to sleep, because it
creats such wakefulness. So only between sunrise and sunset... And if
you feel that your sleep is being disturbed, then reduce the time. Then
do it not even between sunset and sunrise, but for two hours after
sunrise or for two hours before sunset, just 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>between that time. You have to find out... because it differs from
person to person.</p><p>There are a few people who can enjoy it even in the night, but it is
very rare.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Prem Dhyano. Prem means love. Dhyano means
meditation.</p><p>Love is a path unto itself, and so is meditation. One can follow
either love or meditation; both lead to the same goal. But there are a
few people who can follow both, and of course their journey is far
richer. And that is going to be the work for you: love as deeply as
possible and meditate as deeply as possible and go on moving between the
two. Remain fluid, flexible.</p><p>The lover finds it difficult to meditate because he needs the other
and meditation means to be alone. The meditator finds it difficult to
love because he becomes accustomed to being alone and the freedom of
being alone. The very presence of the other seems to be a transgression,
an interference, a disturbance.</p><p>So ordinarily it is simple to follow one, but if you can manage both
then your life will have more richness. The meditator knows only the
beauty of aloneness. He knows nothing of the beauty of togetherness. The
lover knows the beauty of togetherness but is unaware of the beauty of
being alone. And there is no necessity that one should miss the beauty
of the other, just one has to be a little more intelligent to follow
both, because things become complicated. You are handling a more
complicated process.</p><p>So when you are with somebody -- with a friend, with a beloved, with
the trees, with the clouds, with the moon -- dissolve yourself totally
into it; forget yourself, as if you are not, be drunk. And when you
close your eyes, forget the clouds, the woman, the friend, the stars, as
if the world has disappeared. You are alone and there exists nothing
else; all else is illusory. Go on moving between these two with a
natural ease, and you will be surprised that then they enhance each
other. When you have been together with somebody and you go into
aloneness, your aloneness has more depth. When you have been alone and
you move with somebody, your love has more energy to share. It has more
intensity. It is more warm.</p><p>I am giving you a difficult task... but try! And if you fail, if you
find it very difficult, then you can always choose one. But my feeling
is that you will be able</p><p>to manage both together.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

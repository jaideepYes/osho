It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Deva Gerard. Deva means divine. Gerard means a loyal heart.\nA loyal heart is the beginning of the experience of god. The head can be logical but never loyal, the heart can be loyal but never logical. To be loyal is something illogical: it is love, not logic. And the heart knows only the ways of love.\nTo be loyal means to be committed, to be totally involved, to be so surrendered that there is no holding back, risking all for no gain, for no profit, for no future promise but for the sheer joy of risking. There is tremendous joy when one risks just for the sake of it.\nAnd that is from where you start moving into the world of the divine. That very moment you are transported: you are n the world, but the world is no more in you. God has penetrated your heart like an arrow.\nInaki is your name? What does it mean?\n-- I don't know?\nI will keep it -- it sounds good. It has some music to it, and that is far more important than meaning. All meanings are arbitrary. Music is more natural.\nSo this will be your name: Anand Inaki. Anand means bliss. That's the ultimate search. In what ever name we are seeking, we seek bliss. Nobody is really seeking god. Who cares about god? People are only seeking god because they have been told for centuries that I you find god you will be blissful. God is secondary, blissfulness is primary.\nAnd the same is true about truth. If truth brings misery, who would seek truth? A few masochists maybe, a few mad people, self-destructive, suicidal; but no healthy and wholesome person would seek truth. Truth is sought because it brings bliss.\nSo remember: god, truth, nirvana, enlightenment, are different names for bliss.\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Sef. Prem means love; sef means increasing faithfulness.\nLove is the beginning of faith and the end too. The beginning and the end are not separate. The difference is only of that between a seed and a flower. The seed contains the flower and the flower is nothing but the expression of the seed. So is love and faith: love is the seed, faith is its flowering.\nHence anybody who is trying to believe in god without love is deceiving himself and wasting his time.\nAnd how can you love god? -- you don't know him!\nSo my teaching is not to love god, my teaching is to love. Whom you love is not so relevant: people, animals, birds, trees, music, poetry, painting. What you love, the object of love, is not so important, but that you love is important.\nAnd as love increases, slowly slowly it brings a faith into you being, a faith in existence. That is true religion. The untrue religion remains belief-oriented. The true religion originates in love and ultimately blooms and flowers as faith.\nAnd remember: believe and faith are not synonymous, notwithstanding what the dictionaries say. Belief is pseudo faith, it is something basically false. Faith is a totally different phenomenon.\nStart with love and blossom into faith. That's what sannyas is all about: love and faith.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Maria. Anand means bliss. Maria means fragrance. Bliss is more like fragrance than like a flower. A flower is something visible, material; you can catch hold of it. Fragrance is invisible, immaterial; you cannot catch hold of it. Still you can experience it. All that you need is a sensitivity and you will experience it -- but it is an experience.\nA flower can be known even by those who have no sensitivity for fragrance, even by those whose noses are almost dead. A flower can at least be touched, even by a blind man. One can hold the flower in one's hand. It is measurable, it is matter. Nobody can deny it, it is proof unto itself.\nBut fragrance is very subtle. One can deny it and there is no way to prove it. If somebody says, 'No, there is no fragrance,' you cannot prove that there is. At the most you can say, 'I experience it.' But the other person could say you may be deluded. You may be hallucinating, you may be dreaming. You may be deceiving them or you may be deceived yourself. You may be hypnotized. A thousand and one things could be said, and you cannot prove it. Still whether you can prove it or not, you know it.\nThat is exactly the case with bliss, with god, with love, with all the higher values. The higher you move in the hierarchy of values, the more and more\ndifficult it becomes to prove them. God is the most difficult experience to prove because it is the ultimate value, the culmination of all values.\nBliss is another name for god. It can be experienced, it can be lived. One can dance with it. One can be overflooded with it. One can be transformed by it.\nYour name is beautiful: Ma Brigitte. It comes from the same root from where the word 'bridge' comes.\nMan is a bridge. Man is not the goal but only a ladder, a passage, a bridge, between the animal and the divine. One should not be satisfied by being just human; that is not enough. That is making your house on the bridge; it is not safe and the bridge is not meant for that purpose. The bridge has to be transcended, passed over; its function is to take you to the other shore.\nMan is not a being but a bridge. Animals have being and buddhas have being, but man is only a bridge.\nHe has no being, he is a becoming. He goes on becoming, changing, moving from one point to another. He is a journey, a pilgrimage.\nThis has to be remembered: unless one becomes enlightened, never to be satisfied before that. Remain in a divine discontent to the last moment when you explode into light, when you become light, when light becomes your being.\nThis is your name: Swami Deva Saul. Deva means god; saul means demanded, desired.\nGod is continuously demanding, 'Come to me!' Since Adam and Eve left the garden of Eden, he has been calling forth, 'Come back home!' And all these messengers and prophets and Buddhas, they are nothing but messengers. And the message is simple: that god is waiting, that you have wandered enough, gone astray enough. It is the right time to come back.\nSannyas is a coming back. It is turning inwards. And it is in your innermost core that the garden of Eden exists. It is at your inmost core that god is present, calling you forth.\nWe are moving on the outside, ignoring the inside. That is ignorance. Ignoring you inner world is ignorance, knowing your inner world is wisdom.\nYou have a beautiful name: Swami Gurumukh. It means the voice of the master, the mouthpiece of the master.\nThe word 'guru' is untranslatable, in a sense, because it has a certain metaphorical meaning. Guru literally means 'one who dispels darkness'. The master is just approximate, not exactly the same; but we can give it the same meaning. The master is one who helps you to become enlightened; that's the function of the master: he dispels your darkness.\nAnd to become a voice of the master means to be so totally surrendered that you do not speak your own mind but the no-mind of the master speaks through you. It means that you have dropped your will -- the master's will functions through you. A master has dropped his will already, so in fact the master is only a medium, and god starts functioning through you.\nSurrendering to the master is just an excuse for surrendering to god. Because we cannot surrender to the invisible, we need a master -- something visible. A master is just standing between the visible and the invisible; half of the master is visible and half of the master is invisible. So those who come to the master not in a deep surrendered attitude, they will see only the visible part; and those who surrender, they will see the invisible part. Then the master is no more there.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's why in the East, the disciple thinks of the master only in terms of god, in no other way.\nHow long you will be here?\nThis is your name: Swami Thanasis. Thanasis means the immortal one. That is our true reality. Mortality is only of the body, mortality is only of the outer shell. But our inner consciousness is immortal. To be identified with the body and to start thinking, 'I am the body' is the foolishness that creates the fear of death.\nThe moment you know that you are no more the body or the mind all fear of death disappears. And life starts only in the day that the fear of death disappears, because then you can live. Otherwise death is always hanging in front of you. How can you live? How can you enjoy? How can you rejoice? How can you sing and dance? Celebration is impossible: death is always around the corner; it can take you away at any moment. People are living, but in deep trembling, fear, anguish, anxiety.\nIt is only through meditation that a person becomes free of fear of death. He comes to know that he is immortal, there is no way to die. Death has never happened, cannot happen. Death is an impossibility.\nTo know it through your own experience is the beginning of a totally new kind of life: the life of eternity, not of time, the life that always abides, the life that is forever. And that's what god is.\nYour name is beautiful: Ma Konstanze. It means a devoted spirit.\nReligion needs devotion; not only intellectual conviction but a heartfelt devotion. Conviction is superficial and it can be changed very easily, just a few arguments can change your conviction. Hence the people who live in conviction are always afraid -- afreaid of facts, now discoveries, of people who are against their ideas. They are afraid because they know that their conviction can collapse at any moment; just a single argument can destroy the whole edifice. Hence they will not red others' scriptures, they will not listen to others. They will avoid them, they will not argue. They are constantly on guard... but really they are afraid and are cowards.\nA man who is of a devoted heart has no fear. He cannot be unconvinced, that is impossible, because he is not convinced in the first place. It is a devotion. No argument can destroy it, no logic can harm it. In fact no intellectuality ever reaches it; it is far beyond that.\nUnless one moves in religion with a devotion one remains superficially religious. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- these are all superfluous things. If you are really moving with devotion you don't become a Christian, you become a Christ; you don't become a Buddhist, you become a Buddha. Why should one become a Buddhist when on has the capacity to become a Buddha? The Christian is one who is convinced.\nThe Buddha is one who has known.\nAnd knowing happens in the heart, not in the head. Knowing is a quality of love, a by-product of love.\nThe more you love, the more you become capable of seeing things as they are.\nSo love deeply, love totally. Love this existence with deep devotion, with great prayer.\nJust today I was reading about a man, a very intellectual man. He has written a whole Hindu prayer on a board in his bedroom, and every night before going to sleep he would look at the sky and say to god, 'Please god, read it.' Why bother to repeat it every day? Just put it up -- god can read it!\nThere is no way from intellect to god, from scholarship to god. The only way is through devotion. And devotion needs courage because you have to drop your mind, your head. Devotion requires you to cut off your head completely.\nThat's the work of the master: to behead his disciples! And once the head is dropped great doors open to existence. All locks disappear. All secrets which were hidden before become absolutely clear. Nothing is hidden anymore.\nThis is your name: Swami Virato. Virato means the infinite, the vast. Man is not as small as he appears from the outside. He contains the whole sky within, he contains all the oceans. Yes, he looks like a dewdrop, but his appearance is very deceptive. And science is still working on his appearance, the dewdrop.\nThose who have penetrated deeper into human consciousness were surprised to find that as you go deeper, man becomes vast. When you reach his very core, he is the whole universe. And that is the experience of god.\nMeditate and go deeper inwards. It is already there -- we just have to uncover it.\nThis is your new name: Swami Anubhavo. Anubhavo means the state of total immersion in the whole.\nWhen the ego is lost, when you don't feel yourself separate, when suddenly there are no boundaries to you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nanymore, you are melting and merging with the universe -- that state is anubhava. And that state can come only through love and meditation.\nOne has to become more and more silent and one has to become more and more loving. Both are needed, and both together bring the ultimate transformation, the merger, the disappearance of the individual and the appearance of the universal. It is within your capacity to allow it or not to allow it. If we are ready to surrender, it happens; if we resist, it can't happen.\nSannyas means a readiness to surrender, a readiness to be in a state of let-go.\nThis is your new name: Swami Dharmesh. Dharmesh means the god of the ultimate law. It is difficult to translate the word 'dharma' Ordinarily it is translated as the ultimate law, the universal law, the eternal law, the cosmic law; but they are only approximations. In Chinese there is the right word for it 'tao'; and Christianity has the right word for it, 'logos'.\nDharma means that invisible thread that keeps the whole cosmos together. This togetherness can't be without any fundamental cause, otherwise things would start falling apart. We know that the earth does not fall apart because of gravitation, things do not fall away from the earth because of gravitation. But why doesn't the whole universe fall apart? -- there must be something like gravitation. That is dharma.\nAnd the only way to find it is to go within, because there it is the closest to us. You can find it in the trees and in the socks, but then it is far away. You will have to understand the language of the rock, the being of the rock, and it will be a very very impossible almost impossible job. The easiest is to understand your own being because that is the closest. Once you have seen it there you will be able to see it in the rock too and you will be able to see it in the trees and you will be able to see it in the stars. Once seen inside, the whole universe becomes absolutely clear and transparent to you.\nThat experience of interlinkedness, of interdependence, has such exquisite\nbeauty and creates such a great ecstasy that it is not possible to imagine it, not possible to express it, not possible even to give a few hints about it. So all the masters have been doing only one thing: they show you the path to attain it -- then you will know. There is no other way. You have to know it to know it.\nThis is your new name: Swami Garimo. Garimo means the splendor, the glory. Existence is full of splendor and glory, but we are blind, we are deaf. We can't hear the music and we can't see the beauty.\nHence we have to ask, 'Where is god? What is god?'\nIf we can see the beauty, if we can experience the joy, the dance of the stars and the trees and the wind and the rain, we will not ask such stupid questions: 'What is god and where is god?' and whether god exists or not. We will know that this beauty is god, that this splendor is god, that this dance, this celebration, is god.\nMy whole approach is to make you more sensitive towards the beauties of nature, life, existence, because that is the only valid way to become aware of god. There is no other way. There has never been and there will never be.\nThis is your new name: Ma Sarjan. Sarjan means creativity. Creativity is the real worship.\nIn the past religious people have been very uncreative. They were life-negative, hence they could not be creative. Creativity means that you are affirming life, that you are trying to enrich it, that you are trying to make it a little more beautiful than it is. And that's how one should server god: by making his world a little more beautiful, a little more musical, a little more poetic, a little more colorful.\nRemember it: whatsoever you are doing, do it with this vision, that it will help the world to become more rich. In some way or other contribute to the world's richness. And then whether you go to the church or not does not matter -- god is yours. Whether you remember god or not does not matter. Your creativity is enough proof of your remembrance.\nThis is your new name: Swami Visarjan. Visarjan means dissolving, dissolution, melting and dissolving into the whole.\nDon't keep yourself separate. Seeing a rose, become the rose.\nSeeing the sunset, be lost in it. Don't remain aloof, cold. Don't remain just a spectator, become a participant. Seeing the sky full of stars you also become part of it, a small star. But participate in the dance.\nTo me that's what religion is, dissolving oneself in the whole. Just like a river disappears in the ocean you disappear into god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3199","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3199 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

more natural.</p><p>So this will be your name: Anand Inaki. Anand means bliss. That's the
ultimate search. In what ever name we are seeking, we seek bliss. Nobody
is really seeking god. Who cares about god? People are only seeking god
because they have been told for centuries that I you find god you will
be blissful. God is secondary, blissfulness is primary.</p><p>And the same is true about truth. If truth brings misery, who would
seek truth? A few masochists maybe, a few mad people, self-destructive,
suicidal; but no healthy and wholesome person would seek truth. Truth is
sought because it brings bliss.</p><p>So remember: god, truth, nirvana, enlightenment, are different names
for bliss.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Prem Sef. Prem means love; sef means
increasing faithfulness.</p><p>Love is the beginning of faith and the end too. The beginning and the
end are not separate. The difference is only of that between a seed and
a flower. The seed contains the flower and the flower is nothing but the
expression of the seed. So is love and faith: love is the seed, faith is
its flowering.</p><p>Hence anybody who is trying to believe in god without love is
deceiving himself and wasting his time.</p><p>And how can you love god? -- you don't know him!</p><p>So my teaching is not to love god, my teaching is to love. Whom you
love is not so relevant: people, animals, birds, trees, music, poetry,
painting. What you love, the object of love, is not so important, but
that you love is important.</p><p>And as love increases, slowly slowly it brings a faith into you
being, a faith in existence. That is true religion. The untrue religion
remains belief-oriented. The true religion originates in love and
ultimately blooms and flowers as faith.</p><p>And remember: believe and faith are not synonymous, notwithstanding
what the dictionaries say. Belief is pseudo faith, it is something
basically false. Faith is a totally different phenomenon.</p><p>Start with love and blossom into faith. That's what sannyas is all
about: love and faith.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anand Maria. Anand means bliss. Maria means
fragrance. Bliss is more like fragrance than like a flower. A flower is
something visible, material; you can catch hold of it. Fragrance is
invisible, immaterial; you cannot catch hold of it. Still you can
experience it. All that you need is a sensitivity and you will
experience it -- but it is an experience.</p><p>A flower can be known even by those who have no sensitivity for
fragrance, even by those whose noses are almost dead. A flower can at
least be touched, even by a blind man. One can hold the flower in one's
hand. It is measurable, it is matter. Nobody can deny it, it is proof
unto itself.</p><p>But fragrance is very subtle. One can deny it and there is no way to
prove it. If somebody says, 'No, there is no fragrance,' you cannot
prove that there is. At the most you can say, 'I experience it.' But the
other person could say you may be deluded. You may be hallucinating, you
may be dreaming. You may be deceiving them or you may be deceived
yourself. You may be hypnotized. A thousand and one things could be
said, and you cannot prove it. Still whether you can prove it or not,
you know it.</p><p>That is exactly the case with bliss, with god, with love, with all
the higher values. The higher you move in the hierarchy of values, the
more and more</p><p>difficult it becomes to prove them. God is the most difficult
experience to prove because it is the ultimate value, the culmination of
all values.</p><p>Bliss is another name for god. It can be experienced, it can be
lived. One can dance with it. One can be overflooded with it. One can be
transformed by it.</p><p>Your name is beautiful: Ma Brigitte. It comes from the same root from
where the word 'bridge' comes.</p><p>Man is a bridge. Man is not the goal but only a ladder, a passage, a
bridge, between the animal and the divine. One should not be satisfied
by being just human; that is not enough. That is making your house on
the bridge; it is not safe and the bridge is not meant for that purpose.
The bridge has to be transcended, passed over; its function is to take
you to the other shore.</p><p>Man is not a being but a bridge. Animals have being and buddhas have
being, but man is only a bridge.</p><p>He has no being, he is a becoming. He goes on becoming, changing,
moving from one point to another. He is a journey, a pilgrimage.</p><p>This has to be remembered: unless one becomes enlightened, never to
be satisfied before that. Remain in a divine discontent to the last
moment when you explode into light, when you become light, when light
becomes your being.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Deva Saul. Deva means god; saul means
demanded, desired.</p><p>God is continuously demanding, 'Come to me!' Since Adam and Eve left
the garden of Eden, he has been calling forth, 'Come back home!' And all
these messengers and prophets and Buddhas, they are nothing but
messengers. And the message is simple: that god is waiting, that you
have wandered enough, gone astray enough. It is the right time to come
back.</p><p>Sannyas is a coming back. It is turning inwards. And it is in your
innermost core that the garden of Eden exists. It is at your inmost core
that god is present, calling you forth.</p><p>We are moving on the outside, ignoring the inside. That is ignorance.
Ignoring you inner world is ignorance, knowing your inner world is
wisdom.</p><p>You have a beautiful name: Swami Gurumukh. It means the voice of the
master, the mouthpiece of the master.</p><p>The word 'guru' is untranslatable, in a sense, because it has a
certain metaphorical meaning. Guru literally means 'one who dispels
darkness'. The master is just approximate, not exactly the same; but we
can give it the same meaning. The master is one who helps you to become
enlightened; that's the function of the master: he dispels your
darkness.</p><p>And to become a voice of the master means to be so totally
surrendered that you do not speak your own mind but the no-mind of the
master speaks through you. It means that you have dropped your will --
the master's will functions through you. A master has dropped his will
already, so in fact the master is only a medium, and god starts
functioning through you.</p><p>Surrendering to the master is just an excuse for surrendering to god.
Because we cannot surrender to the invisible, we need a master --
something visible. A master is just standing between the visible and the
invisible; half of the master is visible and half of the master is
invisible. So those who come to the master not in a deep surrendered
attitude, they will see only the visible part; and those who surrender,
they will see the invisible part. Then the master is no more there.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>That's why in the East, the disciple thinks of the master only in
terms of god, in no other way.</p><p>How long you will be here?</p><p>This is your name: Swami Thanasis. Thanasis means the immortal one.
That is our true reality. Mortality is only of the body, mortality is
only of the outer shell. But our inner consciousness is immortal. To be
identified with the body and to start thinking, 'I am the body' is the
foolishness that creates the fear of death.</p><p>The moment you know that you are no more the body or the mind all
fear of death disappears. And life starts only in the day that the fear
of death disappears, because then you can live. Otherwise death is
always hanging in front of you. How can you live? How can you enjoy? How
can you rejoice? How can you sing and dance? Celebration is impossible:
death is always around the corner; it can take you away at any moment.
People are living, but in deep trembling, fear, anguish, anxiety.</p><p>It is only through meditation that a person becomes free of fear of
death. He comes to know that he is immortal, there is no way to die.
Death has never happened, cannot happen. Death is an impossibility.</p><p>To know it through your own experience is the beginning of a totally
new kind of life: the life of eternity, not of time, the life that
always abides, the life that is forever. And that's what god is.</p><p>Your name is beautiful: Ma Konstanze. It means a devoted spirit.</p><p>Religion needs devotion; not only intellectual conviction but a
heartfelt devotion. Conviction is superficial and it can be changed very
easily, just a few arguments can change your conviction. Hence the
people who live in conviction are always afraid -- afreaid of facts, now
discoveries, of people who are against their ideas. They are afraid
because they know that their conviction can collapse at any moment; just
a single argument can destroy the whole edifice. Hence they will not red
others' scriptures, they will not listen to others. They will avoid
them, they will not argue. They are constantly on guard... but really
they are afraid and are cowards.</p><p>A man who is of a devoted heart has no fear. He cannot be
unconvinced, that is impossible, because he is not convinced in the
first place. It is a devotion. No argument can destroy it, no logic can
harm it. In fact no intellectuality ever reaches it; it is far beyond
that.</p><p>Unless one moves in religion with a devotion one remains
superficially religious. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- these are all
superfluous things. If you are really moving with devotion you don't
become a Christian, you become a Christ; you don't become a Buddhist,
you become a Buddha. Why should one become a Buddhist when on has the
capacity to become a Buddha? The Christian is one who is convinced.</p><p>The Buddha is one who has known.</p><p>And knowing happens in the heart, not in the head. Knowing is a
quality of love, a by-product of love.</p><p>The more you love, the more you become capable of seeing things as
they are.</p><p>So love deeply, love totally. Love this existence with deep devotion,
with great prayer.</p><p>Just today I was reading about a man, a very intellectual man. He has
written a whole Hindu prayer on a board in his bedroom, and every night
before going to sleep he would look at the sky and say to god, 'Please
god, read it.' Why bother to repeat it every day? Just put it up -- god
can read it!</p><p>There is no way from intellect to god, from scholarship to god. The
only way is through devotion. And devotion needs courage because you
have to drop your mind, your head. Devotion requires you to cut off your
head completely.</p><p>That's the work of the master: to behead his disciples! And once the
head is dropped great doors open to existence. All locks disappear. All
secrets which were hidden before become absolutely clear. Nothing is
hidden anymore.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Virato. Virato means the infinite, the vast.
Man is not as small as he appears from the outside. He contains the
whole sky within, he contains all the oceans. Yes, he looks like a
dewdrop, but his appearance is very deceptive. And science is still
working on his appearance, the dewdrop.</p><p>Those who have penetrated deeper into human consciousness were
surprised to find that as you go deeper, man becomes vast. When you
reach his very core, he is the whole universe. And that is the
experience of god.</p><p>Meditate and go deeper inwards. It is already there -- we just have
to uncover it.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anubhavo. Anubhavo means the state of
total immersion in the whole.</p><p>When the ego is lost, when you don't feel yourself separate, when
suddenly there are no boundaries to you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

is anubhava. And that state can come only through love and
meditation.</p><p>One has to become more and more silent and one has to become more and
more loving. Both are needed, and both together bring the ultimate
transformation, the merger, the disappearance of the individual and the
appearance of the universal. It is within your capacity to allow it or
not to allow it. If we are ready to surrender, it happens; if we resist,
it can't happen.</p><p>Sannyas means a readiness to surrender, a readiness to be in a state
of let-go.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Dharmesh. Dharmesh means the god of the
ultimate law. It is difficult to translate the word 'dharma' Ordinarily
it is translated as the ultimate law, the universal law, the eternal
law, the cosmic law; but they are only approximations. In Chinese there
is the right word for it 'tao'; and Christianity has the right word for
it, 'logos'.</p><p>Dharma means that invisible thread that keeps the whole cosmos
together. This togetherness can't be without any fundamental cause,
otherwise things would start falling apart. We know that the earth does
not fall apart because of gravitation, things do not fall away from the
earth because of gravitation. But why doesn't the whole universe fall
apart? -- there must be something like gravitation. That is dharma.</p><p>And the only way to find it is to go within, because there it is the
closest to us. You can find it in the trees and in the socks, but then
it is far away. You will have to understand the language of the rock,
the being of the rock, and it will be a very very impossible almost
impossible job. The easiest is to understand your own being because that
is the closest. Once you have seen it there you will be able to see it
in the rock too and you will be able to see it in the trees and you will
be able to see it in the stars. Once seen inside, the whole universe
becomes absolutely clear and transparent to you.</p><p>That experience of interlinkedness, of interdependence, has such
exquisite</p><p>beauty and creates such a great ecstasy that it is not possible to
imagine it, not possible to express it, not possible even to give a few
hints about it. So all the masters have been doing only one thing: they
show you the path to attain it -- then you will know. There is no other
way. You have to know it to know it.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Garimo. Garimo means the splendor, the
glory. Existence is full of splendor and glory, but we are blind, we are
deaf. We can't hear the music and we can't see the beauty.</p><p>Hence we have to ask, 'Where is god? What is god?'</p><p>If we can see the beauty, if we can experience the joy, the dance of
the stars and the trees and the wind and the rain, we will not ask such
stupid questions: 'What is god and where is god?' and whether god exists
or not. We will know that this beauty is god, that this splendor is god,
that this dance, this celebration, is god.</p><p>My whole approach is to make you more sensitive towards the beauties
of nature, life, existence, because that is the only valid way to become
aware of god. There is no other way. There has never been and there will
never be.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Sarjan. Sarjan means creativity. Creativity
is the real worship.</p><p>In the past religious people have been very uncreative. They were
life-negative, hence they could not be creative. Creativity means that
you are affirming life, that you are trying to enrich it, that you are
trying to make it a little more beautiful than it is. And that's how one
should server god: by making his world a little more beautiful, a little
more musical, a little more poetic, a little more colorful.</p><p>Remember it: whatsoever you are doing, do it with this vision, that
it will help the world to become more rich. In some way or other
contribute to the world's richness. And then whether you go to the
church or not does not matter -- god is yours. Whether you remember god
or not does not matter. Your creativity is enough proof of your
remembrance.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Visarjan. Visarjan means dissolving,
dissolution, melting and dissolving into the whole.</p><p>Don't keep yourself separate. Seeing a rose, become the rose.</p><p>Seeing the sunset, be lost in it. Don't remain aloof, cold. Don't
remain just a spectator, become a participant. Seeing the sky full of
stars you also become part of it, a small star. But participate in the
dance.</p><p>To me that's what religion is, dissolving oneself in the whole. Just
like a river disappears in the ocean you disappear into god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

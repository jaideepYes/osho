It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Iona. Anand means bliss. Iona means grace.\nIt is bliss that expresses itself as grace, as beauty. Misery is always ugly, awkward, because misery creates disharmony and discord inside. And the inner discord is bound to be reflected on the outside; in your behavior, the way you walk, the way you sit, the way you live, the way you do things. It is bound to be reflected by everything.\nThe miserable person cannot be graceful, cannot be really beautiful. His beauty can only be very superficial, skin-deep. But the person who has attained to bliss, who is living in his innermost core joyously, has a grace, has a beauty. He is a blessing to himself and to the world.\nThat's what a sannyasin has to be: a blessing to himself and to the world. This is your name: Ma Anand Elena. Anand means bliss. Elena means light.\nMisery is like darkness. Bliss is full of light, bliss is light. This can be experienced by everybody and can be observed. Whenever you are miserable you become dark, all lights disappear. Whenever you are in misery you become\nclosed, you love an encapsulated existence, windowless, doorless; no wind, no rain, no sun enters you. You life becomes a grave, and inside a grave there can be no light.\nLight is possible only when you are open to existence. When you are all windows and no walls then there is infinite light. Only in a blissful state can one be open.\nThe whole effort of meditation is to create joy in you. It can be created because the potential is always there. It has only to be directed in the right direction, channelized. If it is not channelized in the right direction it becomes destructive. It is the same energy that becomes misery. When your energy goes astray it becomes misery, when it is on the right track it is bliss. Misery is going away from god, bliss is coming closer to god. And the closer you come, the more you receive the light of god. When you dissolve into god you become light itself.\nYour name: Swami Hans. Hans in Hebrew means a gracious gift of god. That's what life is, a gift. But we are so unaware of it that we never thank existence, we don't feel any gratitude. so much is given yet we 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nremain complaining. We go on asking for more and more. And the misery of the mind is that the more you give, the more it asks for. It becomes more demanding, more stubborn, more arrogant, more violent, more aggressive -- and that is not the way to be blissful. That is the way to hell!\nThe way to bliss goes through gratitude, thankfulness. Feel thankful for existence. It has given so much.\nDon't ask for more, and more shall be given to you. Ask and it shall never be given to you. It is given only to those who are grateful. In gratefulness they become receivers. In gratefulness they become worthy. Ask and you are bound to miss. Never ask anything from existence. Just go on thanking it for all that it has already done, and you will be surprised that you have found the key. You can have the whole of existence without asking for anything.\nThis is your new name: Swami Sagaresh. Sagaresh means the god of the oceans.\nThe ocean is a tremendously meaningful metaphor. It is a metaphor for vastness, for infinity. And those are our innermost qualities. We are vast and we are infinite, we are oceanic, but we have become encaged in the body and the mind and we have completely forgotten our vastness. We have become so identified with this small self, the bodymind structure, that we think we are it. This is the root cause of our misery. And we can never be blissful unless this identity is broken.\nOne has to be aware that one is not the body. One is in the body but not the body, in the mind but not the mind. The body and the mind are just like a caravanserai, just an overnight's stay, and in the morning we go on a further journey. We have been in many bodies and many minds. This is not the first caravanserai you are staying in. It is a long, long journey.\nThe way to become aware \"I am not the body, I am not the mind\" is what meditation is all about. Watch, watch your body walking, sitting, lying down, and you will be able to see that you are the watcher, not the body. Watch your mind in anger, in hatred, in love, in greed, in misery, in joy, and you will become aware one day that you are not these things that happen in the mind; you are the watcher.\nSlowly slowly the watcher becomes crystallized. That is the birth of the soul. That day you are really born, that day your real life begins. From that moment god is a reality for you, and the only reality.\nThis is your new name: Ma Shanto. Shanto means silence.\nSilence is the door to god, mind is the door to the world. Mind is the world, silence is god. Mind means a constant traffic of thoughts, desires, memories. Mind is always in turmoil. It is noisy, it is a marketplace, a thousand and one things go on and on.\nBut beyond the mind there is a small still point in your being where no thought ever arises, where no traffic ever happens, where you are utterly alone. That center has to be searched for. That's the whole search of religion. The day you discover that point within yourself you have discovered god. And by discovering it you have discovered bliss, love, truth -- all that is worth looking for. By discovering it you discover that which is deathless in you, timeless and eternal.\nIn knowing it one becomes free of all fear.\nThis is your name: Swami Gyanmayo. Gyanmayo means the wise one.\nWorship nature. To go into a church is to go into something manmade. Go into the forest, go to the river, go to the ocean. Then you are going to something godmade, and god is closer when you are close to his creation. When you worship his creation... that's the only way to worship him. He is invisible but his creation is visible. His creation has to become the bridge.\nBy worshipping his creation, slowly slowly you will become aware of his tremendous presence. He is present around a tree, around a rock, around a man, around a woman. But first worship, because worship will help you to see the presence, the invisible presence. Then it becomes almost visible, almost tangible.\nYou can touch it.\nAnd the moment you are able to feel it so deeply it transforms you. You become part of it, you melt and merge with it.\nThis is your new name: Ma Sadhan. Sadhan means the method, the technique, the way, the path.\nWe have forgotten who we are, hence certain devices are needed to remind us of our reality. We have gone very far away from ourselves, hence certain ways are needed so that we can bring ourselves back, so that we can come back home.\nAll the methods, all the techniques, all the ways and all the paths are basically, essentially the same. The essence is how to wake you up. We have fallen asleep and gone deep into dreams. One dram creates another 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndream, and there are dreams within dreams within dreams. I is very puzzling to find a way to come out of those dreams, but certain device can help.\nFor example, just an alarm clock -- it is a device. It simply wakes you up suddenly. The moment you wake up you start feeling a little ridiculous. Just a moment before you were dreaming so many things and they have all gone. You feel a little embarrassed at how you could believe in those things which never existed. And so is the case with the world -- it is our dream.\nThe function of the master is to create devices. Different people need different devices. There are people who cannot be awakened by an alarm clock. When the alarm goes they start dreaming about the alarm, they start creating a dream inside. They think it is sunday and that they have come into the church and that church bells are going on. They have avoided waking up, they have created a dream around the clock, around the alarm. They may need could water thrown on them, or maybe more hammerlike methods so that their skulls can be simply shattered -- only then will they come out of their dreams.\nThere are dreamers and dreamers, hence down the ages thousands of methods have been created for different people. One method may be applicable to one person and may not be applicable to another. One it may help, another it may not help at all, on the contrary it may even hinder.\nFor example, sufis have a method that they call vigilance, keeping alert for the whole night; sleep in the day but keep alert for the whole night. But this won't work with somebody who suffers from insomnia. He will be tremendously happy, he will be perfectly okay. He will say 'Good. This is what I always needed.'\nBut it is not going to help him at all. It will fit his state, it will not disturb him.\nFasting can help somebody and somebody it may not help. There are people who don't want to eat at all.\nThey are suffering from a certain disease in which the body rejects food. For them fasting won't help at all.\nEach person needs certain methods, and the function of the master is to see what kind of method is going to help you. Each person needs different times to wake up and each person takes different periods to wake up. It depends on how long you have been asleep, it depends on what kind of dreams you are dreaming. It depends on a thousand and one things.\nThe function of a master is really delicate, the most delicate work in the world.\nSadhan means the method, the technique, the way. For you Vipassana is going to be the way, so learn Vipassana. Here we have Vipassana groups. Do other groups first to cleanse yourself and then do Vipassana. Then Vipassana has to become your companion.\nVipassana simply means watching your breath -- the art of watching your breath without disturbing it at all. It is a subtly art, because the moment you watch you start disturbing. Slowly slowly the knack is learned. Once you know how to watch the breath without disturbing it you have found the right key. This is going to be the method for you.\nThis is your new name: Swami Jyotimaya. Jyotimaya means full of light, overflowing with light, overflooded with light, radiating light.\nLight has to be your meditation. Meditate on the rising sun, meditate on the setting sun, meditate on the stars, on the moon, meditate on a small candle in your room. Use light as the object of your meditation.\nLight is going to help you.\nSlowly slowly watching the sunrise you will be able to drop your ind. Then there will be no observer and no observed. You will be lost in that moment. You will become the sunrise and you will become the sunset and you will be the candle. When that starts happening it means that now the meditation has entered into your being, has sunk deep into you. That means that you have go it.\nSo use all kinds of lights as devices. Do other meditations but remember that light has to become your central meditation.\nThis is your new name: Swami Pujan. Pujan means worship... but not a formal worship, not worshipping in a church or a temple, not worshipping any idol but worshipping existence -- the trees, the rocks, the rivers. Be a pagan -- worship nature.\nTo go into a church is to go into something manmade. Go into the forest, go to the river, go to the ocean.\nThen you are going to something God-made, and God is closer when you are\nclose to his creation. When you worship his creation... that's the only way to worship him. He is invisible but his creation is visible. His creation has to become the bridge.\nBy worshipping his creation, slowly slowly you will become aware of his tremendous presence. He is present around a tree, around a rock, around a man, around a woman. But first worship, because worship 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwill help you to see the presence, the invisible presence. Then it becomes almost visible, almost tangible.\nYou can touch it.\nAnd the moment you are able to feel it so deeply it transforms you. You become part of it, you melt and merge into it.\nThis is your name: Swami Vedam. Vedam means real wisdom, authentic wisdom, not borrowed from others but your own, not a belief but an experience. God should never be made an object of belief because that is the sure way to miss it. God has to be experienced, not believed in. God has to be known, and it is only by knowing him that you move from the ordinary mundane existence into the world of the sacred -- not by belief. Everybody believes. Somebody is Hindu, somebody is Mohammedan, somebody is Christian --\neverybody has a belief system. But those belief systems have not worked, they have not transformed the earth. On the contrary they have been the cause of much mischief, bloodshed, war. In fact those belief systems are nothing but politics in disguise. Beware of all belief systems -- they will keep you ignorant forever.\nThe true way to wisdom is not through the scriptures or through the churches or through the priesthood.\nGod needs no mediators. God needs meditators but not mediators. You can relate\nto him directly, there is no need for an agent to function between you and him. The real masters never stand between you and god.\nThey stand by the side, they point to god and they disappear. They leave you alone with your god, because only in that aloneness, in that intimacy, do miracles happen. Something transpires.\nThis is your new name: Swami Ramo. Ramo means god. Everyone is god, everything is god. Existence and god are two words for the same phenomenon. So don't think of god in terms of a person who created the world, who controls the world, who manages the whole affair. Don't think of him as a supreme boss. There is nobody like that. God is not somebody, god is a quality. It is far better to call it godlyness. It is a fragrance. It simply says one thing , that the world does not consist only of the visible, it also contains the invisible. The world does not consist only of the measurable -- that is the meaning of matter, matter means measurable -- the world also contains the immeasurable. The world does not consist only of the outside, it also has the dimension of interiority. That's all that is meant by god, the dimension of interiority.\nAnd you have to explore it now. That's what sannyas is all about: going into a deep exploration of who you are, of what this consciousness inside you is, who this witness is inside you that can witness the body, that can witness the mind. Who is this witness? From this moment that question should become suprememost. That should be your first priority. Your whole energy should start moving around it.\nAnd once it becomes your deepest concern, your ultimate concern, doors start opening. suddenly inside you, you start finding ways and means and paths that you have never travelled. They are all there, everything is ready, it is just that you are not moving in. You are focussed on the outside. Your back is towards your interiority.\nTurn in. A one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn is needed. And once you start knowing who you are --\njust little glimpses in the beginning -- tremendous joy will arise. Your life will become that of great surprise, excitement. Then there is no boredom, never. Boredom never crosses the path of the man who goes inwards.\nHe is never tired because each moment new mysteries go on cropping up, now\nmysteries go on flooding in.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2880","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2880 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

vastness, for infinity. And those are our innermost qualities. We are
vast and we are infinite, we are oceanic, but we have become encaged in
the body and the mind and we have completely forgotten our vastness. We
have become so identified with this small self, the bodymind structure,
that we think we are it. This is the root cause of our misery. And we
can never be blissful unless this identity is broken.</p><p>One has to be aware that one is not the body. One is in the body but
not the body, in the mind but not the mind. The body and the mind are
just like a caravanserai, just an overnight's stay, and in the morning
we go on a further journey. We have been in many bodies and many minds.
This is not the first caravanserai you are staying in. It is a long,
long journey.</p><p>The way to become aware "I am not the body, I am not the mind" is
what meditation is all about. Watch, watch your body walking, sitting,
lying down, and you will be able to see that you are the watcher, not
the body. Watch your mind in anger, in hatred, in love, in greed, in
misery, in joy, and you will become aware one day that you are not these
things that happen in the mind; you are the watcher.</p><p>Slowly slowly the watcher becomes crystallized. That is the birth of
the soul. That day you are really born, that day your real life begins.
From that moment god is a reality for you, and the only reality.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Shanto. Shanto means silence.</p><p>Silence is the door to god, mind is the door to the world. Mind is
the world, silence is god. Mind means a constant traffic of thoughts,
desires, memories. Mind is always in turmoil. It is noisy, it is a
marketplace, a thousand and one things go on and on.</p><p>But beyond the mind there is a small still point in your being where
no thought ever arises, where no traffic ever happens, where you are
utterly alone. That center has to be searched for. That's the whole
search of religion. The day you discover that point within yourself you
have discovered god. And by discovering it you have discovered bliss,
love, truth -- all that is worth looking for. By discovering it you
discover that which is deathless in you, timeless and eternal.</p><p>In knowing it one becomes free of all fear.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Gyanmayo. Gyanmayo means the wise one.</p><p>Worship nature. To go into a church is to go into something manmade.
Go into the forest, go to the river, go to the ocean. Then you are going
to something godmade, and god is closer when you are close to his
creation. When you worship his creation... that's the only way to
worship him. He is invisible but his creation is visible. His creation
has to become the bridge.</p><p>By worshipping his creation, slowly slowly you will become aware of
his tremendous presence. He is present around a tree, around a rock,
around a man, around a woman. But first worship, because worship will
help you to see the presence, the invisible presence. Then it becomes
almost visible, almost tangible.</p><p>You can touch it.</p><p>And the moment you are able to feel it so deeply it transforms you.
You become part of it, you melt and merge with it.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Sadhan. Sadhan means the method, the
technique, the way, the path.</p><p>We have forgotten who we are, hence certain devices are needed to
remind us of our reality. We have gone very far away from ourselves,
hence certain ways are needed so that we can bring ourselves back, so
that we can come back home.</p><p>All the methods, all the techniques, all the ways and all the paths
are basically, essentially the same. The essence is how to wake you up.

puzzling to find a way to come out of those dreams, but certain device
can help.</p><p>For example, just an alarm clock -- it is a device. It simply wakes
you up suddenly. The moment you wake up you start feeling a little
ridiculous. Just a moment before you were dreaming so many things and
they have all gone. You feel a little embarrassed at how you could
believe in those things which never existed. And so is the case with the
world -- it is our dream.</p><p>The function of the master is to create devices. Different people
need different devices. There are people who cannot be awakened by an
alarm clock. When the alarm goes they start dreaming about the alarm,
they start creating a dream inside. They think it is sunday and that
they have come into the church and that church bells are going on. They
have avoided waking up, they have created a dream around the clock,
around the alarm. They may need could water thrown on them, or maybe
more hammerlike methods so that their skulls can be simply shattered --
only then will they come out of their dreams.</p><p>There are dreamers and dreamers, hence down the ages thousands of
methods have been created for different people. One method may be
applicable to one person and may not be applicable to another. One it
may help, another it may not help at all, on the contrary it may even
hinder.</p><p>For example, sufis have a method that they call vigilance, keeping
alert for the whole night; sleep in the day but keep alert for the whole
night. But this won't work with somebody who suffers from insomnia. He
will be tremendously happy, he will be perfectly okay. He will say
'Good. This is what I always needed.'</p><p>But it is not going to help him at all. It will fit his state, it
will not disturb him.</p><p>Fasting can help somebody and somebody it may not help. There are
people who don't want to eat at all.</p><p>They are suffering from a certain disease in which the body rejects
food. For them fasting won't help at all.</p><p>Each person needs certain methods, and the function of the master is
to see what kind of method is going to help you. Each person needs
different times to wake up and each person takes different periods to
wake up. It depends on how long you have been asleep, it depends on what
kind of dreams you are dreaming. It depends on a thousand and one
things.</p><p>The function of a master is really delicate, the most delicate work
in the world.</p><p>Sadhan means the method, the technique, the way. For you Vipassana is
going to be the way, so learn Vipassana. Here we have Vipassana groups.
Do other groups first to cleanse yourself and then do Vipassana. Then
Vipassana has to become your companion.</p><p>Vipassana simply means watching your breath -- the art of watching
your breath without disturbing it at all. It is a subtly art, because
the moment you watch you start disturbing. Slowly slowly the knack is
learned. Once you know how to watch the breath without disturbing it you
have found the right key. This is going to be the method for you.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Jyotimaya. Jyotimaya means full of
light, overflowing with light, overflooded with light, radiating
light.</p><p>Light has to be your meditation. Meditate on the rising sun, meditate
on the setting sun, meditate on the stars, on the moon, meditate on a
small candle in your room. Use light as the object of your
meditation.</p><p>Light is going to help you.</p><p>Slowly slowly watching the sunrise you will be able to drop your ind.
Then there will be no observer and no observed. You will be lost in that
moment. You will become the sunrise and you will become the sunset and
you will be the candle. When that starts happening it means that now the
meditation has entered into your being, has sunk deep into you. That
means that you have go it.</p><p>So use all kinds of lights as devices. Do other meditations but
remember that light has to become your central meditation.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Pujan. Pujan means worship... but not a
formal worship, not worshipping in a church or a temple, not worshipping
any idol but worshipping existence -- the trees, the rocks, the rivers.
Be a pagan -- worship nature.</p><p>To go into a church is to go into something manmade. Go into the
forest, go to the river, go to the ocean.</p><p>Then you are going to something God-made, and God is closer when you
are</p><p>close to his creation. When you worship his creation... that's the
only way to worship him. He is invisible but his creation is visible.
His creation has to become the bridge.</p><p>By worshipping his creation, slowly slowly you will become aware of

becomes almost visible, almost tangible.</p><p>You can touch it.</p><p>And the moment you are able to feel it so deeply it transforms you.
You become part of it, you melt and merge into it.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Vedam. Vedam means real wisdom, authentic
wisdom, not borrowed from others but your own, not a belief but an
experience. God should never be made an object of belief because that is
the sure way to miss it. God has to be experienced, not believed in. God
has to be known, and it is only by knowing him that you move from the
ordinary mundane existence into the world of the sacred -- not by
belief. Everybody believes. Somebody is Hindu, somebody is Mohammedan,
somebody is Christian --</p><p>everybody has a belief system. But those belief systems have not
worked, they have not transformed the earth. On the contrary they have
been the cause of much mischief, bloodshed, war. In fact those belief
systems are nothing but politics in disguise. Beware of all belief
systems -- they will keep you ignorant forever.</p><p>The true way to wisdom is not through the scriptures or through the
churches or through the priesthood.</p><p>God needs no mediators. God needs meditators but not mediators. You
can relate</p><p>to him directly, there is no need for an agent to function between
you and him. The real masters never stand between you and god.</p><p>They stand by the side, they point to god and they disappear. They
leave you alone with your god, because only in that aloneness, in that
intimacy, do miracles happen. Something transpires.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Ramo. Ramo means god. Everyone is god,
everything is god. Existence and god are two words for the same
phenomenon. So don't think of god in terms of a person who created the
world, who controls the world, who manages the whole affair. Don't think
of him as a supreme boss. There is nobody like that. God is not
somebody, god is a quality. It is far better to call it godlyness. It is
a fragrance. It simply says one thing , that the world does not consist
only of the visible, it also contains the invisible. The world does not
consist only of the measurable -- that is the meaning of matter, matter
means measurable -- the world also contains the immeasurable. The world
does not consist only of the outside, it also has the dimension of
interiority. That's all that is meant by god, the dimension of
interiority.</p><p>And you have to explore it now. That's what sannyas is all about:
going into a deep exploration of who you are, of what this consciousness
inside you is, who this witness is inside you that can witness the body,
that can witness the mind. Who is this witness? From this moment that
question should become suprememost. That should be your first priority.
Your whole energy should start moving around it.</p><p>And once it becomes your deepest concern, your ultimate concern,
doors start opening. suddenly inside you, you start finding ways and
means and paths that you have never travelled. They are all there,
everything is ready, it is just that you are not moving in. You are
focussed on the outside. Your back is towards your interiority.</p><p>Turn in. A one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn is needed. And once you
start knowing who you are --</p><p>just little glimpses in the beginning -- tremendous joy will arise.
Your life will become that of great surprise, excitement. Then there is
no boredom, never. Boredom never crosses the path of the man who goes
inwards.</p><p>He is never tired because each moment new mysteries go on cropping
up, now</p><p>mysteries go on flooding in.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

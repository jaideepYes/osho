It is for reference purposes only.]\nYour name: Swami Robert. Robert means the shining one, the bright one.\nMan shines only when bliss arises. In misery it is impossible. Misery is dark, it can't be bright. Misery is dull. It is really something dead. Miserable people carry dead weights. They are like black holes, they don't contribute to existence; on the contrary they suck from existence. They are suckers, they suck energy from whomsoever they come in contact. Their very presence is destructive. But as one becomes blissful, one becomes creative, one becomes intelligent, one becomes wise, one becomes bright. One starts shining like a star.\nMeditation is the way from misery to bliss. Transform your darkness into light and transform all that is negative in you into something positive. Transform your no into yes. That's what sannyas is all about.\nYour name: Swami Gordon. Gordon is a significant name. It means the ascending one.\nWhen you are climbing towards the heights, reaching towards god -- because that is the only true height, everything else is far below -- when you are trying to reach towards god you become the ascending one.\nAnd the miracle is that when you start ascending towards god, god starts descending towards you.\nThe meeting always happens somewhere in between, it is not one way. It is not only that the seeker moves towards god, the moment the seeker starts moving, god starts moving; it is simultaneous. It is in fact one process and there are two polarities of the one process, the seeker and the sought; it is one phenomenon.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut god cannot descend in you unless you start ascending.\nPeople go on living as if this mundane life is all there is. People go on living as if there is nothing higher possible. There is immense possibility. Man comes with a great potential. The ultimate height of every man's being is god.\nSannyas exactly means golden. Start ascending towards the peaks. That is the only true prayer, because god can hear you only when you act... not through your words, but only through your actions. A real prayer is always non-verbal. One lives it, it is not something to be said. Start ascending -- that is prayer. And it is always heard. Inevitably god starts descending in you.\nIt is not only that man is seeking god, god is also seeking man. If it were only a one-way affair it would not be so beautiful, it would be cold from the other side. It is not so. It is a hot love affair.\nYour name: Swami Axel. Axel has two meanings. Both are tremendously beautiful and will be of great help on the path.\nThe first comes from the Teutonic. In Teutonic axel means divine reward. The second meaning comes from Hebrew. In Hebrew axel means peace. Both meanings come from two different sources but are really two aspects of the same coin.\nPeace is the divine reward. You cannot attain peace, you can only prepare the way for it to come, for it to happen. Your created peace will not be of mush value. If you are living in conflict, misery, then your peace will also reflect you. It will be miserable, it will be dark and dismal. It will not be really peace, it will be only a facade, just a mask.\nReal peace always comes from the beyond. All that is required of us is to prepare the ground, and the first essential thing, and the most essential too, is the disappearance of the ego. That is the rock that does not allow anything from the beyond to penetrate into your being.\nDrop the ego and all that belongs to the ego: anger, greed, possessiveness, jealousy, violence. All that belongs to the ego and supports the ego has to be dropped with the ego. The ego is the center, and all that is negative in you is the periphery of the center. Drop the center and let the periphery also go and then you are available, open, open to the beyond. And then peace starts showering. In thousands of ways you will find peace reaching you from every direction. It showers like flowers, with great beauty and with great fragrance.\nYour name: Swami John. John means gracious gift.\nVery rarely do we recognize it. Very rarely do we see that we have been given great opportunities to grow, to be. Even misery is an opportunity, even darkness is an opportunity, because it is only out of darkness that the desire for light arises. It is only because of misery that one starts searching for bliss.\nThe world is an opportunity. The world means all that it contains, the ten thousand things both god and bad, both thorns and flowers, both success and failure, both life and death -- all are god's gracious gift.\nIf one starts looking rightly then there is nothing which is not a gift. Then one will be continuously grateful, then one will become simply gratitude. and that's what true prayer is, what true love is.\nSannyas means recognizing, remembering all that has been given to you. And you are not in any way worthy of all that has been given you. Nobody is worthy of it. We don't deserve it -- life and love and prayer and the beauty and the splendor of existence. We have not earned it and yet we are not thankful! Man is so stupid and so miserly when being thankful.\nTo be thankful to existence is sannyas. It is nothing formal, it is something of the heart. Learn more and more gratitude, and as you learn gratitude you will come closer to god. When one becomes just gratefulness then god has arrived in you. When you have become the host and he has become the guest. And that ultimate meeting is the search.\nYour name: Swami Muni Ashok. Ashok is a Buddhist name with a very profound meaning.\nBuddha tried in every possible way never to use any positive word for the ultimate because all the positive words were misused too much. The greatest problem with a positive word is that people become desirous of it, they start longing for it.\nBefore Buddha the ultimate state was called ananda, bliss. But that creates desires, one starts hankering for bliss. And to hanker for bliss is the barrier. Bliss happens only when there is no desire.\nThe is the paradox of the seeker -- it has to be understood. -- if you desire you will miss, because desire is the way of missing. When there is no desire and one is absolutely calm and quiet... desires... Desires are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlike winds, they create waves in your consciousness, they disturb your consciousness. When there are no winds blowing, no desires, you are utterly calm and quiet, you start reflecting the truth. You become like a mirror, you reflect that which is.\nHence Buddha changed all positive terms into negative ones. Instead of using ananda, he started using ashoka. Ananda means bliss, ashoka means no-misery. He will never say 'You will attain to bliss,' he will only say 'There will be no misery;.' Now, it is a tremendously beautiful device. You cannot long for no- misery, it doesn't seem worth desiring. Bliss immediately creates a longing in the heart. Something starts ringing in the heart. You want it, you want it immediately, you become impatient. But no-misery simply leaves you aloof and\ncool.\nAshoka means no-misery;, it is a negative way of saying bliss. But Buddha had to use the negative way because the positive had become too associated with wrong people. For centuries the positive has been used\n-- rather misused -- andpeople had got lost because of the positive.\nBuddha would never say that when you attain you will become perfect. He would simply say that when you attain you will be a total nothingness. It is a negative way of defining perfection, hence to understand Buddha one needs a very intelligent mind. Buddha disappeared from this country for the simple reason that nobody was interested in the positive. But he was creating something of great value.\nSo remember that, never make god, truth, moksha, nirvana, a goal. They are not goals. Never make them objects of your desire. The moment they become objects of your desire the whole point is missed. They happen only when you are totally desireless. That is the message in the name.\nAnd muni means the silent one. It is not only that one is not speaking -- that is not true silence. One can speak and yet be silent, and one may not speak and may not be silent. The real thing is inner silence. One should speak out of silence. Then your words will have a beauty. Then you words will have some truth in them. Then your words will have some poetry, music. Then your words will not be just yours, they will come from the beyond.\nSo both words have some significance and some indications for you to work on: become desireless and become silent.\nYour name: Swami Thomas. Thomas means a seeker of truth. It defines sannyas.\nSannyas is not a process of believing; it is a process of searching. Belief is against search. The moment you believe, the search stops. There is no need to seek and search any more, you have already believed. The true seeker is one who will never believe unless he has found. And when you have found there is no need to believe, you know. Then there is no need to believe. So belief is unnecessary at both the stages. When you don't know, belief is a barrier; when you know, belief is unnecessary.\nA seeker has to be an agnostic, neither a believer nor a disbeliever. That is the fundamental approach of a seeker. He simply says \"I don't know, so how can I believe or disbelieve? I cannot say that god is, I cannot say that god is not. All that I can say with certainty is only one thing -- that I know nothing.\nThis is the beginning of a true seeker, this is the first step towards truth, to recognize one's ignorance.\nAnd half the journey is complete the moment you recognize that you don't know. The ego falls flat on the ground. It cannot exist with this recognition of ignorance so it claims knowledgeability. It is the ego that makes you an atheist, that makes you a theist, that makes you a Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist. It is the ego.\nThe agnostic is one who says \"I am simply ignorant\" -- but his ignorance is beautiful. There is no ego in it. How can you claim any ego when you don't know anything. And from that state of not-knowing the search begins.\nMy work here is first to take away all your beliefs, all your knowledge, so that you can become innocent again, like a child. Then there is not much of a problem. Truth is very close.\nIf you are innocent, truth is not far away. If you are knowledgeable, it is as far away in the same proportion, to the amount of knowledge you have.\nRenounce knowledge and become childlike. And you will be immensely fulfilled.\nThis is your new name: Ma Devagita. Devagita means divine song.\nEvery heart is full of divine song. It wants to burst forth, but our mind goes on preventing it. Our mind represses the heart, our mind condemns the heart. It says, \"You are mad, keep quiet. I know what is to be done. I know how it is to be done.\" The mind is very calculative, very mathematical, very logical, and as far as argument is concerned the mind will always win. The heart cannot argue, it knows no argument. It is not 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthinking, it is feeling.\nSannyas means changing the gestalt, jumping from the head to the heart, listening to the heart instead of the head. And suddenly a great change takes over, a revolution -- not less than that. A radical transformation happens. For the first time you start living, and you start living feelingly, lovingly. Your life becomes more and more of a song than a syllogism, a dance, a celebration. And it is only through celebration that we come to know god. There is no other way.\nMy sannyasins have to become utter celebrants, absolutely mad in love with life. My sannyasins have to be singers and dancers. They have to fill the whole earth with song and dance -- that has to be their contribution to the world. They have to be creative, creators of beauty and love and joy. And these are ways to come closer to god.\nThis is your new name: Swami Satyartha. Satyartha means the meaning of truth.\nTruth is not a conclusion. It is not something that you arrive at by thinking. It is a meaning, it is music.\nYou arrive through living, not by thinking. It is not a by-product of the logical mind, it is the experience of the illogical heart. One has to be courageous to know truth.\nMind can give you only hypotheses. They are arbitrary, they are your inventions. And what seems to be true today may not seem true tomorrow, because new facts are always being discovered. What was truth to Newton was not truth to Rutherford, what was truth to Rutherford was not truth to Albert Einstein. But what was truth to Krishna was truth to Jesus, and what was truth to Jesus was truth to Buddha, and what was truth to Buddha is truth to me and can be truth to you. Truth is eternal, it is not arbitrary. But the eternal arrives through the heart, it arrives through living.\nSannyas has to be your life... not just an impotent gesture, but a commitment, an involvement, a total commitment. One has to be ready to risk all for it, it is a gamble. But only gamblers have arrived at truth.\nBusiness people cannot arrive at truth. Business people cannot arrive at truth.\nTruth is not businesslike at all. (beginning is missed as tape gets stuck)\n..and searching can create tensions. There is no need. Whenever you are absolutely open god arrives. It has always been so and it is going to be always so. It is the universal law.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #28\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2507","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2507 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

something of the heart. Learn more and more gratitude, and as you learn
gratitude you will come closer to god. When one becomes just
gratefulness then god has arrived in you. When you have become the host
and he has become the guest. And that ultimate meeting is the
search.</p><p>Your name: Swami Muni Ashok. Ashok is a Buddhist name with a very
profound meaning.</p><p>Buddha tried in every possible way never to use any positive word for
the ultimate because all the positive words were misused too much. The
greatest problem with a positive word is that people become desirous of
it, they start longing for it.</p><p>Before Buddha the ultimate state was called ananda, bliss. But that
creates desires, one starts hankering for bliss. And to hanker for bliss
is the barrier. Bliss happens only when there is no desire.</p><p>The is the paradox of the seeker -- it has to be understood. -- if
you desire you will miss, because desire is the way of missing. When
there is no desire and one is absolutely calm and quiet... desires...

your consciousness. When there are no winds blowing, no desires, you are
utterly calm and quiet, you start reflecting the truth. You become like
a mirror, you reflect that which is.</p><p>Hence Buddha changed all positive terms into negative ones. Instead
of using ananda, he started using ashoka. Ananda means bliss, ashoka
means no-misery. He will never say 'You will attain to bliss,' he will
only say 'There will be no misery;.' Now, it is a tremendously beautiful
device. You cannot long for no- misery, it doesn't seem worth desiring.
Bliss immediately creates a longing in the heart. Something starts
ringing in the heart. You want it, you want it immediately, you become
impatient. But no-misery simply leaves you aloof and</p><p>cool.</p><p>Ashoka means no-misery;, it is a negative way of saying bliss. But
Buddha had to use the negative way because the positive had become too
associated with wrong people. For centuries the positive has been
used</p><p>-- rather misused -- andpeople had got lost because of the
positive.</p><p>Buddha would never say that when you attain you will become perfect.
He would simply say that when you attain you will be a total
nothingness. It is a negative way of defining perfection, hence to
understand Buddha one needs a very intelligent mind. Buddha disappeared
from this country for the simple reason that nobody was interested in
the positive. But he was creating something of great value.</p><p>So remember that, never make god, truth, moksha, nirvana, a goal.
They are not goals. Never make them objects of your desire. The moment
they become objects of your desire the whole point is missed. They
happen only when you are totally desireless. That is the message in the
name.</p><p>And muni means the silent one. It is not only that one is not
speaking -- that is not true silence. One can speak and yet be silent,
and one may not speak and may not be silent. The real thing is inner
silence. One should speak out of silence. Then your words will have a
beauty. Then you words will have some truth in them. Then your words
will have some poetry, music. Then your words will not be just yours,
they will come from the beyond.</p><p>So both words have some significance and some indications for you to
work on: become desireless and become silent.</p><p>Your name: Swami Thomas. Thomas means a seeker of truth. It defines
sannyas.</p><p>Sannyas is not a process of believing; it is a process of searching.
Belief is against search. The moment you believe, the search stops.
There is no need to seek and search any more, you have already believed.
The true seeker is one who will never believe unless he has found. And
when you have found there is no need to believe, you know. Then there is
no need to believe. So belief is unnecessary at both the stages. When
you don't know, belief is a barrier; when you know, belief is
unnecessary.</p><p>A seeker has to be an agnostic, neither a believer nor a disbeliever.
That is the fundamental approach of a seeker. He simply says "I don't
know, so how can I believe or disbelieve? I cannot say that god is, I
cannot say that god is not. All that I can say with certainty is only
one thing -- that I know nothing.</p><p>This is the beginning of a true seeker, this is the first step
towards truth, to recognize one's ignorance.</p><p>And half the journey is complete the moment you recognize that you
don't know. The ego falls flat on the ground. It cannot exist with this
recognition of ignorance so it claims knowledgeability. It is the ego
that makes you an atheist, that makes you a theist, that makes you a
Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist. It is the ego.</p><p>The agnostic is one who says "I am simply ignorant" -- but his
ignorance is beautiful. There is no ego in it. How can you claim any ego
when you don't know anything. And from that state of not-knowing the
search begins.</p><p>My work here is first to take away all your beliefs, all your
knowledge, so that you can become innocent again, like a child. Then
there is not much of a problem. Truth is very close.</p><p>If you are innocent, truth is not far away. If you are knowledgeable,
it is as far away in the same proportion, to the amount of knowledge you
have.</p><p>Renounce knowledge and become childlike. And you will be immensely
fulfilled.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Devagita. Devagita means divine song.</p><p>Every heart is full of divine song. It wants to burst forth, but our
mind goes on preventing it. Our mind represses the heart, our mind
condemns the heart. It says, "You are mad, keep quiet. I know what is to
be done. I know how it is to be done." The mind is very calculative,
very mathematical, very logical, and as far as argument is concerned the
mind will always win. The heart cannot argue, it knows no argument. It
is not 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

heart, listening to the heart instead of the head. And suddenly a great
change takes over, a revolution -- not less than that. A radical
transformation happens. For the first time you start living, and you
start living feelingly, lovingly. Your life becomes more and more of a
song than a syllogism, a dance, a celebration. And it is only through
celebration that we come to know god. There is no other way.</p><p>My sannyasins have to become utter celebrants, absolutely mad in love
with life. My sannyasins have to be singers and dancers. They have to
fill the whole earth with song and dance -- that has to be their
contribution to the world. They have to be creative, creators of beauty
and love and joy. And these are ways to come closer to god.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Satyartha. Satyartha means the meaning
of truth.</p><p>Truth is not a conclusion. It is not something that you arrive at by
thinking. It is a meaning, it is music.</p><p>You arrive through living, not by thinking. It is not a by-product of
the logical mind, it is the experience of the illogical heart. One has
to be courageous to know truth.</p><p>Mind can give you only hypotheses. They are arbitrary, they are your
inventions. And what seems to be true today may not seem true tomorrow,
because new facts are always being discovered. What was truth to Newton
was not truth to Rutherford, what was truth to Rutherford was not truth
to Albert Einstein. But what was truth to Krishna was truth to Jesus,
and what was truth to Jesus was truth to Buddha, and what was truth to
Buddha is truth to me and can be truth to you. Truth is eternal, it is
not arbitrary. But the eternal arrives through the heart, it arrives
through living.</p><p>Sannyas has to be your life... not just an impotent gesture, but a
commitment, an involvement, a total commitment. One has to be ready to
risk all for it, it is a gamble. But only gamblers have arrived at
truth.</p><p>Business people cannot arrive at truth. Business people cannot arrive
at truth.</p><p>Truth is not businesslike at all. (beginning is missed as tape gets
stuck)</p><p>..and searching can create tensions. There is no need. Whenever you
are absolutely open god arrives. It has always been so and it is going
to be always so. It is the universal law.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

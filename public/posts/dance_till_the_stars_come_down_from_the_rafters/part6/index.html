Then it is absence of conflict, absence of tension, absence of struggle, but there is nothing present; it is empty. something is absent but nothing is present. It is just like the peace that exists in the world: it is cold war. War is not happening but everybody is ready to explode into war at any moment. It is only absence of war, but it is not presence of peace.\nPresence of peace is a totally different phenomenon, it is something utterly\npositive. And negative peace cannot transform one, only positive peace can. Positive peace comes not through cultivation, it comes through meditation. Negative peace comes through cultivation: you can cultivate a certain character and that character surrounds you and keeps you quiet. You don't come into unnecessary conflict with people, with others, you remain a little alert, cautious. But this is not a transformation and this is not going to lead you to the ultimate truth.\nTrue peace is a by-product of meditation. It wells up within you, it rises within you. It is something like a fragrance of your soul, the light of your inner being.\n(To Bruno) -- This is your name: Swami Sundaram Bruno. Sundaram means beauty and bruno means darkness -- the beauty of darkness.\nIt is very easy to see the beauty of light, it is very difficult to see the beauty of darkness. We are afraid of darkness, hence the difficulty in seeing the beauty of it. Out of fear we love light and hate darkness, but darkness is as profound as light. It has a totally different quality, its depth, its silence. when you are surrounded by darkness you are surrounded by an infinity.\nLight is always finite, it has limits. And light is always caused by something, it is temporary. Even the sun is temporary: sooner or later it is going to die, it will cease giving light. A candle dies in the night, a sun takes millions of years, but it is only a question of degree. Darkness is without beginning, without end; it is always. It is non-temporal, it has something of eternity in it.\nStart meditating on darkness because that will reveal many mysteries to you. If you can love darkness one day you will be able to love death too, because death is also darkness. If you can love darkness you will be able to fall deeply in love, because love is also darkness. If you are able to love darkness you will be able to move into the unknown, because the unknown is dark, it is familiar. The known, the familiar, is full of light. The moment you cross the boundary of the familiar, you are moving into some eternal abyss.\nSo meditate on darkness and it will help you also on the inward journey... because when you first start moving inwards you come across a great darkness. Ultimately you come to light, but on the way you have to pass through darkness. and if you are afraid of it, you will escape. That's why only a very few people have been able to reach to their innermost core.\n(To Robert) -- This is your name: Swami Satyam Robert. Satyam means truth. Robert means fame.\nFame is good only if it comes as a by-product of experiencing truth, otherwise it has no beauty in it.\nAdolf Hitler is famous, Genghis Khan is famous, and all kinds of criminals and murderers are famous.\nHistory is full of them. In fact history consists only of these people. But that fame is ugly, evil.\nUnless one can be famous because of truth, not for any other reason, fame is futile. A Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra -- their fame arises from a totally different source. It arises from god himself, it is not their fame. They are no more: only god is. Now god is shining forth through them, radiating.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe fame of Moses or a Lao Tzu or a Mohammed has nothing to do with Mohammed, Lao Tzu or Moses. It is not personal, it is divine, it is godly, it is universal. These people have become just vehicles, vehicles of truth. They are utterly empty, egoless. Hence their fame has no stink of ego, it has the fragrance of egolessness.\n(To Georg) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Georg. Deva means divine. Georg means a farmer.\nBuddha has said: I am a divine farmer. I sow the seeds of divinity in people. I water peoples' heart with prayers. I help them to grow and train them to be patient and to wait for the spring, so they will suddenly burst forth into thousands of flowers.\nThat's really the message of all the masters: life should be transformed into a\ndivine farming. I should not be taken for granted. Whatever you have got is only the seed. You have to bring it to the ultimate flowering. That is the task of life, the goal, the very purpose -- and without fulfilling it one never feels blissful.\n(To Gwen) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Gwen. Anand means bliss. Gwen means white.\nWhite is the symbolic color of bliss. White represents a deep harmony of all the colors. It is the whole rainbow, in such a harmony, that you cannot not see separate colors. They have lost their separateness into it, they have become one, they have fallen in a deep accord. Because of that deep accord white has become the symbol of ultimate bliss.\nBliss is possible only when your life has become an accord: your body, your mind, your soul, all in deep harmony; and you in a deep synchronicity with the whole. And that's what meditation is all about: creating a space in you where all the conflicting elements lose their conflict, become friends, hold hands, start dancing and create a harmony. Then bliss arises.\nBliss is the flowering of a white lotus.\n(To Maya) Hello Maya! What is the meaning of your name?\n-- It means illusion.\n-- Who has given it to you?\n-- A friend.\n-- A friend has given it ? Good!\nThis is your name: Ma Veet Maya. Veet means going beyond. Maya means illusion.\nSannyas is the bridge that can take you beyond all illusions. Sannyas is the alchemy to help you to transcend illusions and reach reality.\nAll illusions exist in the mind -- in desires, in memories, in thoughts, in imagination. When all these processes have stopped, when the mind is utterly silent, not functioning at all, you transcend illusion, you transcend the world of\ndreams: you become awakened. That's what a Christ is, what a Buddha is: one who has awakened and dreams no more. And the moment you know the taste of awakening you have experienced the ultimate bliss.\nThere is nothing higher that it, there is nothing deeper that it. It is the ultimate experience of life in all its beauty, grandeur, splendor.\n(To Patrick) Man is born enlightened, but the whole process of up bringing makes him unenlightened.\nEverybody is born a Buddha, but the society does not allow the self-nature to function. It imposes a pseudo nature on top of it, because the pseudo can be manipulated easily. The society is very afraid of self-nature because it is such intelligence that you can reduce cannot reduce a person to a slave, you cannot destroy the person and his freedom. He will not be a part of any country, church, state, because he will be able to see through and through. He cannot be deceived, he cannot be cheated, he cannot be exploited. And the society wants people who can be exploited, enslaved, imprisoned; hence it creates a pseudo personality around the self-nature. It rewards the pseudo personality and it punishes the self- nature.\nThe function of initiation into some spiritual school simply means one thing: it is a de-conditioning, a de-hypnosis. It is destroying the structure created by the society so that your self-nature can be free to function according to itself.\n(To Lea) -- This is your name: Ma Tarika. Tarika means a star, a shining star. We are all carrying within ourselves a star of infinite beauty. We are stars. Of course we are surrounded by much smoke and clouds, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nand if one looks from the outside nothing of the star can be found.\nThe function of meditation is to penetrate through these dark clouds that surround you and to reach to the center where eternal light is present, where life is a flame of joy, of bliss, of tremendous beauty. The experience of that\ninnermost flame is the experience of god.\nThe journey is difficult but worth taking. And it is only difficult in the beginning. As you become accustomed to the joy of the unknown and the freedom of the unknown and the thrill of the unknown, it is no more difficult. Then each moment of it is of such precious beauty, of such exquisite joy, of such tremendous ecstasy that one is ready to go through any hardships. One is even ready to die for it because now one knows that even death is not a death.\n(To Guiseppe) -- This is your new name: Swami Satgyano. Satgyano means true knowing.\nThe false knowing is borrowed, the true knowing is intrinsic. The false knowing comes from the outside and the true knowing arises within you; it is your own treasure, it is your own kingdom. The false knowing can be taken away, the true knowing cannot be taken away from you. Even death cannot separate you from your true knowing.\nThat is the only treasure that we can take beyond death. Everything else will be left behind. So all the trouble that we take in accumulating other things ultimately proves to be futile. It proves to be simply a wastage of time and energy. Only those few moments in which you worked for your inner exploration are saved.\nMeditation is the way to explore inwards. From now onwards, focus your energies on meditation, give as much time and energy to meditation as you can manage, because all else is futile: At the most it keeps you occupied, at the most it is just entertainment; at the worst it is a nightmare.\n(To Annemarie) -- This is your new name: Ma Nishavdo. Nishavdo means the wordless, the silent one.\nAnd that is going to be your work on yourself: get out of the jungle of words, get out of the constant chattering of the mind. Remember constantly: 'I am not the mind, but the watcher, the witness.', and slowly slowly the witness arises out of the clouds like a sun. And the moment you have experienced your absolute separation and transcendence from mind, you are liberated. There is no other bondage, no other prison then the words. Our prison is not made of bricks, it is made of words. It is not a gross phenomenon. It si a very subtle, transparent thing, made of mind.\nSo watch more and more. Create a distance between you and the mind, and remember again and again as many times as possible 'I am not the mind.' Whatever you start getting involved in the mind, remind yourself and immediately relax and get out or it.\nIn the beginning it will be only for moments, then for minutes, then for hours, then for days. In fact the day one can manage to be out of the mind for forty- eight minutes, one is free. That is the experience of all the Buddhas of all the ages: forty-eight minutes... and then the mind has not power over you.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2079","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2079 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

splendor.</p><p>(To Patrick) Man is born enlightened, but the whole process of up
bringing makes him unenlightened.</p><p>Everybody is born a Buddha, but the society does not allow the
self-nature to function. It imposes a pseudo nature on top of it,
because the pseudo can be manipulated easily. The society is very afraid
of self-nature because it is such intelligence that you can reduce
cannot reduce a person to a slave, you cannot destroy the person and his
freedom. He will not be a part of any country, church, state, because he
will be able to see through and through. He cannot be deceived, he
cannot be cheated, he cannot be exploited. And the society wants people
who can be exploited, enslaved, imprisoned; hence it creates a pseudo
personality around the self-nature. It rewards the pseudo personality
and it punishes the self- nature.</p><p>The function of initiation into some spiritual school simply means
one thing: it is a de-conditioning, a de-hypnosis. It is destroying the
structure created by the society so that your self-nature can be free to
function according to itself.</p><p>(To Lea) -- This is your name: Ma Tarika. Tarika means a star, a
shining star. We are all carrying within ourselves a star of infinite
beauty. We <em>are</em> stars. Of course we are surrounded by much smoke
and clouds, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

found.</p><p>The function of meditation is to penetrate through these dark clouds
that surround you and to reach to the center where eternal light is
present, where life is a flame of joy, of bliss, of tremendous beauty.
The experience of that</p><p>innermost flame is the experience of god.</p><p>The journey is difficult but worth taking. And it is only difficult
in the beginning. As you become accustomed to the joy of the unknown and
the freedom of the unknown and the thrill of the unknown, it is no more
difficult. Then each moment of it is of such precious beauty, of such
exquisite joy, of such tremendous ecstasy that one is ready to go
through <em>any</em> hardships. One is even ready to die for it because
now one knows that even death is not a death.</p><p>(To Guiseppe) -- This is your new name: Swami Satgyano. Satgyano
means true knowing.</p><p>The false knowing is borrowed, the true knowing is intrinsic. The
false knowing comes from the outside and the true knowing arises within
you; it is your own treasure, it is your own kingdom. The false knowing
can be taken away, the true knowing cannot be taken away from you. Even
death cannot separate you from your true knowing.</p><p>That is the only treasure that we can take beyond death. Everything
else will be left behind. So all the trouble that we take in
accumulating other things ultimately proves to be futile. It proves to
be simply a wastage of time and energy. Only those few moments in which
you worked for your inner exploration are saved.</p><p>Meditation is the way to explore inwards. From now onwards, focus
your energies on meditation, give as much time and energy to meditation
as you can manage, because <em>all</em> else is futile: At the most it
keeps you occupied, at the most it is just entertainment; at the worst
it is a nightmare.</p><p>(To Annemarie) -- This is your new name: Ma Nishavdo. Nishavdo means
the wordless, the silent one.</p><p>And that is going to be your work on yourself: get out of the jungle
of words, get out of the constant chattering of the mind. Remember
constantly: 'I am not the mind, but the watcher, the witness.', and
slowly slowly the witness arises out of the clouds like a sun. And the
moment you have experienced your absolute separation and transcendence
from mind, you are liberated. There is no other bondage, no other prison
then the words. Our prison is not made of bricks, it is made of words.
It is not a gross phenomenon. It si a very subtle, transparent thing,
made of mind.</p><p>So watch more and more. Create a distance between you and the mind,
and remember again and again as many times as possible 'I am not the
mind.' Whatever you start getting involved in the mind, remind yourself
and immediately relax and get out or it.</p><p>In the beginning it will be only for moments, then for minutes, then
for hours, then for days. In fact the day one can manage to be out of
the mind for forty- eight minutes, one is free. That is the experience
of all the Buddhas of all the ages: forty-eight minutes... and then the
mind has not power over you.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

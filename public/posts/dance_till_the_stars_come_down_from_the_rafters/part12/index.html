It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Gunther. Prem means love. Gunther means bold.\nLove without boldness is impossible. Love requires guts. The greatest courage in life is to lose yourself\n-- and that's the primary requirement of love. Unless you lose yourself you cannot be in love. You can play the game called love, but you will never know the reality of love. You will be doing something else in the name of love. Deep down it will only be an ego trip -- and love can never be an ego trip.\nEgo has to be dissolved, only then does love flow in you. And that is real courage. In a deep sense it is committing suicide -- not of the body but of the mind. It is becoming mindless. Hence love looks to people like something mad, insane. In a way it is true, it is mad. Going beyond the mind is a certain kind of madness. Of course it is divine madness and it brings a sanity of its own kind. It beings an insight, an understanding, but is is totally different from intellectual understanding. It is not of the mind, it is of the beyond.\nThis is your new name: Swami Anand Vedo. Anand means bliss, vedo means the\nscripture -- the scripture of bliss. That is what we are meant to be: scriptures of bliss, sermons of joy, messages of god, flowerings of wisdom. That is our essential being, but we don't allow it to happen, to grow, to explode. We prevent it in every possible way. We are our own enemies.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo be a sannyasin means to become a friend to yourself. And mow start looking for your intrinsic potential. Don't be bothered about what others say you should be, listen to your own inner voice and be it!\nAnd whatsoever is the risk, risk... because without risk there is no growth, without risk the seed can never become a sprout, without risk the child will never be born out of the womb.\nAshen means hope. There is great hope because man can become god. there is great hope because man can blossom into thousands of flowers. There is great hope because man can transcend death, can become immortal.\nCome again! There is great hope (much laughter) ... come again! (To Judy, Serge's little sister)\nSuch a good sannyasin! (laughter)\nThis is your new name: Ma Gitima. Gitima means poetry, a song. Become a song. Sing and dance -- that is your meditation!\nThe name is tremendously beautiful, and this is my whole approach towards life, the meaning of your name. Mirella means wonder, awe.\nMan can function in two ways, either through knowledge or through wonder. If he functions through knowledge he never comes to know the great mysteries of life. Of course he collects many stupid facts called data, but he never comes to\nknow the inner reality that joins those facts together. He knows only fragments and never the harmony that runs through all of then that keeps them together. That's what science goes on doing. The very word 'science' means knowledge. When you function through knowledge you function through the mind.\nReligion functions through the heart. To function through the heart, wonder is the quality required.\nWhen you are in a moment of wonder and awe you are again a child. Again the same freshness overwhelms you, as if the whole existence has become bathed, all dust has disappeared, and the mirror is so clean that it can reflect the subtlest nuances of existence.\nReligion is born out of the experiences of awe\nSeeing the sunrise or the sunset, be overwhelmed. Those are the great moments. Seeing the sky full of stars, be drunk, be lost, utterly lost in it. Become a small star yourself, not a separate spectator but a participant. When you participate in existence you know the mystery. God is nothing but another name for the mysterious that one discovers through wonder and awe.\nFunction from a state of innocence==that's the only way to know. Knowledge is not the way to know. It is only pretension. Innocence is the way to know, and for innocence one has to sacrifice all knowledge. One has to put it aside as sheer garbage. And it is exactly that. It is all crap!\n-- What exactly is the meaning of your name (Livio)?\n-- I don't know.\n(To Lalita, translator and Osho's librarian)\n-- Lalita, do you have some idea?\n-- It is the name of a great Roman family.\n-- Mm, but what does it mean?\n-- It might come from Silviano -- the god of the forest... but that's a guess.\n-- (To Livio) So we will accept Lalita's guess. She is my researcher!\nThe solitary person is in a negative space. He is feeling lonely, he is hankering for the other. He is in a deep sadness because he does not know how to be with himself, he does not know how to enjoy himself, he does not know how to celebrate himself. All that he knows is relationship, so whenever he is in relationship he feels at ease. Whenever he is with somebody he can forget himself. To be with somebody is something like alcohol, it is an intoxicant. It is simply drowning yourself, your worries, anxieties, your very existence in the other. And the other is doing the same with you. That's what people call relationship. Each is using the other as a means to avoid himself.\nSolitude is totally different. It is not loneliness, it is aloneness. It is aloneness. It is not negative, it is utterly positive. It is not the experience that the other is absent but the experience that 'I am present.' It is so overwhelming an experience of one's own presence that everything else fades from the ind and one starts feeling ecstatic. The sheer joy of breathing, the sheer joy of being, the sheer joy of participating in existence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis enough. It is a wonder to be, the wonder of wonders.\nBliss makes real solitude. Then solitude becomes a temple, bliss becomes the deity in it. And that's what meditation is all about: the art of changing loneliness into aloneness, the alchemy of changing solitariness into solitude.\nThis is your name: Ma Prem Madak. Prem means love, madak means intoxicant. Love is the only real intoxicant. And it has a very paradoxical quality to it: it intoxicates you and yet it makes you more aware.\nThat's the miracle of love. It does not make you unconscious. It it makes you unconscious it is lust, not love.\nIf it makes you drunk and yet in the deepest core of your being you become more and more alert and conscious, then it is love.\nOne can be aware without love, but then awareness is almost like a wasteland, a desert. Nothing grows, no flowers, no trees. Love can be without awareness but then it is simply sexuality, animal lust, nothing higher than that -- something biological, physical, chemical. But when both are together, love and awareness, they create a great harmony.\nSo this has to be your work on yourself, love plus awareness. Be drunk as much as you can and yet remain aware. When this paradox is experienced one has experienced god.\nThis is your new name: Swami Deva Abhilash. Deva means divine. Abhilash means thirst for, a deep deep longing for the divine. It is not only a desire, because desire is of the mind. Hence I call it thirst. It is far deeper. You are involved totally in it, your very existence, your every fibre, every cell is dying without it It is as if a man were lost in a desert and is feeling thirsty but cannot find water. First it is in the mind, then slowly he starts feeling it in the body. Then slowly it becomes so total that he is just thirst and nothing else. Not even the word 'thirst' is there. He is thirst. That is the meaning of abhilash.\nIn English there is no word to express it exactly, that's why the explanation is needed. The dictionaries translate it as desire, then they miss the whole point. In Sanskrit we have many words for different kinds of desires. Abhilash is the highest, the purest kind of longing, the longing for the ultimate, the longing to transcend oneself, the longing to come home, the longing to wake up. It is a divine longing, it is a divine discontent. And the person who feels it is blessed.\nThis is your new name: Swami Gyandas. Gyandas means a servant of wisdom.\nThe only thing to be remembered always it that wisdom does not mean knowledge, it means just the opposite. It means a state of not-knowing. It means innocence.\nKnowledge in one of the nourishment for the ego, the most vital nourishment. The more you know, the more you feel that you are somebody. Even riches don't give that much ego, not even political power gives so much ego as knowledgeability does. And ego is the barrier to knowing.\nEgo is a false phenomenon, and if we cling to it we cannot know the real. The false has to cease for the real to be, and the only way is to detach yourself from all knowledge. Yes, spiritual, esoteric, all kinds of knowledge are included in it.\nOne should become more and more innocent, childlike. Wondering is good, looking into existence with no idea of what it is, is good, living without conclusions is virtue.\nThat is the meaning of your name. You have to transform it into a reality, because this is the only key that unlocks the doors of god's temple.\nThis is your new name: Swami Nirguno. Nirguno is one of the names of god.\nIn India we have one thousand names for god. There is one scripture, Vishnu Sastranath. The whole scripture is devoted only to the names, the one thousand names of god. But each name has a beauty. It reminds you of a certain aspect.\nIn the East we say that god has one thousand hand, mm? -- just to signify the vastness, the multi-dimensionality of it, the infinity of it. Nirguno is one of the names. It means that god is without any attributes. Literally it means attributeless. That is the fundamental attribute, that god has not attributes. So whatever we say about him is going to be only approximately true, it can never be the truth. And approximately true simply means a beautiful way to say that it is a lie, because truth is either true or not rue.\nApproximately true is not possible. Either a man is dead or alive; if you say 'approximately alive' it doesn't mean anything. Either you are in love with somebody or not. If you say 'approximately in love', that means nothing. It is simply a polite way of saying, 'Excuse me.'\nThe fundamental quality of god is that he has no qualities. That's why he an manifest in millions of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nqualities. He has no form, that's why he can manifest in all kinds of forms. He is very liquid, flexible, not static, not like rock but like water. So you put it in a cup and it becomes the form of the cup, and you put in in a bottle and it takes the form of the bottle. It is very non-resistant. It is willing to take any form.\nSo on one hand god has no forms and on the other hand all forms are his. And both these things have to be remembered constantly so that you don't become attached to any particular form.\nChrist is only a particular form... Buddha also, Krishna also. But there are people who have become attached to them. Now, there are people who are attached to Krishna, so obsessed, that they cannot think of any other manifestation of god. Buddha they will deny, Christ they will deny, Mohammed they will deny; they will say 'Krishna is the only true god.' And the same is true about the Christian.\nJust the other day I saw an eighteen-page report against me published by the German Protestant Church and distributed to all the churches in Germany saying 'Beware of this man, because this man talks like Jesus, and that is dangerous. And this man should not be quoted anywhere, should not be referred to in any church, in any sermon, from any pulpit.'\nNow what is the fear? The whole fear is that a few Christians may become attracted, and Christ is the only true messenger, there is no other messenger, the only begotten son of god. And what about everybody else? Are all bastards? (laughter)\nIn the East we are no so fanatical. All are his, all forms are his. Everybody is his son, he fathers the whole existence. He it only the father of Jesus Christ. That would be a very poor god who fathers only on son and who cannot father Buddha and who cannot father Lao Tzu and who cannot father Zarathustra. He would be a poor god. When he can father the whole existence, why make him so poor?\nThe report accepts that his man -- it says about me -- is extraordinary, but that is the danger! He is a human being and Jesus is god -- that difference has to be remembered.\nNobody is a human being, everybody is god!\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Parad. Veet means going beyond. Parad means mercury. Mercury represents the mind. It is a metaphor for the mind because the mind is very mercurial, changing continuously. It has nothing permanent in it. Not even an iota remains the same. Not even for two consecutive moments does the mind remain the same, it is constant flux.\nBecause we are trying to live through the mind and we are trying to hold onto the mind, which goes on changing, we are constantly in misery. We cling to it and it slips. It is exactly like mercury.\nIf you don't cling to mercury you can keep it in your hand, but if you close your fist it will slip out, and once it falls onto the floor it is impossible to collect it again. We are cling to the mind so much. It goes into fragments and they all go on slipping our of our hand, and because they go on slipping, we cling even more.\nAnd the more we cling, the more we are in misery, because all our efforts to cling are bound to be frustrated. Wee need some eternal shelter. That shelter is within you, but is is not the mind. It is the witness if the mind.\nSo go beyond the mind, watch the mind, destroy the identity with the mind and remind yourself again and again 'I am the watcher, I am the witness of it all. I am not it.' Slowly slowly it sinks into your being and the forgotten language is remembered again. The day you recognize absolutely, totally, that you are the witness, you have awakened from sleep. That awakening brings bliss, benediction.\nThis is your name: Swami Sandhano. Sandhano means the ultimate enquiry. The ultimate enquire is\n'Who am I?' It is not about god, it is not about heaven and hell, it is not about past lives, it is not about ANYthing, but about yourself.\nMaharishi Ramana used to give only one meditation to his disciples: Who am I? Go into this enquiry.\nWatch, search, disentangle yourself from all identifications with the body and the mind. Slowly slowly you begin to see that you are not the body. You live in the body, obviously, but the body is only an abode, a caravanserai, an overnight stay\n-- in the morning you go. And so is the case with the mind. It is even more fleeting than the body.\nYou are beyond both, and that which is beyond both is unchanging. It is the same from the very beginning , if there was any beginning, and it will remain the same to the very end, it there is going to be any end. In fact there is no beginning and no end: your being is eternal. That's what is meant when I say that you are gods,\ngods who have fallen asleep. The enquiry will wake you up.\nSo this is going to be your meditation. Sitting, walking, go on enquiring 'Who am I?' Not verbally, not intellectually -- existentially. Watch whether you are the body. When you are hungry, watch -- are you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfeeling hungry or are you simply becoming aware that the body is hungry? When you have a headache watch whether you have the pain or you are just a watcher who knows that the head is suffering from pain.\nAnd it is not difficult, slowly slowly to become aware that all these things are happening around you but you are not any of them.\nThat transcendence it the real experience of truth. And when you know your inner truth you become capable of knowing the truth of the whole existence. But the most fundamental step has to be taken inside yourself.\nThis is your new name: Ma Premgyan. Premgyan means love is true wisdom -- not logic, but love, not the head, but the heart. We are all hung up in the head and we have completely forgotten the heart. To ignore the heart is ignorance. Not to ignore the heart is wisdom. And our whole education is rooted in this strategy: it teaches people how to ignore the heart. It condemns the heart, it condemns feeling, it appreciates thinking. It is devoted to the god of logic, and logic is very poor compared to love. Logic is empty, hollow, with no soul in it, just a shadow.\nIt is only love that can fulfil one, it is only love that can give you authentic growth. So move from the head to the heart. That is the whole journey of sannyas.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #13\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3141","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3141 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

it!</p><p>And whatsoever is the risk, risk... because without risk there is no
growth, without risk the seed can never become a sprout, without risk
the child will never be born out of the womb.</p><p>Ashen means hope. There is great hope because man can become god.
there is great hope because man can blossom into thousands of flowers.
There is great hope because man can transcend death, can become
immortal.</p><p>Come again! There is great hope (much laughter) ... come again! (To
Judy, Serge's little sister)</p><p>Such a good sannyasin! (laughter)</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Gitima. Gitima means poetry, a song. Become
a song. Sing and dance -- that is your meditation!</p><p>The name is tremendously beautiful, and this is my whole approach
towards life, the meaning of your name. Mirella means wonder, awe.</p><p>Man can function in two ways, either through knowledge or through
wonder. If he functions through knowledge he never comes to know the
great mysteries of life. Of course he collects many stupid facts called
data, but he never comes to</p><p>know the inner reality that joins those facts together. He knows only
fragments and never the harmony that runs through all of then that keeps
them together. That's what science goes on doing. The very word
'science' means knowledge. When you function through knowledge you
function through the mind.</p><p>Religion functions through the heart. To function through the heart,
wonder is the quality required.</p><p>When you are in a moment of wonder and awe you are again a child.
Again the same freshness overwhelms you, as if the whole existence has
become bathed, all dust has disappeared, and the mirror is so clean that
it can reflect the subtlest nuances of existence.</p><p>Religion is born out of the experiences of awe</p><p>Seeing the sunrise or the sunset, be overwhelmed. Those are the great
moments. Seeing the sky full of stars, be drunk, be lost, utterly lost
in it. Become a small star yourself, not a separate spectator but a
participant. When you participate in existence you know the mystery. God
is nothing but another name for the mysterious that one discovers
through wonder and awe.</p><p>Function from a state of innocence==that's the only way to know.
Knowledge is not the way to know. It is only pretension. Innocence is
the way to know, and for innocence one has to sacrifice all knowledge.
One has to put it aside as sheer garbage. And it is exactly that. It is
all crap!</p><p>-- What exactly is the meaning of your name (Livio)?</p><p>-- I don't know.</p><p>(To Lalita, translator and Osho's librarian)</p><p>-- Lalita, do you have some idea?</p><p>-- It is the name of a great Roman family.</p><p>-- Mm, but what does it mean?</p><p>-- It might come from Silviano -- the god of the forest... but that's
a guess.</p><p>-- (To Livio) So we will accept Lalita's guess. She is my
researcher!</p><p>The solitary person is in a negative space. He is feeling lonely, he
is hankering for the other. He is in a deep sadness because he does not
know how to be with himself, he does not know how to enjoy himself, he
does not know how to celebrate himself. All that he knows is
relationship, so whenever he is in relationship he feels at ease.
Whenever he is with somebody he can forget himself. To be with somebody
is something like alcohol, it is an intoxicant. It is simply drowning
yourself, your worries, anxieties, your very existence in the other. And
the other is doing the same with you. That's what people call
relationship. Each is using the other as a means to avoid himself.</p><p>Solitude is totally different. It is not loneliness, it is aloneness.
It is aloneness. It is not negative, it is utterly positive. It is not
the experience that the other is absent but the experience that 'I am
present.' It is so overwhelming an experience of one's own presence that
everything else fades from the ind and one starts feeling ecstatic. The
sheer joy of breathing, the sheer joy of being, the sheer joy of
participating in existence 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

becomes the deity in it. And that's what meditation is all about: the
art of changing loneliness into aloneness, the alchemy of changing
solitariness into solitude.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Prem Madak. Prem means love, madak means
intoxicant. Love is the only real intoxicant. And it has a very
paradoxical quality to it: it intoxicates you and yet it makes you more
aware.</p><p>That's the miracle of love. It does not make you unconscious. It it
makes you unconscious it is lust, not love.</p><p>If it makes you drunk and yet in the deepest core of your being you
become more and more alert and conscious, then it is love.</p><p>One can be aware without love, but then awareness is almost like a
wasteland, a desert. Nothing grows, no flowers, no trees. Love can be
without awareness but then it is simply sexuality, animal lust, nothing
higher than that -- something biological, physical, chemical. But when
both are together, love and awareness, they create a great harmony.</p><p>So this has to be your work on yourself, love plus awareness. Be
drunk as much as you can and yet remain aware. When this paradox is
experienced one has experienced god.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Deva Abhilash. Deva means divine.
Abhilash means thirst for, a deep deep longing for the divine. It is not
only a desire, because desire is of the mind. Hence I call it thirst. It
is far deeper. You are involved totally in it, your very existence, your
every fibre, every cell is dying without it It is as if a man were lost
in a desert and is feeling thirsty but cannot find water. First it is in
the mind, then slowly he starts feeling it in the body. Then slowly it
becomes so total that he is just thirst and nothing else. Not even the
word 'thirst' is there. He <em>is</em> thirst. That is the meaning of
abhilash.</p><p>In English there is no word to express it exactly, that's why the
explanation is needed. The dictionaries translate it as desire, then
they miss the whole point. In Sanskrit we have many words for different
kinds of desires. Abhilash is the highest, the purest kind of longing,
the longing for the ultimate, the longing to transcend oneself, the
longing to come home, the longing to wake up. It is a divine longing, it
is a divine discontent. And the person who feels it is blessed.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Gyandas. Gyandas means a servant of
wisdom.</p><p>The only thing to be remembered always it that wisdom does not mean
knowledge, it means just the opposite. It means a state of not-knowing.
It means innocence.</p><p>Knowledge in one of the nourishment for the ego, the most vital
nourishment. The more you know, the more you feel that you are somebody.
Even riches don't give that much ego, not even political power gives so
much ego as knowledgeability does. And ego is the barrier to
knowing.</p><p>Ego is a false phenomenon, and if we cling to it we cannot know the
real. The false has to cease for the real to be, and the only way is to
detach yourself from all knowledge. Yes, spiritual, esoteric, all kinds
of knowledge are included in it.</p><p>One should become more and more innocent, childlike. Wondering is
good, looking into existence with no idea of what it is, is good, living
without conclusions is virtue.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name. You have to transform it into a
reality, because this is the only key that unlocks the doors of god's
temple.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Nirguno. Nirguno is one of the names of
god.</p><p>In India we have one thousand names for god. There is one scripture,
Vishnu Sastranath. The whole scripture is devoted only to the names, the
one thousand names of god. But each name has a beauty. It reminds you of
a certain aspect.</p><p>In the East we say that god has one thousand hand, mm? -- just to
signify the vastness, the multi-dimensionality of it, the infinity of
it. Nirguno is one of the names. It means that god is without any
attributes. Literally it means attributeless. That is the fundamental
attribute, that god has not attributes. So whatever we say about him is
going to be only approximately true, it can never be the truth. And
approximately true simply means a beautiful way to say that it is a lie,
because truth is either true or not rue.</p><p>Approximately true is not possible. Either a man is dead or alive; if
you say 'approximately alive' it doesn't mean anything. Either you are
in love with somebody or not. If you say 'approximately in love', that
means nothing. It is simply a polite way of saying, 'Excuse me.'</p><p>The fundamental quality of god is that he has no qualities. That's
why he an manifest in millions of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

forms. He is very liquid, flexible, not static, not like rock but like
water. So you put it in a cup and it becomes the form of the cup, and
you put in in a bottle and it takes the form of the bottle. It is very
non-resistant. It is willing to take any form.</p><p>So on one hand god has no forms and on the other hand all forms are
his. And both these things have to be remembered constantly so that you
don't become attached to any particular form.</p><p>Christ is only a particular form... Buddha also, Krishna also. But
there are people who have become attached to them. Now, there are people
who are attached to Krishna, so obsessed, that they cannot think of any
other manifestation of god. Buddha they will deny, Christ they will
deny, Mohammed they will deny; they will say 'Krishna is the only true
god.' And the same is true about the Christian.</p><p>Just the other day I saw an eighteen-page report against me published
by the German Protestant Church and distributed to all the churches in
Germany saying 'Beware of this man, because this man talks <em>like</em>
Jesus, and that is dangerous. And this man should not be quoted
anywhere, should not be referred to in any church, in any sermon, from
any pulpit.'</p><p>Now what is the fear? The whole fear is that a few Christians may
become attracted, and Christ is the only true messenger, there is no
other messenger, the only begotten son of god. And what about everybody
else? Are all bastards? (laughter)</p><p>In the East we are no so fanatical. All are his, all forms are his.
Everybody is his son, he fathers the whole existence. He it only the
father of Jesus Christ. That would be a very poor god who fathers only
on son and who cannot father Buddha and who cannot father Lao Tzu and
who cannot father Zarathustra. He would be a poor god. When he can
father the whole existence, why make him so poor?</p><p>The report accepts that his man -- it says about me -- is
extraordinary, but that is the danger! He is a human being and Jesus is
god -- that difference has to be remembered.</p><p>Nobody is a human being, everybody is god!</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Veet Parad. Veet means going beyond. Parad
means mercury. Mercury represents the mind. It is a metaphor for the
mind because the mind is very mercurial, changing continuously. It has
nothing permanent in it. Not even an iota remains the same. Not even for
two consecutive moments does the mind remain the same, it is constant
flux.</p><p>Because we are trying to live through the mind and we are trying to
hold onto the mind, which goes on changing, we are constantly in misery.
We cling to it and it slips. It is exactly like mercury.</p><p>If you don't cling to mercury you can keep it in your hand, but if
you close your fist it will slip out, and once it falls onto the floor
it is impossible to collect it again. We are cling to the mind so much.
It goes into fragments and they all go on slipping our of our hand, and
because they go on slipping, we cling even more.</p><p>And the more we cling, the more we are in misery, because all our
efforts to cling are bound to be frustrated. Wee need some eternal
shelter. That shelter is within you, but is is not the mind. It is the
witness if the mind.</p><p>So go beyond the mind, watch the mind, destroy the identity with the
mind and remind yourself again and again 'I am the watcher, I am the
witness of it all. I am not it.' Slowly slowly it sinks into your being
and the forgotten language is remembered again. The day you recognize
absolutely, totally, that you are the witness, you have awakened from
sleep. That awakening brings bliss, benediction.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Sandhano. Sandhano means the ultimate
enquiry. The ultimate enquire is</p><p>'Who am I?' It is not about god, it is not about heaven and hell, it
is not about past lives, it is not about ANYthing, but about
yourself.</p><p>Maharishi Ramana used to give only one meditation to his disciples:
Who am I? Go into this enquiry.</p><p>Watch, search, disentangle yourself from all identifications with the
body and the mind. Slowly slowly you begin to see that you are not the
body. You live in the body, obviously, but the body is only an abode, a
caravanserai, an overnight stay</p><p>-- in the morning you go. And so is the case with the mind. It is
even more fleeting than the body.</p><p>You are beyond both, and that which is beyond both is unchanging. It
is the same from the very beginning , if there was any beginning, and it
will remain the same to the very end, it there is going to be any end.
In fact there is no beginning and no end: your being is eternal. That's
what is meant when I say that you are gods,</p><p>gods who have fallen asleep. The enquiry will wake you up.</p><p>So this is going to be your meditation. Sitting, walking, go on
enquiring 'Who am I?' Not verbally, not intellectually -- existentially.
Watch whether you are the body. When you are hungry, watch -- are you

hungry? When you have a headache watch whether you have the pain or you
are just a watcher who knows that the head is suffering from pain.</p><p>And it is not difficult, slowly slowly to become aware that all these
things are happening around you but you are not <em>any</em> of
them.</p><p>That transcendence it the real experience of truth. And when you know
your inner truth you become capable of knowing the truth of the whole
existence. But the most fundamental step has to be taken inside
yourself.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Premgyan. Premgyan means love is true
wisdom -- not logic, but love, not the head, but the heart. We are all
hung up in the head and we have completely forgotten the heart. To
ignore the heart is ignorance. Not to ignore the heart is wisdom. And
our whole education is rooted in this strategy: it teaches people how to
ignore the heart. It condemns the heart, it condemns feeling, it
appreciates thinking. It is devoted to the god of logic, and logic is
very poor compared to love. Logic is empty, hollow, with no soul in it,
just a shadow.</p><p>It is only love that can fulfil one, it is only love that can give
you authentic growth. So move from the head to the heart. That is the
whole journey of sannyas.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

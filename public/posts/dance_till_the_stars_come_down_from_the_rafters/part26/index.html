It is for reference purposes only.]\nYour name has beautiful meanings. It has two meanings: one from Teutonic and the other from old French. The first meaning is wise, the second meaning is kingly.\nA wise man is naturally kingly. He may be a beggar, but he is still a king. His kingdom is of the within.\nHe has inexhaustible treasures. He has overcome his unconsciousness. That's what wisdom is. Wisdom is not knowledge; it is conquering the unconscious, making your whole being conscious, full of light. Not even islands of darkness are left in it. When your being is full of light whether you have anything or not does not matter, you are kingly.\nSo this will remain your name: Swami Raymond.\nThis is your name: Ma Angela. Angela means a bringer of truth and also a messenger of god. Both meanings are synonymous.\nTo be a messenger of god can only mean bringer of truth because truth is his message. In fact, truth is god and the moment you start living a true life,\nauthentic, you become a messenger. Not in the ordinary sense of carrying a message, but in a very extraordinary sense of being a message. Because the carrier of a message may know nothing of it. He may be just a postman. He may not even be able to read the letter that he is carrying. He may be completely unaware of it. Even doves can do that -- they can carry letters.\nMachines can do it perfectly well -- they carry messages, but they are not messengers.\nA messenger is one who has become the message. His whole being radiates the truth, the beauty, the joy, the celebration that god is. Everybody can become a messenger. It is not something that one is born with, it is something that has to be grown. Everybody brings the seed -- very few people grow it, very few people bring it to flowering. Those who bring it to flowering we call prophets, messengers, Buddhas, Christs, but in fact every person is born with the potential, but only with the potential. You have to make every possible effort to transform it into an actuality.\nBy becoming a sannyasin one commits oneself to this particular work of transforming one's potential into the actual. The day your total potential is translated as actual, is the day of fulfillment -- the day one is freed, liberated. That is the goal of sannyas, that has been the goal of all the religions of the world.\nThis is your name: Swami Antar Herbert. Antar means inner. Herbert means warrior.\nMan can either be a warrior on the outside or a warrior within. The warrior on the outside remains political. His whole effort is ultimately futile. Whatsoever he gains will be lost in death, and whatsoever he gains he gains at great cost because the same energy could have turned inwards. The same energy would have become an inner conquest, an inner glory. The same energy would have created a mastery within your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeing. It would have been possible for a Christ or a Buddha to be born in you but you waste the energy in accumulating unnecessary things: money, power, prestige -- that is all junk. But mind has the tendency to collect junk because mind is basically extrovert. It knows no way to go in.\nWhen you start going in, mind is left behind. It can't go inside with you, it can only go with you outside.\nIt has only one possibility, it is one-dimensional. Mind makes a person a warrior in the political sense.\nMeditation makes him a warrior in the religious sense.\nSo become an inner warrior. Much has to be conquered there. There is much darkness which has to be dispelled, much unconsciousness which has to be transformed, much raw energy which has to be purified.\nIt is a great task, the greatest that life gives you to fulfil. The great challenge is to become a fully grown up person, to come to the crescendo of your potentiality, to reach the highest peak, the Everest of your consciousness. Then one really starts living for the first time. Before that it is all dreaming, not real life.\nBefore that we are in the womb, not yet really born.\nJesus says: Unless a man is born again he will not enter into the kingdom of god. He means this birth, the birth of consciousness in you.\nThis is your name: Ma Veet Hedwig. Veet means surpassing, transcending, going beyond. Hedwig means taking refuge in war.\nThat's the natural animal tendency in man, to take refuge in war. Man hankers for any excuse to fight, to quarrel, to destroy. If he cannot find a real excuse he invents an excuse, but he cannot live without war. In three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought. And what is the achievement? What have they achieved through all this nonsense, violence, bloodshed? Either humanity is insane or very suicidal.\nThe whole past is murderous, and the reason is that we go on listening to the mind. Mind has come to learn a few things, they are of animal heritage. Man has grown out of animals.\nCharles Darwin is true in a certain sense. Man is part of evolution. Maybe he is the highest animal but still he is an animal. And over millions of yours the mind has become conditioned to function in a particular way. It knows only how to fight, it knows only the way of violence. Unless a man learns how to go beyond it he never becomes truly human, he remains animal. This is the quantum leap, when you stop taking refuge in war and you take refuge in a Buddha, you take refuge in a Christ, you take refuge in the awakened one.\nThen you are moving beyond the animal in you and for the first time you are reaching for the human. The human has tremendous beauty, and the human is the beginning of the divine. But the first thing, the first step is to get rid of the animal heritage.\nThe Buddhists have what they call three refuges. The first refuge they call refuge in the Buddha, in the awakened one. That is becoming a disciple, surrendering to a master. And the second refuge they call taking refuge in the commune, taking refuge in the family of the master -- not only surrendering to the master but surrendering to the commune that is happening around the master. And the third they call taking refuge in Dhamma, in the ultimate law of life.…\nA Buddha is a Buddha because he has become one with the ultimate law of life. His commune is a commune of a Buddha because the people who have gathered around him are tying to reach to the ultimate law of life. So the ultimate refuge, the final refuge is in Dhamma, in the universal law. These are the three refuges. Not refuge in war, but refuge in peace, refuge in love, refuge in bliss, refuge in god.\nThis is your new name: Ma Svarajya. Svarajya means independence, freedom.\nFreedom is one of the most significant qualities. In fact, it is out of freedom that all that is great blooms.\nYou can love only if you are free. You can seek truth only if you are free. You can be joyous only if you are free. Hence freedom has to become the very foundation of sannyas.\nI don't want you to belong to the church, to a creed, to a nation, to a race. Those are all ugly things. One should be free of all that nonsense. One should be simply human. There is no need to be a Christian, or Hindu or Mohammedan, and no need to be Indian, an American or a German. One should be free of all\nthese bondages. These are prisons which keep your spirit encaged. Break out!\nAnd it is all up to you. If you cooperate with all these things you are co- operating with your slavery.\nStop co-operating. Nobody else is keeping you in bondage. It is your own unawareness. So become aware of how you co-operate with your slavery, and that very awareness is enough to get rid of all slavery.\nFreedom is your nature. It is not to be achieved. When all slavery disappears one is free, when the slavery is no more present freedom starts welling up within your being. And out of freedom life starts taking on tremendous beauty. Then everything is possible -- love, truth, god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is your new name: Swami Veet Asmitam. Veet means going beyond. Asmitam means the ego.\nThe ego is the only barrier between you and god, between you and love, between you and truth, between you and freedom. There is no other barrier. A single barrier prevents you from all that is great in life. And it is good that there is only one barrier. It can be very easily destroyed because it is not a reality but only our own creation. Because we believe in it, it is there, the moment you withdraw your belief it disappears. Your belief gives life to it, your withdrawal of belief becomes its death.…\nBeing a sannyasin means that now you will not be supporting the ego, slowly slowly you will withdraw.\nAs you become aware you will go on withdrawing yourself from all ego projects, ego trips, ego gems, ego numbers. The day that you are completely free of the ego you are available to god and god is available to you. The moment the ego disappears you become deathless, you become immortal, you become part of\neternity. The moment the ego disappears there is no cause for any misery left, you are blissful. Or to be more exact, you are bliss. You are not there, only bliss is there.\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Atito. Veet means going beyond. Atito means the past.\nOne has to be constantly alert, otherwise the unconscious habit is to go on collecting the past. It is dead, but we go on collecting it. We become too attached to memories, we live in a kind of nostalgia. We live in the past. The past is no more, yet we go on living in the past. It is just a fantasy world, and because of it you cannot live in the herenow and the herenow is the only reality there is.\nAnd the person who lives in the past also lives in the future. The future is a by- product of the past.\nThe future simply means that you would like to repeat a few things of the past which you liked, loved; that is your future. And you would like not to repeat a few things which are nightmarish, painful; that is your future. Your future is your edited past. A few things you have chosen, a few things you have not chosen, and now you are projecting the chosen things into the future. Between these two reality is crushed and completely forgotten. And people go on living either in the past or in the future.\nTo live in the past or in the future is to live asleep. This is what is called the metaphysical sleep. It is a kind of disease. The whole humanity suffers from it, the whole humanity lives in this state of sleep. It is very rarely that a person becomes awakened.\nSannyas is initiation into awakening. And the first step is not to live in the past any more. Whenever your mind starts going into the past bring it back to the present. In the beginning it will be difficult. Just out of old habit mind goes on slipping back. You bring it back again and again and again, and slowly slowly it stops going into the past. And when it stops going into the past it disappears, because mind can exist only in the past or in the future. In the present there is no mind.\nTo be in the present is to be in meditation and to be in the present is to be in god... Man becomes what he really should be, an inexhaustible source of joy, love, truth. He radiates godliness. He becomes evidence that god exists.\nThis is your name: Swami Bhajan. Bhajan means singing in the praise of god. That is going to be your path.\nPraise the Lord. Praise the beauty that surrounds us all, but of which we are unaware. Praise the sunrise, the sunset, the stars, the clouds, the trees, the people, because these are all manifestations of god. Become a song of praise. Look with the eyes of praise. Drop being critical. Being critical is the sure way of missing all that is significant.\nBe creative, don't be critical.\nAnd one can be creative only if one knows how to praise. Out of that very praise creativity arises. You start sharing your being. And when you see the beauty, the splendor of existence, you would like to make it a little more beautiful, just a little more. That's how creativity is. It is an effort to make life a little more beautiful, just a little more. That's how creativity is born. It is an effort to make life a little more beautiful, to bring a little smile, a little laughter, a little joy, a little love into existence, to leave existence a little better than you found it. That's what creativity is all about -- helping, contributing to beautifying existence. And that is true worship.\nBut the critical person only complains, he only finds what is wrong. If you take him to the rose bush he will count the thorns, he will overlook the flowers. And when he has counted thousands of thorns and has become wounded on his hands... It is natural, it is bound to happen when you count thorns, you will be wounded. Then he is very angry, he is in a rage. Now he cannot see flowers. Even if you say that they are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthere he will say \"It is impossible. How amongst thousands of thorns can flowers be born? It is impossible, it is illogical. How out of so many thorns can beautiful roses be born? You must be imagining it.\" He will say, \"You must be fantasizing.\"\nAnd it is very difficult to prove that there are flowers, very difficult to prove that\nthere is beauty, very difficult to prove, almost impossible, that there is love, that there is god.\nA sannyasin lives the life of creativity but not of criticism. He is not negative, he is not searching for some faults. Whatsoever you search you will find.\nIf you search for faults you will find millions. If you search for flowers you will find millions. It depends on you. If you want to live surrounded by thoughts, search for them; if you want to live surrounded by flowers, search for them. And when you are surrounded by flowers sooner or later you will become a flower.\nThere is a synchronicity: when you are surrounded by all that is beautiful, something inside you starts responding, something transpires between you and that which surrounds you.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #27\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2650","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2650 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

violence, bloodshed? Either humanity is insane or very suicidal.</p><p>The whole past is murderous, and the reason is that we go on
listening to the mind. Mind has come to learn a few things, they are of
animal heritage. Man has grown out of animals.</p><p>Charles Darwin is true in a certain sense. Man is part of evolution.
Maybe he is the highest animal but still he is an animal. And over
millions of yours the mind has become conditioned to function in a
particular way. It knows only how to fight, it knows only the way of
violence. Unless a man learns how to go beyond it he never becomes truly
human, he remains animal. This is the quantum leap, when you stop taking
refuge in war and you take refuge in a Buddha, you take refuge in a
Christ, you take refuge in the awakened one.</p><p>Then you are moving beyond the animal in you and for the first time
you are reaching for the human. The human has tremendous beauty, and the
human is the beginning of the divine. But the first thing, the first
step is to get rid of the animal heritage.</p><p>The Buddhists have what they call three refuges. The first refuge
they call refuge in the Buddha, in the awakened one. That is becoming a
disciple, surrendering to a master. And the second refuge they call
taking refuge in the commune, taking refuge in the family of the master
-- not only surrendering to the master but surrendering to the commune
that is happening around the master. And the third they call taking
refuge in Dhamma, in the ultimate law of life.…</p><p>A Buddha is a Buddha because he has become one with the ultimate law
of life. His commune is a commune of a Buddha because the people who
have gathered around him are tying to reach to the ultimate law of life.
So the ultimate refuge, the final refuge is in Dhamma, in the universal
law. These are the three refuges. Not refuge in war, but refuge in
peace, refuge in love, refuge in bliss, refuge in god.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Svarajya. Svarajya means independence,
freedom.</p><p>Freedom is one of the most significant qualities. In fact, it is out
of freedom that all that is great blooms.</p><p>You can love only if you are free. You can seek truth only if you are
free. You can be joyous only if you are free. Hence freedom has to
become the very foundation of sannyas.</p><p>I don't want you to belong to the church, to a creed, to a nation, to
a race. Those are all ugly things. One should be free of all that
nonsense. One should be simply human. There is no need to be a
Christian, or Hindu or Mohammedan, and no need to be Indian, an American
or a German. One should be free of all</p><p>these bondages. These are prisons which keep your spirit encaged.
Break out!</p><p>And it is all up to you. If you cooperate with all these things you
are co- operating with your slavery.</p><p>Stop co-operating. Nobody else is keeping you in bondage. It is your
own unawareness. So become aware of how you co-operate with your
slavery, and that very awareness is enough to get rid of all
slavery.</p><p>Freedom is your nature. It is not to be achieved. When all slavery
disappears one is free, when the slavery is no more present freedom
starts welling up within your being. And out of freedom life starts
taking on tremendous beauty. Then everything is possible -- love, truth,
god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Veet Asmitam. Veet means going beyond.
Asmitam means the ego.</p><p>The ego is the only barrier between you and god, between you and
love, between you and truth, between you and freedom. There is no other
barrier. A single barrier prevents you from all that is great in life.
And it is good that there is only one barrier. It can be very easily
destroyed because it is not a reality but only our own creation. Because
we believe in it, it is there, the moment you withdraw your belief it
disappears. Your belief gives life to it, your withdrawal of belief
becomes its death.…</p><p>Being a sannyasin means that now you will not be supporting the ego,
slowly slowly you will withdraw.</p><p>As you become aware you will go on withdrawing yourself from all ego
projects, ego trips, ego gems, ego numbers. The day that you are
completely free of the ego you are available to god and god is available
to you. The moment the ego disappears you become deathless, you become
immortal, you become part of</p><p>eternity. The moment the ego disappears there is no cause for any
misery left, you are blissful. Or to be more exact, you are bliss. You
are not there, only bliss is there.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Veet Atito. Veet means going beyond. Atito
means the past.</p><p>One has to be constantly alert, otherwise the unconscious habit is to
go on collecting the past. It is dead, but we go on collecting it. We
become too attached to memories, we live in a kind of nostalgia. We live
in the past. The past is no more, yet we go on living in the past. It is
just a fantasy world, and because of it you cannot live in the herenow
and the herenow is the only reality there is.</p><p>And the person who lives in the past also lives in the future. The
future is a by- product of the past.</p><p>The future simply means that you would like to repeat a few things of
the past which you liked, loved; that is your future. And you would like
not to repeat a few things which are nightmarish, painful; that is your
future. Your future is your edited past. A few things you have chosen, a
few things you have not chosen, and now you are projecting the chosen
things into the future. Between these two reality is crushed and
completely forgotten. And people go on living either in the past or in
the future.</p><p>To live in the past or in the future is to live asleep. This is what
is called the metaphysical sleep. It is a kind of disease. The whole
humanity suffers from it, the whole humanity lives in this state of
sleep. It is very rarely that a person becomes awakened.</p><p>Sannyas is initiation into awakening. And the first step is not to
live in the past any more. Whenever your mind starts going into the past
bring it back to the present. In the beginning it will be difficult.
Just out of old habit mind goes on slipping back. You bring it back
again and again and again, and slowly slowly it stops going into the
past. And when it stops going into the past it disappears, because mind
can exist only in the past or in the future. In the present there is no
mind.</p><p>To be in the present is to be in meditation and to be in the present
is to be in god... Man becomes what he really should be, an
inexhaustible source of joy, love, truth. He radiates godliness. He
becomes evidence that god exists.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Bhajan. Bhajan means singing in the praise
of god. That is going to be your path.</p><p>Praise the Lord. Praise the beauty that surrounds us all, but of
which we are unaware. Praise the sunrise, the sunset, the stars, the
clouds, the trees, the people, because these are all manifestations of
god. Become a song of praise. Look with the eyes of praise. Drop being
critical. Being critical is the sure way of missing all that is
significant.</p><p>Be creative, don't be critical.</p><p>And one can be creative only if one knows how to praise. Out of that
very praise creativity arises. You start sharing your being. And when
you see the beauty, the splendor of existence, you would like to make it
a little more beautiful, just a little more. That's how creativity is.
It is an effort to make life a little more beautiful, just a little
more. That's how creativity is born. It is an effort to make life a
little more beautiful, to bring a little smile, a little laughter, a
little joy, a little love into existence, to leave existence a little
better than you found it. That's what creativity is all about --
helping, contributing to beautifying existence. And that is true
worship.</p><p>But the critical person only complains, he only finds what is wrong.
If you take him to the rose bush he will count the thorns, he will
overlook the flowers. And when he has counted thousands of thorns and
has become wounded on his hands... It is natural, it is bound to happen
when you count thorns, you will be wounded. Then he is very angry, he is
in a rage. Now he cannot see flowers. Even if you say that they are

can flowers be born? It is impossible, it is illogical. How out of so
many thorns can beautiful roses be born? You must be imagining it." He
will say, "You must be fantasizing."</p><p>And it is very difficult to prove that there are flowers, very
difficult to prove that</p><p>there is beauty, very difficult to prove, almost impossible, that
there is love, that there is god.</p><p>A sannyasin lives the life of creativity but not of criticism. He is
not negative, he is not searching for some faults. Whatsoever you search
you will find.</p><p>If you search for faults you will find millions. If you search for
flowers you will find millions. It depends on you. If you want to live
surrounded by thoughts, search for them; if you want to live surrounded
by flowers, search for them. And when you are surrounded by flowers
sooner or later you will become a flower.</p><p>There is a synchronicity: when you are surrounded by all that is
beautiful, something inside you starts responding, something transpires
between you and that which surrounds you.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

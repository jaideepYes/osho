It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Anando Dominique. Anando means blissful. Dominique means one who belongs to God.\nEveryone belongs to God -- there is no other way. We are born in God, we live in God, we die in God.\nOur energy is God's energy. God is simply the name of the total energy of existence. But the total is not arithmetical, the total is mysterious. It is not mechanical, it is organic. There is a great difference between the two which needs to be understood.\nThe mechanical, the mathematical total is nothing but the sum total of the parts. The organic total is something more than the sum total of the parts. A great painting is an organic unity. It is not just the sum total of the canvas and the colors. So it is with life.\nGod simply means that existence is more than it appears. It is more than can be measured, it is more than science can ever experiment with. And religion is the search for that more, that mysterious, illusive quality. Hence everybody belongs to God but very few people are aware of the fact. Sannyas is an effort to become\naware of it.\nThe moment you know it on your own -- not because I say, not because Buddha says, not because Jesus 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsays, but because you feel it -- that moment you are transformed. All misery disappears. Life becomes light and a joy, a bliss and a benediction.\nThis is your name: Swami Deva Allen. Deva means divine; allen means cheerful\n-- divine cheerfulness.\nCheerfulness can be of two kinds. One is mundane. One is cheerful because one has just succeeded in something. One has purchased a house that one always wanted to purchase. one has got the woman that one has always fancied. But this kind of cheerfulness is momentary. It comes like a breeze and it goes like a breeze, and you are empty again. In fact you are more in despair than you were before because before there was a hope, now even that hope has gone...\nYou were hoping that being with this woman or this man is going to give meaning and music to your life. That hope, that dream, was very enchanting. It was mesmeric, hypnotic. You were living in that dream, in that projection. Now the woman is there but the meaning has not happened, the music has not arrived.\nSuddenly you are disillusioned, utterly disappointed. The hope is shattered. You will feel more in despair that before.\nThat's what happened with ordinary cheerfulness. Each time you are cheerful you will have to pay for it.\nAnd really one has to pay too much. The cheerfulness is not worth that much. The cheerfulness stays only for moments and then the dark night comes and it is very long.\nBut man is so foolish that he starts hoping again. Maybe some other woman,\nsome other house, some other post, some other power will fulfil him. Again you are running, chasing after shadows -- and the same thing is going to happen.… This is a mundane kind of cheerfulness. This is not worth striving for.\nIf it happens just by the way, enjoy it, but never strive for it. I am not against it, remember. If it happens by the way, if somebody offers you a cup of tea, enjoy it. If somebody invites you to live in a big palace, don't miss (laughter) ... but don't hanker for these things. If they come on the way... A woman comes and holds your hand and it is good, so walk hand in hand. And when she leaves you... you will feel greatly relived, there will be no despair. You will feel the freedom of being alone again.\nI am not saying not to enjoy things that happen on the way, but they are not the goals of life. Yes, a beautiful flower by the side of the road... it suddenly attracts you. stand for a while, smell it, thank god for it, and move on. Don't cling, don't become attached, because if you cling, if you become attached, soon you will be in despair, the flower cannot be forever. Soon it will wither away, soon the petals will fall onto the earth, soon the perfume will disappear and nothing will be left. And by then you will also be in a state of falling apart.\nMundane kind of cheerfulness is good if it comes on its own and you remain aware not to become attached to it. In fact, if you don't desire it you don't become attached to it. Then it is just happening. You are travelling in a train and you become friendly with a person and you chitchat and you share, you commune. Then his station comes and he gets down and you wish him good luck and he wishes you good luck and it is finished there. Mundane life should be taken in theat way.\nBut there is another kind of cheerfulness -- divine cheerfulness. It has nothing to do with anything on the outside. It wells up in you. It is possible only if you go inwards, if you become attuned to your own center, if you become silent, meditative. So silent that thoughts are there no more, so silent that there is no past, no future, but only the present, the purity of now and the utter freshness of here.\nThen you stumble upon a new kind of cheerfulness. It happens for no reason at all, it simply starts flowing within you. It is absurd. You cannot explain to anybody, it is unexplainable. You cannot make people understand what is happening to you, they will think that you are mad. They have always thought\nthat way; because they know only one kind of cheerfulness, which has a cause outside. If you can show the cause, that you have won the lottery, they understand it.\nBut you have not won the lottery, you have not been chosen.\nIf you have got it, you have got the whole world. If you have got it, you have got the very goal of life.\nThe very purpose is fulfilled.\nThis is your name: Swami Devendro. Devendro means god of gods. That's our true reality, that's what we are, we are not less then that. But that is not our awareness, that is not our understanding. We think of ourselves as beggars, begging for this and begging for that, because we have become too engulfed in desires. And the more desires you have, the bigger is you begging bowl. And it is so big that there is no way to full it, in fact it is bottomless. You go on pouring things into it and they go on disappearing.\nWe are dreaming that we are beggars. Desires are dreams. The moment one wakes up in the morning, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\none laughs at oneself, one feels ridiculous: What kind of dreams was one dreaming And how real they appeared when they were there and when you were asleep! The real world had become unreal and the unreal had become the real. This is a miracle that we pass through every night: the unreal becomes the real and the real becomes the unreal, and every morning we recognize it but again we fall into the same trap.\nThe same is true on a higher plane. There is an awakening -- call it enlightenment, samadhi, nirvana, it doesn't matter what words are being used for it, but the essence of it is that there is a higher kind of awakening. When one wakes up from this metaphysical sleep in which we are dreaming, desiring, thinking twenty-four-hours a day, when suddenly a stop comes to all thought and\ndesires, the real dawn has arrived.\nThen for the first time you see how long you have been in a stupid state. You have been almost like a drunkard.\nReal life begins only then, when you know who you are, when you are so alert, so awake, that you recognize your reality. In that moment you are the god of gods, you are the suprememost reality. Nothing is lacking in you, you are perfect. Nothing has ever been lacking in you. Nothing needs to be unproved upon.\nNothing at all needs to be done to you, you are as you should be. Only one thing is missing, you are fast asleep.\nInitiation into sannyas means that you are ready to be awakened, you are saying 'Wake me!', you are surrendering to be awakened. It is a painful process. Dreaming is beautiful. One can have sweet dreams to one's heart's content, you can go on dreaming whatsoever you want to dream, they are your projections.\nWhen for the first time you are taken out of your dreaming state it hurts. Reality is not under your control, your dreams are under your control. With reality you have to be under its control.\nBut the paradox is that in dreams when you think you are a master you are a slave, and when you become a slave, and when you become a slave to reality you become the master.\nThis is your new name: Swami Premendra. Premendra meas god of love.\nLove and god are synonymous, not in the dictionaries of course but in reality, existentially. They are two names for the same phenomenon. God is the name given by the philosophers and love is the name given by the mystics.\nLove is far closer to truth, because god seems to be almost incomprehensible. You hear the word but nothing stirs in your heart. The word 'god' resounds in your ears but there seems to be nor response, no bells ring in your being. The same is not true about love.\nLove is the only experience which is both comprehensible and incomprehensible. A part of it is human and a part of it is divine. A part of it\npenetrates into time and the other part remains beyond in eternity. We can understand a little bit of love, but that little bit becomes the bridge. It may not be easy to define what love is, but everybody understands in an intuitive way what it is.\nThere are many realities which are not definable. For example, time -- nobody has been able to define what it is exactly, but everybody knows what it is and everybody uses time, lives in time, moves in time, feels its flow. but if you force somebody to explain what exactly it is, he finds it is impossible to explain. So is the case with love.\nBut because love can at least be felt, it can become the beginning. Lowly slowly it will take you farther and farther away from the shore into the sea. Slowly slowly... and the ways of love are very gently. It is a gentleman: it will take you slowly slowly, persuade you, seduce you towards the unknown. And you will never become exactly aware of when you have crossed the boundary of the known and have entered into the unknown. That's the beauty of love.\nTo be with a master is to be in a love affair, because between the disciple and the master something very mysterious starts happening. And that is the beginning of god. The presence of something mysterious, miraculous, becomes more and more overwhelming. It starts surrounding you like a cloud, it starts raining on you like flowers.\nAnd if you can take the first step into love one has almost covered half the journey, because there are only two steps. The first is love and the second is death. You start loving and then you have to dissolve yourself. That is death, real death. But if one can die lovingly, if one can dissolve into deep love, one is resurrected immediately. One is born in a new spirit, in a new form. That form is divine, that form is immortal.\nThis is your new name: Ma Premyog. Premyog means the path of love.\nThere are two paths possible, because there are two types of psychoanalysis in the world. The world is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalways divided into tow, everything is divided into two: biologically, psychologically, physiologically. The world is a duality. Light can exist only with darkness. Compassion can exist only with anger, peace can exist only with war. There are like negative and positive poles of electricity.\nMan and woman are biological polarities. Exactly in the same way there are two paths; they are polar opposites but they lead to the same goal. One path is of meditation, awareness. Buddha, Mahavira, Lao Tzu\n-- these are the people who have followed the path of meditation. On the path of meditation love is not discussed at all. There is no reason to discuss love. Not that love does not happen, but is happens only in the end. When the traveller has reached the ultimate goal, then suddenly he finds that he has been following the path of meditation but that like a shadow, a by-product, love has happened.\nBuddha has said: When meditation flowers totally the first indication is that one becomes absolutely loving, one becomes compassionate. When meditation blooms, love spreads like a fragrance.\nOn the path of love, awareness is not discussed at all. Rather just the opposite is needed, a kind of drunkenness, a kind of intoxication. In awareness you try to self-remember, to ask 'Who am I?' In love you try to dissolve, whoever you are, X, Y, Z, it doesn't matter. Who cares? -- It has to be dissolved. So whatever it is, X,Y,Z, is irrelevant. Whatsoever it is, it has to be dissolved, it has to be lost in the thou.\nExistence becomes the thou, the beloved -- call it god -- and the seeker becomes the lover. He starts dissolving himself, he starts disappearing, evaporating.\nWhen the ego evaporates totally, when you are in a state of not-being, you have arrived. And in that moment of arrival you are in for a great surprise. You have dissolved yourself, you have not even left any trace of your ego, and now suddenly you find that you are for the first time a real being. The ego has been dissolved, but that was a false entity. And because it has been dissolved, you have now found your real self, the supreme self.\nBut it comes as a by-product. On the path of love awareness comes as a by- product, and vice versa: on the path of awareness love comes as a by-product.\nLet love be your way, your path. Let love be your very being. Love existence in its multi-dimensionality, it its tremendous beauty. Love people, love trees, clouds, stars. It is not the point what you love, the point is that you love. Become love\nThis is your new name: Swami Anugit. Anugit means a little song, like a haiku, a sonnet.\nMan is very small compared to the universe. The universe is a great orchestra. If you can contribute a little beauty to existence, just a little, that's enough; more is not required, not needed. Existence never asks you for the impossible, it asks only for that which is possible. But man's ego always demands the impossible. Man's ego always wants to become something great.\nA sannyasin has to be just a small song. That's his offering to god. A song means a celebration, a song means a little laughter, cheerfulness, a little dance. Life is so small, so short, so momentary. If we can sing a little song, that's enough.\nA Zen master was invited by the emperor of Japan to address his court. The master came, he stood before the court. Everybody was so expectant, for months they had waited. The emperor was there, the queen and all the court was there and may people were invited; it was a great gathering. The master had never come to any other place to speak. They were sitting silently and the master stood up. There was absolute silence as if they had even stopped breathing. What was he going to say? He simply took out a small flute, played a short note on the flute and left the court!\nThe emperor ran after him, fell at his feet and said 'What about the address?' He said 'This is my address\n-- just a short note. I have said all that I can say, all that can be said. More than that is not possible. Nobody has ever said more that that.'\nSo be a small note on a flute, and life is fulfilled. Don't hanker to be something great, something special, holy, saintly. All that is rubbish. Just be ordinary, so ordinary that nobody ever comes to know of you, so ordinary as if you had never existed. And don't leave any footprints. Just like the birds fly in the sky -- they don't leave any footprints. That's what Jesus means when he says: Blessed are the meek, for theirs is the kingdom of god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #23\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2967","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2967 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

woman,</p><p>some other house, some other post, some other power will fulfil him.
Again you are running, chasing after shadows -- and the same thing is
going to happen.… This is a mundane kind of cheerfulness. This is not
worth striving for.</p><p>If it happens just by the way, enjoy it, but never strive for it. I
am not against it, remember. If it happens by the way, if somebody
offers you a cup of tea, enjoy it. If somebody invites you to live in a
big palace, don't miss (laughter) ... but don't hanker for these things.
If they come on the way... A woman comes and holds your hand and it is
good, so walk hand in hand. And when she leaves you... you will feel
greatly relived, there will be no despair. You will feel the freedom of
being alone again.</p><p>I am not saying not to enjoy things that happen on the way, but they
are not the goals of life. Yes, a beautiful flower by the side of the
road... it suddenly attracts you. stand for a while, smell it, thank god
for it, and move on. Don't cling, don't become attached, because if you
cling, if you become attached, soon you will be in despair, the flower
cannot be forever. Soon it will wither away, soon the petals will fall
onto the earth, soon the perfume will disappear and nothing will be
left. And by then you will also be in a state of falling apart.</p><p>Mundane kind of cheerfulness is good if it comes on its own and you
remain aware not to become attached to it. In fact, if you don't desire
it you don't become attached to it. Then it is just happening. You are
travelling in a train and you become friendly with a person and you
chitchat and you share, you commune. Then his station comes and he gets
down and you wish him good luck and he wishes you good luck and it is
finished there. Mundane life should be taken in theat way.</p><p>But there is another kind of cheerfulness -- divine cheerfulness. It
has nothing to do with anything on the outside. It wells up in you. It
is possible only if you go inwards, if you become attuned to your own
center, if you become silent, meditative. So silent that thoughts are
there no more, so silent that there is no past, no future, but only the
present, the purity of now and the utter freshness of here.</p><p>Then you stumble upon a new kind of cheerfulness. It happens for no
reason at all, it simply starts flowing within you. It is absurd. You
cannot explain to anybody, it is unexplainable. You cannot make people
understand what is happening to you, they will think that you are mad.
They have always thought</p><p>that way; because they know only one kind of cheerfulness, which has
a cause outside. If you can show the cause, that you have won the
lottery, they understand it.</p><p>But you have not won the lottery, you have not been chosen.</p><p>If you have got it, you have got the whole world. If you have got it,
you have got the very goal of life.</p><p>The very purpose is fulfilled.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Devendro. Devendro means god of gods. That's
our true reality, that's what we are, we are not less then that. But
that is not our awareness, that is not our understanding. We think of
ourselves as beggars, begging for this and begging for that, because we
have become too engulfed in desires. And the more desires you have, the
bigger is you begging bowl. And it is so big that there is no way to
full it, in fact it is bottomless. You go on pouring things into it and
they go on disappearing.</p><p>We are dreaming that we are beggars. Desires are dreams. The moment
one wakes up in the morning, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

one dreaming And how <em>real</em> they appeared when they were there
and when you were asleep! The real world had become unreal and the
unreal had become the real. This is a miracle that we pass through every
night: the unreal becomes the real and the real becomes the unreal, and
every morning we recognize it but again we fall into the same trap.</p><p>The same is true on a higher plane. There is an awakening -- call it
enlightenment, samadhi, nirvana, it doesn't matter what words are being
used for it, but the essence of it is that there is a higher kind of
awakening. When one wakes up from this metaphysical sleep in which we
are dreaming, desiring, thinking twenty-four-hours a day, when suddenly
a stop comes to all thought and</p><p>desires, the real dawn has arrived.</p><p>Then for the first time you see how long you have been in a stupid
state. You have been almost like a drunkard.</p><p>Real life begins only then, when you know who you are, when you are
so alert, so awake, that you recognize your reality. In that moment you
are the god of gods, you are the suprememost reality. Nothing is lacking
in you, you are perfect. Nothing has ever been lacking in you. Nothing
needs to be unproved upon.</p><p>Nothing at all needs to be done to you, you are as you should be.
Only one thing is missing, you are fast asleep.</p><p>Initiation into sannyas means that you are ready to be awakened, you
are saying 'Wake me!', you are surrendering to be awakened. It is a
painful process. Dreaming is beautiful. One can have sweet dreams to
one's heart's content, you can go on dreaming whatsoever you want to
dream, they are your projections.</p><p>When for the first time you are taken out of your dreaming state it
hurts. Reality is not under your control, your dreams are under your
control. With reality you have to be under <em>its</em> control.</p><p>But the paradox is that in dreams when you think you are a master you
are a slave, and when you become a slave, and when you become a slave to
reality you become the master.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Premendra. Premendra meas god of
love.</p><p>Love and god are synonymous, not in the dictionaries of course but in
reality, existentially. They are two names for the same phenomenon. God
is the name given by the philosophers and love is the name given by the
mystics.</p><p>Love is far closer to truth, because god seems to be almost
incomprehensible. You hear the word but nothing stirs in your heart. The
word 'god' resounds in your ears but there seems to be nor response, no
bells ring in your being. The same is not true about love.</p><p>Love is the only experience which is both comprehensible and
incomprehensible. A part of it is human and a part of it is divine. A
part of it</p><p>penetrates into time and the other part remains beyond in eternity.
We can understand a little bit of love, but that little bit becomes the
bridge. It may not be easy to define what love is, but everybody
understands in an intuitive way what it is.</p><p>There are many realities which are not definable. For example, time
-- nobody has been able to define what it is exactly, but everybody
knows what it is and everybody uses time, lives in time, moves in time,
feels its flow. but if you force somebody to explain what exactly it is,
he finds it is impossible to explain. So is the case with love.</p><p>But because love can at least be felt, it can become the beginning.
Lowly slowly it will take you farther and farther away from the shore
into the sea. Slowly slowly... and the ways of love are very gently. It
is a gentleman: it will take you slowly slowly, persuade you, seduce you
towards the unknown. And you will never become exactly aware of when you
have crossed the boundary of the known and have entered into the
unknown. That's the beauty of love.</p><p>To be with a master is to be in a love affair, because between the
disciple and the master something very mysterious starts happening. And
that is the beginning of god. The presence of something mysterious,
miraculous, becomes more and more overwhelming. It starts surrounding
you like a cloud, it starts raining on you like flowers.</p><p>And if you can take the first step into love one has almost covered
half the journey, because there are only two steps. The first is love
and the second is death. You start loving and then you have to dissolve
yourself. That is death, real death. But if one can die lovingly, if one
can dissolve into deep love, one is resurrected immediately. One is born
in a new spirit, in a new form. That form is divine, that form is
immortal.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Premyog. Premyog means the path of
love.</p><p>There are two paths possible, because there are two types of
psychoanalysis in the world. The world is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

biologically, psychologically, physiologically. The world is a duality.
Light can exist only with darkness. Compassion can exist only with
anger, peace can exist only with war. There are like negative and
positive poles of electricity.</p><p>Man and woman are biological polarities. Exactly in the same way
there are two paths; they are polar opposites but they lead to the same
goal. One path is of meditation, awareness. Buddha, Mahavira, Lao
Tzu</p><p>-- these are the people who have followed the path of meditation. On
the path of meditation love is not discussed at all. There is no reason
to discuss love. Not that love does not happen, but is happens only in
the end. When the traveller has reached the ultimate goal, then suddenly
he finds that he has been following the path of meditation but that like
a shadow, a by-product, love has happened.</p><p>Buddha has said: When meditation flowers totally the first indication
is that one becomes absolutely loving, one becomes compassionate. When
meditation blooms, love spreads like a fragrance.</p><p>On the path of love, awareness is not discussed at all. Rather just
the opposite is needed, a kind of drunkenness, a kind of intoxication.
In awareness you try to self-remember, to ask 'Who am I?' In love you
try to dissolve, whoever you are, X, Y, Z, it doesn't matter. Who cares?
-- It has to be dissolved. So whatever it is, X,Y,Z, is irrelevant.
Whatsoever it is, it has to be dissolved, it has to be lost in the
thou.</p><p>Existence becomes the thou, the beloved -- call it god -- and the
seeker becomes the lover. He starts dissolving himself, he starts
disappearing, evaporating.</p><p>When the ego evaporates totally, when you are in a state of
not-being, you have arrived. And in that moment of arrival you are in
for a great surprise. You have dissolved yourself, you have not even
left any trace of your ego, and now suddenly you find that you are for
the first time a real being. The ego has been dissolved, but that was a
false entity. And because it has been dissolved, you have now found your
real self, the supreme self.</p><p>But it comes as a by-product. On the path of love awareness comes as
a by- product, and vice versa: on the path of awareness love comes as a
by-product.</p><p>Let love be your way, your path. Let love be your very being. Love
existence in its multi-dimensionality, it its tremendous beauty. Love
people, love trees, clouds, stars. It is not the point <em>what</em> you
love, the point is that you love. Become love</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Anugit. Anugit means a little song, like
a haiku, a sonnet.</p><p>Man is very small compared to the universe. The universe is a great
orchestra. If you can contribute a little beauty to existence, just a
little, that's enough; more is not required, not needed. Existence never
asks you for the impossible, it asks only for that which is possible.
But man's ego always demands the impossible. Man's ego always wants to
become something great.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be just a small song. That's his offering to god.
A song means a celebration, a song means a little laughter,
cheerfulness, a little dance. Life is so small, so short, so momentary.
If we can sing a little song, that's enough.</p><p>A Zen master was invited by the emperor of Japan to address his
court. The master came, he stood before the court. Everybody was so
expectant, for months they had waited. The emperor was there, the queen
and all the court was there and may people were invited; it was a great
gathering. The master had never come to any other place to speak. They
were sitting silently and the master stood up. There was absolute
silence as if they had even stopped breathing. What was he going to say?
He simply took out a small flute, played a short note on the flute and
left the court!</p><p>The emperor ran after him, fell at his feet and said 'What about the
address?' He said 'This is my address</p><p>-- just a short note. I have said all that I can say, all that can be
said. More than that is not possible. Nobody has ever said more that
that.'</p><p>So be a small note on a flute, and life is fulfilled. Don't hanker to
be something great, something special, holy, saintly. All that is
rubbish. Just be ordinary, so ordinary that nobody ever comes to know of
you, so ordinary as if you had never existed. And don't leave any
footprints. Just like the birds fly in the sky -- they don't leave any
footprints. That's what Jesus means when he says: Blessed are the meek,
for theirs is the kingdom of god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

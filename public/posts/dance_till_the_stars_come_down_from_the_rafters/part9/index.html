Anand means bliss, blissful. And Dolphin is a good name...(laughter) It represents intelligence. There is every possibility that dolphins have better intelligence than human beings. At least they have a bigger brain\nGood, Dolphin. Look here! (much laughter) Good, Raje.\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Kristen. Anand means bliss. Kristen means a follower of Christ.\nBliss is the essential religion. Whether you follow Christ or Buddha or Lao Tzu, it doesn't matter: if you are blissful you are following all the awakened ones, all the Christs, all the Buddhas, all the Krishnas. If you are not blissful you can only be a Christian, a Buddhist and a Hindu -- but that is pseudo, that is not true.\nThere are millions of Christians. They are not concerned at all with Christ or Christ-consciousness, they have no inner search, no enquiry into the truth. Their religion is formal, accidental; they are born in a Christian family so they are Christians. That is not the way to be a Christian.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are becoming a Christian for the first time, Christian in the sense that now you will be moving more and more towards bliss, love, truth. And these are the qualities that prepare the ground for god to descend in to you.\nThis is your name: Swami Antar Ulrich. Antar means the inner, ulrich means rule -- one who rules over his own inner world.\nIt is easy to rule the outer, it is easy to become an Alexander or a Napoleon. However difficult it appears, it is not so difficult. But to be a Buddha is only for the very few because it is climbing the highest peak of consciousness and the journey is arduous, risky, hazardous. And the fight is not with anybody else but with your own unconsciousness, with your own darkness, with your own unintelligence.\nThe moment one conquers one's unconsciousness and becomes totally conscious is the moment of the greatest experience possible. One can call it the experience of god or of nirvana or of enlightenment. Those are all just ways to describe the indescribable.\n-- What is the meaning of your name? -- Mali.\n-- Gardener.\n-- Who has given it to you?\n-- Myself...\n-- Mm mm. That's good!\nThis will be your name: Swami Prem Mali. Prem means love and mali means gardener.\nLove has to be grown. Seeds are available, the soil is available, everything is available -- just the gardener is fast asleep. Hence seeds are rotting and the soil is becoming a desert. Otherwise it can become full of roses, roses of love and bliss and truth and joy. But the gardener is asleep, the only thing missing is that the gardener is asleep. The gardener is there but not awake, so whether he is there or he is not, makes no difference. An asleep gardener and no gardener are the same. The gardener has to be awakened.\nYou have chosen a beautiful name... but you have chosen a name which will now need much effort to make it a reality. Go deeper into meditations so you can become more aware.\nThis is your name: Ma Prem Inge. Prem means love. In Norse mythology Inge is the name of the goddess of peace.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen both happen together then something really valuable happens. They can happen separately, but then it is not much. One can be peaceful without love. That's what monks and nuns have been doing down the ages, renouncing the world. Renouncing the world means renouncing all possibilities of love, all situations where love can arise, escaping from all those contacts. It is easy to be peaceful without love, there is nothing to disturb one.\nLove creates the greatest disturbance, chaos, but only out of chaos are stars born. So love cannot be rejected simply. It releases great energy, and if you are not capable of transforming it into creativity it can become destructive, it does become destructive. Either make it a great creative explosion or it is bound to turn sour and bitter and poisonous. It is going to eat your heart.\nSo people have become afraid of love and for centuries they have been escaping\nit, choosing peace against love -- but that peace is dull, dead, sad. It cannot sing, it cannot dance, it cannot celebrate. There is nothing to celebrate, nothing to dance for, nothing to sing about, because all dance, all song, all celebration is rooted in the energy of love.\nLove is also possible without peace, but then it drives you crazy. Again and again it brings you to the brink of insanity, of suicide. It is playing with fire.\nBut when both are together something tremendously beautiful happens. When love has peace at the very center of it, it is no more destructive, it is no more feverish, it is no more insane. It is healthy, whole, creative. It is a blessing to oneself and to others. And when peace is rooted in love there is great rejoicing.\nThat very rejoicing is god.\nMy effort here is to help my sannyasins to grow these two apparently diametrically opposite energies together. It is a great experiment, more difficult than all other religious experiments that have been made up to now, more complex too. But if one succeeds one reaches to the highest peak. And the potential for success is there in everyone, it just has not been tapped rightly.\nThis is your name: Ma Jeannine. It is a beautiful name; it means the beloved disciple and that's what you have to become.\nIt is easy to be a student, it is difficult to be a disciple. The student is interested only in the superficial, he is not committed. The disciple is committed, the disciple is ready to gamble all that he has for something unknown, for something of the beyond. Only a gambler can be a disciple. The businesslike mind cannot be a disciple. It is always calculating, cunning, always thinking in terms of getting more and giving less. the disciple is one who gives all, without any conditions, unconditionally, one who surrenders for the sheer joy of surrendering. But then great things start happening to the disciple because he becomes open, absolutely open to the master. He becomes the beloved, he becomes capable of absorbing the love of the master. Not only his love, but his being also starts overlapping the being of the disciple. And that's real communion. In the East we call it satsang: when the master's being overlaps the being of the disciple. Ultimately a moment comes when the disciple and the master become one; that is the state of the devotee. But being a disciple is a necessary step towards that ultimate state.\nSo let your name become a reality for you... and much more, much more that you can ever imagine, much more than you can conceive is going to happen. But you have to be available, you are not to hold back anything.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- Two more days.\n-- Good. Next time come for a longer period. But things will continue wherever you are, just continue to meditate.\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Asho. Veet means going beyond; asho means hope -- going beyond hope.\nHope is a disguised form of desire. And unless one drops all desiring in all forms, disguised, one cannot attain to one's own reality. When we hope we project the future, when we hope, we hope in the future.\nNobody can hope in the present. Hope brings in the future, hope is the future. And it is behind hope that the mind goes on playing thousands of games, it goes on deceiving you. It goes on promising you: tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.… And tomorrow never comes, it can't come in the very nature of things. It is always today.\nThere is no other time then now. All other times are just mind-fabrications, fantasies. To be in meditation means to be in the present, and to be in the present one has to cut the root of all desire, the root 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nof all hope.\nRemember, by cutting the root of hope you don't become hopeless, because when there is no hope there is no possibility of hopelessness either. They both disappear. Hopelessness is possible only if hope is there, it is a by-product of hope. When hope is not, hopelessness also is not. And your whole sky, inner sky,\nis clear of all the clouds of hopes, of hopelessness, of desires, of frustrations, of expectations. Your whole sky is simply unclouded and the sun shines forth -- the sun of truth, the sun of your own being.\nThis will be your new name: Swami Shantamo.\nShantamo means the silent one and this is going to be the device for you: be more and more silent.\nSpeak less, become telegraphic. Speak only that which is absolutely necessary, delete all that is unnecessary, superfluous. And whenever you can find time, as many times in the day as possible, even in small gaps -- ten minutes, fifteen minutes -- just close your eyes and sit silently.\nSitting silently is going to be your device. Slowly slowly things will calm down and the mind will start evaporating. And one day, one is left without the mind. Then joy explodes. Time disappears, eternity appears. Then one is neither birth nor life nor death, one is something transcendental. With the transcendental comes liberation -- liberation from all misery, from all pain, from all ignorance, from all stupidity.\nThis is you new name: Swami Chaitanyo. Chaitanyo means consciousness -- and that has to be the key for you, the golden key that opens the door of god.\nBecome more and more conscious of all that you do, of all that you think, of all that you desire, imagine, dream. Just remember that you have to be conscious of everything. Walking , be conscious of it, eating, be conscious of it, thinking, go on watching what thoughts are passing in the mind. One day you will be surprised, when you have learned the knack of it, it continues even in sleep. You go on watching the dreams, you know what kind of dreams are passing by and you know that they are dreams.\nThat day, when one can watch one's own dreams, is of a great transformation. From that moment onwards you are a new being. Then you enter into the world of reality. By watching dreams, thoughts, desires, slowly slowly we become disidentified with all that we are watching, we become the witness. And that witness is the ultimate reality.\nThis is your new name: Swami Sudhiro. Sudhiro means the wise one.\nWisdom is our nature. Ignorance is only an accident, it is like falling ill. Health is your nature, illness is only an accident; hence illness can be cured and your health starts flowing again. Illness is only a little disturbance in the flow of your health. So ignorance is a little disturbance in the flow of your wisdom. And the point to understand is that knowledge is the root cause of the creation of ignorance.\nThe more you know, the more ignorant you become, because you start flowing to the superficial knowledge and you start forgetting your real wisdom. You cling to the information given by others, which is all borrowed. And truth can never be borrowed, it has to be one's own.\nSo whatsoever one knows about truth is not truth. But knowing about truth can give you the feeling as if you know, and you can cling to it. Hence the knowledgeable people are the most ignorant people in the world.\nIf one wants to destroy one's ignorance one has to destroy one's knowledge. And that's my whole effort here, to help you drop your knowledge. In that very dropping, ignorance disappears and wisdom wells up --\nit starts flowing again. And that flow of wisdom is freedom, is bliss, is benediction.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #10\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2140","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2140 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

disciple and the master become one; that is the state of the devotee.
But being a disciple is a necessary step towards that ultimate
state.</p><p>So let your name become a reality for you... and much more, much more
that you can ever imagine, much more than you can conceive is going to
happen. But you have to be available, you are not to hold back
anything.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Two more days.</p><p>-- Good. Next time come for a longer period. But things will continue
wherever you are, just continue to meditate.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Veet Asho. Veet means going beyond; asho
means hope -- going beyond hope.</p><p>Hope is a disguised form of desire. And unless one drops all desiring
in all forms, disguised, one cannot attain to one's own reality. When we
hope we project the future, when we hope, we hope <em>in</em> the
future.</p><p>Nobody can hope in the present. Hope brings in the future, hope
<em>is</em> the future. And it is behind hope that the mind goes on
playing thousands of games, it goes on deceiving you. It goes on
promising you: tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.… And tomorrow never comes,
it can't come in the very nature of things. It is always today.</p><p>There is no other time then now. All other times are just
mind-fabrications, fantasies. To be in meditation means to be in the
present, and to be in the present one has to cut the root of all desire,
the root 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

because when there is no hope there is no possibility of hopelessness
either. They both disappear. Hopelessness is possible only if hope is
there, it is a by-product of hope. When hope is not, hopelessness also
is not. And your whole sky, inner sky,</p><p>is clear of all the clouds of hopes, of hopelessness, of desires, of
frustrations, of expectations. Your whole sky is simply unclouded and
the sun shines forth -- the sun of truth, the sun of your own being.</p><p>This will be your new name: Swami Shantamo.</p><p>Shantamo means the silent one and this is going to be the device for
you: be more and more silent.</p><p>Speak less, become telegraphic. Speak only that which is absolutely
necessary, delete all that is unnecessary, superfluous. And whenever you
can find time, as many times in the day as possible, even in small gaps
-- ten minutes, fifteen minutes -- just close your eyes and sit
silently.</p><p>Sitting silently is going to be your device. Slowly slowly things
will calm down and the mind will start evaporating. And one day, one is
left without the mind. Then joy explodes. Time disappears, eternity
appears. Then one is neither birth nor life nor death, one is something
transcendental. With the transcendental comes liberation -- liberation
from all misery, from all pain, from all ignorance, from all
stupidity.</p><p>This is you new name: Swami Chaitanyo. Chaitanyo means consciousness
-- and that has to be the key for you, the golden key that opens the
door of god.</p><p>Become more and more conscious of all that you do, of all that you
think, of all that you desire, imagine, dream. Just remember that you
have to be conscious of everything. Walking , be conscious of it,
eating, be conscious of it, thinking, go on watching what thoughts are
passing in the mind. One day you will be surprised, when you have
learned the knack of it, it continues even in sleep. You go on watching
the dreams, you know what kind of dreams are passing by and you know
that they are dreams.</p><p>That day, when one can watch one's own dreams, is of a great
transformation. From that moment onwards you are a new being. Then you
enter into the world of reality. By watching dreams, thoughts, desires,
slowly slowly we become disidentified with all that we are watching, we
become the witness. And that witness is the ultimate reality.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Sudhiro. Sudhiro means the wise one.</p><p>Wisdom is our nature. Ignorance is only an accident, it is like
falling ill. Health is your nature, illness is only an accident; hence
illness can be cured and your health starts flowing again. Illness is
only a little disturbance in the flow of your health. So ignorance is a
little disturbance in the flow of your wisdom. And the point to
understand is that knowledge is the root cause of the creation of
ignorance.</p><p>The more you know, the more ignorant you become, because you start
flowing to the superficial knowledge and you start forgetting your real
wisdom. You cling to the information given by others, which is all
borrowed. And truth can never be borrowed, it has to be one's own.</p><p>So whatsoever one knows about truth is not truth. But knowing about
truth can give you the feeling as if you know, and you can cling to it.
Hence the knowledgeable people are the most ignorant people in the
world.</p><p>If one wants to destroy one's ignorance one has to destroy one's
knowledge. And that's my whole effort here, to help you drop your
knowledge. In that very dropping, ignorance disappears and wisdom wells
up --</p><p>it starts flowing again. And that flow of wisdom is freedom, is
bliss, is benediction.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

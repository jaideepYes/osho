It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Ghira, for her daughter) -- This is her name: Ma Deva Renu. Deva means divine, renu means dust --\ndivine dust.\nMan is both: from the outside he is dust, from the inside he is divine. If we just look from the outside we can never find the divine. The divine has to be found with closed eyes inside.\n(To Itil) -- Come here... come here. What is the meaning of Itil?\n-- It is a Persian name... from Mullah Nasrudin country.\n-- Mm! That's good, but what does it mean?\n-- But I'm an American citizen now.\n-- What does it means?\n-- Itil was a great king that started an empire.\n-- Mm mm. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n-- ... which became Jewish and later became Arab, Muslim.\n-- Mm mm. Good. And now he is becoming a sanyasin! (much laughter). Close your eyes. Good, Itil, come here.\nThis is your name: Swami Deva Itil. Deva means divine and itil is a treat king -- divine king.\nAll the masters of all the ages, have declared that everybody is born a divine king, but is utterly unaware of the fact. Not knowing our own inner world, we remain unaware of our kingdom. And because we are unaware of the kingdom that belongs to us, that is forever ours, we go on desiring small things, begging for small things. we are dreaming that we are beggars. The moment one wakes up, one is in for a great surprise: one finds one is not a beggar, one is a king. That's the whole purpose of meditation, to make you aware of your kingdom, to make you aware of your highest potential. And once you start becoming aware then the journey is not difficult. Only the first step is the most difficult. Just a little awakening and then the sleep is almost gone, then things become easier.\nSannyas is an effort to wake up. Tossing and turning in your sleep -- that's what sannyas is. From the very distance you have heard that you are a king, even in your sleep it is resounding. But unless you are awake it cannot be a reality, it cannot be a realization.\n(To Wilfred) -- This is your name: Swami Veet Wilfred. Veet means beyond, Wilfred means will.\nMan has to go beyond his will so that he can become part of the divine will. One has to drop one's own will, it is the whole trouble. Once our will is dissolved then god starts functioning through us. Then there is no misery, no anxiety; one\nis utterly relaxed. There is no problem. All problems arise out of your will, because will means fighting with the whole. It is struggle, and struggle is bound to bring tension. And you are doomed to fail; hence however hard one fights one knows deep down in the heart, deep down somewhere that it is futile, one cannot succeed against the whole. One can succeed only with the whole, not against the whole.\nSannyas means surrendering your will, going beyond it. And the moment you surrender your will, all is yours. Suddenly the whole universe opens its doors for you, all the mysteries become available to you, all the secrets are handed over to you, all the keys. The paradox is: in surrendering the will you become the master, and in keeping the will and fighting for it, you will remain a slave.\n(To Christer) -- -- This is your name: Swami Prem Christer. Prem means love. Christer means a follower of Christ.\nLove is the message of all the Christs. I am not using the singular word 'Christ', I am using the plural\n'Christ' because to me Jesus is only one of the Christs. Lao Tzu is also a Christ, Buddha too, Mohammed, Zarathustra, Socrates -- these are all Christs. Christ is a state of ultimate consciousness, just as Buddhahood is: Christ is synonymous with Buddhahood.\nAnd the message of all the Christs is love. It is through love that reality is revealed. It is through love that we become aware of the tremendous beauty of existence. It is through love, and only through love, that one enters into the temple of god.\n(To Hans) -- -- This is your name: Swami Jivan Hans. Jivan means life. Hans means a gift of god.\nLife is a gift of god -- never forget it. Everybody has forgotten it. Nobody is thankful to god for life. On the contrary people are continuously complaining. They are not grateful. Such a precious gift, such an incomparable, unique gift, but people are so stupid that they can't appreciate it. They take it for granted, as if it were their right. It is not our right, we cannot claim it. We don't deserve it, we are not worthy of it. It is given to us not because we deserve it, but because god cannot resist the temptation of giving it. He has to share it: he is overflowing with life energy, he does not know what to do with it, hence he goes on\nshowering it. Worthy, unworthy, deserving, undeserving, sinners, saints; it does not matter, god goes on giving. That is his intrinsic nature. He gives because he has so much that if he does not give it it will become a burden on him. He is like a cloud full of rainwater, it has to rain. It will rain on the stones, it will rain on the rocks, it will rain anywhere. It has to rain.\nTo understand it is to be religious. This understanding brings a shift in your consciousness. Then you are no more complaining, then you are tremendously grateful -- and that gratefulness is prayer.\n(To John) -- This is your new name: Swami Gyandeva. Gyandeva means the god of Wisdom. We are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nborn with infinite wisdom but we go on losing our wisdom in collecting knowledge. Knowledge is rubbish, it is mundane, it is trivia. We go on giving away the precious for the absolutely meaningless.\nTo be a sannyasin means an effort to reclaim your lost wisdom. And the only way is: become ignorant again of so-called knowledge. Unburden yourself of knowledge, unlearn it, and the moment all knowledge has been unlearned, wisdom starts welling up in you. It is your intrinsic nature. It has not to be learned, it has not to be searched for, you have not to go outside seeking for it. It is your innermost core of being.\nMeditation means unlearning knowledge so that wisdom can assert life again.\n(To Kurt) This is your new name: Swami Ramraj. Ramraj means the kingdom of god.\nJesus says that the kingdom of god is within you. That is the essential teaching of all the wakened ones: don't go anywhere, don't seek and search outside yourself, you will not find anything there. You will remain empty, unfulfilled, frustrated, because the real kingdom, the real riches are part of your interiority, of your subjectivity, of your soul.\nOrdinary humanity is extrovert. That's exactly the meaning of the worldly man: extrovert. By becoming a sannyasin you will be moving in exactly the opposite direction: it is introversion. Not that I am against the world, but not to know oneself is very dangerous. Once you know yourself you can roam all over the world sharing your joy and living your joy; then there is no problem. If you are rooted in your being you can be as extrovert as you want, nothing can harm you. You can live in the marketplace but your meditation will remain undisturbed.\nBut the first, the foremost thing is to settle within, to be acquainted with your inner reality. And my whole effort is to turn you in, in every possible way, to help you to go in.\nI cannot give you the truth, nobody can, but I can indicate where it is to be found. It is not to be found on the moon, it is not to be found on Everest; it is to be found just within you. Learn to close your eyes and see within.\n(To Marilyn) -- This is your new name: Ma Prabhato. Prabhato means the early dawn.\nSannyas is the early dawn. It is an end and a beginning, it is a death and a rebirth. it is the interval between the two.\nYou will have to drop the past, you will have to drop clinging to the old, whatsoever it is, good or bad. it is not a question of choosing the good and dropping the bad: the past has to be dropped totally. One has to disconnect oneself from the past; only then toes the rebirth become possible, only then does the sun rise.\nThe sun is always ready to rise, it is just that we go on clinging to the past, and the past is nothing but a dark night.\nEnough is enough. Now drop the old and let the new be born in you. And always remember: Sannyas is not something like an event, it is a process. It is not that one day you become a sannyasin and then it is finished. It is like breathing: you have to go on breathing continuously.\nSannyas is a process not an event, so you will have to go on dropping the past continuously, because every day we accumulating the past. Today you can drop it; again tomorrow, twenty-four hours will have passed and those twenty-four hours will be there and you can cling to them.\nSannyas means the awareness that 'now, I am not going to cling to that which is no more. The moment is gone, it is gone, I am finished with it and that is that... a full pint, no looking back.; And then a great miracle happens: when you don't look back, for the first time you become aware of the present, and the beauty of it.\nThat beauty is god. Now is another name for god.\n(To Renee) -- This is your new name: Ma Nisargo. Nisargo means nature. Be more and more natural from now non.\nThe society imposes artificiality on everybody. It calls it culture, civilization, education. It gives it big names, but the real thing is that it makes you artificial. It teaches you to repress nature.\nMy whole effort is to help you to be natural again, because it is only through nature that one can come to god. The more artificial one becomes, the farther away one is from god. So now remember it: you will need civilization, culture, education, but don't get identified with them They are games. One can play them because one has to live in a society where everybody is living those games, but remember that they are games and they are not realities. Watch so that you don't get identified with them, and whenever they are not needed be natural.\n'Nature' has to be the key word for you. And that is going to help you immensely, that will bring the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nradical change needed.\n(To Lilly) -- This is your new name: Ma Nirvano. Nirvano means cessation of the ego, dropping of the ego. And that's essentially what religion is.\nThe irreligious person lives in the ego; he thinks \"I am separate from the whole.\" The religious person lives egolessly; he knows that \"I am part of the whole, an intrinsic part of the whole, not at all separate.\" To know it -- that \"I am not\nseparate from the whole\" brings tremendous freedom. It brings vastness. The whole sky is yours. You are no more identified with a small, very small ego.\nWe are vast but we have become confined in small spaces, that's why there is so much misery. This misery is natural. It is like forcing and ocean into a dewdrop. We are birds with wings who need to have the whole sky, but we are encaged. Nobody is encaging us, the irony is that we go on encaging ourselves. We are the prison and we are the prisoner and we are the gaoler-there is nobody else.\nThat's why the mystics call it a dream: it is a dream. In a dream you are all. The moment you wake up you find that this is strange: \"I was chased by a lion, but I was the lion and I was chased and I was the spectator too, the witness to the whole thing.\" This is how life is, like a dream.\nNow it is time... If children play with stupid games they can be forgiven, they need to go astray, they need to commit many mistakes. But as you grow older you cannot be forgiven. And the ego is the most stupid game because it is against reality, it is against god.\nSannyas simply means becoming aware of the fact that the ego is a false entity, our own creation, our own projection... and the we are caught in it. It is like a spider's web: the spider brings it out from itself. We go on creating our own prisons out of ourselves -- our imagination, our desire, our memory, our ambition, our jealousy. And they all go on spinning subtle structures around us. The whole structure is called the ego.\nWhatsoever the mind does, the whole work of the mind is called the ego.\nFrom this very moment become aware of it, and slowly slowly get out of it. It is not going to be difficult to get out of it; and it is time to.\nBefore one leaves the body one should be able to leave the ego. Then death becomes tremendously beautiful, it becomes a door to the divine. Then it is no more ugly, no more painful, on the contrary, it is a blessing, a benediction.\n(To Michael)\nThis is your new name: Swami Sudas. Sudas means the surrendered one -- and that is going to be your path. Be utterly surrendered to existence; no fight any more, no conflict any more, no more private goals of your own. Let the whole\npossess you, let the whole guide you. Then wherever it takes you is good and whatsoever it makes out of you is good.\nMan alone cannot do right, he will only do wrong. Right happens only when man allows god to function through him.\nSo allow god to function through you. Trust. If this whole universe is going so beautifully, why can't it take care of you? Why should you be worried, anxious about yourself? No rose bush is worried, no bird, no animal, no star. It is just the stupid human mind that creates so many worries -- and the simple reason is that it thinks it is separate. Naturally, if you are separate then the whole worry is yours; if you are not separate then the whole will take care.\nJesus says: 'Thy kingdom come, they will be done'. Let that be your prayer too.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #6\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2604","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2604 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

can't appreciate it. They take it for granted, as if it were their
right. It is not our right, we cannot claim it. We don't deserve it, we
are not worthy of it. It is given to us not because we deserve it, but
because god cannot resist the temptation of giving it. He has to share
it: he is overflowing with life energy, he does not know what to do with
it, hence he goes on</p><p>showering it. Worthy, unworthy, deserving, undeserving, sinners,
saints; it does not matter, god goes on giving. That is his intrinsic
nature. He gives because he has <em>so</em> much that if he does not
give it it will become a burden on him. He is like a cloud full of
rainwater, it <em>has</em> to rain. It will rain on the stones, it will
rain on the rocks, it will rain <em>anywhere</em>. It <em>has</em> to
rain.</p><p>To understand it is to be religious. This understanding brings a
shift in your consciousness. Then you are no more complaining, then you
are tremendously grateful -- and that gratefulness is prayer.</p><p>(To John) -- This is your new name: Swami Gyandeva. Gyandeva means
the god of Wisdom. We are 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

collecting knowledge. Knowledge is rubbish, it is mundane, it is trivia.
We go on giving away the precious for the absolutely meaningless.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means an effort to reclaim your lost wisdom. And
the only way is: become ignorant again of so-called knowledge. Unburden
yourself of knowledge, unlearn it, and the moment all knowledge has been
unlearned, wisdom starts welling up in you. It is your intrinsic nature.
It has not to be learned, it has not to be searched for, you have not to
go outside seeking for it. It is your innermost core of being.</p><p>Meditation means unlearning knowledge so that wisdom can assert life
again.</p><p>(To Kurt) This is your new name: Swami Ramraj. Ramraj means the
kingdom of god.</p><p>Jesus says that the kingdom of god is within you. That is the
essential teaching of all the wakened ones: don't go anywhere, don't
seek and search outside yourself, you will not find anything there. You
will remain empty, unfulfilled, frustrated, because the real kingdom,
the real riches are part of your interiority, of your subjectivity, of
your soul.</p><p>Ordinary humanity is extrovert. That's exactly the meaning of the
worldly man: extrovert. By becoming a sannyasin you will be moving in
exactly the opposite direction: it is introversion. Not that I am
against the world, but not to know oneself is very dangerous. Once you
know yourself you can roam all over the world sharing your joy and
living your joy; then there is no problem. If you are rooted in your
being you can be as extrovert as you want, nothing can harm you. You can
live in the marketplace but your meditation will remain undisturbed.</p><p>But the first, the foremost thing is to settle within, to be
acquainted with your inner reality. And my whole effort is to turn you
in, in every possible way, to help you to go in.</p><p>I cannot give you the truth, nobody can, but I can indicate where it
is to be found. It is not to be found on the moon, it is not to be found
on Everest; it is to be found just within you. Learn to close your eyes
and see within.</p><p>(To Marilyn) -- This is your new name: Ma Prabhato. Prabhato means
the early dawn.</p><p>Sannyas is the early dawn. It is an end and a beginning, it is a
death and a rebirth. it is the interval between the two.</p><p>You will have to drop the past, you will have to drop clinging to the
old, whatsoever it is, good or bad. it is not a question of choosing the
good and dropping the bad: the past has to be dropped totally. One has
to disconnect oneself from the past; only then toes the rebirth become
possible, only then does the sun rise.</p><p>The sun is always ready to rise, it is just that we go on clinging to
the past, and the past is nothing but a dark night.</p><p>Enough is enough. Now drop the old and let the new be born in you.
And always remember: Sannyas is not something like an event, it is a
process. It is not that one day you become a sannyasin and then it is
finished. It is like breathing: you have to go on breathing
continuously.</p><p>Sannyas is a process not an event, so you will have to go on dropping
the past continuously, because every day we accumulating the past. Today
you can drop it; again tomorrow, twenty-four hours will have passed and
those twenty-four hours will be there and you can cling to them.</p><p>Sannyas means the awareness that 'now, I am not going to cling to
that which is no more. The moment is gone, it is gone, I am finished
with it and that is that... a full pint, no looking back.; And then a
great miracle happens: when you don't look back, for the first time you
become aware of the present, and the beauty of it.</p><p>That beauty is god. Now is another name for god.</p><p>(To Renee) -- This is your new name: Ma Nisargo. Nisargo means
nature. Be more and more natural from now non.</p><p>The society imposes artificiality on everybody. It calls it culture,
civilization, education. It gives it big names, but the real thing is
that it makes you artificial. It teaches you to repress nature.</p><p>My whole effort is to help you to be natural again, because it is
only through nature that one can come to god. The more artificial one
becomes, the farther away one is from god. So now remember it: you will
need civilization, culture, education, but don't get identified with
them They are games. One can play them because one has to live in a
society where everybody is living those games, but remember that they
are games and they are not realities. Watch so that you don't get
identified with them, and whenever they are not needed be natural.</p><p>'Nature' has to be the key word for you. And that is going to help
you immensely, that will bring the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

cessation of the ego, dropping of the ego. And that's essentially what
religion is.</p><p>The irreligious person lives in the ego; he thinks "I am separate
from the whole." The religious person lives egolessly; he knows that "I
am part of the whole, an intrinsic part of the whole, not at all
separate." To know it -- that "I am not</p><p>separate from the whole" brings tremendous freedom. It brings
vastness. The whole sky is yours. You are no more identified with a
small, very small ego.</p><p>We are vast but we have become confined in small spaces, that's why
there is so much misery. This misery is natural. It is like forcing and
ocean into a dewdrop. We are birds with wings who need to have the whole
sky, but we are encaged. Nobody is encaging us, the irony is that we go
on encaging ourselves. We are the prison and we are the prisoner and we
are the gaoler-there is nobody else.</p><p>That's why the mystics call it a dream: it <em>is</em> a dream. In a
dream you are all. The moment you wake up you find that this is strange:
"I was chased by a lion, but I was the lion and I was chased and I was
the spectator too, the witness to the whole thing." This is how life is,
like a dream.</p><p>Now it is time... If children play with stupid games they can be
forgiven, they need to go astray, they need to commit many mistakes. But
as you grow older you cannot be forgiven. And the ego is the most stupid
game because it is against reality, it is against god.</p><p>Sannyas simply means becoming aware of the fact that the ego is a
false entity, our own creation, our own projection... and the we are
caught in it. It is like a spider's web: the spider brings it out from
itself. We go on creating our own prisons out of ourselves -- our
imagination, our desire, our memory, our ambition, our jealousy. And
they all go on spinning subtle structures around us. The whole structure
is called the ego.</p><p>Whatsoever the mind does, the whole work of the mind is called the
ego.</p><p>From this very moment become aware of it, and slowly slowly get out
of it. It is not going to be difficult to get out of it; and it is time
to.</p><p>Before one leaves the body one should be able to leave the ego. Then
death becomes tremendously beautiful, it becomes a door to the divine.
Then it is no more ugly, no more painful, on the contrary, it is a
blessing, a benediction.</p><p>(To Michael)</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Sudas. Sudas means the surrendered one
-- and that is going to be your path. Be utterly surrendered to
existence; no fight any more, no conflict any more, no more private
goals of your own. Let the whole</p><p>possess you, let the whole guide you. Then wherever it takes you is
good and whatsoever it makes out of you is good.</p><p>Man alone cannot do right, he will only do wrong. Right happens only
when man allows god to function through him.</p><p>So allow god to function through you. Trust. If this whole universe
is going so beautifully, why can't it take care of you? Why should you
be worried, anxious about yourself? No rose bush is worried, no bird, no
animal, no star. It is just the stupid human mind that creates so many
worries -- and the simple reason is that it thinks it is separate.
Naturally, if you are separate then the whole worry is yours; if you are
not separate then the whole will take care.</p><p>Jesus says: 'Thy kingdom come, they will be done'. Let that be your
prayer too.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

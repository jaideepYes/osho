It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Antar Steffanie. Antar means inner, steffanie means a voice -- the inner voice.\nGod does not speak from the outside, he does not speak through the scriptures. He speaks from your innermost core. But we never hear, because we are in the turmoil of the head so much that the still, small voice of the within is lost.\nSannyas means the science of stilling the mind so that the inner voice can be heard.\nOnce you have started hearing the inner voice no other guide is needed. Then god is your guide. Then there is no question of choosing between alternatives, then he continuously directs you towards that which is right. He is still directing us but we are not available, we are pre-occupied.\nLearn the art of making the mind silent. It is not difficult. In the beginning it appears difficult, but don't be deceived by the appearance. Go on trying again and again and again, and be patient. Remain alert to the fact that it has happened to many people, it can happen to you, because we are all potentially the same.…\nIf one can become a Jesus or a Buddha, then everybody has the potential to become that.\nAnd the art can be reduces to a simple maxim: watch you mind. See what go on inside the mind, detached, aloof, just like a bystander. Don't condemn, don't appreciate, don't be friendly and don't be inimical. Just be neutral, a pure watcher with no vested interest in it, like a mirror. Anything that comes by the mirror reflects. It does not say that it is beautiful, it does not say that it is ugly.\nIf you can watch your mind, by and by it becomes silent of its own accord. And the day the mind is silent one hears the inner voice for the first time and one has found the guide, the true master.\nThe outer master helps you find the inner master.\nThis is your name: Swami Prem Dirk. Prem means love, dirk means full of justice.\nLove is full of justice, and only love can be full of justice because love knows how to forgive. Love knows how to be compassionate. Love knows how to accept the limitations of human beings. Love knows that nobody is perfect. Love does not demand the impossible. It is the unloving people who demand the impossible. They demand perfection. They demand such things which cannot be fulfilled, and then they have an excuse to go on living a life without love.\nThe excuse is, \"Where is the person whom I can love? Nobody seems to be worthy enough.\" This is just a strategy to avoid love: make demands which cannot be fulfilled by human beings.\nTrue love knows how to accept the person with all his limitations, with all his imperfections, and out of that understanding justice is born.\nGrow in love. The more you love, the more just you will be. And to be just is to be religious. But love is the secret, love is the alchemy that can transform your being into a blessing to yourself, to others, to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- existence itself.\nThis is your name: Swami Antar Dirk. Antar means inner. Dirk has two meanings; one is, full of justice; the other is, a king, a ruler.\nYou have to be a ruler of the inner world. We have a kingdom inside, the true kingdom. We all want to be kings but we go on searching in the wrong direction, we go on searching outside. And one can become a king, one can have all the wealth and all the power and the prestige; still, deep down one knows that one has missed. One is still poor, one is still empty. Nothing is yet fulfilled and life has slipped out of your hands in collecting rubbish.\nAlexander dies as poor as any beggar. So the whole show is just a deception. The true kingdom is of the inner. A Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu, a Jesus -- these are true kings because they rule themselves.\nOrdinarily we are slaves, pretending to be rulers. Unless one conquers one's unconsciousness one remains a pretender, one remains a slave and goes on playing all kinds of games of pretension and deception, goes on proclaiming 'I am not what you think I am.' And he knows what he is and everybody else knows too, because everybody else is doing the same thing. All are beggars and all are hidden behind masks.\nBe a true king. And the beauty of the inner kingdom is that there is no competition. You have your kingdom, I have my own, and they never collide, they never overlap. Each person has an inner world so vast, and there is no competition, no fight, no quarrel with anybody.\nSannyas is initiation into the inner. It is a turning point in life. Withdraw yourself more and more from the outside, from unnecessary occupations, and put your energy more and more into the inner search.\nI am not saying to renounce the world because one has to do a few things on the outside. One has to keep the body together, one has to earn a livelihood, one has to take care of many things. Whatsoever is necessary and needful has to be done, but the needful is very small. Our needs are not many -- our desires are impossible. Needs can be fulfilled, desires cannot be fulfilled. When a need goes mad it becomes desire.\nDesire means that now you are caught in such a vicious circle that you will never be able to come out of it unless you really try hard to get out of its clutches. Needs are perfectly okay, they have to be fulfilled, but that takes a very little amount of your energy. In fact ninety per cent of your energy becomes available for the inner search, ten per cent is enough for the outer work. And ninety per cent of your energy is a vast amount of energy, it is enough. You can just ride on that wave and go inwards.\nMy work here is to help you to reduce your desires to the necessary needs and then the remaining energy will take you inwards. Then the process is very simple. If the energy is available you can simply float with it. The problem is that people waste their energy outside so much that when it comes to going in they don't have any energy, they fall asleep. Whenever they sit for meditation they fall asleep. No energy is available. They have wasted all their energy outside. Utterly tired, exhausted, they try meditation.\nMeditation needs more energy than anything else in the world, remember it, and energy has to be saved.\nYou have only a certain amount of energy. So be very careful, don't waste it, because it is through this saved energy that the inner kingdom can be conquered. There is no other way.\nThis is your name: Ma Anand Sylvia. Anand means bliss. Sylvia means the god of solitude, the solitude that prevails in deep woods and forests.\nPeople are afraid of solitude, hence sylvia also means the sudden terror that catches one when one is absolutely alone in a forest.\nSolitude in itself is tremendously beautiful, blissful, it is a benediction, but we don't know how to make contact with solitude, how to befriend it. All that we do know is absolutely wrong. What we know about solitude is not about solitude but about solitariness. And those two things are as different as two things can be.\nSolitariness is a negative state. One feels lonely, lost empty, afraid of one's own emptiness. Solitude is positive. It is not loneliness, it is aloneness. It is overflowing energy.\nWilliam Blake says: Energy is delight. When you are really in solitude you are so full of energy, it is overflowing, you are overwhelmed by it. You are not really\nlonely, you are with yourself. In solitariness you are lonely. There is nobody you can be with and you don't know how to be with yourself. In solitude you know how to be with yourself, how to be totally centered in you own being. Great bliss arises out of that centering, out of that grounding.\nMeditation is an approach towards your inner solitude. Somewhere deep down in you there is a point where everything else disappears, the whole world disappears. You are left absolutely alone. There is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnobody, not even the thought of somebody, not even the image, no desire for the other. And you are so intrigues with that silent presence of yourself that you don't want to disturb it. You are not frightened, you are rejoicing tremendously that you have found your inner space, that you have found a corner within your being where you can always move, where the world cannot reach you, where the worries of the world cannot reach you. You have found a point within yourself which is untouchable, unreachable. You are really for the first time an individual. For the first time you have privacy, because nobody can penetrate that aloneness.\nSlowly slowly one has to move away from the body and the mind, from all kings of thoughts, desires, memories, imagination. And the farther away you go from the mind, the closer you come to yourself. A moment comes when the mind is thousands of miles away fro you, you cannot even hear its noise. It is as if it were no more. Then you are, and for the first time you are: tremendously you are, totally you are. It is a blissful state. There is no need to be in terror, there is no need to be afraid or scared.\nThe function of a master is to help you to understand this solitude. Not only to understand it but to love it, to rejoice in it.\nThis is your name: Swami Veet Harald. Veet means going beyond. Harald means warrior.\nSannyas is just the opposite of being a soldier. The soldier is interested in conquering the world and the sannyasin is interested in conquering himself. The\nwarrior fights with others, the sannyasin has no fight with anybody in the world. He has dropped all conflict, all struggle. He does not think in terms of war. He is at pease with existence, he has surrendered to existence; hence there is no question of war. But in that very surrender he becomes a conqueror, because in that very surrender he becomes a vehicle of the whole. He is no more apart, he is no more separate. He is no more small. The dewdrop has slipped into the ocean.\nYes on the one hand the dewdrop has died. But on the other hand the dewdrop has become the ocean.\nThis is your new name: Swami Veet Nito. Veet means going beyond. Nito means morality.\nReligion is going beyond the moral and the immoral. It is a transcendence of all duality. It is going beyond the good and the bad. In fact when you have gone beyond good and bad you are good. When you have gone beyond the moral and the immoral you are for the first time really moral.\nThese three words have to be understood. One is sinner. The sinner is one who lives an immoral life against the nature of the whole. That is sin -- going against the totality.\nThe other word is \"saint\". He lives a moral life, he tries hard to be with the whole, but his effort creates a tension. His very desire to be with the whole, never to go against it, makes him egoistic. He thinks himself holier-than-thou because he is following a moral life, a virtuous life, the religious life.\nAnd the third word is \"sage\". The sage is one who is neither sinner nor a saint, A sage is one who has transcended all moral and immoral ideas, who is neither trying to go against nor trying to go with, who is not trying at all, who is so relaxed, so utterly relaxed. Out of that relaxation he is in harmony with the whole. Out of that let-go he lives as part of the whole. He cannot live otherwise, he has no ego anymore.\nEgo can exist only when you are striving for something -- good or bad, it doesn't matter. Ego can exist only when you are making efforts to achieve something.\nThe sage is not trying to achieve anything at all. My sannyasins have to be sages, not saints. The saint is in a very low state, a little better than the sinner, but just a little better and not always. Sometimes it is even worse than being a sinner, it\ndepends. Sometimes the sinner is humble because he knows he is a sinner; that makes him humble. And the saint is very egoistic. Of course his is a very pious ego, but the more pious the ego is, the more poisonous it is. It has happened many; times that sinners have come to god's door more easily than saints.\nBut my sannyasin has to remember that he has to transcend both. He has to become a sage.\nA sage is one who is not striving for anything in particular, who has no goal, who is not trying to achieve enlightenment, moksha, nirvana, the kingdom of god. Those are all gos goals. They are very subtle but they are ego goals.\nThe sage is one who has dropped the whole idea of achievement, who has dropped the very achieving mind, who lives moment to moment, who is utterly ordinary. When he is hungry he eats, when he is thirsty he drinks, and when he is tires he sleeps; his life is very ordinary. But in that very ordinariness god is found.\nThat very ordinariness is enlightenment.\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Ahmo. Veet means going beyond. Ahmo means the ego.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's the whole process of sannyas, going beyond the ego. Going beyond the idea 'I am'. While this idea persists god cannot be experienced. This is the barrier, the only barrier, there is no other barrier. The more you feet that you are, the more difficult it is to feel the presence of god, because that presence is very subtle and the ego is very gross. The ego is like a rock and the presence of god is like a fragrance. It is not even like a flower but like a fragrance. Now the rock cannot feet the fragrance, it is insensitive.\nThe ego has to be dissolved, and it can be dissolved because it is a false entity.\nWe have created it. It is a created phenomenon, it does not exist in reality. We are not born with it, it is cultivated later on. Slowly slowly we teach the child to be an ego. In fact the day the child says \"I am,\" he becomes part of our society.\nBefore that he remains a little wild, before that he remains more natural, more spontaneous.\nIt happens somewhere near about the age of three to four. In girls it happens near about three, in boys, near about four. Boys are always lagging behind. Girls come to maturity a little sooner... in everything!\nAbout the ego also, they become aware of it first. Even small girls become very concerned about their image, their face -- they look in the mirror for hours -- their dress and things like that , which are all just arrangements for creating a beautiful ego.\nIt is because of those -- that we become egos near about three or four -- that we can only remember after that point. If you try to remember backward you will come to remember only up to that point when you become an ego. Before that there is blankness, a gap.\nOne can remember things that happened at the age of four or three. And that will be decisive, that will decide when the ego entered into your world, because when the ego enters it starts collecting memories. It is a great collector of junk. It make albums of all kinds of stupid things.\nBefore it comes into existence one lives moment to moment. Who cares to remember the past? So the child up to the third or fourth year remains spontaneous, wild, natural, outside society, on the fringe. It is a cultivated phenomenon, hence it can be dropped. If it were natural there would be no way to drop it.\nBecause it is put together by society it can be easily dismantled. And that's what sannyas is all about, dismantling the ego.\nThe process is painful because you have to become too attached to it. But once you understand that the ego is the root cause of all your misery, you are ready to go through the surgery. It is better to be finished with it in one stroke rather than to go on being miserable for your whole life.\nThe more intelligent a person is, the more ready he is to drop the ego. Whatsoever the pain, he is ready to accept it. Once the ego is dropped all pain disappears. Life takes on a totally different color and form.\nThen you function without any idea of the I. You function as part of the whole -- like trees, like clouds, like stars. And certainly the same beauty and the same grandeur is yours. The same beauty of the trees and the clouds and the stars becomes your beauty. And the same silence and the same music and the same joy and the same celebration prevails in your being.\nSo that is going to be your work: kill the ego. That is the only price needed. We have to pay it, only then are we available to god, and god is available to us. And by god I mean the whole universe; not some person but the divine presence that permeates everything, the melody of all, the harmony of the whole.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #24\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3127","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3127 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

which cannot be fulfilled by human beings.</p><p>True love knows how to accept the person with all his limitations,
with all his imperfections, and out of that understanding justice is
born.</p><p>Grow in love. The more you love, the more just you will be. And to be

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- existence itself.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Antar Dirk. Antar means inner. Dirk has two
meanings; one is, full of justice; the other is, a king, a ruler.</p><p>You have to be a ruler of the inner world. We have a kingdom inside,
the true kingdom. We all want to be kings but we go on searching in the
wrong direction, we go on searching outside. And one can become a king,
one can have all the wealth and all the power and the prestige; still,
deep down one knows that one has missed. One is still poor, one is still
empty. Nothing is yet fulfilled and life has slipped out of your hands
in collecting rubbish.</p><p>Alexander dies as poor as any beggar. So the whole show is just a
deception. The true kingdom is of the inner. A Buddha, a Zarathustra, a
Lao Tzu, a Jesus -- these are true kings because they rule
themselves.</p><p>Ordinarily we are slaves, pretending to be rulers. Unless one
conquers one's unconsciousness one remains a pretender, one remains a
slave and goes on playing all kinds of games of pretension and
deception, goes on proclaiming 'I am not what you think I am.' And he
knows what he is and everybody else knows too, because everybody else is
doing the same thing. All are beggars and all are hidden behind
masks.</p><p>Be a true king. And the beauty of the inner kingdom is that there is
no competition. You have your kingdom, I have my own, and they never
collide, they never overlap. Each person has an inner world so vast, and
there is no competition, no fight, no quarrel with anybody.</p><p>Sannyas is initiation into the inner. It is a turning point in life.
Withdraw yourself more and more from the outside, from unnecessary
occupations, and put your energy more and more into the inner
search.</p><p>I am not saying to renounce the world because one has to do a few
things on the outside. One has to keep the body together, one has to
earn a livelihood, one has to take care of many things. Whatsoever is
necessary and needful has to be done, but the needful is very small. Our
needs are not many -- our desires are impossible. Needs can be
fulfilled, desires cannot be fulfilled. When a need goes mad it becomes
desire.</p><p>Desire means that now you are caught in such a vicious circle that
you will never be able to come out of it unless you really try hard to
get out of its clutches. Needs are perfectly okay, they have to be
fulfilled, but that takes a very little amount of your energy. In fact
ninety per cent of your energy becomes available for the inner search,
ten per cent is enough for the outer work. And ninety per cent of your
energy is a vast amount of energy, it is enough. You can just ride on
that wave and go inwards.</p><p>My work here is to help you to reduce your desires to the necessary
needs and then the remaining energy will take you inwards. Then the
process is very simple. If the energy is available you can simply float
with it. The problem is that people waste their energy outside so much
that when it comes to going in they don't have any energy, they fall
asleep. Whenever they sit for meditation they fall asleep. No energy is
available. They have wasted all their energy outside. Utterly tired,
exhausted, they try meditation.</p><p>Meditation needs more energy than anything else in the world,
remember it, and energy has to be saved.</p><p>You have only a certain amount of energy. So be very careful, don't
waste it, because it is through this saved energy that the inner kingdom
can be conquered. There is no other way.</p><p>This is your name: Ma Anand Sylvia. Anand means bliss. Sylvia means
the god of solitude, the solitude that prevails in deep woods and
forests.</p><p>People are afraid of solitude, hence sylvia also means the sudden
terror that catches one when one is absolutely alone in a forest.</p><p>Solitude in itself is tremendously beautiful, blissful, it is a
benediction, but we don't know how to make contact with solitude, how to
befriend it. All that we do know is absolutely wrong. What we know about
solitude is not about solitude but about solitariness. And those two
things are <em>as</em> different as two things can be.</p><p>Solitariness is a negative state. One feels lonely, lost empty,
afraid of one's own emptiness. Solitude is positive. It is not
loneliness, it is aloneness. It is overflowing energy.</p><p>William Blake says: Energy is delight. When you are really in
solitude you are so full of energy, it is overflowing, you are
overwhelmed by it. You are not really</p><p>lonely, you are with yourself. In solitariness you are lonely. There
is nobody you can be with and you don't know how to be with yourself. In
solitude you know how to be with yourself, how to be totally centered in
you own being. Great bliss arises out of that centering, out of that
grounding.</p><p>Meditation is an approach towards your inner solitude. Somewhere deep
down in you there is a point where everything else disappears, the whole
world disappears. You are left absolutely alone. There is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>nobody, not even the thought of somebody, not even the image, no
desire for the other. And you are so intrigues with that silent presence
of yourself that you don't want to disturb it. You are not frightened,
you are rejoicing tremendously that you have found your inner space,
that you have found a corner within your being where you can always
move, where the world cannot reach you, where the worries of the world
cannot reach you. You have found a point within yourself which is
untouchable, unreachable. You are really for the first time an
individual. For the first time you have privacy, because nobody can
penetrate that aloneness.</p><p>Slowly slowly one has to move away from the body and the mind, from
all kings of thoughts, desires, memories, imagination. And the farther
away you go from the mind, the closer you come to yourself. A moment
comes when the mind is thousands of miles away fro you, you cannot even
hear its noise. It is as if it were no more. Then you are, and for the
first time you are: tremendously you are, totally you are. It is a
blissful state. There is no need to be in terror, there is no need to be
afraid or scared.</p><p>The function of a master is to help you to understand this solitude.
Not only to understand it but to love it, to rejoice in it.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Veet Harald. Veet means going beyond. Harald
means warrior.</p><p>Sannyas is just the opposite of being a soldier. The soldier is
interested in conquering the world and the sannyasin is interested in
conquering himself. The</p><p>warrior fights with others, the sannyasin has no fight with anybody
in the world. He has dropped all conflict, all struggle. He does not
think in terms of war. He is at pease with existence, he has surrendered
to existence; hence there is no question of war. But in that very
surrender he becomes a conqueror, because in that very surrender he
becomes a vehicle of the whole. He is no more apart, he is no more
separate. He is no more small. The dewdrop has slipped into the
ocean.</p><p>Yes on the one hand the dewdrop has died. But on the other hand the
dewdrop has become the ocean.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Veet Nito. Veet means going beyond. Nito
means morality.</p><p>Religion is going beyond the moral and the immoral. It is a
transcendence of all duality. It is going beyond the good and the bad.
In fact when you have gone beyond good and bad you are good. When you
have gone beyond the moral and the immoral you are for the first time
really moral.</p><p>These three words have to be understood. One is sinner. The sinner is
one who lives an immoral life against the nature of the whole. That is
sin -- going against the totality.</p><p>The other word is "saint". He lives a moral life, he tries hard to be
with the whole, but his effort creates a tension. His very desire to be
with the whole, never to go against it, makes him egoistic. He thinks
himself holier-than-thou because he is following a moral life, a
virtuous life, the religious life.</p><p>And the third word is "sage". The sage is one who is neither sinner
nor a saint, A sage is one who has transcended all moral and immoral
ideas, who is neither trying to go against nor trying to go with, who is
not trying at all, who is so relaxed, so utterly relaxed. Out of that
relaxation he is in harmony with the whole. Out of that let-go he lives
as part of the whole. He cannot live otherwise, he has no ego
anymore.</p><p>Ego can exist only when you are striving for something -- good or
bad, it doesn't matter. Ego can exist only when you are making efforts
to achieve something.</p><p>The sage is not trying to achieve anything at all. My sannyasins have
to be sages, not saints. The saint is in a very low state, a little
better than the sinner, but just a little better and not always.
Sometimes it is even worse than being a sinner, it</p><p>depends. Sometimes the sinner is humble because he knows he is a
sinner; that makes him humble. And the saint is very egoistic. Of course
his is a very pious ego, but the more pious the ego is, the more
poisonous it is. It has happened many; times that sinners have come to
god's door more easily than saints.</p><p>But my sannyasin has to remember that he has to transcend both. He
has to become a sage.</p><p>A sage is one who is not striving for anything in particular, who has
no goal, who is not trying to achieve enlightenment, moksha, nirvana,
the kingdom of god. Those are all gos goals. They are very subtle but
they are ego goals.</p><p>The sage is one who has dropped the whole idea of achievement, who
has dropped the very achieving mind, who lives moment to moment, who is
utterly ordinary. When he is hungry he eats, when he is thirsty he
drinks, and when he is tires he sleeps; his life is very ordinary. But
in that very ordinariness god is found.</p><p>That very ordinariness is enlightenment.</p><p>This is your new name: Ma Veet Ahmo. Veet means going beyond. Ahmo
means the ego.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>That's the whole process of sannyas, going beyond the ego. Going
beyond the idea 'I am'. While this idea persists god cannot be
experienced. This is the barrier, the only barrier, there is no other
barrier. The more you feet that you are, the more difficult it is to
feel the presence of god, because that presence is very subtle and the
ego is very gross. The ego is like a rock and the presence of god is
like a fragrance. It is not even like a flower but like a fragrance. Now
the rock cannot feet the fragrance, it is insensitive.</p><p>The ego has to be dissolved, and it can be dissolved because it is a
false entity.</p><p>We have created it. It is a created phenomenon, it does not exist in
reality. We are not born with it, it is cultivated later on. Slowly
slowly we teach the child to be an ego. In fact the day the child says
"I am," he becomes part of our society.</p><p>Before that he remains a little wild, before that he remains more
natural, more spontaneous.</p><p>It happens somewhere near about the age of three to four. In girls it
happens near about three, in boys, near about four. Boys are always
lagging behind. Girls come to maturity a little sooner... in
everything!</p><p>About the ego also, they become aware of it first. Even small girls
become very concerned about their image, their face -- they look in the
mirror for hours -- their dress and things like that , which are all
just arrangements for creating a beautiful ego.</p><p>It is because of those -- that we become egos near about three or
four -- that we can only remember after that point. If you try to
remember backward you will come to remember only up to that point when
you become an ego. Before that there is blankness, a gap.</p><p>One can remember things that happened at the age of four or three.
And that will be decisive, that will decide when the ego entered into
your world, because when the ego enters it starts collecting memories.
It is a great collector of junk. It make albums of all kinds of stupid
things.</p><p>Before it comes into existence one lives moment to moment. Who cares
to remember the past? So the child up to the third or fourth year
remains spontaneous, wild, natural, outside society, on the fringe. It
is a cultivated phenomenon, hence it can be dropped. If it were natural
there would be no way to drop it.</p><p>Because it is put together by society it can be easily dismantled.
And that's what sannyas is all about, dismantling the ego.</p><p>The process is painful because you have to become too attached to it.
But once you understand that the ego is the root cause of all your
misery, you are ready to go through the surgery. It is better to be
finished with it in one stroke rather than to go on being miserable for
your whole life.</p><p>The more intelligent a person is, the more ready he is to drop the
ego. Whatsoever the pain, he is ready to accept it. Once the ego is
dropped all pain disappears. Life takes on a totally different color and
form.</p><p>Then you function without any idea of the I. You function as part of
the whole -- like trees, like clouds, like stars. And certainly the same
beauty and the same grandeur is yours. The same beauty of the trees and
the clouds and the stars becomes your beauty. And the same silence and
the same music and the same joy and the same celebration prevails in
your being.</p><p>So that is going to be your work: kill the ego. That is the only
price needed. We have to pay it, only then are we available to god, and
god is available to us. And by god I mean the whole universe; not some
person but the divine presence that permeates everything, the melody of
all, the harmony of the whole.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

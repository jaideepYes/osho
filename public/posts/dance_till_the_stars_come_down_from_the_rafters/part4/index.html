It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Renate) -- This is your name: Ma Bhora. Bhora means the early dawn; those beautiful moments when the night is over and the day has not yet arrived -- that little interval, that gap.\nSannyas is exactly that interval: you are leaving the past, your mind, all that you have known yourself to be. The old will be gone and the new will take a little time to come. And between these two, great courage is needed. The man who is not courageous enough can fall back, can become afraid of the emptiness, can be frightened that the familiar is disappearing and there seems to be no sign of truth arising. That's why very few people take the initiative to move into the unknown, and god is the most unknown, the most unknowable phenomenon.\nThe function of the master is to help you in this interval. Once the sun has risen then there is no problem; then the new mind has arrived, the new man is born. Now you can live again with the new, through the new; the old is no more needed. But before the new arrives and the old is gone, you are in a kind of limbo -- don't be afraid of it.\nAnd never think of falling back -- that is cowardly. And a cowardly person cannot be religious. Religion is only for the brave ones.\n(To Gerdi) -- This is your name: Ma Gerdi. It is a beautiful name; it means courageous spirit. and Courage is the most significant religious quality, everything else is secondary, because without courage there is no possibility of being sincere, truthful, meditative. without courage there is no possibility of growing, because growth means going constantly beyond the known. when the seed becomes a sprout it is going into something unknown, when the sprout starts growing flowers it is again movement into the unknown. And when the fragrance leaves the flowers... again a quantum leap into the unknown.\nLife needs courage at each step. Wherever courage is lacking we become dormant. Courage keeps us flowing, alive.\n(To Vera) -- This is your name: Ma Vera. Vera means truthful, sincere, faithful. Those are great things.\nAnd if from right now you start growing in these directions, they can happen. They very rarely happen and to only a few people, but only those people to whom these qualities happen are fortunate.\nEverybody is capable but much work has to be done. Start from now! Good Vera!\n(To Reinhard) -- This is your name. Reinhard means pure heart/ In fact the heart is never impure. It is a repetition to say pure heart; the heart means purity.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe head can be impure but the heart cannot be impure. The head can be impure because it can have desires, memories, thoughts. Even when it has good desires it is impure. Even if the dust is golden it is dust and it covers the mirror. Even when you desire god you are creating impurity. Impurity simply means that you are bringing something alien, foreign into yourself. The head is always impure and the heart is always pure.\nSo the question is not how to make the heart pure or how to make the head pure; the question is how to move from the head to the heart. Movement from the head to the heart is movement from impurity to purity\n-- and that's what meditation is. When we say that meditation is no-mind, we are simply saying that meditation is the heart.\n(To Wim) -- This is your name: Swami Dharmo. Dharmo means the ultimate law, the tao, the logos, the law that keeps the whole universe going, that keeps the whole universe together, the invisible thread running through the whole of existence. Without it things will fall apart. But nothing falls apart. It is such an immense existence but it runs with such harmony, with such rhythmic joy. It is so deeply connected, interlinked, that to contemplate upon it, just to think of it, fills one with great mystery.\nNow your work, the work of a sannyasin, is to be in tune with this ultimate law, to be in tune with the whole. Ordinarily man lives apart, he tries to lie a separate existence. That's what ego is: an effort to live as a separate entity. It is bound to fail, it is doomed to fail. And it brings great misery.\nSannyas means dropping that whole project of the ego, of living separately from existence, moving with existence, with the whole, in absolute surrender. Then there is no misery, no anguish, no anxiety. Then all is good and when all is good, all is god.\n(To Klaus) -- This is your name: Swami Sarthi. Sarthi means the charioteer.\nMan's body is like a chariot and man's consciousness should be the charioteer. But it is fast asleep and the chariot goes on moving according to the horses. The five senses are five horses. They have their own different ideas and they are running in all directions; hence the misery, the chaos. It is a miracle that somehow we keep on going.\nThe charioteer has to be awakened, he has to take the reins in his hands. That's what sannyas is: the beginning of an inner mastery, the beginning of a sense of direction, the beginning of a center in your being, a rootedness, a groundedness. Each movement has to be made consciously, only then can life become something significant, otherwise it remains accidental.\n(To China) -- This is you new name: Ma Sargam. Sargam literally means the\nseven notes of music.\nMusic consists of seven notes and, exactly like that, man consists of seven centers. Man is like a rainbow: he has seven colors. When all the seven colors meet in deep harmony white is created. White is not a single color, it is the harmony between the seven colors. When all the seven colors are absent, it is black.\nBlack is also not a color, it is absence of all the colors. White is the presence of all the colors, but a presence with a certain condition: a presence in deep harmony.\nWhen there are seven notes of music they can either create noise -- if there is no harmony; or they can create beautiful music if there is harmony. Ordinarily every man is a chaos: his seven centers are not functioning in harmony. His head says one thing, his heart says another. One center goes to the north, another center goes to the south. One part longs for one thing, another part longs for just the opposite. And it is not possible to have both.\nFor example, either you can have light in the room or you can have darkness in the room. If part of you wants darkness and part of you wants light, then there is going to be trouble: you will be torn apart and nothing will ever make you contented. If there is light one part will start feeling frustrated; if there is darkness the other part starts freaking out. It is impossible because it is not in the nature of things to have both.\nWe have seven centers and all the centers can demand opposite things. This is the natural state of humanity; hence everybody is more or less neurotic Neurosis is a common quality. Unless one makes a great effort to create harmony, unless one bridges all these seven centers, seven notes into oneness, unless all these seven become integrated and start functioning as a unity, sanity is not born.\nSannyas is an effort to bring you out of neuroses, out of insanity, into a saner space. it is an effort to create music out of noise, a cosmos out of chaos. And unless is happens life is futile.\nSo let this moment be decisive.… work upon yourself. Now life will not be the same old accidental life, driftwood life; from now onwards you have to live consciously. And slowly slowly things start settling.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt takes time. But once you start feeling that things have started settling and some music is heard, then the journey becomes easier; then you know you are on the right track. And as you move deeper and deeper into this harmony, more and more joy, more and more ecstasy arises. At the ultimate point all the seven colors meet and you explode into white light. That experience is called god. God is not a person but the ultimate experience of harmony.\n(To Jose) -- This is your new name: Swami Purvesh. Purvesh means the God of the East. Symbolically, the East represents spirituality, and the West represents materialism. The East represents religion, and the West represents science.\nBecoming a sannyasin means becoming Eastern. This is a new birth. The East has nothing to do with geography; remember, it is a metaphor just as the West is a metaphor. For example, I would not count China as the East, it is the West; it is so materialistic, so communistic.\nI would count Jesus, Eckhart, Francis, as Eastern. Although they were born in the West, it does not make much difference, they are as Eastern as Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir, Nanak. There are people in the West who are Eastern, and there are people in the East who are Western. So symbolically, geography is one thing, but geographical divisions cannot be decisive.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are becoming part of the East, part of the tremendous tradition of spirituality, of the tremendous rebellion of spirituality. Rejoice! You are accepted, you are welcomed.\nNow let your Western attitudes, approaches, disappear -- the Western hurry, the Western speed, the Western grip on things, the Western possessiveness. Let them all be part of the past.\nRelax! Forget hurry. The moment you forget hurry, worry disappears. The moment you are not speedy, you cannot be tense. The moment you are not\npossessive, great relaxation happens. And the miracle is that when you don't possess anything you possess the whole. The whole kingdom of God is yours.\n(To Eric) -- This is your new name: Swami Arupam. Arupam means the formless, the nameless.\nGod has no form, no name, no definition. God is indefinable, indescribable, inexpressible. Hence whatsoever has been said about god is all wrong. The moment it is said, it becomes wrong.\nOne can be right about god only if one remains silent. Utter a single word and you have missed the point. Nothing can be said about god, but god can be experienced. There is no proof, no logical certainty, but there is something existential. You have to move into a new space. It is a new space, it is a new life style, it is a new vision of the world. It is a new way of looking at things The whole remains the same, it is just that you start looking is a new way and immediately everything changes.\nSannyas is a new way of looking at things. It is a way of looking at things in such a way that slowly slowly god starts emerging from everywhere. Although he has no form, he starts expressing himself in all forms possible. Or you start feeling him in all forms.\nIn one sense no wave is the ocean; in another sense every wave is the ocean. In one sense no form is god; in another sense every form is divine.\nMind cannot know because mind can only catch hold of forms. To know the formless you will have to go beyond the mind, you will have to drop the mind at least for a few moments every day, so that you can be bathed with god. And those few moments are the real moments. These are the only moments that you have lived, all other moments will go down the drain; they will not be saved. Only those moments that you have lived with god, with the presence of god, are saved.\n(To Donna) -- This is your new name: Ma Satori. Satori is a Japanese name; it means a state of no-mind.\nMind is only a mechanism, but it is so close that we have become identified with it. We have completely forgotten that we are separate. It is as if man was born sitting in a car... from the very beginning he is just sitting in a car, driving a car,\nand there is no time, no opportunity for him to get out of the car. Slowly slowly he will become identified with the car. Naturally, because he has no time, no opportunity to see the separation. That's exactly the case with the mind: we are born in it, with it, and there is no way to get out of it so we never know the separation. This is the only problem that has to be solved; all other problems arise out of it.\nWatch the mind. Become a little more distant. See the functioning of the mind: thoughts passing, coming and going, desires arising, disappearing, memories passing. It is like a screen and you are the spectator, you are the watcher. When this experience becomes strengthened, when it becomes very solid, that you are a witness, the shift happens. Suddenly the gestalt changes: You are no more mind, but a new 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nstate has arisen, the state of no-mind. And that is a great liberation. After that moment there are no problems in existence, after that moment there is no misery. Then all is joy and song and dance and celebration.\n(To Elena) -- This is your new name: Ma Mouna. Mouna means silence -- and that is going to be the key for you. Be more and more silent. Whenever you have the opportunity just sit silently doing nothing, not even doing meditation. Just sit silently, for no reason, for no purpose, slowly slowly silence grows. It becomes an overwhelming experience.\nAnd when silence has permeated you through and through, you will know who you are and you will know what this life is all about. In knowing it one knows god.\n(To Evangelos) -- This is your new name: Swami Veetmano. Veetmano means beyond the mind.\nTruth is beyond the mind. Philosophy fails for the simple reason that philosophy is mind and nothing else and truth is never going to be a conclusion of the mind. it is an experience when mind ceases to exist.\nWhen all the noise that mind makes has disappeared, then you know something within yourself; something surfaces from you own depths -- and that is truth. It is not a conclusion arrived at by mind, it's something that surfaces only when mind is no more present.\nMind is the barrier, the block. It is like a rock: it does not allow your own inner depth to speak to you My work here consists only of one thing: helping you to go beyond the mind.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #5\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2599","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2599 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

their own different ideas and they are running in all directions; hence
the misery, the chaos. It is a miracle that somehow we keep on
going.</p><p>The charioteer has to be awakened, he has to take the reins in his
hands. That's what sannyas is: the beginning of an inner mastery, the
beginning of a sense of direction, the beginning of a center in your
being, a rootedness, a groundedness. Each movement has to be made
consciously, only then can life become something significant, otherwise
it remains accidental.</p><p>(To China) -- This is you new name: Ma Sargam. Sargam literally means
the</p><p>seven notes of music.</p><p>Music consists of seven notes and, exactly like that, man consists of
seven centers. Man is like a rainbow: he has seven colors. When all the
seven colors meet in deep harmony white is created. White is not a
single color, it is the harmony between the seven colors. When all the
seven colors are absent, it is black.</p><p>Black is also not a color, it is absence of all the colors. White is
the presence of all the colors, but a presence with a certain condition:
a presence in deep harmony.</p><p>When there are seven notes of music they can either create noise --
if there is no harmony; or they can create beautiful music if there is
harmony. Ordinarily every man is a chaos: his seven centers are not
functioning in harmony. His head says one thing, his heart says another.
One center goes to the north, another center goes to the south. One part
longs for one thing, another part longs for just the opposite. And it is
not possible to have both.</p><p>For example, either you can have light in the room or you can have
darkness in the room. If part of you wants darkness and part of you
wants light, then there is going to be trouble: you will be torn apart
and nothing will ever make you contented. If there is light one part
will start feeling frustrated; if there is darkness the other part
starts freaking out. It is impossible because it is not in the nature of
things to have both.</p><p>We have seven centers and all the centers can demand opposite things.
This is the natural state of humanity; hence everybody is more or less
neurotic Neurosis is a common quality. Unless one makes a great effort
to create harmony, unless one bridges all these seven centers, seven
notes into oneness, unless all these seven become integrated and start
functioning as a unity, sanity is not born.</p><p>Sannyas is an effort to bring you out of neuroses, out of insanity,
into a saner space. it is an effort to create music out of noise, a
cosmos out of chaos. And unless is happens life is futile.</p><p>So let this moment be decisive.… work upon yourself. Now life will
not be the same old accidental life, driftwood life; from now onwards
you have to live consciously. And slowly slowly things start
settling.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It takes time. But once you start feeling that things have started
settling and some music is heard, then the journey becomes easier; then
you know you are on the right track. And as you move deeper and deeper
into this harmony, more and more joy, more and more ecstasy arises. At
the ultimate point all the seven colors meet and you explode into white
light. That experience is called god. God is not a person but the
ultimate experience of harmony.</p><p>(To Jose) -- This is your new name: Swami Purvesh. Purvesh means the
God of the East. Symbolically, the East represents spirituality, and the
West represents materialism. The East represents religion, and the West
represents science.</p><p>Becoming a sannyasin means becoming Eastern. This is a new birth. The
East has nothing to do with geography; remember, it is a metaphor just
as the West is a metaphor. For example, I would not count China as the
East, it is the West; it is so materialistic, so communistic.</p><p>I would count Jesus, Eckhart, Francis, as Eastern. Although they were
born in the West, it does not make much difference, they are as Eastern
as Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir, Nanak. There are people in the West who are
Eastern, and there are people in the East who are Western. So
symbolically, geography is one thing, but geographical divisions cannot
be decisive.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are becoming part of the East, part of
the tremendous tradition of spirituality, of the tremendous rebellion of
spirituality. Rejoice! You are accepted, you are welcomed.</p><p>Now let your Western attitudes, approaches, disappear -- the Western
hurry, the Western speed, the Western grip on things, the Western
possessiveness. Let them all be part of the past.</p><p>Relax! Forget hurry. The moment you forget hurry, worry disappears.
The moment you are not speedy, you cannot be tense. The moment you are
not</p><p>possessive, great relaxation happens. And the miracle is that when
you don't possess anything you possess the whole. The whole kingdom of
God is yours.</p><p>(To Eric) -- This is your new name: Swami Arupam. Arupam means the
formless, the nameless.</p><p>God has no form, no name, no definition. God is indefinable,
indescribable, inexpressible. Hence whatsoever has been said about god
is all wrong. The moment it is said, it becomes wrong.</p><p>One can be right about god only if one remains silent. Utter a single
word and you have missed the point. Nothing can be said about god, but
god can be experienced. There is no proof, no logical certainty, but
there is something existential. You have to move into a new space. It is
a new space, it is a new life style, it is a new vision of the world. It
is a new way of looking at things The whole remains the same, it is just
that you start looking is a new way and immediately everything
changes.</p><p>Sannyas is a new way of looking at things. It is a way of looking at
things in such a way that slowly slowly god starts emerging from
everywhere. Although he has no form, he starts expressing himself in all
forms possible. Or you start feeling him in all forms.</p><p>In one sense no wave is the ocean; in another sense every wave is the
ocean. In one sense no form is god; in another sense every form is
divine.</p><p>Mind cannot know because mind can only catch hold of forms. To know
the formless you will have to go beyond the mind, you will have to drop
the mind at least for a few moments every day, so that you can be bathed
with god. And those few moments are the real moments. These are the only
moments that you have lived, all other moments will go down the drain;
they will not be saved. Only those moments that you have lived with god,
with the presence of god, are saved.</p><p>(To Donna) -- This is your new name: Ma Satori. Satori is a Japanese
name; it means a state of no-mind.</p><p>Mind is only a mechanism, but it is so close that we have become
identified with it. We have completely forgotten that we are separate.
It is as if man was born sitting in a car... from the very beginning he
is just sitting in a car, driving a car,</p><p>and there is no time, no opportunity for him to get out of the car.
Slowly slowly he will become identified with the car. Naturally, because
he has no time, no opportunity to see the separation. That's exactly the
case with the mind: we are born in it, with it, and there is no way to
get out of it so we never know the separation. This is the only problem
that has to be solved; all other problems arise out of it.</p><p>Watch the mind. Become a little more distant. See the functioning of
the mind: thoughts passing, coming and going, desires arising,
disappearing, memories passing. It is like a screen and you are the
spectator, you are the watcher. When this experience becomes
strengthened, when it becomes very solid, that you are a witness, the
shift happens. Suddenly the gestalt changes: You are no more mind, but a
new 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

liberation. After that moment there are no problems in existence, after
that moment there is no misery. Then all is joy and song and dance and
celebration.</p><p>(To Elena) -- This is your new name: Ma Mouna. Mouna means silence --
and that is going to be the key for you. Be more and more silent.
Whenever you have the opportunity just sit silently doing nothing, not
even doing meditation. Just sit silently, for no reason, for no purpose,
slowly slowly silence grows. It becomes an overwhelming experience.</p><p>And when silence has permeated you through and through, you will know
who you are and you will know what this life is all about. In knowing it
one knows god.</p><p>(To Evangelos) -- This is your new name: Swami Veetmano. Veetmano
means beyond the mind.</p><p>Truth is beyond the mind. Philosophy fails for the simple reason that
philosophy is mind and nothing else and truth is never going to be a
conclusion of the mind. it is an experience when mind ceases to
exist.</p><p>When all the noise that mind makes has disappeared, then you know
something within yourself; something surfaces from you own depths -- and
that is truth. It is not a conclusion arrived at by mind, it's something
that surfaces only when mind is no more present.</p><p>Mind is the barrier, the block. It is like a rock: it does not allow
your own inner depth to speak to you My work here consists only of one
thing: helping you to go beyond the mind.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

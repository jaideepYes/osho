It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your new name: Swami Amrito. It mean the immortal one.\nOnly the body dies, we never die. We go on changing bodies like one changes clothes, but the real one is beyond birth and death.\nThis is your new name: Ma Veet Hilde. Veet means beyond, hilde means war.\nMan is constantly is a state of war with others and with himself. We have been taught to be always in a kind of struggle. We have become conditioned to the idea that life is a struggle, the survival of the fittest.\nConsciously we fight, unconsciously we fight. Even when we love there is fight. The fight has become so engrained that it has almost become our nature. Sooner or later the fight will erupt with whoever is close to you.\nNow the psychologists have started calling lovers intimate enemies, and there is truth in it. There is a kind of intimacy, they are close, but enmity is there. Even in a loving relationship there is war, anger, aggression, an effort to dominate the other, an effort not to be dominated by the other. One is constantly on guard. One cannot relax. And without relaxation there is no religion. Without total relaxation\nthere is not god. It is only in a relaxed state, utterly relaxed, that you come to feel the presence of something divine that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npermeates and pervades the whole existence.\nTo be a sannyasins means going beyond all kinds of conflict, falling in love with love itself.\nThis is your name: Ma Sonia. It has many meanings and all the meanings are beautiful and very deeply related. Although they come from different languages, a subtle undercurrent connects them.\nThe first meaning is Greek -- it means wisdom. Wisdom is your capacity to understand existence. It is not a question of being well-informed, well-educated, well-studied. One may be absolutely uneducated, one may know nothing about books, yet one can be absolutely intelligent. That intelligence which does not come from the outside is wisdom. It grows within you. You are born with it. Nobody is born with knowledge, everybody is born with wisdom. Knowledge is given later on, it is a conditioning. But wisdom is our innermost core.\nTo attain to wisdom one has to put knowledge aside. Knowledge functions as a barrier, like a rock.\nSprings of wisdom cannot know. Hence those who have really understood life and existence, all agree on one thing, one has to be innocent to be wise. Socrates is right when he says: I know only one thing, that I know nothing. That is the quintessence of wisdom.\nThe second meaning comes from Persian. In Persian sonia means purity. If one is innocent one is pure, one need not try to be pure. Innocence has the fragrance of purity. Purity does not mean moral, virtuous, etcetera. It simply means a childlike capacity to wonder, to be in awe. Seeing the sunset, the stars in the night, one is simply silent. The beauty is so overwhelming that the mind stops. And the stopping of the mind is purity, no-mind is purity.\nThe third meaning comes from Hebrew. In Hebrew it means the seer... not the knower but the seer. The blind man can know about light, but he cannot see. Knowing about light is not knowing light itself, to know light itself one has to see. And the same is true with truth, with god. One seeds new eyes, a new capacity to see.\nAnd the fourth meaning comes from the Indian languages; the it means golden. Wisdom, purity, the capacity to see -- these are the most valuable phenomena. They are golden, real gold.\nSo remember all these meanings and remember that they have to be transformed into reality.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Robert. Anand means bliss, joy, cheerfulness. Robert means bright, radiant.\nBliss cannot be otherwise. It is bound to be radiant. It vibrates, it pulsates, it creates an aura around you.\nThose who have eyes can see it, and those who have ears can hear the music of it, and those who have hearts can feel the love flowing through it.\nBliss has one intrinsic quality: it wants to be shared, it wants to reach others. It is just the opposite of misery. When you are miserable you want o be closed you shrink. You don't want to see anybody, you don't want to meet anybody. The extreme is suicide.\nSuicide simply means 'I don't want to be seen again or to see anybody again. I don't want to relate in any way. I disconnect myself from life totally.' That is the extreme of misery. One wants simply to disappear form life itself, because if you are alive you will have to relate. Some way or other you will have to communicate and misery does not want to relate or communicate. Misery makes you a windowless phenomenon. You become encapsulated.\nIt is just the opposite of bliss. Bliss opens you up. You become all windows. Walls disappear. You are simply windows and windows. You are just an open phenomenon, available, vulnerable. Suddenly you start exploding, your energy starts spreading. A single blissful person, a Jesus or a Buddha, changes the quality of the whole of the earth.\nWe cannot think of humanity without Buddha, Jesus, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu. Just delete one dozen names from the history of humanity and man would be back to the animal stage. Man would have lost all that is valuable. These few individuals became so blissful that they made the whole earth radian t with their existence.\nBuddha says: When one single person becomes enlightened the whole existence takes a step upwards., the plane of consciousness changes immediately.\nThis is your name: Swami Hans. Hans means a gracious gift of god. We take your life for granted, that's why ;we never become aware of its immense value. We take it so much for granted that we never thank existence for it, we never feel grateful. On the contrary, we are full of complaints.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo be a sannyasin means changing the whole gestalt from complaints, because whatsoever has been given to us is more that we deserve. We cannot ask for more. Even what has been given is already more, we are not worthy of it.\nBut this is the stupidity of the human mind. Whatsoever you give to it, it starts taking for granted, its starts feeling it has a birthright to it, and then from there it starts asking for more. And if more is not given then there is great misery.\nEverybody is miserable because of this constant hankering for more. Contentment arises the moment you see that whatsoever has been given is already more, more than you could have ever expected, more than you are worthy of, more than you have ever earned. When you see that gracious gift of love, of life, of all that you are capable of -- music, poetry, beauty, of experiencing a thousand and one things -- you will feel grateful, grateful to some unknown energy. Call it god, existence, truth, the universe, but you will feel grateful. And the moment gratefulness arises you are changing from an irreligious person into a religious person.\nReligion does not mean going regularly to the church or to the temple. It means\ngratefulness, being constantly in a state of gratitude, in a thankfulness. That is what prayer is. There is no need for any other prayer.\nThis is your new name: Swami Vinito.\nVinito means humble. But humble does not mean what it ordinarily means in the dictionaries. There it means that one has to cultivate a quality of humbleness.\nWhen I use the word 'humble' I mean egolessness, nothing to do with cultivating a certain quality of humbleness. If the ego remains inside, you can cultivate the quality of being humble but it will simply be ego in a new, beautiful garment. It will be pious, but it will be the same ego. Nothing has changed; you remain the same. In fact it is far more dangerous, because now it will be difficult for you to find it; it will be hiding in deeper recesses of your being. The ordinary egoist is on the surface, the pious egoist is very subtle, he hides deep down.\nHumbleness to me simply means egolessness. It is not a virtue to be cultivated, but it is a consciousness to be raised; it is something inner. You have to drop the idea, \"I am separate from existence.\" The moment you drop the idea of separation, all ideas of superiority or inferiority disappear. That disappearance of superiority and inferiority is true humbleness, authentic humbleness. That's the goal of sannyas.\nWe don't cultivate a character, we create a consciousness.\nThis is your new name: Swami Sahajo. Sahajo means natural, spontaneous.\nMan can function in two ways. One is out of memory. Then whatsoever he does is a kind of reaction. He is not responding to reality, he is functioning out of his past. He is not spontaneous. He has some principles about what to do, what not to do. He has a certain ideology to be followed. Rather than responding to the reality that he is encountering he is responding to his past ideology. He will always be missing the point.\nAnd that creates great frustration in life, because you always go on missing the target, you are always falling short. You always reach the station when the train has left.\nOne has to be spontaneous in life, one has to be responsible. By responsibility I don't mean that one has to be very dutiful. That is the wrong meaning of the\nword 'responsibility'. Responsibility simply means capacity to respond not according to the past but according to the present moment, reflecting the reality that is in front of you.\nAct out of your presence, awareness, act out of your totality. Then you action is a response, it is no more a reaction, and every response brings a deep fulfillment.\nIf life becomes responsible in this sense, then each moment brings more and more maturity, growth, fulfillment, contentment and you start feeling grounded, rooted, centered, integrated. And to be integrated is to be reborn. That is the beginning of a real life. Before that we are only in a kind of womb, a psychological womb. One has to come out of it.\nSocrates has said: The function of the master is that of a midwife. He is right. The function of the master is exactly that of a midwife. He helps you to come out of the psychological womb.\nThis is your new name: Swami Abhinavo. Abhinavo means the new, the fresh.\nDon't live in the past. That is dead, that is gone and gone forever. Don't live in the future either. That is not yet, and it is not going to be according to you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove in the moment. Moment to moment living is sannyas, neither bothering about the past not about the future. This moment is enough. One lives with one's totality because there is nothing that is holding one back and there is nothing that has already gone ahead. You are totally here, totally now, not in fragments.\nPeople are in fragments. Ninety per cent are somewhere in the womb and if you look in the present there is nothing. Between their past and their future their present disappears.\nThis is the wrong way to live, the stupid way to live. The right way to live is to\nlet your past and future disappear so that your whole energy pours into the present. That is meditation, and that is the only way to meet god because god is always now and here. And it will keep you young and fresh. It will keep you always alert and aware. And the more aware you are, the more you know the beauty of existence, the joy of existence, the sheer grandeur of it all.\nThis is your new name: Swami Pradipo. Pradipo means a lamp.\nThe last statement of Gautam the Buddha to his disciples was: Be a lamp onto yourself. That is a tremendously significant message.\nNobody else can be a light for you. Buddhas can point the way but you have to walk, and you have to walk according to your light. The capacity to create light is there. All that is needed to create the light is inside you, it is just that you have not looked there.\nOnce you search within you will find everything that is needed to create a flame. Nothing has to be imported from the outside, the inner is so absolutely rich. We are born with everything that is really needed, but we become so much interested in the unnecessary, in the accidental, that we completely forget the intrinsic, the inner, the innate.\nSannyas has to be a turning point, a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn from the outside towards the inner. And soon you will be surprised that all that you have been desiring and longing for has been waiting there for you since the very beginning.\nJesus says: The kingdom of god is within you.… But you are not there. You are rushing in all directions.\nTo ignore oneself is the only ignorance in the world, and to know oneself is the only phenomenon worth knowing, the only knowledge, the only real knowledge.\nThis is your name: Swami Chinmayo. Chinmayo means consciousness.\nConsciousness is our true reality. We are not the body, we are not the mind; we are the witness of it all.\nWe can watch the mind and its functionings; we are the watcher.\nOne has to become more and more centered in the process of watching. One has to disidentify oneself from the bodymind complex and this is the whole process of meditation: the process of disidentification.\nThat is the negative part of the process. And the positive part is centering into the process of witnessing, becoming more and more rooted in watchfulness.\nThese two things done, the negative and the positive -- disidentification with the bodymind complex and centering in the process of awareness -- that's the whole of religion. Nothing else is needed. No scripture, no doctrine, no dogma. This is enough to liberate. More than that is an unnecessary burden.\nDance Til the Stars Come Down From the Rafters Chapter #17\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2498","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_till_the_stars_come_down_from_the_rafters/>Dance Till The Stars Come Down From The Rafters</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2498 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Till_The_Stars_Come_Down_From_The_Rafters/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

exploding, your energy starts spreading. A single blissful person, a
Jesus or a Buddha, changes the quality of the whole of the earth.</p><p>We cannot think of humanity without Buddha, Jesus, Zarathustra, Lao
Tzu. Just delete one dozen names from the history of humanity and man
would be back to the animal stage. Man would have lost all that is
valuable. These few individuals became so blissful that they made the
whole earth radian t with their existence.</p><p>Buddha says: When one single person becomes enlightened the whole
existence takes a step upwards., the plane of consciousness changes
immediately.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Hans. Hans means a gracious gift of god. We
take your life for granted, that's why ;we never become aware of its
immense value. We take it so much for granted that we never thank
existence for it, we never feel grateful. On the contrary, we are full
of complaints.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>To be a sannyasin means changing the whole gestalt from complaints,
because whatsoever has been given to us is more that we deserve. We
cannot ask for more. Even what has been given is already more, we are
not worthy of it.</p><p>But this is the stupidity of the human mind. Whatsoever you give to
it, it starts taking for granted, its starts feeling it has a birthright
to it, and then from there it starts asking for more. And if more is not
given then there is great misery.</p><p>Everybody is miserable because of this constant hankering for more.
Contentment arises the moment you see that whatsoever has been given is
already more, more than you could have ever expected, more than you are
worthy of, more than you have ever earned. When you see that gracious
gift of love, of life, of all that you are capable of -- music, poetry,
beauty, of experiencing a thousand and one things -- you will feel
grateful, grateful to some unknown energy. Call it god, existence,
truth, the universe, but you will feel grateful. And the moment
gratefulness arises you are changing from an irreligious person into a
religious person.</p><p>Religion does not mean going regularly to the church or to the
temple. It means</p><p>gratefulness, being constantly in a state of gratitude, in a
thankfulness. That is what prayer is. There is no need for any other
prayer.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Vinito.</p><p>Vinito means humble. But humble does not mean what it ordinarily
means in the dictionaries. There it means that one has to cultivate a
quality of humbleness.</p><p>When I use the word 'humble' I mean egolessness, nothing to do with
cultivating a certain quality of humbleness. If the ego remains inside,
you can cultivate the quality of being humble but it will simply be ego
in a new, beautiful garment. It will be pious, but it will be the same
ego. Nothing has changed; you remain the same. In fact it is far more
dangerous, because now it will be difficult for you to find it; it will
be hiding in deeper recesses of your being. The ordinary egoist is on
the surface, the pious egoist is very subtle, he hides deep down.</p><p>Humbleness to me simply means egolessness. It is not a virtue to be
cultivated, but it is a consciousness to be raised; it is something
inner. You have to drop the idea, "I am separate from existence." The
moment you drop the idea of separation, all ideas of superiority or
inferiority disappear. That disappearance of superiority and inferiority
is true humbleness, authentic humbleness. That's the goal of
sannyas.</p><p>We don't cultivate a character, we create a consciousness.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Sahajo. Sahajo means natural,
spontaneous.</p><p>Man can function in two ways. One is out of memory. Then whatsoever
he does is a kind of reaction. He is not responding to reality, he is
functioning out of his past. He is not spontaneous. He has some
principles about what to do, what not to do. He has a certain ideology
to be followed. Rather than responding to the reality that he is
encountering he is responding to his past ideology. He will always be
missing the point.</p><p>And that creates great frustration in life, because you always go on
missing the target, you are always falling short. You always reach the
station when the train has left.</p><p>One has to be spontaneous in life, one has to be responsible. By
responsibility I don't mean that one has to be very dutiful. That is the
wrong meaning of the</p><p>word 'responsibility'. Responsibility simply means capacity to
respond not according to the past but according to the present moment,
reflecting the reality that is in front of you.</p><p>Act out of your presence, awareness, act out of your totality. Then
you action is a response, it is no more a reaction, and every response
brings a deep fulfillment.</p><p>If life becomes responsible in this sense, then each moment brings
more and more maturity, growth, fulfillment, contentment and you start
feeling grounded, rooted, centered, integrated. And to be integrated is
to be reborn. That is the beginning of a real life. Before that we are
only in a kind of womb, a psychological womb. One has to come out of
it.</p><p>Socrates has said: The function of the master is that of a midwife.
He is right. The function of the master is exactly that of a midwife. He
helps you to come out of the psychological womb.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Abhinavo. Abhinavo means the new, the
fresh.</p><p>Don't live in the past. That is dead, that is gone and gone forever.
Don't live in the future either. That is not yet, and it is not going to
be according to you.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Love in the moment. Moment to moment living is sannyas, neither
bothering about the past not about the future. <em>This</em> moment is
enough. One lives with one's totality because there is nothing that is
holding one back and there is nothing that has already gone ahead. You
are totally here, totally now, not in fragments.</p><p>People are in fragments. Ninety per cent are somewhere in the womb
and if you look in the present there is nothing. Between their past and
their future their present disappears.</p><p>This is the wrong way to live, the stupid way to live. The right way
to live is to</p><p>let your past and future disappear so that your whole energy pours
into the present. That is meditation, and that is the only way to meet
god because god is always now and here. And it will keep you young and
fresh. It will keep you always alert and aware. And the more aware you
are, the more you know the beauty of existence, the joy of existence,
the sheer grandeur of it all.</p><p>This is your new name: Swami Pradipo. Pradipo means a lamp.</p><p>The last statement of Gautam the Buddha to his disciples was: Be a
lamp onto yourself. That is a tremendously significant message.</p><p>Nobody else can be a light for you. Buddhas can point the way but you
have to walk, and you have to walk according to your light. The capacity
to create light is there. All that is needed to create the light is
inside you, it is just that you have not looked there.</p><p>Once you search within you will find everything that is needed to
create a flame. Nothing has to be imported from the outside, the inner
is so absolutely rich. We are born with everything that is really
needed, but we become so much interested in the unnecessary, in the
accidental, that we completely forget the intrinsic, the inner, the
innate.</p><p>Sannyas has to be a turning point, a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree
turn from the outside towards the inner. And soon you will be surprised
that all that you have been desiring and longing for has been waiting
there for you since the very beginning.</p><p>Jesus says: The kingdom of god is within you.… But <em>you</em> are
not there. You are rushing in all directions.</p><p>To ignore oneself is the only ignorance in the world, and to know
oneself is the only phenomenon worth knowing, the only knowledge, the
only real knowledge.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Chinmayo. Chinmayo means consciousness.</p><p>Consciousness is our true reality. We are not the body, we are not
the mind; we are the witness of it all.</p><p>We can watch the mind and its functionings; we are the watcher.</p><p>One has to become more and more centered in the process of watching.
One has to disidentify oneself from the bodymind complex and this is the
whole process of meditation: the process of disidentification.</p><p>That is the negative part of the process. And the positive part is
centering into the process of witnessing, becoming more and more rooted
in watchfulness.</p><p>These two things done, the negative and the positive --
disidentification with the bodymind complex and centering in the process
of awareness -- that's the whole of religion. Nothing else is needed. No
scripture, no doctrine, no dogma. This is enough to liberate. More than
that is an unnecessary burden.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=dance-til-the-stars-come-down-from-the-rafters>Dance Til the Stars

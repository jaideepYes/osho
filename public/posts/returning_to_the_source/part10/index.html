SO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD AND HIS CLOTHES ALSO ROSE UP, CLOSE TO HIS BODY.\nIT WAS DECIDED TO CARRY HIM TO THE BURNING GROUND, BUT HE STILL STOOD THERE WITHOUT MOVING. PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE SCENE.\nHIS YOUNGER SISTER, A NUN, HAPPENED TO BE THERE. SHE GRUMBLED AT HIM: WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE, YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF LAWS AND CUSTOMS; AND EVEN NOW YOU’RE DEAD, YOU’RE MAKING A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF.\nSHE THEN PRODDED HER BROTHER WITH HER FINGER, AND HE FELL DOWN WITH A BANG. THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THE CREMATORIUM.\nDeath is the root of all fear, and if there is fear, you cannot live. With fear there is no life. If there is fear you are already dead.\nThis is the vicious circle – you are afraid of death, and because of fear you cannot live, you are already dead. Then you become more afraid and the fear creeps into your very center; you become just a trembling.\nAs I see you, you are just a trembling. If you dig deeply, you will always find the fear of death. This fear is the root of all fears. In any fear, whatsoever the form of the fear, somewhere the fear of death is hidden. Why are people so afraid of death? Is death really a phenomenon to be afraid of?\nThe first thing to remember is that you don’t know death. You have not known it, so how can you be afraid of something that you don’t know? that’s impossible. You can be afraid of something you know, but of something that is totally unknown, absolutely unknown how can you be afraid? Fear needs an object to be afraid of.\nYou cannot really be afraid of death, you must be afraid of something else. That something else is an unfulfilled life – you have not been able to live, you have not been able to achieve a fulfillment, you have not been able to overflow, you have not been able to celebrate. Your life has been an emptiness, a hollowness, a nothing.\nDeath is coming near and you have not been able to live yet – this creates the fear. Death is coming near and you will be no more, the opportunity is being taken away. Every moment you are losing life and you have not lived yet – this creates the fear.\nDeath is approaching – that is not the fear, The fear is that you have not lived yet and death is knocking at the door; the time to leave has come and you are yet unfulfilled. If you have lived, you have a fulfillment, a contentment, a deep gratitude. You have flowered – there is nothing more to achieve. Then you are not afraid of death; rather, you welcome it.\nYou have achieved: now death comes like a deep sleep after the day’s labour – a whole day of achievement, of fulfillment, of reaching, of meeting, of encountering, of flowering, and then death comes like a deep sleep. You welcome it. When the tree has flowered, death is welcome; when the tree is still struggling to flower, there is fear.\nIf you are afraid of death that is simply one indication that your life has been a wastage. It has been like a desert, nothing has flowered in it. It has been like a pond, closed in itself and not moving anywhere. It has not been like a river – flowing, dancing, running towards the Ultimate.\nWhen a river reaches to the ocean there is a death. When a pond dries, becomes more and more dirty, evaporates, that too is death, but both are so absolutely different.\nWhen a river reaches to the ocean it is a fulfillment because there the river will die and become something greater. It is a jump, a jump from the finite to the infinite: the river losing itself, its identity, and becoming the ocean. Nothing is lost and everything is gained.\nBut a pond drying up, not reaching anywhere, a no ocean anywhere, just drying in itself, is also dying. You are like a pond. That’s why there is the fear of death. Be like a river, and then there is no fear of death.\nDeath itself is like a sleep. Sleep is a temporary death, so if a person becomes very afraid of death he is also bound to become afraid of sleep. In the West, insomnia has now become a common phenomenon; almost everybody is suffering from it. It is not only because of mental tensions that insomnia exists. Deeper than the tensions, is fear, the fear of death. You cannot let go.\nI know a person who is so afraid of death that he cannot sleep, because he is afraid that he may die in his sleep. He tries to remain awake – he talks, reads, listens to music, but he is afraid of going into sleep. And if you are afraid for many, many days, it becomes a habit; unknowingly you create a barrier against sleep.\nIn the West people are afraid of death, and if they are afraid, how can they go into sleep? Sleep is like death, so logically they are right – if you are afraid of death, you should also be afraid of sleep. They are similar phenomena; sleep is a temporary death. After the day’s labour, the work, you are exhausted – you need a death so that you can be reborn, so that in the morning you are again rejuvenated, fresh, young. And in sleep, death is exactly what happens.\nHave you observed the fact that in sleep you are not the same person at all? You don’t remember who you are, you don’t remember whether you are rich or poor, you don’t remember your own face, you don’t remember who your father is and who your mother is; you don’t remember anything that you have learned, anything that has been cultivated in you you drop everything at the door and you go to sleep. That’s why it is so refreshing, because you get rid of yourself. You are like a burden – you leave it at the door and you fall into sleep.\nSleep opens a different dimension where identity, ego, nothing of this world exists. That’s why it is so fresh, so refreshing in the morning you come back to life, a new day starts, a new life.\nThe fear of death will automatically create a fear of sleep and a fear of love. Because love also is like death – you die in it. That’s why people cannot love. They talk about it, they fantasize, they imagine, but they never fall in love. Even if they try, they try to manipulate the phenomenon, not allow it, because love is so much like death.\nFour things are similar: death, love, sleep and meditation; their qualities are similar. And the basic similarity is that you have to dissolve – and people are afraid of all of them. If you are afraid of death you will be afraid of sleep, of love, of meditation.\nMany come to me and they say: How to love? It is not a question of how, and when you ask ‘how’, you are trying to manipulate – you would like to remain in control, so whenever you Want you can push the button on or off. You would like to remain the master of the whole thing.\nBut nobody can be in possession of love. Love possesses you, you cannot possess it. Love controls you, you cannot control it. Love means you are no longer there, something else has come. That’s why love is so rejuvenating.\nEven if an old man falls in love, suddenly, you will see that his face has become younger. His eyes are no more old; his body may be old, but his total being suddenly becomes young. Why does it happen? – for this very reason: you can allow a let-go; you move to the original source of energy where rebirth is possible. You only touch the deathless core when you are ready to die. That is the paradox – you touch the deepest core when you are ready to die. If you cling to the surface and you are afraid, afraid to let go, then you remain on the surface; and the surface is the body.\nPeople who are afraid of love are not afraid of sex. Love is dangerous, sex is not dangerous – it can be manipulated. There are now many manuals on how to do it. You can manipulate it – sex\ncan become a technique. Love can never become a technique. In sex, you try to remain in control; then even sex will not help to reach the Ultimate. It will go to a certain point and you will drop back because somewhere it also needs a let-go.\nThat is why orgasm is becoming more and more difficult. Ejaculation is not orgasm, to give birth to children is not orgasm. Orgasm is the involvement of the total body: mind, body, soul, all together you vibrate, your whole being vibrates from the toes to the head. You are no longer in control; existence has taken possession of you and you don’t know who you are. It is like a madness, it is like a sleep, it is like meditation, it is like death.\nSo even in sex, you let go up to a point, but you don’t allow totality, because if you allowed totality then the ego could not exist. And this is the problem – you are afraid of death because you are not capable of living totally.\nLove, meditation, sleep; nothing is total. In your activity you are also not total, because if you were total, there also a moment would come when you are lost. Losing yourself has become the problem, you cannot lose yourself, you cannot relax – you have to do something. You go into the garden and dig a hole, but you are not total. If you really were total while digging the hole you would forget yourself completely the self-consciousness would disappear.\nYou are self-conscious but not conscious of yourself; you are aware but there is an ego. You are aware of the total – the trees, the sun’s rays, the breezes blowing, the birds singing, your activity – the digging of the hole, the mud coming out – you are aware of everything except yourself. If you became conscious of yourself, in that moment an orgasmic feeling would happen. It is like deep love, it is like sleep, it is like death. You will come out of it totally different and new.\nIf you don’t move into a let-go, life cannot happen to you. It happens through that passage when you are not. When you are not standing in the way, then life happens to you, then you feel fulfilled. When you are fulfilled there is no fear of death. When there is no fear of death, you become more and more capable of let-go.\nAnd if you have really known what life is, who bothers about death? If you have really known what life is and celebrated it, then death is not the end – then death is the culmination, the peak, the highest let-go. Then love is nothing, a sexual orgasm is nothing, sleep is nothing. If you have lived life rightly, fully, then death is the greatest bliss, because it is the greatest let-go. The more intense and total the let-go, the more the bliss. This is the rule, this is the law. So what to do?\nIf you want to live, allow death also – it is like having two wings. It is not a thing somewhere in the end, it is a process: the day you were born you began dying. It is not life here and death there, life now and death then, no. You cannot divide them; they are together, they have to be.\nLife is death. Life and death both are two wings. The day you are born, that same day you start to die. It is a process; you inhale – it is life, you exhale – it is death. In the morning you get up – it is life, in the evening you go to bed – it is death; you work, act – it is life, then you relax – it is death; it is continuous, every moment it is there. And if you avoid death you will also be avoiding life. If you don’t want to exhale deeply how can you inhale deeply? If you don’t want to relax, how can you act deeply? – you won’t have any energy.\nIf you are afraid of sleep, in the morning you will not wake up fresh and you will feel sleepy the whole day. Then everything gets mixed up. You are neither alive nor dead, but just dragging on. And this is a bad situation – just dragging on. Either be alive or be dead, but don’t drag on. In either case, being dead totally, you will attain to a greater living totally, you will attain to a greater death, because they are two aspects of the same coin. Once you can see that life implies death, that every act of being alive is also an act of dying, you have seen the Total.\nThen life is not serious, then it is fun. It becomes serious because of the fear of death. You cannot laugh loudly because of the fear of death; you cannot enjoy because of the fear of death; you cannot do anything – because of the fear of death.\nDeath is always around the corner like a black shadow following you. It doesn’t allow you to do anything. Then you become serious and you start thinking: How to attain the deathless? Then you start searching for how to become immortal, how to find the secret, the elixir.\nThese are all nonsense searches, it is not true seeking. Nowhere does there exist something chemical, alchemical, like elixir, ambrosia – no. The secret is in seeing life and death as a single process. You cannot find the secret anywhere – the philosopher’s stone exists nowhere, it exists in this fact: that life and death are together. They are one process, a unitary phenomenon. Then you are not afraid. Then rather, on the contrary, you are thankful to death, because life becomes possible only because of death. Through death, life becomes possible; through dying everything is renewed.\nSo death is not against life, it is not the opposite, it is not the enemy. It is through death that life becomes possible – you are alive because you can die. If you cannot die, you will not be alive at all. You don’t know for what you are asking if you ask for deathlessness! Then you will be like a rock; then you cannot be alive.\nLook at the flower that bloomed this morning.Just near the flower there is a rock. By the evening,\nthe flower will be gone but the rock will be there, because the flower is more alive and the rock is not so alive. The flower is dead by the evening. What do you want? – to be a rock-like phenomenon or a flower-like phenomenon? Why does the flower die so soon? – because it is so alive, so intensely alive that death comes quickly; it doesn’t linger on. The flower was not dragging; it lived the moment, it lived totally – it danced under the sky, it enjoyed the sun, the breeze. For a moment it was eternity. The flower laughed, the flower sang, the flower did whatsoever was to be done, and by the evening, the flower was ready to die – and without a single tear in her eyes, without weeping and crying.\nLook at a dying flower – the petals have already fallen on the ground but you can never say that it is ugly – it is beautiful in death also. Then look at a man dying; he becomes ugly. Why? – because of the fear. Fear makes you ugly. If you are too afraid you will become more and more ugly. The flower is fulfilled; now the time to rest has come and the flower is going to rest, and when the rest is over the flower will come back.\nAgain and again.… Life is an eternal recurrence, death is just a rest. You need not be worried about it, you simply live. And if you live then you are not serious. If you are afraid of death, then you are serious. To be sincere is one thing, to be serious is another. A man who loves life is sincere, authentic, but never serious. Life is not like an illness. If you are looking at death and are\nobsessed with death, then life is just serious – then you will become a long-face. You may move to the monasteries, to the temples, go to the Himalayas, but you will remain a long-face. It is fear that has taken you to the monastery.\nRemember, an authentic religious person is not fear-oriented, he is love-oriented. A really authentic religious person becomes religious to enjoy life more, to enjoy it deeply and totally. He is not scared. A real religious man looks at life as a game: it is not business, it is a game. Hindus call it LEELA, a play; not even a game but a play.\nThere is a difference between a game and play. Children play, but you even make a game out of play. Then it becomes business-like, then even in playing you are seeking victory, success, gain, profit.\nLife is a play. There is nothing to be achieved out of it, it itself is the goal; there is nowhere to reach, it itself is the Ultimate. Life is not moving to achieve some goal, it is not going anywhere. It is just like children playing, you cannot ask them: For what are you playing? What is the purpose? They will laugh at your foolishness. They will say: We are simply playing. It is so beautiful! Profit is not their concern, and profit should also not be your concern, but play.\nLife is a moment to celebrate, to enjoy. Make it fun, a celebration, and then you will enter the temple. The temple is not for the long-faced, it has never been for them. Look at life – do you see sadness anywhere? Have you ever seen a tree depressed? Have you seen a bird anxiety-ridden? Have you seen an animal neurotic? No, life is not that, not at all. Only man has gone wrong somewhere, and he has gone wrong somewhere because he thinks himself to be very wise, very clever.\nYour cleverness is your disease. Don’t be too wise. Always remember to stop; don’t go to the extreme. A little foolishness and a little wisdom is good, and the right combination makes you a Buddha – a little foolishness and a little wisdom. Don’t be just wise or else you will be a long-face; don’t be just a fool or else you will become suicidal. A little foolishness, enough to enjoy life, and a little wisdom to avoid the errors – that will do.\nBut one has to know the right combination, and the right combination is always different for each individual. My right combination cannot be your right combination; nobody is a model for anybody else. You have to find your own balance because everybody is so unique. But always remember not to destroy foolishness completely, because in certain moments to be foolish is to be wise.\nEverybody should remain open. In certain moments you should be like children, in certain moments you should simply forget the business of life, purposelessly just enjoying the moment, doing foolish things: dancing and singing, playing with and collecting pebbles on the shore, and nobody inside you says: What foolishness are you doing? – this time can be devoted to making money. At this time you could be in the office or in the shop and your bank balance could be growing. What are you doing – are you a child?\nIf the child in you is completely lost, then you can never be religious. Religion is for children. That’s why Jesus insists: Only those who are like children will be able to enter into the kingdom of my God. But what does being a child mean? Observe a child – he is wise. He is a fool also, but when it is needed he can be wise, very wise.\nI was staying with a family for a few days and a small boy in the family was reading a book. On the book cover there was a picture of Atlas supporting the earth. So I asked the child: Do you know who this Atlas is? He said: Yes, he is a great giant who supports the whole world. So I said to him: Correct, but who supports Atlas? He thought for a moment and then he said: I think he must have married a rich wife.\nThey can be wise, and they are fools. When a child is wise the wisdom has the freshness of a dew drop in the morning – it is not stale. Your wisdom is stale, contaminated. You have collected it, you have borrowed it, you have taken it from others – it is not your own. What do you know that is your own? You have collected from many sources. That is knowledge, not wisdom.\nWisdom is a response, a fresh response to the moment; knowledge is an old, rotten, collected thing. You don’t respond to the moment; you bring the past, the memory into it and you react through it. Wisdom is response, knowledge is reaction. To already have the answer, a ready-made answer before the question has been raised – is not wisdom. A child is wise because he has no knowledge. He has to look around, he has to feel, he has to think, he has to respond – he does not know.\nIt is a Christian myth that when Jesus went to the sea he sea turned into red wine. Christian theologians have been trying to explain it: How can the sea turn into red wine? They have had much difficulty; puzzled, and no answer has yet been found. But a small child found the answer – that small child was Lord Byron, who became very famous later on as a great poet.\nHe was a small child in school and the question was asked: Why and how did the sea turn into red wine when Jesus reached it? The answer was fixed, ready-made; it had been taught already. All the other children started writing their answers, only Byron waited with closed eyes. The teacher came many times, but he was so meditative that she thought it better not to disturb him – he was thinking so much.\nAnd of what can a child think? – because thinking is always of the known. If you know, you can think; if you don’t know, what can you think?\nThinking is possible only if you know something – then you can think. But if you don’t know, you don’t know. What was he doing? – the child was sitting silently, but he looked so beautiful. Then in the end he simply wrote a single sentence, and the sentence was: Seeing that my Lord had come; the sea became shy and turned red.\nWhen Jesus had come, my Lord had come; and the sea, seeing that my Lord had come became shy like a girl. The beloved has come, and that shyness was on the face of the sea. Only a child can answer that way because he does not know the answer – but this is beautiful! All the theologians are foolish before this child. He had said the right thing; he had explained the whole thing.\nA certain wisdom exists when you are innocent. But innocence is ignorance, and of course, a certain foolishness exists when you are innocent, when you are ignorant. A child is beautiful because he is both – innocent, wise in his innocence, and a fool, foolish in his innocence. And a child is the right proportion for you. Remember, you will have to attain to a second childhood before you can enter into the Kingdom of God.\nA second childhood is even more beautiful than the first, because in the first you were not aware. In the second you will be fully aware. This is how Zen Masters behave – you will find them sometimes just foolish, and in certain moments you will find them so wise that you cannot believe how this foolishness can exist with such wisdom. And you in your knowledge also are foolish, but your foolishness is contaminated, it is not innocent. When foolishness is innocent it has a wisdom of its own, and when foolishness is contaminated by knowledge it is simply idiocy; it has no wisdom.\nI have heard that Albert Einstein was staying with a very knowledgeable woman who knew much. In the night they were sitting near the window and the woman said: Look outside Dr. Einstein. This star, this Venus is so beautiful; it looks like a beautiful woman. Einstein said: My dear lady, it is not Venus, it is Jupiter. The lady said: Dr. Einstein, you are simply amazing! – you can even judge the sex of a planet from such a far away distance! She said: Venus? – Venus is feminine, Jupiter is masculine. You are amazing! How can you judge the sex of a star from so far away? And the woman was very knowledgeable, a professor in some university, but foolish in her knowledge.\nAnd whenever you are foolish through your ‘knowledgeability’ you are idiotic, simply idiotic. Be foolish like a child: if you don’t know, you don’t know – don’t pretend. A child can simply say: I don’t know. Can you say so simply that you don’t know? It is so difficult to say ‘I don’t know,’ because when you say it the ‘I’ drops. And unless you can say that you don’t know, you will never be wise. Only through ignorance does the ego drop, and when there is no ego you have attained to a second childhood.\nYou will not be able to understand this Zen Master if you can’t see this quality of a wise fool, of foolishness in one’s wisdom – a man who takes life as fun. When he takes life as fun he also takes death as fun. Nothing is a problem to him – he accepts everything, he is playful. Now try to understand this beautiful story.\nWHEN TENG YIN FENG WAS ABOUT TO DIE – he was a Master, a very well known Master – HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM: I HAVE SEEN MONKS DIE SITTING AND LYING, BUT HAVE ANY DIED STANDING?’ YES, SOME,’ THEY REPLIED.’HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN?’ ASKED TENG. ‘NO, NEVER SUCH A THING,’ THEY SAID.\nDeath is coming near, death is going to knock at the door, and the Master says: How shall I receive it? – the guest is coming; how shall I be the host, how shall I receive it?\nYou die, a Master receives death. You die clinging to life, not ready to die. You have to be snatched away and that’s why your whole being becomes ugly. A Master prepares; he is even asking for the posture: What posture shall I die in? Because death should be received in a unique way. It doesn’t come every day; it is a rare guest. One should prepare, one should be ready.\nAnd what type of Master was this Teng to say: I have seen monks die sitting and lying.Ordinarily,\npeople die lying on their backs, not even sitting. Only a few people, those who die in meditation, who die meditatively, die sitting. Otherwise, ninety-nine percent of the people die on a bed.\n... BUT HAVE ANY DIED STANDING?’ YES, SOME,’ THEY REPLIED.\nA few people, a few rare persons have died standing. They too die standing because they are very meditative. There are certain techniques which can only be done standing. For example, Jain\ntechniques, Mahavir and his techniques, all have to be done standing. He meditated standing for years; he would sit only when tired, otherwise he would stand.\nA certain silence immediately comes to you if you stand quietly. Try it in the corner of your room: just in the corner stand silently, not doing anything – suddenly the energy also stands inside you. Sitting, you will feel many disturbances in the mind, because sitting is a posture of a thinker. Standing, the energy flows like a pillar and is distributed equally all over the body. Standing is beautiful.\nA technique is to do the meditation just standing – try it because some of you will find it very, very beautiful. If you can stand for one hour, it is just wonderful. Just by standing and not doing anything, not moving, you will find that something settles within you, becomes silent. A centering happens, and you will feel yourself like a pillar of energy; the body disappears. So a few meditators have died standing.\n‘HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN?’ ASKED TENG.\nStanding in a SHIRSASHAN, a head-stand posture; nobody has ever died like that! You cannot even sleep in that posture; dying must be very difficult because the blood circulates towards the head. So nobody has ever tried this Teng is the only one who has not only tried it, he did it. It was an absolutely impossible posture for dying because you cannot even sleep in it.\nFor sleep, a certain phenomenon is needed in the body: the blood should not be circulating towards the head. That’s why we use pillows, to make the head a little higher than the body so the blood is not flowing towards the head. If the blood is flowing towards the head, the head continues thinking. The more civilized you become, the more the size of your pillows increase; then you need one, two, tree pillows. A great thinker has to use five, six, seven pillows, because the blood circulation has to be stopped. That’s why after eating, sleep becomes easier because the blood circulates towards the stomach. The body now has a more basic function to perform and that is to digest the food. Thinking cannot be allowed; thinking is a luxury.\nWhen you have eaten too much, then you can think; when you are starving you cannot think. That’s why many religions have used fasting as a meditation, because if you fast you cannot think. The body needs energy for more basic functions; energy cannot be given to the head – it is a luxury. That’s why animals don’t think, they have not come to that standard of life yet.\nThe more rich a country, the more thinking there is; the poorer a country, the less thinking there is, because you cannot afford energy for thinking. If you fast, you will feel that in the night it is difficult to sleep, very difficult, because with nothing to digest the whole energy moves towards the head. The movement of energy towards the head has to be stopped, only then you can sleep. It is difficult to sleep standing in an upside-down posture.\n‘HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN’ ASKED TENG. ‘NO, NEVER SUCH A THING,’ THEY SAID.\n– ’We have never heard of it, what are you talking about? A person standing on his head and dying?’SO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD, AND HIS CLOTHES ALSO ROSE UP, CLOSE\nTO HIS BODY. That is possible. Until a few years ago, it would have simply been a myth, but now there are scientific explanations for it. It is possible because the body is electricity, it is nothing but\nbio-electricity. When somebody dies, the body becomes a pillar of energy and that pillar leaves the body. If it is very magnetic energy, as it has to be with a Master, the clothes will just be magnetized.\nNot only did Teng die upside-down, but his clothes rose with his body, they clung to the body. If you rub your clothes on your body you will feel a certain electricity created in the clothes. The body is electric and when the body dies the electricity leaves the body; it is pulled upwards. Just with that flow those clothes might have risen. There is no need to think about it as a myth or a story – it is possible.\nSO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD.\nIs death so easy that you can die upside-down? Yes, death is easy if you have lived. Then you can choose the right moment to die. You must have heard about many saints making a prediction that they will be dying on a certain day, a certain time. People think that they know how to read the future. That is nonsense, nobody can read the future. Future means that which remains invisible. Then what do they do?\nIf I say to you: After seven days pass I will be dying in the morning at six o’clock sharp – so don’t miss it, then what will you think? You will think: How is it possible? To the mind, the only possibility seems to be that somehow I know the future. That is not the truth, nobody knows the future. But a man who has lived totally can decide when to die. He is not predicting, he is simply saying that he has decided to die on a certain day at six o’clock in the morning.\nIf you have lived – and when I say lived, I mean totally thenyouknowwhatlife−\nenergyis.Y oucometoknowallthenooksandcrannies.oflifeenergy;thenyouknowallitstides, whenitcome\n−thenyouknowallitsnuances.Ifyouhavelivedtotally, youknowyourselftotally.Thenyoucandecidewhen\nIwillleavethisroomatsixotclock.Whatistheproblem?−\n−atsixotclockyouleavetheroom!Butyouhavetoknowyourself, theroom, andwherethedooris.\nYOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHO YOU ARE; you are aware of only a very minute fragment of your being: that is your mind – and that too, not fully. Nine tenths of your being remains a dark continent; it is yet an Africa, you never enter into it. In your inner being the geography is not yet completely mapped; you don’t have your own map. Once you know your map, the inner geography, the topography, then when the right moment has come, you can simply decide to leave. You can leave this body because this body is just a house, an abode – it is not you. A Master is unidentified with the body, unidentified with the mind; he can decide. So Teng stood on his head and died. Even this impossible posture of standing on one’s head can be used. If you know how to live, you know how to die, because they are both one.\nAnother thing to be understood is why was he joking about death? Death is a serious affair and he is making fun of it! Standing on his head, he is making fun of death. He is saying that if you have lived, lived a life of celebrations, then you can die celebrating – it is fun. When you know that you are not going to die, that something in you is eternal, then the whole of life becomes fun. It is a great cosmic joke and you can play with it.\nIn his death, Teng was giving a message to his disciples: Everything is fun, don’t be too concerned about anything. Just live the moment while it lasts, live it and enjoy it!\nThis is my feeling also: that if there is any God, He is not going to ask you: What right things have you done and what bad things have you done; what sins have you committed and what virtues have you followed, no. If there is any God, He is going to ask: Has your life been a celebration or a sadness? That’s the only thing that can be asked.\nWhen the whole existence celebrates, why are you standing separate, alone, isolated? And then you feel that you are a stranger. When flowers flower, Why do you stand aloof? – why not flower? When birds sing, why do you stand aloof? why not sing, why not become a participant?\nReligion is a participation in the mystique that is all around you, in the mystery that is all around you. It is not an effort to know, it is an effort to be, to be a participant. Then everything is beautiful – life is beautiful and death is beautiful, and you can play a joke.\nA rare man this Teng was. The disciples were very afraid of what to do. Never before had there been such a precedent; nobody had died standing on his head. What to do with such a man?\nIT WAS DECIDED TO CARRY HIM TO THE BURNING GROUND, BUT HE STILL STOOD THERE WITHOUT MOVING.\nIf you have been an energy pillar in life, an unmoving pillar, if you have attained anything in life that has become crystallized, then you can even use your death.\nThere are many versions of this story. In one version the sister came and said: Why are you making a fool of yourself? Teng laughed and fell dead.\nPEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE SCENE. HIS YOUNGER SISTER, A NUN, HAPPENED TO BE THERE.\nShe lived in another monastery for women. She came, not because the brother had died, she came just to see the foolishness that he was doing. She was a sister to Teng and she could teach him the last lesson.\nSHE GRUMBLED AT HIM: WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF LAWS AND CUSTOMS, AND EVEN NOW YOU ARE DEAD, YOU’RE MAKING A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF.\nThis Teng is one of the rebellious Zen Masters. He lived a life without any laws and without any regulations. He lived a life without any enforced discipline. Not that he was not disciplined, he was absolutely disciplined, otherwise how could he have stood on his head and died? He was not only disciplined in life, he was disciplined in his death.\nYou cannot find such an absolute discipline with no enforced discipline. This discipline came from his inside – he followed his own way, he never followed anybody. He had rules but the rules were not fixed by any outside code; they came out of his own awareness. Of course, he was a nuisance to other people.\nIt is said of Teng that when he lived with his own Master and was himself a disciple, he would sleep long after everybody else was up and the whole monastery was working. It would be nine o’clock\nin the morning and he would still be sleeping. Once the Master came and he said: Teng, what are you doing? This is a monastery – one has to get up in the BRAHAM MURHUT, at five o’clock. It is reported that Teng said: Of course I always get up in the morning, I always get up in the BRAHAM MURHUT! The Master said: What are you saying? It is nine o’clock; four hours ago the sun has risen! Teng said: Whenever the braham within me wants to get up, then I get up. That is the braham murhut, the moment of God. When the God within me wants to get up, who am I to make rules? – I get up immediately, I never lose a single moment. Whenever the God within me wants to get up, jump out of the bed; whenever he wants to go to bed, I jump into bed. Who am I, Master, to create a disturbance? And the Master said: You are right – you have found the right braham murhut.\nIt is said about him that he would never eat according to rules, because in a Buddhist monastery you have to follow rules, everything is fixed. That has a beauty of its own, and for some people, that fixed routine suits very well. But don’t try to follow Teng; you may not be a Teng.\nRemember, for some people, almost fifty percent, a routine helps, because whenever something becomes routine, you need not worry about it, it takes care of itself. If it is five o’clock, you have to get up. You need not decide it every day, because to decide every day will create more anxiety and thinking. If it is six o’clock, you have to go to the meditation, so you go; it is seven o’clock, so you go for breakfast. At breakfast, fixed things are given every day, so you need not think about what is going to be given. You need not even desire because there is no point – the breakfast is fixed, it is always the same. And this way the routine continues. By and by, it becomes a robot-like thing around you; you are completely free of decisions. You can do other things – you can meditate, you can become aware; you need not be worried about the petty things around you. To fifty percent of the people, this suits perfectly; to fifty percent this never suits. To fix themselves into a routine becomes a worry and an anxiety for them; they are not made that way.\nOne has to feel oneself, one has to feel how one is made and never follow anything else. First just feel yourself, and there are only two possibilities: either you can live a life of spontaneity, or you can live a life of discipline. Both are good because the basic thing is to become alert and aware.\nTeng never followed any rules – whenever he felt hungry, he would eat, even though it might be midnight, whenever he was not hungry, he would not eat, although many days would pass. It was not fasting because fasting has to be forced. It was not a fast, he was not feeling hungry so it was okay, he would not eat. Many nights he would not sleep if he was not feeling sleepy; if he was feeling, for days together he would sleep.\nThat’s why the sister said: WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF LAWS AND CUSTOMS, AND EVEN NOW YOU ARE DEAD, YOU ARE MAKING A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF.\nThe sister was also an Enlightened woman, otherwise she would have been crying and weeping. She is not crying and weeping; on the contrary, she is giving right advice to this dying man – a fool who was always a nuisance. Now, even in death, the sister is a totally different type.\nThis has been my feeling: that women are the types who will need an outer discipline. In that fifty percent of people, forty per cent will always be women who would need discipline. There are reasons for it: the whole of nature has made women to follow a certain law. That’s why every twenty-eight days the period comes, the body follows a routine. If there is something wrong, only then is that discipline broken. Otherwise, it is absolutely fixed.\nA woman’s body follows laws – it has to because she is going to give birth to a child; she is going to become a mother and a child cannot be left with somebody who moves in an individual way. A woman has a collective unconscious, not an individual unconscious. She has to, because a purpose has to be fulfilled through her – the child will come in nine months. And if a woman is healthy, everything will be a routine. If you can make a routine, everything will become healthy. So the sister belongs to the opposite polarity.\nFrom the very beginning you will feel that a girl behaves differently than a boy. The girl is more graceful, more rounded, more obedient – not rebellious. A boy from the very beginning is a trouble- maker, rebellious. If you say: Don’t do this; then he is bound to do it. A boy is totally different. Even in the womb, a mother can feel whether the child is going to be a boy or a girl, because the boy starts kicking in the womb. You can feel the girl remain absolutely silent and relaxed, but the boy starts kicking. Even in the womb the male energy is different from the female energy.\nThis sister must have been always telling him: You are wrong. But he was true to himself even in his death. He was true to himself when he was alive and he is true to himself when he is dead. He had remained a true, authentic man – true to his own being, not following anything, just following his own life-energy wherever it led. But the sister was also true to herself – even when the brother was dead she was not weeping and crying. The last advice that could be given she was giving. She said: You were a nuisance in your life. You created trouble for others because you never followed any laws and customs. And now, even in your death, you are a nuisance to yourself.\nSE THEN PRODDED HER BROTHER WITH HER FINGER AND HE FELL DOWN WITH A BANG. THEN THEY WENT OF TO THE CREMATORIUM.\nBoth of them knew that there is no death. It is said that when the brother fell down with a bang, the sister just went back to her monastery.\nIf you take life easily, if you enjoy life, if your life by and by becomes a fulfillment, the same will be your death. What are we doing? We are not enjoying life, we are only preparing to enjoy it – and life is here and now, no preparation is needed. I see people always preparing – they are preparing to live a great life somewhere in the future. They will be afraid of death because in the future death is waiting. And your life is also in the future. You are making a house, purchasing a car, and this and that, accumulating things; just getting ready to live. You will never be ready, and by the time you are ready, death will knock at your door. That’s the fear: that death may come before you are ready. A man of understanding lives life here and now, every moment he lives it. For him there is no death because there is no future life. He exhausts the moment, he lives it totally, he enjoys it, he thanks God for it, he is grateful.\nWhere is the fear of death if at this moment you are alive? Here at this moment, you are alive – where is the fear of death? Don’t try to get ready to die, just live. And I tell you, everybody, as he is, is ready to live this very moment.\nDon’t miss this moment, and don’t ask for long preparations. That way you will never be ready. And the mind gets a habitual form: always thinking of tomorrow, tomorrow – it becomes fixed. By the time you have accumulated wealth the mind will again be telling you: Tomorrow, tomorrow. ‘Tomorrow’ is the disease of the mind.\nA new life comes into existence when you live now. A new life is a ‘now’ life. Then where is the fear? Who is worried about death? Then you can play a joke in the end. And if you live, you start feeling what life is. It is felt only through living; there is no other way to feel it. It is just like swimming – you swim and you learn; swimming comes through swimming, life is felt through living.\nYou postpone, you don’t feel life; you feel death all around. Through postponing you will feel death, through living you will feel life. If you feel life, it is eternal. It has no death to it, it never dies; it goes on and on and on, and each moment is eternity.\nRemember it as deeply as possible: don’t postpone, don’t move into tommorow – here, now, is all that you need. Enjoy it, and the more you enjoy, the more will be given to you. That is what Jesus meant when he said: Knock and the door shall be opened unto you. Ask and it shall be given. This very moment the door is there. Ask, knock, live! – don’t postpone.\nThis is the whole message of all those who have become awakened: Today is enough, tomorrow will take care of itself. And tomorrow never comes; it is always today. If you know the knack of living here and now, you will be able to live every moment that comes. Even at the moment of death, you will be able to live. This is what this Teng did – he lived the moment of death. And if you can live the moment of death, how can you die? Then you change your death also into life.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"8270","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/returning_to_the_source/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/returning_to_the_source/>Returning to the Source</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 So Teng Died Standing On His Head</h1><div class=post-meta>39 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8270 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Returning_to_the_Source/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark9>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>10</span></p><p><br></p><p>So Teng Died Standing On His Head</p><p><br></p><p>20 December 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN TENG YIN FENG WAS ABOUT TO DIE HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM:
I HAVE SEEN MONKS DIE SITTING AND LYING, BUT HAVE ANY DIED STANDING?
‘YES, SOME,’ THEY REPLIED.</p><p><br></p><p>‘HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN?’ ASKED TENG. ‘NO, NEVER SUCH A THING,’ THEY
SAID. SO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD AND HIS CLOTHES ALSO ROSE UP,
CLOSE TO HIS BODY.</p><p><br></p><p>IT WAS DECIDED TO CARRY HIM TO THE BURNING GROUND, BUT HE STILL STOOD
THERE WITHOUT MOVING. PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT
AT THE SCENE.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS YOUNGER SISTER, A NUN, HAPPENED TO BE THERE. SHE GRUMBLED AT HIM:
WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE, YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF LAWS AND CUSTOMS; AND EVEN
NOW YOU’RE DEAD, YOU’RE MAKING A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE THEN PRODDED HER BROTHER WITH HER FINGER, AND HE FELL DOWN WITH A
BANG. THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THE CREMATORIUM.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is the root of all fear, and if there is fear, you cannot live.
With fear there is no life. If there is fear you are already dead.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the vicious circle – you are afraid of death, and because of
fear you cannot live, you are already dead. Then you become more afraid
and the fear creeps into your very center; you become just a
trembling.</p><p>As I see you, you are just a trembling. If you dig deeply, you will
always find the fear of death. This fear is the root of all fears. In
any fear, whatsoever the form of the fear, somewhere the fear of death
is hidden. Why are people so afraid of death? Is death really a
phenomenon to be afraid of?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to remember is that you don’t know death. You have
not known it, so how can you be afraid of something that you don’t know?
that’s impossible. You can be afraid of something you know, but of
something that is totally unknown, absolutely unknown how can you be
afraid? Fear needs an object to be afraid of.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot really be afraid of death, you must be afraid of something
else. That something else is an unfulfilled life – you have not been
able to live, you have not been able to achieve a fulfillment, you have
not been able to overflow, you have not been able to celebrate. Your
life has been an emptiness, a hollowness, a nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is coming near and you have not been able to live yet – this
creates the fear. Death is coming near and you will be no more, the
opportunity is being taken away. Every moment you are losing life and
you have not lived yet – this creates the fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is approaching – that is not the fear, The fear is that you
have not lived yet and death is knocking at the door; the time to leave
has come and you are yet unfulfilled. If you have lived, you have a
fulfillment, a contentment, a deep gratitude. You have flowered – there
is nothing more to achieve. Then you are not afraid of death; rather,
you welcome it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have achieved: now death comes like a deep sleep after the day’s
labour – a whole day of achievement, of fulfillment, of reaching, of
meeting, of encountering, of flowering, and then death comes like a deep
sleep. You welcome it. When the tree has flowered, death is welcome;
when the tree is still struggling to flower, there is fear.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are afraid of death that is simply one indication that your
life has been a wastage. It has been like a desert, nothing has flowered
in it. It has been like a pond, closed in itself and not moving
anywhere. It has not been like a river – flowing, dancing, running
towards the Ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>When a river reaches to the ocean there is a death. When a pond
dries, becomes more and more dirty, evaporates, that too is death, but
both are so absolutely different.</p><p><br></p><p>When a river reaches to the ocean it is a fulfillment because there
the river will die and become something greater. It is a jump, a jump
from the finite to the infinite: the river losing itself, its identity,
and becoming the ocean. Nothing is lost and everything is gained.</p><p><br></p><p>But a pond drying up, not reaching anywhere, a no ocean anywhere,
just drying in itself, is also dying. You are like a pond. That’s why
there is the fear of death. Be like a river, and then there is no fear
of death.</p><p><br></p><p>Death itself is like a sleep. Sleep is a temporary death, so if a
person becomes very afraid of death he is also bound to become afraid of
sleep. In the West, insomnia has now become a common phenomenon; almost
everybody is suffering from it. It is not only because of mental
tensions that insomnia exists. Deeper than the tensions, is fear, the
fear of death. You cannot let go.</p><p>I know a person who is so afraid of death that he cannot sleep,
because he is afraid that he may die in his sleep. He tries to remain
awake – he talks, reads, listens to music, but he is afraid of going
into sleep. And if you are afraid for many, many days, it becomes a
habit; unknowingly you create a barrier against sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West people are afraid of death, and if they are afraid, how
can they go into sleep? Sleep is like death, so logically they are right
– if you are afraid of death, you should also be afraid of sleep. They
are similar phenomena; sleep is a temporary death. After the day’s
labour, the work, you are exhausted – you need a death so that you can
be reborn, so that in the morning you are again rejuvenated, fresh,
young. And in sleep, death is exactly what happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you observed the fact that in sleep you are not the same person
at all? You don’t remember who you are, you don’t remember whether you
are rich or poor, you don’t remember your own face, you don’t remember
who your father is and who your mother is; you don’t remember anything
that you have learned, anything that has been cultivated in you you drop
everything at the door and you go to sleep. That’s why it is so
refreshing, because you get rid of yourself. You are like a burden – you
leave it at the door and you fall into sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleep opens a different dimension where identity, ego, nothing of
this world exists. That’s why it is so fresh, so refreshing in the
morning you come back to life, a new day starts, a new life.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear of death will automatically create a fear of sleep and a
fear of love. Because love also is like death – you die in it. That’s
why people cannot love. They talk about it, they fantasize, they
imagine, but they never fall in love. Even if they try, they try to
manipulate the phenomenon, not allow it, because love is so much like
death.</p><p><br></p><p>Four things are similar: death, love, sleep and meditation; their
qualities are similar. And the basic similarity is that you have to
dissolve – and people are afraid of all of them. If you are afraid of
death you will be afraid of sleep, of love, of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Many come to me and they say: How to love? It is not a question of
how, and when you ask ‘how’, you are trying to manipulate – you would
like to remain in control, so whenever you Want you can push the button
on or off. You would like to remain the master of the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody can be in possession of love. Love possesses you, you
cannot possess it. Love controls you, you cannot control it. Love means
you are no longer there, something else has come. That’s why love is so
rejuvenating.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if an old man falls in love, suddenly, you will see that his
face has become younger. His eyes are no more old; his body may be old,
but his total being suddenly becomes young. Why does it happen? – for
this very reason: you can allow a let-go; you move to the original
source of energy where rebirth is possible. You only touch the deathless
core when you are ready to die. That is the paradox – you touch the
deepest core when you are ready to die. If you cling to the surface and
you are afraid, afraid to let go, then you remain on the surface; and
the surface is the body.</p><p><br></p><p>People who are afraid of love are not afraid of sex. Love is
dangerous, sex is not dangerous – it can be manipulated. There are now
many manuals on how to do it. You can manipulate it – sex</p><p>can become a technique. Love can never become a technique. In sex,
you try to remain in control; then even sex will not help to reach the
Ultimate. It will go to a certain point and you will drop back because
somewhere it also needs a let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why orgasm is becoming more and more difficult. Ejaculation
is not orgasm, to give birth to children is not orgasm. Orgasm is the
involvement of the total body: mind, body, soul, all together you
vibrate, your whole being vibrates from the toes to the head. You are no
longer in control; existence has taken possession of you and you don’t
know who you are. It is like a madness, it is like a sleep, it is like
meditation, it is like death.</p><p><br></p><p>So even in sex, you let go up to a point, but you don’t allow
totality, because if you allowed totality then the ego could not exist.
And this is the problem – you are afraid of death because you are not
capable of living totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Love, meditation, sleep; nothing is total. In your activity you are
also not total, because if you were total, there also a moment would
come when you are lost. Losing yourself has become the problem, you
cannot lose yourself, you cannot relax – you have to do something. You
go into the garden and dig a hole, but you are not total. If you really
were total while digging the hole you would forget yourself completely
the self-consciousness would disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>You are self-conscious but not conscious of yourself; you are aware
but there is an ego. You are aware of the total – the trees, the sun’s
rays, the breezes blowing, the birds singing, your activity – the
digging of the hole, the mud coming out – you are aware of everything
except yourself. If you became conscious of yourself, in that moment an
orgasmic feeling would happen. It is like deep love, it is like sleep,
it is like death. You will come out of it totally different and new.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t move into a let-go, life cannot happen to you. It
happens through that passage when you are not. When you are not standing
in the way, then life happens to you, then you feel fulfilled. When you
are fulfilled there is no fear of death. When there is no fear of death,
you become more and more capable of let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you have really known what life is, who bothers about death?
If you have really known what life is and celebrated it, then death is
not the end – then death is the culmination, the peak, the highest
let-go. Then love is nothing, a sexual orgasm is nothing, sleep is
nothing. If you have lived life rightly, fully, then death is the
greatest bliss, because it is the greatest let-go. The more intense and
total the let-go, the more the bliss. This is the rule, this is the law.
So what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to live, allow death also – it is like having two wings.
It is not a thing somewhere in the end, it is a process: the day you
were born you began dying. It is not life here and death there, life now
and death then, no. You cannot divide them; they are together, they have
to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is death. Life and death both are two wings. The day you are
born, that same day you start to die. It is a process; you inhale – it
is life, you exhale – it is death. In the morning you get up – it is
life, in the evening you go to bed – it is death; you work, act – it is
life, then you relax – it is death; it is continuous, every moment it is
there. And if you avoid death you will also be avoiding life. If you
don’t want to exhale deeply how can you inhale deeply? If you don’t want
to relax, how can you act deeply? – you won’t have any energy.</p><p>If you are afraid of sleep, in the morning you will not wake up fresh
and you will feel sleepy the whole day. Then everything gets mixed up.
You are neither alive nor dead, but just dragging on. And this is a bad
situation – just dragging on. Either be alive or be dead, but don’t drag
on. In either case, being dead totally, you will attain to a greater
living totally, you will attain to a greater death, because they are two
aspects of the same coin. Once you can see that life implies death, that
every act of being alive is also an act of dying, you have seen the
Total.</p><p><br></p><p>Then life is not serious, then it is fun. It becomes serious because
of the fear of death. You cannot laugh loudly because of the fear of
death; you cannot enjoy because of the fear of death; you cannot do
anything – because of the fear of death.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is always around the corner like a black shadow following you.
It doesn’t allow you to do anything. Then you become serious and you
start thinking: How to attain the deathless? Then you start searching
for how to become immortal, how to find the secret, the elixir.</p><p><br></p><p>These are all nonsense searches, it is not true seeking. Nowhere does
there exist something chemical, alchemical, like elixir, ambrosia – no.
The secret is in seeing life and death as a single process. You cannot
find the secret anywhere – the philosopher’s stone exists nowhere, it
exists in this fact: that life and death are together. They are one
process, a unitary phenomenon. Then you are not afraid. Then rather, on
the contrary, you are thankful to death, because life becomes possible
only because of death. Through death, life becomes possible; through
dying everything is renewed.</p><p><br></p><p>So death is not against life, it is not the opposite, it is not the
enemy. It is through death that life becomes possible – you are alive
because you can die. If you cannot die, you will not be alive at all.
You don’t know for what you are asking if you ask for deathlessness!
Then you will be like a rock; then you cannot be alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the flower that bloomed this morning.<span class=s4></span>Just near the flower there is a rock. By the
evening,</p><p>the flower will be gone but the rock will be there, because the
flower is more alive and the rock is not so alive. The flower is dead by
the evening. What do you want? – to be a rock-like phenomenon or a
flower-like phenomenon? Why does the flower die so soon? – because it is
so alive, so intensely alive that death comes quickly; it doesn’t linger
on. The flower was not dragging; it lived the moment, it lived totally –
it danced under the sky, it enjoyed the sun, the breeze. For a moment it
was eternity. The flower laughed, the flower sang, the flower did
whatsoever was to be done, and by the evening, the flower was ready to
die – and without a single tear in her eyes, without weeping and
crying.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at a dying flower – the petals have already fallen on the ground
but you can never say that it is ugly – it is beautiful in death also.
Then look at a man dying; he becomes ugly. Why? – because of the fear.
Fear makes you ugly. If you are too afraid you will become more and more
ugly. The flower is fulfilled; now the time to rest has come and the
flower is going to rest, and when the rest is over the flower will come
back.</p><p><br></p><p>Again and again.… Life is an eternal recurrence, death is just a
rest. You need not be worried about it, you simply live. And if you live
then you are not serious. If you are afraid of death, then you are
serious. To be sincere is one thing, to be serious is another. A man who
loves life is sincere, authentic, but never serious. Life is not like an
illness. If you are looking at death and are</p><p>obsessed with death, then life is just serious – then you will become
a long-face. You may move to the monasteries, to the temples, go to the
Himalayas, but you will remain a long-face. It is fear that has taken
you to the monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, an authentic religious person is not fear-oriented, he is
love-oriented. A really authentic religious person becomes religious to
enjoy life more, to enjoy it deeply and totally. He is not scared. A
real religious man looks at life as a game: it is not business, it is a
game. Hindus call it LEELA, a play; not even a game but a play.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a difference between a game and play. Children play, but you
even make a game out of play. Then it becomes business-like, then even
in playing you are seeking victory, success, gain, profit.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a play. There is nothing to be achieved out of it, it itself
is the goal; there is nowhere to reach, it itself is the Ultimate. Life
is not moving to achieve some goal, it is not going anywhere. It is just
like children playing, you cannot ask them: For what are you playing?
What is the purpose? They will laugh at your foolishness. They will say:
We are simply playing. It is so beautiful! Profit is not their concern,
and profit should also not be your concern, but play.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a moment to celebrate, to enjoy. Make it fun, a celebration,
and then you will enter the temple. The temple is not for the
long-faced, it has never been for them. Look at life – do you see
sadness anywhere? Have you ever seen a tree depressed? Have you seen a
bird anxiety-ridden? Have you seen an animal neurotic? No, life is not
that, not at all. Only man has gone wrong somewhere, and he has gone
wrong somewhere because he thinks himself to be very wise, very
clever.</p><p><br></p><p>Your cleverness is your disease. Don’t be too wise. Always remember
to stop; don’t go to the extreme. A little foolishness and a little
wisdom is good, and the right combination makes you a Buddha – a little
foolishness and a little wisdom. Don’t be just wise or else you will be
a long-face; don’t be just a fool or else you will become suicidal. A
little foolishness, enough to enjoy life, and a little wisdom to avoid
the errors – that will do.</p><p><br></p><p>But one has to know the right combination, and the right combination
is always different for each individual. My right combination cannot be
your right combination; nobody is a model for anybody else. You have to
find your own balance because everybody is so unique. But always
remember not to destroy foolishness completely, because in certain
moments to be foolish is to be wise.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody should remain open. In certain moments you should be like
children, in certain moments you should simply forget the business of
life, purposelessly just enjoying the moment, doing foolish things:
dancing and singing, playing with and collecting pebbles on the shore,
and nobody inside you says: What foolishness are you doing? – this time
can be devoted to making money. At this time you could be in the office
or in the shop and your bank balance could be growing. What are you
doing – are you a child?</p><p><br></p><p>If the child in you is completely lost, then you can never be
religious. Religion is for children. That’s why Jesus insists: Only
those who are like children will be able to enter into the kingdom of my
God. But what does being a child mean? Observe a child – he is wise. He
is a fool also, but when it is needed he can be wise, very wise.</p><p>I was staying with a family for a few days and a small boy in the
family was reading a book. On the book cover there was a picture of
Atlas supporting the earth. So I asked the child: Do you know who this
Atlas is? He said: Yes, he is a great giant who supports the whole
world. So I said to him: Correct, but who supports Atlas? He thought for
a moment and then he said: I think he must have married a rich wife.</p><p><br></p><p>They can be wise, and they are fools. When a child is wise the wisdom
has the freshness of a dew drop in the morning – it is not stale. Your
wisdom is stale, contaminated. You have collected it, you have borrowed
it, you have taken it from others – it is not your own. What do you know
that is your own? You have collected from many sources. That is
knowledge, not wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Wisdom is a response, a fresh response to the moment; knowledge is an
old, rotten, collected thing. You don’t respond to the moment; you bring
the past, the memory into it and you react through it. Wisdom is
response, knowledge is reaction. To already have the answer, a
ready-made answer before the question has been raised – is not wisdom. A
child is wise because he has no knowledge. He has to look around, he has
to feel, he has to think, he has to respond – he does not know.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a Christian myth that when Jesus went to the sea he sea turned
into red wine. Christian theologians have been trying to explain it: How
can the sea turn into red wine? They have had much difficulty; puzzled,
and no answer has yet been found. But a small child found the answer –
that small child was Lord Byron, who became very famous later on as a
great poet.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a small child in school and the question was asked: Why and
how did the sea turn into red wine when Jesus reached it? The answer was
fixed, ready-made; it had been taught already. All the other children
started writing their answers, only Byron waited with closed eyes. The
teacher came many times, but he was so meditative that she thought it
better not to disturb him – he was thinking so much.</p><p><br></p><p>And of what can a child think? – because thinking is always of the
known. If you know, you can think; if you don’t know, what can you
think?</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking is possible only if you know something – then you can think.
But if you don’t know, you don’t know. What was he doing? – the child
was sitting silently, but he looked so beautiful. Then in the end he
simply wrote a single sentence, and the sentence was: Seeing that my
Lord had come; the sea became shy and turned red.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus had come, my Lord had come; and the sea, seeing that my
Lord had come became shy like a girl. The beloved has come, and that
shyness was on the face of the sea. Only a child can answer that way
because he does not know the answer – but this is beautiful! All the
theologians are foolish before this child. He had said the right thing;
he had explained the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>A certain wisdom exists when you are innocent. But innocence is
ignorance, and of course, a certain foolishness exists when you are
innocent, when you are ignorant. A child is beautiful because he is both
– innocent, wise in his innocence, and a fool, foolish in his innocence.
And a child is the right proportion for you. Remember, you will have to
attain to a second childhood before you can enter into the Kingdom of
God.</p><p>A second childhood is even more beautiful than the first, because in
the first you were not aware. In the second you will be fully aware.
This is how Zen Masters behave – you will find them sometimes just
foolish, and in certain moments you will find them so wise that you
cannot believe how this foolishness can exist with such wisdom. And you
in your knowledge also are foolish, but your foolishness is
contaminated, it is not innocent. When foolishness is innocent it has a
wisdom of its own, and when foolishness is contaminated by knowledge it
is simply idiocy; it has no wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Albert Einstein was staying with a very
knowledgeable woman who knew much. In the night they were sitting near
the window and the woman said: Look outside Dr. Einstein. This star,
this Venus is so beautiful; it looks like a beautiful woman. Einstein
said: My dear lady, it is not Venus, it is Jupiter. The lady said:
Dr. Einstein, you are simply amazing! – you can even judge the sex of a
planet from such a far away distance! She said: Venus? – Venus is
feminine, Jupiter is masculine. You are amazing! How can you judge the
sex of a star from so far away? And the woman was very knowledgeable, a
professor in some university, but foolish in her knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever you are foolish through your ‘knowledgeability’ you are
idiotic, simply idiotic. Be foolish like a child: if you don’t know, you
don’t know – don’t pretend. A child can simply say: I don’t know. Can
you say so simply that you don’t know? It is so difficult to say ‘I
don’t know,’ because when you say it the ‘I’ drops. And unless you can
say that you don’t know, you will never be wise. Only through ignorance
does the ego drop, and when there is no ego you have attained to a
second childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not be able to understand this Zen Master if you can’t see
this quality of a wise fool, of foolishness in one’s wisdom – a man who
takes life as fun. When he takes life as fun he also takes death as fun.
Nothing is a problem to him – he accepts everything, he is playful. Now
try to understand this beautiful story.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN TENG YIN FENG WAS ABOUT TO DIE – he was a Master, a very well
known Master – HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM: I HAVE SEEN MONKS DIE
SITTING AND LYING, BUT HAVE ANY DIED STANDING?’ YES, SOME,’ THEY
REPLIED.’HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN?’ ASKED TENG. ‘NO, NEVER SUCH A THING,’
THEY SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is coming near, death is going to knock at the door, and the
Master says: How shall I receive it? – the guest is coming; how shall I
be the host, how shall I receive it?</p><p><br></p><p>You die, a Master receives death. You die clinging to life, not ready
to die. You have to be snatched away and that’s why your whole being
becomes ugly. A Master prepares; he is even asking for the posture: What
posture shall I die in? Because death should be received in a unique
way. It doesn’t come every day; it is a rare guest. One should prepare,
one should be ready.</p><p><br></p><p>And what type of Master was this Teng to say: I have seen monks die
sitting and lying.<span class=s4></span>Ordinarily,</p><p>people die lying on their backs, not even sitting. Only a few people,
those who die in meditation, who die meditatively, die sitting.
Otherwise, ninety-nine percent of the people die on a bed.</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT HAVE ANY DIED STANDING?’ YES, SOME,’ THEY REPLIED.</p><p><br></p><p>A few people, a few rare persons have died standing. They too die
standing because they are very meditative. There are certain techniques
which can only be done standing. For example, Jain</p><p>techniques, Mahavir and his techniques, all have to be done standing.
He meditated standing for years; he would sit only when tired, otherwise
he would stand.</p><p><br></p><p>A certain silence immediately comes to you if you stand quietly. Try
it in the corner of your room: just in the corner stand silently, not
doing anything – suddenly the energy also stands inside you. Sitting,
you will feel many disturbances in the mind, because sitting is a
posture of a thinker. Standing, the energy flows like a pillar and is
distributed equally all over the body. Standing is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>A technique is to do the meditation just standing – try it because
some of you will find it very, very beautiful. If you can stand for one
hour, it is just wonderful. Just by standing and not doing anything, not
moving, you will find that something settles within you, becomes silent.
A centering happens, and you will feel yourself like a pillar of energy;
the body disappears. So a few meditators have died standing.</p><p><br></p><p>‘HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN?’ ASKED TENG.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing in a SHIRSASHAN, a head-stand posture; nobody has ever died
like that! You cannot even sleep in that posture; dying must be very
difficult because the blood circulates towards the head. So nobody has
ever tried this Teng is the only one who has not only tried it, he did
it. It was an absolutely impossible posture for dying because you cannot
even sleep in it.</p><p><br></p><p>For sleep, a certain phenomenon is needed in the body: the blood
should not be circulating towards the head. That’s why we use pillows,
to make the head a little higher than the body so the blood is not
flowing towards the head. If the blood is flowing towards the head, the
head continues thinking. The more civilized you become, the more the
size of your pillows increase; then you need one, two, tree pillows. A
great thinker has to use five, six, seven pillows, because the blood
circulation has to be stopped. That’s why after eating, sleep becomes
easier because the blood circulates towards the stomach. The body now
has a more basic function to perform and that is to digest the food.
Thinking cannot be allowed; thinking is a luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have eaten too much, then you can think; when you are
starving you cannot think. That’s why many religions have used fasting
as a meditation, because if you fast you cannot think. The body needs
energy for more basic functions; energy cannot be given to the head – it
is a luxury. That’s why animals don’t think, they have not come to that
standard of life yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The more rich a country, the more thinking there is; the poorer a
country, the less thinking there is, because you cannot afford energy
for thinking. If you fast, you will feel that in the night it is
difficult to sleep, very difficult, because with nothing to digest the
whole energy moves towards the head. The movement of energy towards the
head has to be stopped, only then you can sleep. It is difficult to
sleep standing in an upside-down posture.</p><p><br></p><p>‘HOW ABOUT UPSIDE-DOWN’ ASKED TENG. ‘NO, NEVER SUCH A THING,’ THEY
SAID.</p><p><br></p><p>– ’We have never heard of it, what are you talking about? A person
standing on his head and dying?’SO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD, AND
HIS CLOTHES ALSO ROSE UP, CLOSE</p><p>TO HIS BODY. That is possible. Until a few years ago, it would have
simply been a myth, but now there are scientific explanations for it. It
is possible because the body is electricity, it is nothing but</p><p>bio-electricity. When somebody dies, the body becomes a pillar of
energy and that pillar leaves the body. If it is very magnetic energy,
as it has to be with a Master, the clothes will just be magnetized.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only did Teng die upside-down, but his clothes rose with his
body, they clung to the body. If you rub your clothes on your body you
will feel a certain electricity created in the clothes. The body is
electric and when the body dies the electricity leaves the body; it is
pulled upwards. Just with that flow those clothes might have risen.
There is no need to think about it as a myth or a story – it is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>SO TENG DIED STANDING ON HIS HEAD.</p><p><br></p><p>Is death so easy that you can die upside-down? Yes, death is easy if
you have lived. Then you can choose the right moment to die. You must
have heard about many saints making a prediction that they will be dying
on a certain day, a certain time. People think that they know how to
read the future. That is nonsense, nobody can read the future. Future
means that which remains invisible. Then what do they do?</p><p><br></p><p>If I say to you: After seven days pass I will be dying in the morning
at six o’clock sharp – so don’t miss it, then what will you think? You
will think: How is it possible? To the mind, the only possibility seems
to be that somehow I know the future. That is not the truth, nobody
knows the future. But a man who has lived totally can decide when to
die. He is not predicting, he is simply saying that he has decided to
die on a certain day at six o’clock in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have lived – and when I say lived, I mean totally <span class=s5>t</span><span class=s6>henyouknowwhatlife</span><span class=s7>−</span></p><p>energyis.Y oucometoknowallthenooksandcrannies.oflifeenergy<span class=s8>;</span>thenyouknowallitstides, whenitcome</p><p>−<span class=s6>thenyouknowallitsnuances.Ifyouhavelivedtotally,

andwherethedooris.</p><p>YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHO YOU ARE; you are aware of only a very minute
fragment of your being: that is your mind – and that too, not fully.
Nine tenths of your being remains a dark continent; it is yet an Africa,
you never enter into it. In your inner being the geography is not yet
completely mapped; you don’t have your own map. Once you know your map,
the inner geography, the topography, then when the right moment has
come, you can simply decide to leave. You can leave this body because
this body is just a house, an abode – it is not you. A Master is
unidentified with the body, unidentified with the mind; he can decide.
So Teng stood on his head and died. Even this impossible posture of
standing on one’s head can be used. If you know how to live, you know
how to die, because they are both one.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing to be understood is why was he joking about death?
Death is a serious affair and he is making fun of it! Standing on his
head, he is making fun of death. He is saying that if you have lived,
lived a life of celebrations, then you can die celebrating – it is fun.
When you know that you are not going to die, that something in you is
eternal, then the whole of life becomes fun. It is a great cosmic joke
and you can play with it.</p><p><br></p><p>In his death, Teng was giving a message to his disciples: Everything
is fun, don’t be too concerned about anything. Just live the moment
while it lasts, live it and enjoy it!</p><p>This is my feeling also: that if there is any God, He is not going to
ask you: What right things have you done and what bad things have you
done; what sins have you committed and what virtues have you followed,
no. If there is any God, He is going to ask: Has your life been a
celebration or a sadness? That’s the only thing that can be asked.</p><p><br></p><p>When the whole existence celebrates, why are you standing separate,
alone, isolated? And then you feel that you are a stranger. When flowers
flower, Why do you stand aloof? – why not flower? When birds sing, why
do you stand aloof? why not sing, why not become a participant?</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is a participation in the mystique that is all around you,
in the mystery that is all around you. It is not an effort to know, it
is an effort to be, to be a participant. Then everything is beautiful –
life is beautiful and death is beautiful, and you can play a joke.</p><p><br></p><p>A rare man this Teng was. The disciples were very afraid of what to
do. Never before had there been such a precedent; nobody had died
standing on his head. What to do with such a man?</p><p><br></p><p>IT WAS DECIDED TO CARRY HIM TO THE BURNING GROUND, BUT HE STILL STOOD
THERE WITHOUT MOVING.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have been an energy pillar in life, an unmoving pillar, if you
have attained anything in life that has become crystallized, then you
can even use your death.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many versions of this story. In one version the sister came
and said: Why are you making a fool of yourself? Teng laughed and fell
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE SCENE. HIS
YOUNGER SISTER, A NUN, HAPPENED TO BE THERE.</p><p><br></p><p>She lived in another monastery for women. She came, not because the
brother had died, she came just to see the foolishness that he was
doing. She was a sister to Teng and she could teach him the last
lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE GRUMBLED AT HIM: WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF LAWS
AND CUSTOMS, AND EVEN NOW YOU ARE DEAD, YOU’RE MAKING A NUISANCE OF
YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>This Teng is one of the rebellious Zen Masters. He lived a life
without any laws and without any regulations. He lived a life without
any enforced discipline. Not that he was not disciplined, he was
absolutely disciplined, otherwise how could he have stood on his head
and died? He was not only disciplined in life, he was disciplined in his
death.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find such an absolute discipline with no enforced
discipline. This discipline came from his inside – he followed his own
way, he never followed anybody. He had rules but the rules were not
fixed by any outside code; they came out of his own awareness. Of
course, he was a nuisance to other people.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of Teng that when he lived with his own Master and was
himself a disciple, he would sleep long after everybody else was up and
the whole monastery was working. It would be nine o’clock</p><p>in the morning and he would still be sleeping. Once the Master came
and he said: Teng, what are you doing? This is a monastery – one has to
get up in the BRAHAM MURHUT, at five o’clock. It is reported that Teng
said: Of course I always get up in the morning, I always get up in the
BRAHAM MURHUT! The Master said: What are you saying? It is nine o’clock;
four hours ago the sun has risen! Teng said: Whenever the braham within
me wants to get up, then I get up. That is the braham murhut, the moment
of God. When the God within me wants to get up, who am I to make rules?
– I get up immediately, I never lose a single moment. Whenever the God
within me wants to get up, jump out of the bed; whenever he wants to go
to bed, I jump into bed. Who am I, Master, to create a disturbance? And
the Master said: You are right – you have found the right braham
murhut.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about him that he would never eat according to rules,
because in a Buddhist monastery you have to follow rules, everything is
fixed. That has a beauty of its own, and for some people, that fixed
routine suits very well. But don’t try to follow Teng; you may not be a
Teng.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, for some people, almost fifty percent, a routine helps,
because whenever something becomes routine, you need not worry about it,
it takes care of itself. If it is five o’clock, you have to get up. You
need not decide it every day, because to decide every day will create
more anxiety and thinking. If it is six o’clock, you have to go to the
meditation, so you go; it is seven o’clock, so you go for breakfast. At
breakfast, fixed things are given every day, so you need not think about
what is going to be given. You need not even desire because there is no
point – the breakfast is fixed, it is always the same. And this way the
routine continues. By and by, it becomes a robot-like thing around you;
you are completely free of decisions. You can do other things – you can
meditate, you can become aware; you need not be worried about the petty
things around you. To fifty percent of the people, this suits perfectly;
to fifty percent this never suits. To fix themselves into a routine
becomes a worry and an anxiety for them; they are not made that way.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to feel oneself, one has to feel how one is made and never
follow anything else. First just feel yourself, and there are only two
possibilities: either you can live a life of spontaneity, or you can
live a life of discipline. Both are good because the basic thing is to
become alert and aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Teng never followed any rules – whenever he felt hungry, he would
eat, even though it might be midnight, whenever he was not hungry, he
would not eat, although many days would pass. It was not fasting because
fasting has to be forced. It was not a fast, he was not feeling hungry
so it was okay, he would not eat. Many nights he would not sleep if he
was not feeling sleepy; if he was feeling, for days together he would
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the sister said: WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE YOU TOOK NO NOTICE OF
LAWS AND CUSTOMS, AND EVEN NOW YOU ARE DEAD, YOU ARE MAKING A NUISANCE
OF YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>The sister was also an Enlightened woman, otherwise she would have
been crying and weeping. She is not crying and weeping; on the contrary,
she is giving right advice to this dying man – a fool who was always a
nuisance. Now, even in death, the sister is a totally different
type.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been my feeling: that women are the types who will need an
outer discipline. In that fifty percent of people, forty per cent will
always be women who would need discipline. There are reasons for it: the
whole of nature has made women to follow a certain law. That’s why every
twenty-eight days the period comes, the body follows a routine. If there
is something wrong, only then is that discipline broken. Otherwise, it
is absolutely fixed.</p><p>A woman’s body follows laws – it has to because she is going to give
birth to a child; she is going to become a mother and a child cannot be
left with somebody who moves in an individual way. A woman has a
collective unconscious, not an individual unconscious. She has to,
because a purpose has to be fulfilled through her – the child will come
in nine months. And if a woman is healthy, everything will be a routine.
If you can make a routine, everything will become healthy. So the sister
belongs to the opposite polarity.</p><p><br></p><p>From the very beginning you will feel that a girl behaves differently
than a boy. The girl is more graceful, more rounded, more obedient – not
rebellious. A boy from the very beginning is a trouble- maker,
rebellious. If you say: Don’t do this; then he is bound to do it. A boy
is totally different. Even in the womb, a mother can feel whether the
child is going to be a boy or a girl, because the boy starts kicking in
the womb. You can feel the girl remain absolutely silent and relaxed,
but the boy starts kicking. Even in the womb the male energy is
different from the female energy.</p><p><br></p><p>This sister must have been always telling him: You are wrong. But he
was true to himself even in his death. He was true to himself when he
was alive and he is true to himself when he is dead. He had remained a
true, authentic man – true to his own being, not following anything,
just following his own life-energy wherever it led. But the sister was
also true to herself – even when the brother was dead she was not
weeping and crying. The last advice that could be given she was giving.
She said: You were a nuisance in your life. You created trouble for
others because you never followed any laws and customs. And now, even in
your death, you are a nuisance to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>SE THEN PRODDED HER BROTHER WITH HER FINGER AND HE FELL DOWN WITH A
BANG. THEN THEY WENT OF TO THE CREMATORIUM.</p><p><br></p><p>Both of them knew that there is no death. It is said that when the
brother fell down with a bang, the sister just went back to her
monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>If you take life easily, if you enjoy life, if your life by and by
becomes a fulfillment, the same will be your death. What are we doing?
We are not enjoying life, we are only preparing to enjoy it – and life
is here and now, no preparation is needed. I see people always preparing
– they are preparing to live a great life somewhere in the future. They
will be afraid of death because in the future death is waiting. And your
life is also in the future. You are making a house, purchasing a car,
and this and that, accumulating things; just getting ready to live. You
will never be ready, and by the time you are ready, death will knock at
your door. That’s the fear: that death may come before you are ready. A
man of understanding lives life here and now, every moment he lives it.
For him there is no death because there is no future life. He exhausts
the moment, he lives it totally, he enjoys it, he thanks God for it, he
is grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is the fear of death if at this moment you are alive? Here at
this moment, you are alive – where is the fear of death? Don’t try to
get ready to die, just live. And I tell you, everybody, as he is, is
ready to live this very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t miss this moment, and don’t ask for long preparations. That way
you will never be ready. And the mind gets a habitual form: always
thinking of tomorrow, tomorrow – it becomes fixed. By the time you have
accumulated wealth the mind will again be telling you: Tomorrow,
tomorrow. ‘Tomorrow’ is the disease of the mind.</p><p>A new life comes into existence when you live now. A new life is a
‘now’ life. Then where is the fear? Who is worried about death? Then you
can play a joke in the end. And if you live, you start feeling what life
is. It is felt only through living; there is no other way to feel it. It
is just like swimming – you swim and you learn; swimming comes through
swimming, life is felt through living.</p><p><br></p><p>You postpone, you don’t feel life; you feel death all around. Through
postponing you will feel death, through living you will feel life. If
you feel life, it is eternal. It has no death to it, it never dies; it
goes on and on and on, and each moment is eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it as deeply as possible: don’t postpone, don’t move into
tommorow – here, now, is all that you need. Enjoy it, and the more you
enjoy, the more will be given to you. That is what Jesus meant when he
said: Knock and the door shall be opened unto you. Ask and it shall be
given. This very moment the door is there. Ask, knock, live! – don’t
postpone.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole message of all those who have become awakened:
Today is enough, tomorrow will take care of itself. And tomorrow never
comes; it is always today. If you know the knack of living here and now,
you will be able to live every moment that comes. Even at the moment of
death, you will be able to live. This is what this Teng did – he lived
the moment of death. And if you can live the moment of death, how can
you die? Then you change your death also into life.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_golden_gate_vol_1/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Saying Yes to Life</span>

PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AND NEAR TO ADMIRE THEM. THE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY THE MASTER KOSEN. WHEN KOSEN WAS DRAWING THE CHARACTERS THERE WAS A PUPIL STANDING BY WHO HAD MIXED THE INK. ‘NOT SO GOOD,’ SAID THE PUPIL AT KOSEN’S FIRST TRY. ‘THAT’S WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE,’ SAID THE PUPIL TO THE SECOND TRY. AND SO IT WENT ON. AFTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH TRY, THE INK WAS RUNNING LOW, SO THE PUPIL WENT OUT TO MIX SOME MORE. ‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’ THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’ WHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED, HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AS THIS LATEST EFFORT, AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!\nA few things before we enter this beautiful story. First, if you are divided, then a conflict arises not only in the mind, but in your bio-energy – then you are two. And if you are two, energy is wasted in the conflict; the energy is dissipated. Unless you are one, nothing can be done. As far as the inner journey is concerned, your oneness will be needed more and more. On the surface it is okay; you can go on doing the day-to-day work even if you are divided.\nJust imagine a circle with a center: if you draw two lines from the periphery towards the center, on the periphery they are divided; the more you come towards the center, the more the gap becomes less and less and less; just near the center the gap is almost not; at the center the gap disappears. At the center everything becomes one; at the periphery everything is divided, is two.\nWhen you are self-conscious you are two, because then you exist at the periphery. When you are not self-conscious you are one, because then you don’t exist at the periphery, you exist at the center.\nIf you are an egoist, you are dissipating your energy because the ego exists at the periphery. The ego exists for others; it has to be on the periphery. When you are totally alone in your innermost being the ego doesn’t exist. You are but the ego is not and when you are, without the ego, your energy is tremendous. When you are without the ego, you are a God. Then you are undivided, and the source of energy is infinite.\nAt the periphery everything is divided, and not only divided, but in conflict. It is as if I am fighting both my hands – right fights the left, left fights the right. What will happen? Is there any possibility of either hand being victorious? – no possibility, because both hands are mine The right cannot win because it is mine; the left cannot be defeated – it is mine.\nBehind both hands I am one, so there is no possibility of any victory. And all victories will be just dreams, pretensions. I can fool myself, I can put my right hand on top of my left and say: Now the right has won. I can change the situation in a single moment; I can put the left on top of the right and say: The left has won. This is what you have been doing continuously.\nIf you fight with yourself, there is no victory. Nobody is going to be defeated, nobody is going to win; the whole game is stupid. But one thing is certain – if you go on fighting with yourself, you are dissipating energy. The right cannot win, the left cannot win – you will be defeated in the end. It is suicidal, you are destroying yourself.\nWhen you are one, you become a creator, when you are two, you become suicidal – you destroy yourself. And how do you become two? Whenever self-consciousness arises, you become two. Whenever you look at others and feel; What do they think about me? – you become two.\nThat’s why all that is beautiful cannot happen when you are two. A creator has to forget everything, he has to forget the whole world; only then something from Beyond descends.\nOne great English poet, Coleridge, has left only seven poems completed, and he was one of the greatest masters. He left thousands of poems incomplete. Forty thousand in all have been calculated; only seven complete.\nJust before his death somebody asked: What is the matter with you? The whole house is filled with incomplete poems, and a few poems need just a touch – the last line, or three lines are there one line is missing. Why can’t you complete them?\nColeridge is reported to have said: Who can complete them? I have never written a single word. When I am not, then something descends. Only three lines came; I was waiting for the fourth but it never came. And I cannot complete it because it will come from a different plane of being. I was not when these three lines came, and I would be there too much when the fourth is added. I could add it, but that would be just false. It would be something imposed – it won’t have a flow, it won’t be authentic, it won’t be true. So what can I do? I can simply wait.\nHe waited for certain poems for twenty years, and then the line, the missing line would descend, and he would add it.\nIt is said about one of the greatest poets of India, Rabindranath Tagore, that whenever he would be writing a poem or painting a picture, he would become so self-conscious that he would forget to eat,\nhe would forget to drink, he would forget to sleep. Even his wife would come but he would not be able to recognize who was standing before him. So whenever he was in a creative mood, nobody would disturb him, nobody would go near his house. He was in such a different state of being that to disturb him could be fatal. For three days, four days, even for weeks, he would not eat, he would not do anything. He had become just a vehicle – he was ONE.\nIt happened that Rabindranath’s book, GEETANJALI, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, became world famous. He translated it himself because he wrote in.Bengali. The original was Bengali and he translated it into English himself. But he was not so confident, it is easy to translate prose, it is very, very difficult to translate poetry, even if it is your own.\nPoetry exists somewhere beyond grammar – it is more music, less language, it is more a feeling and less a thought. It eludes, and that is the beauty of it – you cannot fix it. It is like a river moving, it is not like a pond. Prose is like a pond, poetry is like a river.\nRabindranath tried for many days; he would work on single pieces. Then he translated it completely. But not confident, he asked C. F. Andrews for help. C. F. Andrews was one of the colleagues of Mahatma Gandhi, he worked for India’s independence very deeply. C. F. Andrews looked through it and he said: It is wonderful, beautiful! Only at four places would I like to change it because at four places it is not grammatical. So he changed it at four places, just four words, and Rabindranath was very happy. Andrews said: It is okay now.\nRabindranath took it to London. Before it was to be published he called a small gathering of poets at the house of Yeats, one of the great poets of England. Almost twenty poets, all known, had gathered – they listened. Then Rabindranath asked: Do you feel that something is missing? Yeats stood and he said: At four places something is wrong. Rabindranath was surprised. He couldn’t believe it because nobody else knew that C. F. Andrews had changed the book at four places. He asked: What are those four places? – and they were exactly the same places. Yeats said: At these four places the flow has stopped. Someone else has put in those four words, not you.\nYeats was a very perceptive poet; he could feel that the river had somewhere become a pond, that someone else from a different plane of being had entered, that something had become like a block; the river was not flowing as easily afterwards as it had been flowing before. There was a stone, a rock somewhere. Grammar is like a rock – it is dead.\nRabindranath then said: Yes, C. F. Andrews suggested these words, and he is an Englishman, so he knows better. English is not my mother tongue. He added: These were the four words I had used before Andrews corrected it. Yeats said: They are ungrammatical but they are poetic, they have the flow, so forget the grammar and retain the flow.\nAt the very center, the flow is the thing. Grammar is irrelevant, grammar exists on the surface; at the center – only a flow of energy. A different plane of being is needed. When something from the Beyond descends into you, you are needed to be one.\nThese are the two planes of humanity: duality, the plane of duality, what Hindus call DWAITA, the plane of two; and non-duality, the plane of one, the plane of the non-dual. When you are divided you are in this world; when you are undivided, you have transcended – you are no longer here, you have\npenetrated into the Beyond. Then boundaries meet and the boundaries meet in you. So the whole effort is how to become undivided, how to become one.\nJust the other night a girl came to me and she said: I am already a sannyasin inside. Why divide the outside from the inside? Is there really a division between inside and outside? Where is the demarcation line? Can you draw a line and say:\nBeyond this is inside? Where? – at the body can you draw a line? If the body dies, you die, If the body is not there, where are you?\nAt the mind then? – if the mind becomes unconscious you become unconscious. Who are you without the mind? Where do you divide? – everything is linked.\nAt the periphery it is outside; at the center it is inside, but the periphery belongs to the center. Can you have a center without a periphery? – then what type of center would that be? The center belongs to the periphery. Can you have a periphery without a center? – they belong to each other. They are just like two banks of a river – the river flows in between and you cannot divide.\nYou are hungry – you don’t say: Hunger is inside so how can I eat the food which is outside? You eat the food and the food becomes your blood, and the blood becomes your bio-energy, and your bio-energy becomes your thinking, and your thinking becomes your heart, your feeling, and your feeling becomes your witness, and your witness becomes the Divine, the Ultimate. There is a subtle digestion on every plane.\nYou take the food, it is outside. The moment you have taken it in, you digest it, the non-essential is thrown out again; the essential moves towards the center. You have digested it – it has become blood, bones, flesh – the body. Then again a digestion takes place – the most subtle of it is again absorbed. It becomes your bio – energy, what scientists call bio-plasma. It becomes electricity in you.\nBut then again, a digestion happens; the essential in it is again absorbed inwards – it becomes your thoughts. Thought is subtle electricity. Then again you move inwards.\nThinking is digested into feeling – it becomes your heart, so love is still a more subtle bio-energy than thinking, but that too is not the end.\nAgain in love, that which is more subtle is absorbed and digested – it becomes your witness, your meditation. It becomes your awareness, but that too is not the end because still the witness is there, and when the witness is there the division is there.\nThe division has become narrow; you are coming almost to the center but the division is still there. You are a witness – the subject and the object. Of what are you a witness? The division is still there.\nThen at the last jump energy has become totally centered; the object and subject disappear. Then there is no witness, then you have gone to the Beyond, then you are as if you are not. You are and you are not; you have become the Whole.\nThis is the state, the final state where in one way you are totally, utterly annihilated, and in another way you have become the Whole. The son disappears, now you have become the Father. Now there is no Jesus, just the Supreme-most Father exists – the son is absorbed. Where will you draw the line between that which is outside and that which is inside?\nMany people come to me and they say: Inside we are already SANNYASINS. But is there really a division on the outside? And if you divide you become two; if you become two, then the conflict arises, the whole game of inner war, an inner politics arises – who is to dominate whom? Either the outside is to dominate the inside, or the inside is to dominate the outside. If the outside dominates the inside you become a materialist. If the inside dominates the outside you become a spiritualist. In either case you are half, you are not whole.\nWhen the outside and inside disappear, nobody dominates anybody, because a domination is not a good state of affairs. The one who dominates will be thrown sooner or later, the oppressors will become the oppressed, and the oppressed will become the oppressors. It is just a fight between your left hand and right hand and the whole game is a pretense. Remember this paradox: the more you go inwards, the less of the outer there is. When you really reach to the innermost, inner and outer both disappear. Then you are nothing, and everything.\nIn a school a teacher was asking tricky questions, and then she said: Charlie Brown, how will you define nothingness? Without a single moment’s hesitation Charlie Brown said: Nothingness is a balloon with its skin off. That is you at the last moment, the skin off – nothingness. But then you have become the Whole because the skin was dividing you from the Whole.\nAnd where is your skin? Self-consciousness, the ego is your skin. When the ego is off you become nothing and the Whole simultaneously, because they both mean the same thing.\nThe second thing to be understood: you may have observed in yourself and in others also, that there is a very deep urge to become unconscious. Puritans cannot understand it, moralists cannot understand it, hence the appeal of all types of alcohols, drugs, chemical intoxicants – why? Preachers go on preaching against it but it has not changed a single person; not a single man has been changed through it. Humanity goes on moving on its path: puritans go on condemning, but nobody listens to them.\nIt cannot be an ordinary thing, something extraordinary is involved. That’s why it is so difficult to try to change an alcoholic – very, very difficult, almost impossible. Why is there so much appeal in becoming unconscious? – because self-consciousness is such a disease, it is such a burden. And there are only two ways to go beyond it: one is to fall into unconsciousness, the other is to become superbly conscious. Either move to superconsciousness, or move to unconsciousness. Self-consciousness is such a tension, such an anguish and anxiety, so move either to alcohol, or move to God.\nGod and the devil, God and alcohol are not opposites really. If God is Supreme Consciousness, then unconsciousness is the opposite pole.\nI have heard: Once it happened that a social worker who was trying to convert people towards, religion and against sin, against alcohol, came to see Mulla Nasrudin. She said: Last time I came to\nsee you, you were sober, and it made me tremendously happy. But now you are again intoxicated and it makes me very, very unhappy. ‘True,’ said Mulla Nasrudin beaming with happiness. He said: This time it is my turn to be happy.\nAlcohol, unconsciousness, may not give you happiness. but at least it helps you to forget unhappiness. You forget your anxieties, and through the chemical help you drop the division, the division into two, the self-consciousness.\nSelf-consciousness is the greatest tension in the mind. That’s why sometimes you would like to be alone; you would like to go to the Himalayas, and forget the whole society.\nSociety is not the problem, but when the other is present, it is very difficult to be self-unconscious or to be unself-conscious – both are the same.\nIt is difficult when the other is present to forget yourself; the thou creates the I within you, they are two polarities. When nobody is there and you are alone, you feel a certain relaxation. That’s why people go to the forests. But then too they become bored, because when you are alone tension is not there, but boredom enters because excitement disappears.\nExcitement is a sort of anxiety – anxiety is a sort of excitement. If you are after excitement, you cannot be meditative, you cannot move to a solitary place, you cannot move inwards, because there you will be alone and there is no excitement. Excitement needs the other. Alone, how can you be excited? – nothing is happening, how can you be excited? For anything to happen the other is needed. So if you are alone you become bored. If you move with society, live in relationship, then you become much to tense.\nSo going into loneliness won’t help. But if you can drop your self-consciousness while living in society with others; in relationship if you can drop your self-consciousness, suddenly there is no tension and no boredom, and life is a constant celebration without any excitement. It is a very silent celebration. It is a joy, but without any excitement; it is a very, very cool happiness; it is a deep fulfillment, but without any excitement.\nA Buddha is so fulfilled, but there is no excitement about it. He’s simply fulfilled. He has not achieved anything, nothing new has happened, but he has simply become so content with himself that it is very, very cool state of enjoyment – it is a cool state of bliss.\nRemember, that is the difference between bliss and happiness: happiness is excitement; bliss is happiness without excitement. If there is excitement, sooner or later you will get bored, because only when the excitement is new it is excitement. But how can you be excited about the same thing again and again?\nYou are excited about a woman or a man, but when the honeymoon is over, then the excitement is also over. Almost always, by the end of the honeymoon, a marriage ends – then there is just a hang- over, because you are looking for excitement, and excitement cannot be a continuous phenomenon. Unless your love is cool, not cold remember, but cool – cold is dead, cool is alive, but without any excitement – it is bound to turn into boredom.\nIn the world everything ends in boredom, it has to. When you attain to the innermost core of your being, you are happy without any cause, you are happy without any reason, you are happy without any excitement. There will be no boredom. And this is what happens in love also.\nYou need love, because only in love do you become self-unconscious; only in love does the other disappear. There is no need to be ‘I’. With someone you love you can be alone. Even if the lover or the beloved is present you can be alone. The deepest possibility in love is that it helps you to drop self-consciousness.\nBut if you have to continuously carry the other’s presence, if you have to behave accordingly, if you have to follow rules, if you have to plan even in love what to say and what not to say, then this love is sooner or later going to turn sour, bitter, because self-consciousness is there.\nWherever you find self-consciousness disappearing: in alcohol, in love, in meditation, you feel good. But alcohol cannot give you a permanent state; love can give that to you, but that possibility is very, very difficult.\nRemember, love is more difficult than meditation because love means living with the other and without the self. Meditation means living with oneself, forgetting the other completely – it is a less difficult dimension than love. That’s why those who can love don’t need meditation; they will reach through love.\nJesus says: Love is God. But to love is very difficult. It is difficult because the other enters with all his problems. The other is ill – you are ill, and when two ill persons meet, illness is not only doubled, it is multiplied.\nIt is very difficult to love, but if you can love then there is no need for any meditation. Love will become your meditation and you will reach through it. If you cannot love, if you feel it difficult then meditation is the only door.\nOnly one in a million reaches through love; others reach through meditation. Once you become meditative love also becomes easy, and then you can love. If you love then meditation comes as a shadow of it.\nYou have to decide how to drop your self-consciousness. There are two methods: one is through love, through a relationship; living with the other, and growing – it is a difficult path, very, very arduous – there is nothing more difficult than that; and the other is living in meditation. You have to choose.\nIf you grow in love, meditation will happen like a shadow. Love and meditation are two aspects of the same coin; if you have gained control of the one aspect, the other follows. If you meditate, love will follow – if you love, meditation will follow. This you have to choose.\nMeditation is easier – love is more difficult. Unless you want to move into the difficult unnecessarily – that is for you to decide – with meditation love comes automatically. This is my feeling: that ninety- nine percent in one hundred have to go through meditation, then love will happen. Only one percent can go through love, and meditation happens. This is the state of affairs, this is how things are. But\none thing is certain, that in either case self-conscious is to be dropped. Now try to understand this story.\nTHERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL LETTERS CARVED OVER THE GATE OF THE OAKU TEMPLE IN KYOTO WHICH SAYS: THE FIRST PRINCIPLE. PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AND NEAR TO ADMIRE THEM. THE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY THE MASTER KOSEN.\nZen uses all types of skills to grow in meditation; calligraphy is one of them. If you have seen Japanese or Chinese calligraphy, you will become aware of a certain quality – there is flow. No other language can do that, because every other language has an alphabet. The Far Eastern languages – Chinese, Japanese, don’t have an alphabet. They are pictorial languages; not the pen, but the brush is used, and the flow is the quality.\nSo a calligraphy is not only that which is written, it also carries something. of the Master who has done it – the flow. Change is not allowed, you cannot correct it; you have simply to do it in one stroke. A very skilled Master, a very mindful state is needed. You cannot change it, you cannot correct it. If you correct it, the whole point is lost because then the ego enters. You simply have to flow with it.\nThese are pictures and the basic thing is not that which is written, the basic thing is that which is hidden. You will be surprised. On the gate of a temple only these words are written: The First Principle. What type of message is that? – The First Principle, it says nothing. If you go and read these words: The First Principle, what does it say? There is no message in it.\nThe First Principle is ‘flow’ – it is not written; these words are just an indirect way. If you look at the calligraphy, there is the first principle, the flow. If you can flow, if your energy can flow without any blocks you will achieve. But the moment you become self-conscious, block enters, immediately.\nIt is just like falling into sleep – if you become self-conscious you cannot fall into sleep. Now the West is suffering from insomnia, and sooner or later the whole world will suffer, because sleep needs self-unconsciousness.\nAnd yet the whole civilization teaches you how to be more self-conscious – walk, do, move in life, the whole training is how to be a subtle egoist. The Western psychology says that a mature ego is needed; the whole Eastern effort is that a mature egolessness is needed.\nIn fact, when you become egoless, only then you are mature, never before.\nEgo is a juvenile phenomenon. It is childish, it is foolish, it is idiotic, because through ego you simply cut yourself off from the universal flow; then you are no longer a part of it. It is as if a wave in the ocean says: I am total, I do not belong to the ocean – I have nothing to do with the ocean, I am separate. Ego is separation, and whenever a wave says: I am separated, the wave is foolish. The wave is one with the ocean, ocean waves in it.\nReal maturity is to attain an egolessness – a balloon with the skin off – then you are fully mature, a Buddha, one who is now awakened. Western psychology teaches that you should become a mature\nego – it is good. If you are attaining it just to throw it, then it is good, because you can throw a thing only when you have it.\nAttain an ego, it is good, but don’t get caught in it. It is something to be attained and thrown. It is something you have to get, because if you don’t have an ego, how will you achieve surrender? This has been a constant problem for me.\nEastern people come to me: Indians, Japanese, they can surrender very easily. They are almost ready to surrender, but they have nothing to surrender. Western people come to me; they are very, very antagonistic to surrender, and they have something to surrender. If they surrender, they will grow. And Eastern people, before they surrender something they have to attain a mature ego.\nRemember only that which you have can be surrender. If you don’t have an ego, what are you going to surrender? The Western psychology takes the first step and the Eastern religion takes the last. They are complementary. Unless Western psychology and Eastern religion meet, man is going to remain in trouble.\nWhat is in these words, ‘The First Principle’? They say nothing. But ‘The First Principle’ is not the point, the words are not the point .The point is, the point was, for the Master to make them with such a flow, that even a touch of self-consciousness is in them. Whosoever loves to read between lines will be able to read at this temple gate.\nAnd why at the gate? – because that is the gate of the temple. If you are self-conscious, you cannot enter a temple; that is the first principle. If you have self-consciousness, an egoist mind, you cannot enter the temple. If you drop your self-consciousness, only then you can enter.\nAnd what is a temple? – it is an emptiness. It is nothing surrounded by walls – it is an emptiness. You drop the ego outside. This was the problem for the Master: to write these three words in such a flow, that while he was writing them, not even a single touch of the self entered into them. Difficult, because you will not be able to judge this unless you know how self-consciousness can destroy the flow. The first principle is to be in such a flow that ‘I’ is no block – you simply live in a let-go.\nNothing is like Japanese or Chinese calligraphy; no language can do that, only they can do it – pictorial, flowing, doing it with a brush. Years of training are needed. First a man has to be taught the skill of calligraphy, and that alone won’t do because just skill is not the point. A very egoist person can become very skillful but that is not the point.\nFirst one has to learn calligraphy for years and then the Master says: Now drop it for a few years. forget about it. For three or four years, the disciple has to forget about it. He will do other things: gardening, cleaning, many millions of things, but not calligraphy. He has to completely forget it so that the skill doesn’t remain in the ego, on the surface, but the skill settles, and settles, and settles at the center, reaches to the very bottom of the river.\nThen the Master says: Now – now you can do calligraphy. But do it without any self-consciousness, do it as if you are not the doer, as if someone else is doing it through you; you become just instrumental and just move with the energy. That was the point, and it was going to be on the gate.\nTHE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY THE MASTER KOSEN. WHEN KOSEN WAS DRAWING THE CHARACTERS THERE WAS A PUPIL STANDING BY WHO HAD MIXED THE INK.\n... standing by who had mixed the ink. The ink has to be mixed fresh constantly; ready-made ink is not used. These are all symbolic things – everything should be fresh, moving in the moment. A pupil stands by who goes on preparing the ink, and the Master goes on doing the calligraphy.\nBut when the pupil saw the first calligraphy complete, he said: Not so good. At Kosen’s first try this became the problem: immediately the Master became aware of the disciple, that he was standing there judging, looking. And when somebody is judging it is very difficult to remain self- unconscious. He became self-conscious; a slight tremor in the hand, a slight fear, a slight effort, because somebody was going to judge – he became afraid, a slight nervousness entered him.\nMulla Nasrudin was invited to speak in a ladies’ club. A woman entered into the room and asked Nasrudin: Are you feeling nervous? He was just about to speak after a few minutes. Nasrudin said: No, I have never felt nervous, never in my life! – but he was trembling as he spoke. The woman said: Then what are you doing here in the ladies room? Nervous, he had not noticed that he was in a ladies’ room. He was not conscious, he was walking up and down.\nWhen you are nervous you are not yourself. When you are self-conscious, you are not your true Self; you are afraid, there is a slight trembling inside because others are going to judge whether they appreciate you or not – a fear has entered.\nI have heard about one Zen Master, Bokuju, that he would talk to his disciples even though sometimes the disciples would not come at the right time. He would start talking and there was no one to listen. Sometimes he would talk for so long that the disciples would simply disappear, but he would continue.\nI have known a man in my own life. I had a teacher, a rare teacher. I was the only student in his subject, so he told me: Remember one thing, because I don’t follow rules; when I am speaking, I cannot remember time, so if you feel uneasy, or you would like to go to the bathroom, simply go and don’t disturb me. And then return silently, sit and I will continue. While you are gone I cannot disrupt my flow, so it is for you to go and come, but don’t disturb me. And don’t wait, because nobody knows when I will stop. I may start when the bell rings, but I cannot stop, because how can the bell control me? Starting by it is okay, but stopping? If something is incomplete, how can I stop? – I will have to complete it. So if you are fed up or bored, simply go. I tried many times – I would be outside up to half an hour, and when I returned he would be speaking and there was nobody there.\nThis type of man could not be nervous because he was not bothered about whether somebody was listening or not; he was not bothered about whether somebody was judging him or not. But Kosen was bothered he was not yet a Perfect Master. This showed that he was more interested in the judgement of others than in doing his own thing. He was not yet centered. He was almost at the center, approximately he had reached, but something was missing.\n‘NOT SO GOOD,’ SAID THE PUPIL AT KOSEN’S FIRST TRY. ‘THAT IS WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE,’ SAID THE PUPIL TO THE SECOND TRY. AND SO IT WENT ON.\n– He must have become more and more worried –\nAFTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH TRY, THE INK WAS RUNNING LOW, SO THE PUPIL WENT OUT TO MIX SOME MORE. ‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’ THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’\nThe pupil was outside, so while he was out of the way, Kosen wanted to give it a last try. Because when the pupil was out Kosen was not self-conscious; nobody was there to judge.\n‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’\nWhen the pupil is out of the way, the ego is also out of the way. While the pupil is out Kosen is also out. Because of the pupil, Kosen could not NOT BE; because of the pupil he had to be there. When the pupil was out of the way, Kosen was also out of the way – the passage was clear, there was nobody. The pupil and Kosen had both disappeared.\nWHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED, HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THIS LATEST EFFORT, AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!\nHow had it happened? He failed sixty-four times and the sixty-fifth time, he attained. How did it happen? – sixty-four times he was there to do it; the last time he was not there to do it – it had been done by the Beyond.\nWhen you are not, the Beyond functions; when you are, the Beyond cannot function because you are in the way.\nNot only did this calligraphy become a masterpiece, but through this calligraphy, Kosen became a Perfect Master; never again could anybody bother him, never again was he nervous, never again was he self-conscious – never again! This became a revelation, a realization. He could see through and through what the problem was: it was not the pupil, it was he himself; it was not his eye and judgement, it was his own ego.\nRemember this, because a moment will come in your meditation when only you will be in your way, nobody else. A moment is bound to come in your own growth also, when everything is clear and only you are in the way.\nSo never think about what others are thinking about your meditation. Never think about others: why they are judging you, how they are judging you. Their judgement is their affair, it is their business, it has nothing to do with you. You do your thing and do it totally; efface yourself utterly, then everything starts happening.\nThe moment the doer leaves, everything starts happening because the doer is the problem. Let it happen. If meditation is not happening, you are still doing it. You are still a doer, you are still watching how and what others are thinking, whether they will judge you mad. If their judgement is in your mind you cannot be total, you are divided.\nOnly the ego thinks about others, because it depends on others. It is nothing but a collection of others’ opinions, what others say about you. You are continuously on display, an exhibitionist: ’What\nare others thinking, what are others saying?’ Because of these others your ego remains, becomes more and more solid, crystallized.\nHave you ever observed that whenever you are not thinking of others and not thinking of what they think about you, suddenly you have a different flow of energy within you, an unblocked flow – there is no block and the river flows to the ocean? And then whatsoever you do becomes a masterpiece – whatsoever! Your quality is now totally different. Now you exist on a different plane altogether and whatsoever you do, even a very small thing, becomes totally different. It becomes ‘the first principle’.\nIf you are total, even if you remove your shoes before you enter this house, you remove them in a different way. It becomes ‘the first principle’.\nIf a calligraphy, just three words, ‘The First Principle’, can become a great message, why not shoes? The way you walk becomes ‘the first principle’. You walk unself-consciously – you walk like an animal, like a bird, or you sit under a tree and you sit like a tree, unself-conscious. And then suddenly, many millions of things start flowering within you. The only problem is that you are, and the only solution is that you should not be there.\nJust give way; don’t stand there, just give way, just put yourself aside. Difficult – that’s why it is the first principle. But once you can do it, the temple is opened – you have entered. There is nobody blocking the way except you.\nLook at how you do things and you will always find the ego. People saying prayers always look around; go to a mosque and watch, go to a temple and watch. If many people are there, then people say their prayer with a fervor. If there is nobody to look at them they simply do it in haste, as if the prayer is not addressed to God but to the bystanders, to the onlookers.\nThis is happening continuously, whatsoever you do. You are not enjoying the act, you are enjoying others’ opinions. And what value does it carry, what is the meaning in it, why are you here? – just to be judged by others that you are a very good man, a religious man, a meditator, a seeker after Truth? Truth doesn’t seem to be so important as others saying that you are a great seeker after Truth.\nPeople come to me every day. I watch. Something is happening to someone’s back, maybe just a back-ache. He comes to me, and if I say: It is nothing but a back-ache, go to the doctor; he doesn’t feel very good. If I say: It is your kundalini rising, and look at his face, he feels very happy, tremendously happy. And in a hundred cases, ninety nine cases are back-ache. He says: Something is happening in the third eye. But it is nothing, just a headache. If I say: Go and take aspirin or something, he simply feels badly. I see it in his face. He had come for something else, for recognition that he is growing, that he is reaching somewhere. Through headaches no one has ever reached. Not only does headache have to be left behind, but the head itself has to be left behind.\nWatch yourself, be alert to what you are doing. Don’t be a fool, and don’t befool yourself. It is so easy to, but the Ultimate can happen only when this foolishness disappears. Nothing else will help. Unless you want to go on accumulating more junk around your ego, watch whatsoever you do and remain alert. Don’t go on moving like a somnambulist and don’t try to seek any recognition from others. Just be alert, and watch and wait – and the Ultimate will happen to you. Because through watching, you will disappear. Through forgetting about others you will forget your own ego.\nEven with God people have the same relationship – they pray loudly just to get some recognition from the Ultimate. Because no recognition can come from that source, they have created mid-agencies: priests, popes; they can give you recognition.\nGod never recognizes you. God recognizes you only when you are not, and that’s the trouble. That’s why priests exist; they can give you recognition. They can tell you: Yes, you are growing. If you are growing, there is no need to ask anybody; the growth will speak for itself, and even if the whole world denies it, it doesn’t matter. If you are growing, the growth itself will say; you will feel it, you will be fulfilled through it. You will not go asking. God gives no recognition to you.\nThat’s why in this century we have said: God is dead. If He doesn’t give us recognition, how can He be alive? If He does not come and give us a certificate, how can He be alive? He should recognize us – only then.\nWe would like to carry our egos to the very end; because He is not there to affirm. And unless you also become a nobody like Him, there is no possibility of meeting Him. We have created priests, great churches; they give you certificates.\nI know a man. He is the head priest of a small Mohammedan community in India. He gives a letter; exactly, literally a letter; he writes a letter referring a man’s name who is going to die to God, saying that he has donated this much and he has done that much, and this and that, so ‘take care of him’. The letter is to be put into the grave with the man. And people feel very, very happy; they donate, they give money, they fast, they pray just to get a big certificate. You are dying in your grave and the letter will remain there.\nI was speaking to this community once. I told them: You just go and dig your own graves and you will find those letters there. But they were afraid to dig because if they were to find the letters there, then the whole edifice would fall. Then what to do? Then who would give them recognition?\nDon’t ask for recognition because all recognition is the effort of the ego. Don’t look at others, just watch yourself. When you grow, you know. When you flower, you know. When you are blessed you will know. If you grow there is no possibility not to know; it is absolutely certain that you will know.\nBut because in our lives we continuously live with other, always looking in their eyes, at how they feel, at how they think about us, we go on and on. Then the habit becomes a fixed pattern. When you move into the other world you carry the same habit.\nJust a few days ago one man came to me and he said: I have become Enlightened. I said: It is very good, now everything is finished. Why you have come to me? He answered: Just to check. What type of Enlightenment is this that you are not certain of it?\nThere was a case against Mulla Nasrudin. Because he was drunk, he had insulted somebody, so he was taken to court. The magistrate said: Nasrudin, are you here again? Are you guilty or not? Nasrudin said: Guilty your honor, but I would like to be tried to make certain. Nobody is certain even about himself, and everybody is looking at the other.\nOnce it happened that Mulla Nasrudin’s four-year old child asked him: Daddy, why you married Mummy? Mulla Nasrudin stared at the child for a few seconds and said: So, you also are not certain\nwhy? You also are asking why? Also I am not certain. He added: If you can find out some day why I married your Mummy, please tell me.\nYou live in an uncertainty; your only certainty is others’ recognition. When you start moving to the Beyond this is not needed. And that is the temple, and the first principle is at the door: drop yourself – drop yourself utterly. You cannot be allowed to enter. When you are not, then you are allowed. Then you flow into the temple; then there is no blockage of energy.\nTry it – be watchful and move in the world as if you are alone – there is nobody, move in the world as if it is a total loneliness – there is nobody. If nobody is there your self-consciousness will drop by and by. Then the pupil will be out, and with the pupil, you also will have gone out.\n‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’ THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’ WHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THIS LATEST EFFORT, AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!\nIf you can put yourself out of the way, your whole being will say – masterpiece! You become the masterpiece. There are two types of creators in the world: one type of creator works with objects – a poet, a painter, they work with objects, they create things; the other type of creator, the mystic, creates himself. He doesn’t work with objects, he works with the subject; he works on himself, his own being. And he is the real creator, the real poet because he makes himself into a masterpiece.\nYou are carrying a masterpiece hidden within you, but you are standing in the way. Just move aside, then the masterpiece will be revealed.\nEveryone is a masterpiece because God never gives birth to anything less than that. Everyone carries that masterpiece hidden for many lives, not knowing who they are, and just trying on the surface to become someone. Drop the idea of becoming someone because you already are a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it. God has Himself created you, you cannot be improved.\nHere, I’m not teaching you to improve your life – no, not me. I am simply teaching you to know the life that is already there, that has already always been there, that is already the case.\nJust put yourself aside, so your eyes are not filled with the ego, your being is not cloudy, and the sky becomes open. Suddenly, not only you, but the whole Existence says: A masterpiece! This is ‘the first principle’.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7948","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/returning_to_the_source/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/returning_to_the_source/>Returning to the Source</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 The First Principle</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7948 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Returning_to_the_Source/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

TEMPLE IN KYOTO WHICH SAY: THE FIRST PRINCIPLE. PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AND
NEAR TO ADMIRE THEM. THE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY THE
MASTER KOSEN. WHEN KOSEN WAS DRAWING THE CHARACTERS THERE WAS A PUPIL
STANDING BY WHO HAD MIXED THE INK. ‘NOT SO GOOD,’ SAID THE PUPIL AT
KOSEN’S FIRST TRY. ‘THAT’S WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE,’ SAID THE PUPIL TO
THE SECOND TRY. AND SO IT WENT ON. AFTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH TRY, THE INK
WAS RUNNING LOW, SO THE PUPIL WENT OUT TO MIX SOME MORE. ‘JUST A QUICK
ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’ THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT
OF THE WAY.’ WHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED, HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AS THIS LATEST
EFFORT, AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!</p><p><br></p><p>A few things before we enter this beautiful story. First, if you are
divided, then a conflict arises not only in the mind, but in your
bio-energy – then you are two. And if you are two, energy is wasted in
the conflict; the energy is dissipated. Unless you are one, nothing can
be done. As far as the inner journey is concerned, your oneness will be
needed more and more. On the surface it is okay; you can go on doing the
day-to-day work even if you are divided.</p><p><br></p><p>Just imagine a circle with a center: if you draw two lines from the
periphery towards the center, on the periphery they are divided; the
more you come towards the center, the more the gap becomes less and less
and less; just near the center the gap is almost not; at the center the
gap disappears. At the center everything becomes one; at the periphery
everything is divided, is two.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are self-conscious you are two, because then you exist at
the periphery. When you are not self-conscious you are one, because then
you don’t exist at the periphery, you exist at the center.</p><p>If you are an egoist, you are dissipating your energy because the ego
exists at the periphery. The ego exists for others; it has to be on the
periphery. When you are totally alone in your innermost being the ego
doesn’t exist. You are but the ego is not and when you are, without the
ego, your energy is tremendous. When you are without the ego, you are a
God. Then you are undivided, and the source of energy is infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>At the periphery everything is divided, and not only divided, but in
conflict. It is as if I am fighting both my hands – right fights the
left, left fights the right. What will happen? Is there any possibility
of either hand being victorious? – no possibility, because both hands
are mine The right cannot win because it is mine; the left cannot be
defeated – it is mine.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind both hands I am one, so there is no possibility of any
victory. And all victories will be just dreams, pretensions. I can fool
myself, I can put my right hand on top of my left and say: Now the right
has won. I can change the situation in a single moment; I can put the
left on top of the right and say: The left has won. This is what you
have been doing continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>If you fight with yourself, there is no victory. Nobody is going to
be defeated, nobody is going to win; the whole game is stupid. But one
thing is certain – if you go on fighting with yourself, you are
dissipating energy. The right cannot win, the left cannot win – you will
be defeated in the end. It is suicidal, you are destroying yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are one, you become a creator, when you are two, you become
suicidal – you destroy yourself. And how do you become two? Whenever
self-consciousness arises, you become two. Whenever you look at others
and feel; What do they think about me? – you become two.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all that is beautiful cannot happen when you are two. A
creator has to forget everything, he has to forget the whole world; only
then something from Beyond descends.</p><p><br></p><p>One great English poet, Coleridge, has left only seven poems
completed, and he was one of the greatest masters. He left thousands of
poems incomplete. Forty thousand in all have been calculated; only seven
complete.</p><p><br></p><p>Just before his death somebody asked: What is the matter with you?
The whole house is filled with incomplete poems, and a few poems need
just a touch – the last line, or three lines are there one line is
missing. Why can’t you complete them?</p><p><br></p><p>Coleridge is reported to have said: Who can complete them? I have
never written a single word. When I am not, then something descends.
Only three lines came; I was waiting for the fourth but it never came.
And I cannot complete it because it will come from a different plane of
being. I was not when these three lines came, and I would be there too
much when the fourth is added. I could add it, but that would be just
false. It would be something imposed – it won’t have a flow, it won’t be
authentic, it won’t be true. So what can I do? I can simply wait.</p><p><br></p><p>He waited for certain poems for twenty years, and then the line, the
missing line would descend, and he would add it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about one of the greatest poets of India, Rabindranath
Tagore, that whenever he would be writing a poem or painting a picture,
he would become so self-conscious that he would forget to eat,</p><p>he would forget to drink, he would forget to sleep. Even his wife
would come but he would not be able to recognize who was standing before
him. So whenever he was in a creative mood, nobody would disturb him,
nobody would go near his house. He was in such a different state of
being that to disturb him could be fatal. For three days, four days,
even for weeks, he would not eat, he would not do anything. He had
become just a vehicle – he was ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that Rabindranath’s book, GEETANJALI, for which he was
awarded the Nobel Prize, became world famous. He translated it himself
because he wrote in.Bengali. The original was Bengali and he translated
it into English himself. But he was not so confident, it is easy to
translate prose, it is very, very difficult to translate poetry, even if
it is your own.</p><p><br></p><p>Poetry exists somewhere beyond grammar – it is more music, less
language, it is more a feeling and less a thought. It eludes, and that
is the beauty of it – you cannot fix it. It is like a river moving, it
is not like a pond. Prose is like a pond, poetry is like a river.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath tried for many days; he would work on single pieces.
Then he translated it completely. But not confident, he asked C. F.
Andrews for help. C. F. Andrews was one of the colleagues of Mahatma
Gandhi, he worked for India’s independence very deeply. C. F. Andrews
looked through it and he said: It is wonderful, beautiful! Only at four
places would I like to change it because at four places it is not
grammatical. So he changed it at four places, just four words, and
Rabindranath was very happy. Andrews said: It is okay now.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath took it to London. Before it was to be published he
called a small gathering of poets at the house of Yeats, one of the
great poets of England. Almost twenty poets, all known, had gathered –
they listened. Then Rabindranath asked: Do you feel that something is
missing? Yeats stood and he said: At four places something is wrong.
Rabindranath was surprised. He couldn’t believe it because nobody else
knew that C. F. Andrews had changed the book at four places. He asked:
What are those four places? – and they were exactly the same places.
Yeats said: At these four places the flow has stopped. Someone else has
put in those four words, not you.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeats was a very perceptive poet; he could feel that the river had
somewhere become a pond, that someone else from a different plane of
being had entered, that something had become like a block; the river was
not flowing as easily afterwards as it had been flowing before. There
was a stone, a rock somewhere. Grammar is like a rock – it is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath then said: Yes, C. F. Andrews suggested these words, and
he is an Englishman, so he knows better. English is not my mother
tongue. He added: These were the four words I had used before Andrews
corrected it. Yeats said: They are ungrammatical but they are poetic,
they have the flow, so forget the grammar and retain the flow.</p><p><br></p><p>At the very center, the flow is the thing. Grammar is irrelevant,
grammar exists on the surface; at the center – only a flow of energy. A
different plane of being is needed. When something from the Beyond
descends into you, you are needed to be one.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two planes of humanity: duality, the plane of duality,
what Hindus call DWAITA, the plane of two; and non-duality, the plane of
one, the plane of the non-dual. When you are divided you are in this
world; when you are undivided, you have transcended – you are no longer
here, you have</p><p>penetrated into the Beyond. Then boundaries meet and the boundaries
meet in you. So the whole effort is how to become undivided, how to
become one.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other night a girl came to me and she said: I am already a
sannyasin inside. Why divide the outside from the inside? Is there
really a division between inside and outside? Where is the demarcation
line? Can you draw a line and say:</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond this is inside? Where? – at the body can you draw a line? If
the body dies, you die, If the body is not there, where are you?</p><p><br></p><p>At the mind then? – if the mind becomes unconscious you become
unconscious. Who are you without the mind? Where do you divide? –
everything is linked.</p><p><br></p><p>At the periphery it is outside; at the center it is inside, but the
periphery belongs to the center. Can you have a center without a
periphery? – then what type of center would that be? The center belongs
to the periphery. Can you have a periphery without a center? – they
belong to each other. They are just like two banks of a river – the
river flows in between and you cannot divide.</p><p><br></p><p>You are hungry – you don’t say: Hunger is inside so how can I eat the
food which is outside? You eat the food and the food becomes your blood,
and the blood becomes your bio-energy, and your bio-energy becomes your
thinking, and your thinking becomes your heart, your feeling, and your
feeling becomes your witness, and your witness becomes the Divine, the
Ultimate. There is a subtle digestion on every plane.</p><p><br></p><p>You take the food, it is outside. The moment you have taken it in,
you digest it, the non-essential is thrown out again; the essential
moves towards the center. You have digested it – it has become blood,
bones, flesh – the body. Then again a digestion takes place – the most
subtle of it is again absorbed. It becomes your bio – energy, what
scientists call bio-plasma. It becomes electricity in you.</p><p><br></p><p>But then again, a digestion happens; the essential in it is again
absorbed inwards – it becomes your thoughts. Thought is subtle
electricity. Then again you move inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking is digested into feeling – it becomes your heart, so love is
still a more subtle bio-energy than thinking, but that too is not the
end.</p><p><br></p><p>Again in love, that which is more subtle is absorbed and digested –
it becomes your witness, your meditation. It becomes your awareness, but
that too is not the end because still the witness is there, and when the
witness is there the division is there.</p><p><br></p><p>The division has become narrow; you are coming almost to the center
but the division is still there. You are a witness – the subject and the
object. Of what are you a witness? The division is still there.</p><p><br></p><p>Then at the last jump energy has become totally centered; the object
and subject disappear. Then there is no witness, then you have gone to
the Beyond, then you are as if you are not. You are and you are not; you
have become the Whole.</p><p>This is the state, the final state where in one way you are totally,
utterly annihilated, and in another way you have become the Whole. The
son disappears, now you have become the Father. Now there is no Jesus,
just the Supreme-most Father exists – the son is absorbed. Where will
you draw the line between that which is outside and that which is
inside?</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me and they say: Inside we are already
SANNYASINS. But is there really a division on the outside? And if you
divide you become two; if you become two, then the conflict arises, the
whole game of inner war, an inner politics arises – who is to dominate
whom? Either the outside is to dominate the inside, or the inside is to
dominate the outside. If the outside dominates the inside you become a
materialist. If the inside dominates the outside you become a
spiritualist. In either case you are half, you are not whole.</p><p><br></p><p>When the outside and inside disappear, nobody dominates anybody,
because a domination is not a good state of affairs. The one who
dominates will be thrown sooner or later, the oppressors will become the
oppressed, and the oppressed will become the oppressors. It is just a
fight between your left hand and right hand and the whole game is a
pretense. Remember this paradox: the more you go inwards, the less of
the outer there is. When you really reach to the innermost, inner and
outer both disappear. Then you are nothing, and everything.</p><p><br></p><p>In a school a teacher was asking tricky questions, and then she said:
Charlie Brown, how will you define nothingness? Without a single
moment’s hesitation Charlie Brown said: Nothingness is a balloon with
its skin off. That is you at the last moment, the skin off –
nothingness. But then you have become the Whole because the skin was
dividing you from the Whole.</p><p><br></p><p>And where is your skin? Self-consciousness, the ego is your skin.
When the ego is off you become nothing and the Whole simultaneously,
because they both mean the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing to be understood: you may have observed in yourself
and in others also, that there is a very deep urge to become
unconscious. Puritans cannot understand it, moralists cannot understand
it, hence the appeal of all types of alcohols, drugs, chemical
intoxicants – why? Preachers go on preaching against it but it has not
changed a single person; not a single man has been changed through it.
Humanity goes on moving on its path: puritans go on condemning, but
nobody listens to them.</p><p><br></p><p>It cannot be an ordinary thing, something extraordinary is involved.
That’s why it is so difficult to try to change an alcoholic – very, very
difficult, almost impossible. Why is there so much appeal in becoming
unconscious? – because self-consciousness is such a disease, it is such
a burden. And there are only two ways to go beyond it: one is to fall
into unconsciousness, the other is to become superbly conscious. Either
move to superconsciousness, or move to unconsciousness.
Self-consciousness is such a tension, such an anguish and anxiety, so
move either to alcohol, or move to God.</p><p><br></p><p>God and the devil, God and alcohol are not opposites really. If God
is Supreme Consciousness, then unconsciousness is the opposite pole.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: Once it happened that a social worker who was trying to
convert people towards, religion and against sin, against alcohol, came
to see Mulla Nasrudin. She said: Last time I came to</p><p>see you, you were sober, and it made me tremendously happy. But now
you are again intoxicated and it makes me very, very unhappy. ‘True,’
said Mulla Nasrudin beaming with happiness. He said: This time it is my
turn to be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Alcohol, unconsciousness, may not give you happiness. but at least it
helps you to forget unhappiness. You forget your anxieties, and through
the chemical help you drop the division, the division into two, the
self-consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-consciousness is the greatest tension in the mind. That’s why
sometimes you would like to be alone; you would like to go to the
Himalayas, and forget the whole society.</p><p><br></p><p>Society is not the problem, but when the other is present, it is very
difficult to be self-unconscious or to be unself-conscious – both are
the same.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult when the other is present to forget yourself; the
thou creates the I within you, they are two polarities. When nobody is
there and you are alone, you feel a certain relaxation. That’s why
people go to the forests. But then too they become bored, because when
you are alone tension is not there, but boredom enters because
excitement disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Excitement is a sort of anxiety – anxiety is a sort of excitement. If
you are after excitement, you cannot be meditative, you cannot move to a
solitary place, you cannot move inwards, because there you will be alone
and there is no excitement. Excitement needs the other. Alone, how can
you be excited? – nothing is happening, how can you be excited? For
anything to happen the other is needed. So if you are alone you become
bored. If you move with society, live in relationship, then you become
much to tense.</p><p><br></p><p>So going into loneliness won’t help. But if you can drop your
self-consciousness while living in society with others; in relationship
if you can drop your self-consciousness, suddenly there is no tension
and no boredom, and life is a constant celebration without any
excitement. It is a very silent celebration. It is a joy, but without
any excitement; it is a very, very cool happiness; it is a deep
fulfillment, but without any excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha is so fulfilled, but there is no excitement about it. He’s
simply fulfilled. He has not achieved anything, nothing new has
happened, but he has simply become so content with himself that it is
very, very cool state of enjoyment – it is a cool state of bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, that is the difference between bliss and happiness:
happiness is excitement; bliss is happiness without excitement. If there
is excitement, sooner or later you will get bored, because only when the
excitement is new it is excitement. But how can you be excited about the
same thing again and again?</p><p><br></p><p>You are excited about a woman or a man, but when the honeymoon is
over, then the excitement is also over. Almost always, by the end of the
honeymoon, a marriage ends – then there is just a hang- over, because
you are looking for excitement, and excitement cannot be a continuous
phenomenon. Unless your love is cool, not cold remember, but cool – cold
is dead, cool is alive, but without any excitement – it is bound to turn
into boredom.</p><p>In the world everything ends in boredom, it has to. When you attain
to the innermost core of your being, you are happy without any cause,
you are happy without any reason, you are happy without any excitement.
There will be no boredom. And this is what happens in love also.</p><p><br></p><p>You need love, because only in love do you become self-unconscious;
only in love does the other disappear. There is no need to be ‘I’. With
someone you love you can be alone. Even if the lover or the beloved is
present you can be alone. The deepest possibility in love is that it
helps you to drop self-consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have to continuously carry the other’s presence, if you
have to behave accordingly, if you have to follow rules, if you have to
plan even in love what to say and what not to say, then this love is
sooner or later going to turn sour, bitter, because self-consciousness
is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever you find self-consciousness disappearing: in alcohol, in
love, in meditation, you feel good. But alcohol cannot give you a
permanent state; love can give that to you, but that possibility is
very, very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, love is more difficult than meditation because love means
living with the other and without the self. Meditation means living with
oneself, forgetting the other completely – it is a less difficult
dimension than love. That’s why those who can love don’t need
meditation; they will reach through love.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: Love is God. But to love is very difficult. It is
difficult because the other enters with all his problems. The other is
ill – you are ill, and when two ill persons meet, illness is not only
doubled, it is multiplied.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult to love, but if you can love then there is no
need for any meditation. Love will become your meditation and you will
reach through it. If you cannot love, if you feel it difficult then
meditation is the only door.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one in a million reaches through love; others reach through
meditation. Once you become meditative love also becomes easy, and then
you can love. If you love then meditation comes as a shadow of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to decide how to drop your self-consciousness. There are two
methods: one is through love, through a relationship; living with the
other, and growing – it is a difficult path, very, very arduous – there
is nothing more difficult than that; and the other is living in
meditation. You have to choose.</p><p><br></p><p>If you grow in love, meditation will happen like a shadow. Love and
meditation are two aspects of the same coin; if you have gained control
of the one aspect, the other follows. If you meditate, love will follow
– if you love, meditation will follow. This you have to choose.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is easier – love is more difficult. Unless you want to
move into the difficult unnecessarily – that is for you to decide – with
meditation love comes automatically. This is my feeling: that ninety-
nine percent in one hundred have to go through meditation, then love
will happen. Only one percent can go through love, and meditation
happens. This is the state of affairs, this is how things are. But</p><p>one thing is certain, that in either case self-conscious is to be
dropped. Now try to understand this story.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL LETTERS CARVED OVER THE GATE OF THE OAKU
TEMPLE IN KYOTO WHICH SAYS: THE FIRST PRINCIPLE. PEOPLE COME FROM FAR
AND NEAR TO ADMIRE THEM. THE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY
THE MASTER KOSEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen uses all types of skills to grow in meditation; calligraphy is
one of them. If you have seen Japanese or Chinese calligraphy, you will
become aware of a certain quality – there is flow. No other language can
do that, because every other language has an alphabet. The Far Eastern
languages – Chinese, Japanese, don’t have an alphabet. They are
pictorial languages; not the pen, but the brush is used, and the flow is
the quality.</p><p><br></p><p>So a calligraphy is not only that which is written, it also carries
something. of the Master who has done it – the flow. Change is not
allowed, you cannot correct it; you have simply to do it in one stroke.
A very skilled Master, a very mindful state is needed. You cannot change
it, you cannot correct it. If you correct it, the whole point is lost
because then the ego enters. You simply have to flow with it.</p><p><br></p><p>These are pictures and the basic thing is not that which is written,
the basic thing is that which is hidden. You will be surprised. On the
gate of a temple only these words are written: The First Principle. What
type of message is that? – The First Principle, it says nothing. If you
go and read these words: The First Principle, what does it say? There is
no message in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The First Principle is ‘flow’ – it is not written; these words are
just an indirect way. If you look at the calligraphy, there is the first
principle, the flow. If you can flow, if your energy can flow without
any blocks you will achieve. But the moment you become self-conscious,
block enters, immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like falling into sleep – if you become self-conscious you
cannot fall into sleep. Now the West is suffering from insomnia, and
sooner or later the whole world will suffer, because sleep needs
self-unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet the whole civilization teaches you how to be more
self-conscious – walk, do, move in life, the whole training is how to be
a subtle egoist. The Western psychology says that a mature ego is
needed; the whole Eastern effort is that a mature egolessness is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, when you become egoless, only then you are mature, never
before.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is a juvenile phenomenon. It is childish, it is foolish, it is
idiotic, because through ego you simply cut yourself off from the
universal flow; then you are no longer a part of it. It is as if a wave
in the ocean says: I am total, I do not belong to the ocean – I have
nothing to do with the ocean, I am separate. Ego is separation, and
whenever a wave says: I am separated, the wave is foolish. The wave is
one with the ocean, ocean waves in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Real maturity is to attain an egolessness – a balloon with the skin
off – then you are fully mature, a Buddha, one who is now awakened.
Western psychology teaches that you should become a mature</p><p>ego – it is good. If you are attaining it just to throw it, then it
is good, because you can throw a thing only when you have it.</p><p><br></p><p>Attain an ego, it is good, but don’t get caught in it. It is
something to be attained and thrown. It is something you have to get,
because if you don’t have an ego, how will you achieve surrender? This
has been a constant problem for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Eastern people come to me: Indians, Japanese, they can surrender very
easily. They are almost ready to surrender, but they have nothing to
surrender. Western people come to me; they are very, very antagonistic
to surrender, and they have something to surrender. If they surrender,
they will grow. And Eastern people, before they surrender something they
have to attain a mature ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember only that which you have can be surrender. If you don’t have
an ego, what are you going to surrender? The Western psychology takes
the first step and the Eastern religion takes the last. They are
complementary. Unless Western psychology and Eastern religion meet, man
is going to remain in trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>What is in these words, ‘The First Principle’? They say nothing. But
‘The First Principle’ is not the point, the words are not the point .The
point is, the point was, for the Master to make them with such a flow,
that even a touch of self-consciousness is in them. Whosoever loves to
read between lines will be able to read at this temple gate.</p><p><br></p><p>And why at the gate? – because that is the gate of the temple. If you
are self-conscious, you cannot enter a temple; that is the first
principle. If you have self-consciousness, an egoist mind, you cannot
enter the temple. If you drop your self-consciousness, only then you can
enter.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is a temple? – it is an emptiness. It is nothing surrounded
by walls – it is an emptiness. You drop the ego outside. This was the
problem for the Master: to write these three words in such a flow, that
while he was writing them, not even a single touch of the self entered
into them. Difficult, because you will not be able to judge this unless
you know how self-consciousness can destroy the flow. The first
principle is to be in such a flow that ‘I’ is no block – you simply live
in a let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is like Japanese or Chinese calligraphy; no language can do
that, only they can do it – pictorial, flowing, doing it with a brush.
Years of training are needed. First a man has to be taught the skill of
calligraphy, and that alone won’t do because just skill is not the
point. A very egoist person can become very skillful but that is not the
point.</p><p><br></p><p>First one has to learn calligraphy for years and then the Master
says: Now drop it for a few years. forget about it. For three or four
years, the disciple has to forget about it. He will do other things:
gardening, cleaning, many millions of things, but not calligraphy. He
has to completely forget it so that the skill doesn’t remain in the ego,
on the surface, but the skill settles, and settles, and settles at the
center, reaches to the very bottom of the river.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the Master says: Now – now you can do calligraphy. But do it
without any self-consciousness, do it as if you are not the doer, as if
someone else is doing it through you; you become just instrumental and
just move with the energy. That was the point, and it was going to be on
the gate.</p><p>THE ORIGINAL CALLIGRAPHY WAS DONE ON PAPER BY THE MASTER KOSEN. WHEN
KOSEN WAS DRAWING THE CHARACTERS THERE WAS A PUPIL STANDING BY WHO HAD
MIXED THE INK.</p><p><br></p><p>... standing by who had mixed the ink. The ink has to be mixed fresh
constantly; ready-made ink is not used. These are all symbolic things –
everything should be fresh, moving in the moment. A pupil stands by who
goes on preparing the ink, and the Master goes on doing the
calligraphy.</p><p><br></p><p>But when the pupil saw the first calligraphy complete, he said: Not
so good. At Kosen’s first try this became the problem: immediately the
Master became aware of the disciple, that he was standing there judging,
looking. And when somebody is judging it is very difficult to remain
self- unconscious. He became self-conscious; a slight tremor in the
hand, a slight fear, a slight effort, because somebody was going to
judge – he became afraid, a slight nervousness entered him.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was invited to speak in a ladies’ club. A woman
entered into the room and asked Nasrudin: Are you feeling nervous? He
was just about to speak after a few minutes. Nasrudin said: No, I have
never felt nervous, never in my life! – but he was trembling as he
spoke. The woman said: Then what are you doing here in the ladies room?
Nervous, he had not noticed that he was in a ladies’ room. He was not
conscious, he was walking up and down.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are nervous you are not yourself. When you are
self-conscious, you are not your true Self; you are afraid, there is a
slight trembling inside because others are going to judge whether they
appreciate you or not – a fear has entered.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one Zen Master, Bokuju, that he would talk to his
disciples even though sometimes the disciples would not come at the
right time. He would start talking and there was no one to listen.
Sometimes he would talk for so long that the disciples would simply
disappear, but he would continue.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known a man in my own life. I had a teacher, a rare teacher. I
was the only student in his subject, so he told me: Remember one thing,
because I don’t follow rules; when I am speaking, I cannot remember
time, so if you feel uneasy, or you would like to go to the bathroom,
simply go and don’t disturb me. And then return silently, sit and I will
continue. While you are gone I cannot disrupt my flow, so it is for you
to go and come, but don’t disturb me. And don’t wait, because nobody
knows when I will stop. I may start when the bell rings, but I cannot
stop, because how can the bell control me? Starting by it is okay, but
stopping? If something is incomplete, how can I stop? – I will have to
complete it. So if you are fed up or bored, simply go. I tried many
times – I would be outside up to half an hour, and when I returned he
would be speaking and there was nobody there.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of man could not be nervous because he was not bothered
about whether somebody was listening or not; he was not bothered about
whether somebody was judging him or not. But Kosen was bothered he was
not yet a Perfect Master. This showed that he was more interested in the
judgement of others than in doing his own thing. He was not yet
centered. He was almost at the center, approximately he had reached, but
something was missing.</p><p><br></p><p>‘NOT SO GOOD,’ SAID THE PUPIL AT KOSEN’S FIRST TRY. ‘THAT IS WORSE
THAN THE FIRST ONE,’ SAID THE PUPIL TO THE SECOND TRY. AND SO IT WENT
ON.</p><p>– He must have become more and more worried –</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH TRY, THE INK WAS RUNNING LOW, SO THE PUPIL
WENT OUT TO MIX SOME MORE. ‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’
THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’</p><p><br></p><p>The pupil was outside, so while he was out of the way, Kosen wanted
to give it a last try. Because when the pupil was out Kosen was not
self-conscious; nobody was there to judge.</p><p><br></p><p>‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK WHILE THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF
THE WAY.’</p><p><br></p><p>When the pupil is out of the way, the ego is also out of the way.
While the pupil is out Kosen is also out. Because of the pupil, Kosen
could not NOT BE; because of the pupil he had to be there. When the
pupil was out of the way, Kosen was also out of the way – the passage
was clear, there was nobody. The pupil and Kosen had both
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED, HE TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THIS LATEST EFFORT,
AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!</p><p><br></p><p>How had it happened? He failed sixty-four times and the sixty-fifth
time, he attained. How did it happen? – sixty-four times he was there to
do it; the last time he was not there to do it – it had been done by the
Beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are not, the Beyond functions; when you are, the Beyond
cannot function because you are in the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only did this calligraphy become a masterpiece, but through this
calligraphy, Kosen became a Perfect Master; never again could anybody
bother him, never again was he nervous, never again was he
self-conscious – never again! This became a revelation, a realization.
He could see through and through what the problem was: it was not the
pupil, it was he himself; it was not his eye and judgement, it was his
own ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this, because a moment will come in your meditation when
only you will be in your way, nobody else. A moment is bound to come in
your own growth also, when everything is clear and only you are in the
way.</p><p><br></p><p>So never think about what others are thinking about your meditation.
Never think about others: why they are judging you, how they are judging
you. Their judgement is their affair, it is their business, it has
nothing to do with you. You do your thing and do it totally; efface
yourself utterly, then everything starts happening.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment the doer leaves, everything starts happening because the
doer is the problem. Let it happen. If meditation is not happening, you
are still doing it. You are still a doer, you are still watching how and
what others are thinking, whether they will judge you mad. If their
judgement is in your mind you cannot be total, you are divided.</p><p><br></p><p>Only the ego thinks about others, because it depends on others. It is
nothing but a collection of others’ opinions, what others say about you.
You are continuously on display, an exhibitionist: ’What</p><p>are others thinking, what are others saying?’ Because of these others
your ego remains, becomes more and more solid, crystallized.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever observed that whenever you are not thinking of others
and not thinking of what they think about you, suddenly you have a
different flow of energy within you, an unblocked flow – there is no
block and the river flows to the ocean? And then whatsoever you do
becomes a masterpiece – whatsoever! Your quality is now totally
different. Now you exist on a different plane altogether and whatsoever
you do, even a very small thing, becomes totally different. It becomes
‘the first principle’.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are total, even if you remove your shoes before you enter this
house, you remove them in a different way. It becomes ‘the first
principle’.</p><p><br></p><p>If a calligraphy, just three words, ‘The First Principle’, can become
a great message, why not shoes? The way you walk becomes ‘the first
principle’. You walk unself-consciously – you walk like an animal, like
a bird, or you sit under a tree and you sit like a tree,
unself-conscious. And then suddenly, many millions of things start
flowering within you. The only problem is that you are, and the only
solution is that you should not be there.</p><p><br></p><p>Just give way; don’t stand there, just give way, just put yourself
aside. Difficult – that’s why it is the first principle. But once you
can do it, the temple is opened – you have entered. There is nobody
blocking the way except you.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at how you do things and you will always find the ego. People
saying prayers always look around; go to a mosque and watch, go to a
temple and watch. If many people are there, then people say their prayer
with a fervor. If there is nobody to look at them they simply do it in
haste, as if the prayer is not addressed to God but to the bystanders,
to the onlookers.</p><p><br></p><p>This is happening continuously, whatsoever you do. You are not
enjoying the act, you are enjoying others’ opinions. And what value does
it carry, what is the meaning in it, why are you here? – just to be
judged by others that you are a very good man, a religious man, a
meditator, a seeker after Truth? Truth doesn’t seem to be so important
as others saying that you are a great seeker after Truth.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me every day. I watch. Something is happening to
someone’s back, maybe just a back-ache. He comes to me, and if I say: It
is nothing but a back-ache, go to the doctor; he doesn’t feel very good.
If I say: It is your kundalini rising, and look at his face, he feels
very happy, tremendously happy. And in a hundred cases, ninety nine
cases are back-ache. He says: Something is happening in the third eye.
But it is nothing, just a headache. If I say: Go and take aspirin or
something, he simply feels badly. I see it in his face. He had come for
something else, for recognition that he is growing, that he is reaching
somewhere. Through headaches no one has ever reached. Not only does
headache have to be left behind, but the head itself has to be left
behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch yourself, be alert to what you are doing. Don’t be a fool, and
don’t befool yourself. It is so easy to, but the Ultimate can happen
only when this foolishness disappears. Nothing else will help. Unless
you want to go on accumulating more junk around your ego, watch
whatsoever you do and remain alert. Don’t go on moving like a
somnambulist and don’t try to seek any recognition from others. Just be
alert, and watch and wait – and the Ultimate will happen to you. Because
through watching, you will disappear. Through forgetting about others
you will forget your own ego.</p><p>Even with God people have the same relationship – they pray loudly
just to get some recognition from the Ultimate. Because no recognition
can come from that source, they have created mid-agencies: priests,
popes; they can give you recognition.</p><p><br></p><p>God never recognizes you. God recognizes you only when you are not,
and that’s the trouble. That’s why priests exist; they can give you
recognition. They can tell you: Yes, you are growing. If you are
growing, there is no need to ask anybody; the growth will speak for
itself, and even if the whole world denies it, it doesn’t matter. If you
are growing, the growth itself will say; you will feel it, you will be
fulfilled through it. You will not go asking. God gives no recognition
to you.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in this century we have said: God is dead. If He doesn’t
give us recognition, how can He be alive? If He does not come and give
us a certificate, how can He be alive? He should recognize us – only
then.</p><p><br></p><p>We would like to carry our egos to the very end; because He is not
there to affirm. And unless you also become a nobody like Him, there is
no possibility of meeting Him. We have created priests, great churches;
they give you certificates.</p><p><br></p><p>I know a man. He is the head priest of a small Mohammedan community
in India. He gives a letter; exactly, literally a letter; he writes a
letter referring a man’s name who is going to die to God, saying that he
has donated this much and he has done that much, and this and that, so
‘take care of him’. The letter is to be put into the grave with the man.
And people feel very, very happy; they donate, they give money, they
fast, they pray just to get a big certificate. You are dying in your
grave and the letter will remain there.</p><p><br></p><p>I was speaking to this community once. I told them: You just go and
dig your own graves and you will find those letters there. But they were
afraid to dig because if they were to find the letters there, then the
whole edifice would fall. Then what to do? Then who would give them
recognition?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask for recognition because all recognition is the effort of
the ego. Don’t look at others, just watch yourself. When you grow, you
know. When you flower, you know. When you are blessed you will know. If
you grow there is no possibility not to know; it is absolutely certain
that you will know.</p><p><br></p><p>But because in our lives we continuously live with other, always
looking in their eyes, at how they feel, at how they think about us, we
go on and on. Then the habit becomes a fixed pattern. When you move into
the other world you carry the same habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago one man came to me and he said: I have become
Enlightened. I said: It is very good, now everything is finished. Why
you have come to me? He answered: Just to check. What type of
Enlightenment is this that you are not certain of it?</p><p><br></p><p>There was a case against Mulla Nasrudin. Because he was drunk, he had
insulted somebody, so he was taken to court. The magistrate said:
Nasrudin, are you here again? Are you guilty or not? Nasrudin said:
Guilty your honor, but I would like to be tried to make certain. Nobody
is certain even about himself, and everybody is looking at the
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that Mulla Nasrudin’s four-year old child asked him:
Daddy, why you married Mummy? Mulla Nasrudin stared at the child for a
few seconds and said: So, you also are not certain</p><p>why? You also are asking why? Also I am not certain. He added: If you
can find out some day why I married your Mummy, please tell me.</p><p><br></p><p>You live in an uncertainty; your only certainty is others’
recognition. When you start moving to the Beyond this is not needed. And
that is the temple, and the first principle is at the door: drop
yourself – drop yourself utterly. You cannot be allowed to enter. When
you are not, then you are allowed. Then you flow into the temple; then
there is no blockage of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Try it – be watchful and move in the world as if you are alone –
there is nobody, move in the world as if it is a total loneliness –
there is nobody. If nobody is there your self-consciousness will drop by
and by. Then the pupil will be out, and with the pupil, you also will
have gone out.</p><p><br></p><p>‘JUST A QUICK ONE WITH THE LAST OF THE INK,’ THOUGHT KOSEN, ‘WHILE
THAT PUPIL IS OUT OF THE WAY.’ WHEN THE PUPIL RETURNED HE TOOK A GOOD
LOOK AT THIS LATEST EFFORT, AND SAID: A MASTERPIECE!</p><p><br></p><p>If you can put yourself out of the way, your whole being will say –
masterpiece! You become the masterpiece. There are two types of creators
in the world: one type of creator works with objects – a poet, a
painter, they work with objects, they create things; the other type of
creator, the mystic, creates himself. He doesn’t work with objects, he
works with the subject; he works on himself, his own being. And he is
the real creator, the real poet because he makes himself into a
masterpiece.</p><p><br></p><p>You are carrying a masterpiece hidden within you, but you are
standing in the way. Just move aside, then the masterpiece will be
revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone is a masterpiece because God never gives birth to anything
less than that. Everyone carries that masterpiece hidden for many lives,
not knowing who they are, and just trying on the surface to become
someone. Drop the idea of becoming someone because you already are a
masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to
know it, to realize it. God has Himself created you, you cannot be
improved.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, I’m not teaching you to improve your life – no, not me. I am
simply teaching you to know the life that is already there, that has
already always been there, that is already the case.</p><p><br></p><p>Just put yourself aside, so your eyes are not filled with the ego,
your being is not cloudy, and the sky becomes open. Suddenly, not only
you, but the whole Existence says: A masterpiece! This is ‘the first
principle’.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

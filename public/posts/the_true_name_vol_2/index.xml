‌CHAPTER 1
Fear Is A Beggar
1 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium THERE IS NO END TO HIS VIRTUES, NOR TO THEIR NARRATION.
THERE IS NO END TO HIS WORKS AND HIS BOUNTY,
AND ENDLESS WHAT HE SEES AND HEARS.
THERE IS NO KNOWING THE SECRETS OF HIS MIND; THERE IS NO BEGINNING OR END TO IT.
SO MANY STRUGGLE TO KNOW HIS DEPTH, BUT NONE HAS EVER ACHIEVED IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Patience is the Goldsmith
10 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
SELF-RESTRAINT IS THE FURNACE; PATIENCE IS THE GOLDSMITH; INTELLECT IS THE ANVIL; KNOWLEDGE IS THE HAMMER;
FEAR IS THE BELLOWS; AUSTERITY IS THE FIRE;
FEELING IS THE CRUCIBLE INTO WHICH THE NECTAR FALLS. THE COINAGE OF THE WORD IS CAST IN THE MINT OF TRUTH. ONLY THOSE RECEIVING HIS GRACE CAN SUCCEED IN IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Steeped in the Wine of Love
2 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
PRICELESS ARE HIS QUALITIES, AND HIS TRADING, TOO; PRICELESS ARE HIS SALESMEN, AND HIS STOREHOUSES; PRICELESS IS HE WHO COMES TO TAKE, AND WHAT HE TAKES; PRICELESS HIS FEELINGS, AND HIS SAMADHI, TOO; PRICELESS HIS DIVINE JUSTICE, AND HIS COURTS;
PRICELESS THE WEIGHTS AND BALANCE TO JUDGE MAN’S ACTIONS; PRICELESS HIS BOUNTY, AND THE SYMBOLS WHICH DISTINGUISH IT; PRICELESS HIS GRACE AND HIS ORDER, TOO;</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Birds Don’t Go To College
3 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
WHERE IS THAT DOOR? WHAT MANSION IS IT WHERE YOU SIT AND OVERLOOK YOUR CREATION?
INFINITE SOUNDS ARE RINGING, AND INFINITE ARE THE PLAYERS; INFINITE THE SINGERS, AND INFINITE THE MELODIES THEY SING. WATER, FIRE AND WIND SING YOUR GLORY,
AND THE GOD OF DEATH SINGS AT YOUR DOOR; CHITRAGUPTA, SHIVA, BRAHMA, DEVI – ALL SING YOUR GLORY; AND INDRA ON HIS THRONE AND ALL THE DEITIES,</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Posture is a Template
4 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
OH YOGI, ASSUME THE POSTURE OF CONTENTMENT AND MODESTY. PICK UP THE CARRYING BAG OF DIGNITY AND HONOR,
AND APPLY THE SACRED ASH OF MEDITATION.
ESTABLISH DEATH AS YOUR BEDROLL; MAKE A MAIDEN OF YOUR BODY. LET EXPERIENCE BE YOUR STAFF OF LIBERATION,
AND CONSIDER THE UNITY OF ALL AS YOUR FIRST PRINCIPLE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
One Becomes Three
5 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
BY SKILLFUL MEANS ONE MAYA HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO THREE DISCIPLES: BRAHMA, THE CREATOR; VISHNU, THE SUSTAINER; AND SHIVA, THE DESTROYER. GOD DIRECTS THEM BY HIS WILL AND HIS ORDER.
HE WATCHES THEM BUT THEY CANNOT SEE HIM; THAT IS THE WONDER OF WONDERS.
IF YOU MUST BOW, BOW TO HIM.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Your Boat is Useless on Land
6 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
IF MY SINGLE TONGUE BECOMES A HUNDRED THOUSAND,
AND THIS HUNDRED THOUSAND BECOMES TWENTY TIMES MORE, WITH EACH TONGUE WOULD I SING A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES THE ONLY NAME OF THE MASTER OF THE WORLD.
THESE ARE THE STEPS OF THE NAME OF THE LORD.
BY FOLLOWING THEM DOES ONE BECOME TWENTY-ONE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Mines of Meditation
7 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
HAVING MADE NIGHT AND DAY, THE SEASONS, AND THE DATES; AND AIR, WATER, FIRE AND THE UNDERWORLDS;
HAVING MADE ALL OF THIS, HE ESTABLISHED THE EARTH AS A DHARMASHALA. IN IT HE CREATED COUNTLESS CREATURES OF MANY COLORS AND FORMS. THEIR NAMES ARE INFINITE.
EACH IS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DEEDS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
There Is No End To It
8 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
THE SUPREME LAW EXPRESSES THE REALM OF RELIGION.
NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITIONS OF THE REALM OF KNOWLEDGE: SO MANY WINDS, WATERS, AND FIRES; SO MANY KRISHNAS AND SHIVAS;
SO MANY BRAHMAS, SO MANY OF HIS CREATIONS OF SO MANY COLORS AND FORMS;
SO MANY FIELDS OF ACTION AND SACRED MOUNTAINS; SO MANY POLAR STARS AND SO MANY SERMONS;</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
He Exults In His Creation
9 December 1974 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
POWER IS THE EXPRESSION IN THE REALM OF GRACE; EXCEPT THIS, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.
IN IT ARE THE GREAT WARRIORS AND HEROES; THERE RAMA ABIDES IN HIS FULLNESS.
AND IN ITS GLORY ALSO SEETA ABIDES, WHOSE FORM IS BEYOND WORDS. THOSE IN WHOSE HEART RAMA ABIDES NEVER DIE NOR CAN BE CHEATED.</description>

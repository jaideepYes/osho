Religion is falling in tune with the whole, falling in love with the whole, falling in a togetherness with the whole. A religious person is one who is not against the whole and the irreligious is one who is fighting the whole, is in conflict with the whole. The religious person is life-affirmative. The irreligious person is life-negative.\nTo the religious person all is good -- his affirmation is absolute and total. Nothing is wrong; even if it appears at times that it is wrong, it cannot be wrong. It must be a misunderstanding, a misinterpretation. It must be based somewhere in our ignorance because we don't know the whole story. So maybe some part looks as if not fitting with the whole. We have not heard the whole song, so some note appears to fall out of line.\nBut everything has to be good if there is God. God is the guarantee of goodness. Evil, as such, cannot exist. If it appears, it must be a nightmare of our own minds; we must have created it.\nThe religious mind denies not. His affirmation is absolute, unconditional. He says yes to existence. And his yes has no conditions -- remember it; when he says yes he means it. If you find a person who says no to existence, to life, to this and that, then remember, he is just an egoist -- not religious at all. He is fighting the whole, trying to prove himself a conqueror, trying to prove that he is something special. He is doomed to fail. His frustration is sooner or later going to be;it cannot be avoided for long, it is predestined. It is predestined by his own attitude of conflict. Religion is cooperation -- cooperation with all that is.\nTry to understand it as deeply as possible because only then will you be able to understand this mystic singer Kabir. He is a lover of life. He does not deny, he does not negate, he does not condemn, he never sees anything bad anywhere. Once you have had a vision of the whole, all becomes sublime. Then there is nothing secular;everything is sacred, and the whole existence is the temple of God, and the whole life is a prayer.\nWalking, you walk in God. Dancing, you dance in God. Sleeping, you sleep in God --\nbecause nothing else exists than him.\nGod is the guarantee of goodness. God means the good. The good is the substratum of existence, so evil is not possible. Evil is impossible. We must have misrepresented; we must have brought our own ideas, concepts, doctrines; we must have created our own stupid private notions of how things should be. Things simply ARE.There is no SHOULD in existence. The idea of should is brought by man -- and once you bring the idea of should, existence is divided into two: good and bad. Once you say `Things should be like this', you have moved away from reality, you have moved away from that which is. And only that which is, IS; nothing else. Reality is here as it is; don't bring the should, otherwise the condemnation comes.\nIn the West, Albert Schweitzer has created a very false notion about the East. He was a great thinker, but unfortunately not acquainted with the Eastern mind at all. And he was too Western. He has created a notion that East and Eastern religions are life-denying, life-negative. It is utter nonsense. And you will see, when we enter into Kabir you will see: more life-affirmation is not possible, more love for live is not possible. Even Jesus is not so life-affirmative as Kabir. Where else can you find a temple like Khajuraho, more life-affirmative? Where\ncan you find an occult science like Tantra, more life-affirming?\nWhere can you find such absolute YES? Life is God -- and there is no other god; and worship of life is worship -- and there is no other worship.\nBut Schweitzer got his ideas because the Christian missionaries have been interpreting the Eastern religion in such a way that it looks life-negative. Of course there have been a few thinkers in the East who ARE life-negative, but they are very few, and the main current of Eastern religiousness does not consist only of them. In fact they are by the side of the road; they are not the main flow of Eastern consciousness. But Christian missionaries emphasized those life- negative thinkers, and, emphasized their life-negativities more and more, to create an atmosphere in the West as if Christianity is life-affirmative. The truth is just the reverse: Christianity is not life-affirmative. It has not loved man, it has not loved this world, it has not danced, it has not laughed.\nGo to a Christian church and you feel as if you have entered a cemetery -- dead, very serious, corpse-like. You enter a church and you start feeling that you are also becoming serious. The very vibe is not of laughter, no. Christians say Jesus never laughed. I don't believe it -- I cannot believe it, because I know Jesus better.\nBut Christians say Jesus never laughed If I write the gospels, I would write that Jesus laughed his whole life. In fact, when he was crucified he had a belly laughter. He laughed tremendously, uproariously -- because this was just ridiculous. To try to kill that which cannot be killed, to try to kill Jesus -- the very idea is ridiculous, he must have laughed. I can still hear his laughter But\nChristians have not heard his laughter; they have based their religion more on the cross than on Christ.\nChristianity would have been benefitted tremendously if the cross had been forgotten --\nbecause with the cross, death comes in. I call Christianity `crossianity'. It is a religion of death, of the cross -- serious, sad. If Christianity had paid more attention to Jesus, then a totally different world view would have arisen. More emphasis should have been given to the resurrected Christ -- not to the crucified. Then Christianity would have been more life-affirmative, even death could not kill, even the cross could not destroy -- Jesus is resurrected. Then Christianity\ncould have danced, then there would have been singing and celebration, and churches would have been more human, But that didn't happen; the whole of Christianity became attached too much to the cross.\nIn fact, we are all too much attached to death. Death leaves a greater impression in us. If somebody is alive we don't bother to be happy with him, but if he dies we cry. We had never thought about it before, that that man was alive just a day before and we could have danced together and we could have celebrated a few moments and we could have allowed benediction to enter -- we never thought about it. Now he is dead, now we cry. We don't seem to be interested too much in life, we seem to be interested too much in death.\nI have heard...\nA great enemy of Voltaire died. They were lifelong enemies, critisising each other.\nSomebody rushed to Voltaire to release the news and said, `Your great enemy is dead.'\nShocked, Voltaire said, Ì will miss him tremendously.' He started crying and he said, 'He was a great man and it will be difficult to find a greater man than him. His intelligence was tremendously sharp and his whole life was a beautiful life.'\nThe man who had come to release the news could not believe these words, that Voltaire would say these words -- he was expecting that he would be happy. Seeing him shocked, Voltaire said, 'All these things are true, provided he is really dead. Provided he is really dead -- if he is still alive, then forget all this.'\nWhen a person is dead he becomes good. We declare people good only when they are dead. Alive, they are not good; alive, they are not worth friendship; alive we fight. Dead\n,we praise them to high pinacles. I have heard...\nA miserly man died. The widow went to the priest and asked him, `How much will it cost? -- you have to deliver a speech.'\nHe said,` There are speeches and speeches. The best will cost two hundred dollars.'\n`Two hundred dollars?' the woman said. `My husband would not have allowed that much of a luxury. Isn't there a cheaper speech/'\nThem man said, `There are hundred-dollars -- but then I will not be able to praise him much.'\nThe woman said, `Still come a little lower.'\nAnd the priest said, `Fifty dollars is still too much.'\nThen he said, Òkay, ten dollars -- but remember, then I will have to tell the truth.'\nWhen a person dies, we start telling lies... beautiful lies. In India everybody dies and goes to heaven -- even politicians. Nobody seems to go to hell; hell must be absolutely empty.\nDeath seems to be very important to us. We are death-obsessed. That's why Christians made too much fuss about the cross -- that became a symbol. A religion that is centered on the concept of the cross and death and crucifixion cannot be a religion of life-affirmation. Schweitzer is wrong. He should have read Kabir -- his whole being would have been benefitted tremendously.\nKabir is REALLY the religious person. His declaration about life is of tremendous trust.\nHe does not say to you to renounce anything. He says rather, `Bring everything to God and bring God to everything.' You will be surprised by his assertions: these assertions are tremendously revolutionary.\nA few things more ,before we enter the songs.\nReligion is not traditional -- cannot be by its very nature. Tradition is that which is dead.\nTradition is that which has passed away, tradition is just the dust of the past, tradition is just the memory. Religion is always alive, breathing. Religion can never be traditional.\nWhenever religion becomes traditional, it serves the Devil more than God. Then it serves death more than life. Then it serves politicians, priests, organizations, churches, but it doesn't serve the spirit of man. Then it is no more an opening towards the future.\nTradition looks back; we have to go forward. Looking backward is meaningless; not only meaningless, but harmful too, dangerous -- because we cannot go backwards, we have to go forwards, and looking backwards and moving forwards is bound to create trouble.\nThe second thing: religion is not in the scriptures, cannot be. Scriptures are dead letters.\nYes, there was religion some day, throbbing in those words when they were being uttered by an alive Master. When Krishna told Srimat Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, it was alive. It was alive because of Krishna, it was illuminated because of Krishna -- when Krishna disappeared, the Bhagavad Gita became a corpse. Dead words: you can go on analyzing those words, interpreting this way and that... There are one thousand commentaries on the Gita -- famous ones; there are many more. In fact, whenever anybody reads the Gita, he has his own meaning of it. Krishna's meaning is lost; it disappeared with Krishna himself.\nThe snake has passed... only the track on the sand is left. That track you go on worshipping as a scripture.\nWhen Jesus walked on earth and talked to his disciples, it was a throbbing truth, throbbing with life -- alive, vibrating, pulsating. The word was not dead; the word was God, the word was truth itself. The word had a heart in it. The word was suffused with love, experience, existence, being. When Jesus has gone, life is gone. Then you can collect words and you can make as many gospels as you want. Those gospels are going to be of no help.\nReal religion is never in the scriptures. And a real religious seeker does not go in search of scriptures, he goes in search of a Master -- a living Master. That is one of the basic tenets of Kabir's understanding: SATGURU -- the living Master. Go and search for a living Master! If you can come in contact with a living Master then dead scriptures will become alive again. They become alive only VIA the living Master -- there is no other way, because the living Master is the only scripture. When the living Master touches the Bhagavad Gita it will become\nalive; when he touches the gospel, the gospel will become alive. When he recites the Koran, the Koran will again become alive. He will give his own life to these words, they will start throbbing. But directly you cannot find religion in the scriptures.\nSo religion is not in the tradition and religion is not in the scriptures and religion is not in the rituals. Rituals are formalities. Unless you are in communion with a living Master, rituals are a dead weight. They will burden you, they will dry you, they will kill you, and you will be lost in infinite formalities. With a living Master, a new ritual is born. It comes out of the contact; it has a context to it, a living reference to it. It is not learned by dead tradition being transferred from one generation to another. You live it -- and through living it, you learn it.\nWhen you come to a living Master, deep down something in you wants to bow down. It is not that you are going to do a certain formality -- if you are doing, it is meaningless.\nBut something really down in your spirit, deep in your spirit, deep in your center, wants to bow down. Then bowing to a Master is no more ritualistic. It is alive, it is meaningful, it is not an empty gesture. But you can just go on bowing down to anybody, because you have been taught to bow down -- then it is useless. Try to see the difference. When something is born into you out of your spontaneity, then it is true. When you have to do something as a duty, it is untrue. `Duty' is a dirty word. If something is born out of love, good. If something is born out of duty, avoid it, never do it -- because that is dangerous.\nIf you learn the ways of duty too much, you will forget the ways of love. Duty is against love. Duty is a false substitute for love.\nReligion is not in the rituals. Of course, whenever there is religion there is ritual\n-- but that is a totally different matter. How can you avoid when Buddha walks amongst you, how can you avoid touching his feet? Impossible. You can do only two things and both are rituals: either you have to touch his feet, or you have to throw stones at him. Both are rituals -- one is that of the enemy and one is that of the friend, but both are rituals. You cannot neglect Buddha, you cannot be indifferent, that's all. The phenomenon is such that you cannot just bypass. Either you have to become a friend or you have to become an enemy; you have to choose. You have to have an attitude -- that attitude is ritual. But then it is born into your heart, not learned from somebody else. It simply arises in your\nbeing.\nReligion, wherever it is, always brings rituals; but when the religion disappears, the rituals become dead. Don't carry the corpse. Yes, you loved your mother very much and now she is dead -- what are you going to do? Are you going to carry her corpse for your whole life? You have to burn it or bury it. You have to get rid of it, you cannot go on carrying it. But this same thing happens as far as religion is concerned. You loved the Buddha so much, and great passion arose in your soul, and great worship and great songs were born in his presence... now he is gone, you continue the song. By and by, it is a far away echo of the echo... goes on fading.\nWhen the pope speaks in the Vatican, it is not Jesus' voice at all -- cannot be. When Jesus speaks, he speaks on his own authority. When the pope speaks, he speaks on the authority of Jesus. A real Master speaks on his own authority, he is his sole authority.\nReligion is not in the tradition, not in the rituals, and NOT in the so-called religions --\nHindu, Christian, Mohammedan. Religion has no adjective to it. Religion is simply religion, as love is love. Do you call love Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan? If love is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan, then why should God be Christian, Hindu and Mohammedan? Has not Jesus said\n`God is Love'? Religion is not in the religions; religion is pure of all adjectives, pure of all definitions, and each one has to seek it.\nNobody can be born into a religion, religion has to be born into you. You have to open your soul and receive religion. It is showering all around... but you are carrying toys, substitutes, false coins, in your hands, and thinking you are having religion. In the church it is not, in the mosque it is not, in the temple it is not. Go somewhere where a living Master is: it is there. And that too exists only for a few moments -- the Master is gone, and the religion disappears.\nHence Kabir's insistence for a SATGURU -- for a true Master Religion is individual, one has to seek it on one's own. It is not a social phenomenon, it has nothing to do with the crowd and the collective. It is a private thing, as intimate as love. You come to it alone, in deep intimacy, privacy... you open your heart. Religion is spontaneous in the sense that you cannot learn it. You can be it, but\nyou cannot learn it. It is as spontaneous as love. Have you ever learnt what love is?And that day will be a doomsday, when man will have to learn how to love. That day seems to be coming closer every day, in the West particularly, and more particularly in America. Books are being written: How to Love, How to be Friendly -- foolish books, because if man has forgotten how to love, no book can teach it. To teach humanity how to love is as if somebody goes to the fish and teaches the fish to swim -- that will be foolish. And so is the case with religion. Religion cannot be taught, it can only be caught; it is a sort of infection. You can go wherever a holy person exists and you can catch it, you can imbibe it.\nReligion is a rebellion. It is a rebellion against death, it is rebellion against all that is dead; it is rebellion against the outside: it is rebellion against politics, greed, society, culture, civilization. Religion is a rebellion: it says we have to listen to the innermost core of our being and follow it wherever it leads. Wherever... unafraid of the consequences, we will listen to the small still voice within and follow it. Religion is a risk. Those people who are after security too much can never become religious; it is a dangerous thing. If you pass through it, you will be passing through a crucifixion... but only after the crucifixion is resurrection.\nNow listen to the sutras of Kabir.\nHE IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM OF THE FORMLESS TO THE VISION OF THESE EYES...\nNow if the real Master is the basic thing to search and seek for, then of course a definition is needed: Who is the real Master? Whom to call the real Master? How to know? Kabir says:\nHE IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM OF THE FORMLESS TO THE VISION OF THESE EYES\n... in whose presence the formless descends and becomes a presence... through whom you can have a look at the farthest star... through whom you can have a feeling of God himself... through whose words silence speaks, and through whose eyes the infinite peeks at you. And if you hold his hand, you will suddenly see: the hand is his, but not only his -\n- God is holding your hand through him. He is a vehicle, a bamboo flute on the lips of the infinite. He gives form to the formless, he is the embodiment of the formless.\nYou have to be very open and vulnerable, only then will you be able to feel a Master.\nDon't go to a Master with a negative attitude, otherwise you will never reach him. The very negative attitude will not allow his vibe to reach you. The negative attitude will not allow you to move into the same wavelength in which he lives. Hence trust is needed.\nHence, love is needed. Otherwise you will go empty and you will come empty -- and when you will come empty you will say,`This is not the real Master. I went empty and I have come empty.' If you are not open, you will come empty. Only if you are open is there a possibility to feel. And don't be afraid of open-ness. If you are open and the Master is not real, nothing will happen; and you will know it, and you will know it certainly, that this is not for you, that this is not the man you are seeking. But be open --\nbecause if you are open, only then can you know whether he is true or not. If you are closed, already closed, then there is no possibility. In fact, if you are closed, sooner or later you will become a victim of somebody who is a pseudo-Master -- because pseudo-Masters try to convince you argumentatively.\nThe real Masters are very paradoxical, very contradictory. They are as contradictory as life itself, because they embody life. They are as inconsistent as God himself, because they embody God. They are not logical, they are very illogical -- because they are superlogical, because they are bringing something which cannot be grasped through logic.\nIn the closeness of a real Master you will feel you are close to an abyss... but if you are open -- only then. If you are not open, you will become a victim to some pseudo-person who can convince you, who can talk you in, who can seduce you in. For example, if you are greedy he will talk about greed. He will tell you how much you are going to gain out of the meditation, the prayer. He will persuade your greed, how much you are going to have in heaven if you follow him. He will promise you much. A true Master never promises anything. In fact he shatters you completely -- your greed, your desire, your idea of becoming\nsomebody, being somebody -- he shatters all in all. A real Master is a rock against which your boat is completely shattered... your whole mind is shattered. He drives you crazy; he does not argue. His argument is more of his being than of his words.\nBut we are greedy. We live through greed, we are afraid, full of fear -- somebody gives us consolation, we become victims. A real Master is not a consolation, he is not a solace.\nHe is, in fact, death to you. He kills you, he destroys you, he is very destructive... but creativity is possible only when the old is destroyed. When the old ceases to be, the new can enter in.\nI have heard a beautiful anecdote. Meditate over it.…\nThe letter from Sean to his old, old mother was heartening. `Dear mother,' he wrote, Ì\nam sending you some pills that a witch doctor gave me and if you take one, it will take years of your life.'\nHe came home a few weeks later, and there was a beautiful young woman outside his house rocking a pram in which a baby lay sucking a bottle.\n`Where's my mother?' he asked.\nÀrrah, don't be silly,' she said. Ì'm your mother and these pills were marvellous.'\nÌmagine!' said Sean. Òne pill, and you're as beautiful as anyone could be -- and what's more, you were able to have a baby. Lord, but they were powerful!'\n`You madman!' she cried. `That's not a baby, that's your father. He took two;'\nAvoid greed -- otherwise you will take two pills. And there are many people who are selling things like that. Witch doctors.…\nA Master is not here to fulfill your greed, he is here to destroy your greed. Because once greed is destroyed, you become available to yourself. If you are greedy you are never available to yourself. Greed becomes desire, desire becomes a projection in the future.\nAnd you are always wandering somewhere in the future; you are never herenow. Greed takes you away from yourself: greed has to be destroyed.\nA Master never promises you anything -- but only in the presence of a Master something becomes possible. He will not tell you: Ì will take death away from you', or `You will become immortal'. He is not giving you nectar, elixir, ambrosia. Of course, being with a Master one becomes immortal -- but not that he MAKES you immortal. He simply takes you deep into the existence of death.\nJust look at it: he takes you deep into the experience of death. That is what deep meditation is all about -- a death *experience. And when you have known your death, watched it, suddenly you realize you are separate from it. It happens, but it never happens to you. It happens on the periphery, it never reaches to the center. It happens to the body, it never happens to you. And the body is nothing but your abode. You have changed many bodies, and you will change many more -- but you are immortal. But a real Master does not promise it. He delivers it one day, but there is no promise for it. If you are seeking one state where fear will dissolve, some state where your greed will be fulfilled, some state where you will be titilated constantly with pleasure, paradise, then you are bound to become a victim of some pseudo-person.\nSATGURU means the real Master. A SATGURU means the pseudo-Master. HE IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM\nOF THE FORMLESS TO THE VISION OF THESE EYES: WHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE WAY OF ATTAINING HIM.…\nTHE SIMPLE WAY -- not complex methods, not yoga postures, not very complicated rituals. He teaches simple ways, very simple, that anybody who wants to do it can do it right now. His ways are so simple and spontaneous that you will be surprised why you did not discover them yourself. They are so simple! Once the Master has taught you, once you have known the beauty of them, once you have tasted a little, you will be simply surprised why you could not discover them -- they are so simple.\nThe real Master is not technical, he is simple -- because there is no technique to achieve God. God is not somewhere at the end of a technique, no. God is already available to you.\nYou are in God;you just have to shake yourself a little so that you can become a little more alert. Just a little more alertness, that's all.\nSometimes you do become alert, but you become alert also in a very unconscious way.\nYou are driving a car and suddenly you see that a bus is coming and the driver seems to be drunk or mad and you see no possibility of avoiding the accident. The accident is going to be; it becomes almost a certainty. In that moment you become alert, very alert, but that alertness is unconscious. You are alert, but you are not alert that you are alert.\nIn some dangerous situation you become alert, but that alertness is unconscious. A Master simply teaches you how to be alert with full consciousness. He teaches you conscious awareness. Now you may be a little puzzled, because... conscious awareness?\nYou think consciousness means awareness, awareness means consciousness. No. There are moments when you are aware but not conscious. If somebody comes suddenly with a pistol in his hand and forces the pistol on your chest, you will be aware but not conscious. Thinking will stop. The shock is so sudden, so unexpectedly sudden, and cannot figure out what is going to happen, and death is so close... in that shock, your mind stops. Your constantly spinning mind spins no more. Your constantly chattering mind is simply shocked into silence: you become aware. But this awareness is unconscious.\nThe Master teaches only one thing: how to be consciously aware. And that's a very simple thing. You can start doing it any moment; you can apply awareness, consciousness, to any activity that you go on doing.If you are walking on the road, just walk consciously. Take each step in deep alertness. Listening to me, right now, listen attentively. You are listening attentively but that attention may be unconscious. Become conscious of the attentiveness, and suddenly you will see a tremendous blessing descends in you. Out of nowhere, suddenly it is there. Just a moment of conscious alertness and your doors open and God enters in -- as if he was just waiting there at the door, knocking and knocking and knocking. But you are so much preoccupied.…\nKabir says:\nWHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE WAY OF ATTAINING HIM.…\nPeople who teach complex ways simply show that they have not known God -- because God needs no expertise. And people who teach complex ways have a reason to teach complex ways :so that they always can say to you Ìf you are not doing the thing rightly, how can you hope to attain?'\nHave you heard a beautiful story of Khalil Gibran?..\nA man used to move from town to town. He was a great teacher and he used to say to people, `Come and follow me, and I will show you the way to God.' But people were engaged. They had so many thousands of things to do and they would say, `We worship you, we respect you, and one day we are coming to follow you -- but right now it is difficult.'\nNobody is ready now -- that's why so many pseudo-Masters can exist. Saint Augustine, in his confessions says: Ì used to pray to God when I was young, \"God save me, but not right now. Save me but not right now\" -- because I was indulging in so many things,' he says, ànd I wanted to enjoy all that is available. So this was not to be heard immediately.\nI was saying the prayer because it has to be said formally, but I would always say, \"Save me Lord, but not right now.\"'\nSo this preacher went from town to town, and people would say, `Not right now. We will come one day.' And he was very happy because nobody ever followed him and there was no trouble. A madman one day said, Òkay, I am coming.' He became a little afraid, but he said -- he was a very clever and cunning man -- he said, `Come.' And he would give him such complex procedures as are almost impossible to do. But the man was really mad. He would do them, and even this teacher could not find any fault. And the man continued. The teacher was thinking he would get fed-up sooner or later.\nOne year passed, two years passed, and he would say, `When?' The disciple was too much! -- and he would ask again and again,`Now, what else to do?' And he was doing everything! Even the Master became afraid -- now he could not think what else to say for him to do, and he was doing EVERYTHING.\nSix years passed, and one day the disciple said, `How long is it still? I am ready to do anything but you are not giving me anything.' He said, `Listen: the truth is, in your company I have lost my own way. I used to know where he is, but since you have come You just have mercy on me and leave me.'\nComplex procedures have been invented by cunning people. First nobody is ready to do them; good -- the pseudo-Master can exist, because his techniques will never be put to any experimentation. Second if somebody tries to do it, they are so complex that it can always be said that you are not doing them rightly.They are so complex that you cannot trust yourself and you are always afraid that something may go wrong. But a real Master will give you very simple techniques -- anybody of average intelligence, of average health, can do them.\nWHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE WAY OF ATTAINING HIM, THAT IS OTHER THAN RITES OR CEREMONIES...\nHe never teaches you rituals, rites and ceremonies. He may teach you celebration\n-- but never ceremonies. Celebration is of the heart, and ceremony is just a ritual of the mind.\nWHO DOES NOT MAKE YOU CLOSE THE DOORS, AND HOLD THE BREATH, AND RENOUNCE THE WORLD...\nThe real Master is all for the world, because this world is a manifestation of God. This world is full of God. Every rock is so crowded with God, and every tree and every bird and all that exists is so full, overflowing with God... where to go? and for what? Whom to renounce? and for what? And how can one renounce? -- because wherever you are in God, and wherever you are you are in this world... because there is no other world.\nHE DOES NOT MAKE YOU CLOSE YOUR DOORS, AND HOLD YOUR BREATH, AND RENOUNCE THE WORLD:\nWHO MAKES YOU PERCEIVE THE SUPREME SPIRIT WHENEVER THE MIND\nATTACHES ITSELF...\nJust look at the beauty if this sutra. Kabir says:\nWHO MAKES YOU PERCEIVE THE SUPREME SPIRIT WHENEVER THE MIND\nATTACHES ITSELF...\nHe says: Don't be worried. Whenever you mind feels attachment, don't be afraid of the attachment: go deep into it and try to find God there... and you will find him there. You love a woman-no need to escape from her: look deep into her eyes... and you will find God there. God is welling up everywhere. You love your child-don't renounce the world and don't throw the child to this hungry, violent, ugly world, don't abandon the child to the wolves: look into the eyes of the child. Put ears to his heart and listen deeply... and you will find God there.\nKabir says: Unconditionally, whenever the mind attaches itself, perceive the supreme self.\nI have heard about a man who came to Kabir and he wanted to know god, and Kabir asked him, \"Don't you love somebody?\"\nHe said, `Sorry, I don't love anybody.'\nKabir said, Ànybody will do, but you love-because unless you love, there is no bridge.'\nThe man was a little shy but then he confessed, `Yes, I love. I love my cow.' A poor man, and he had one cow and nothing else.\nKabir said, `Perfectly good. That will do.'\nThe man asked, `Then what have I to do now?'\nHe said, `Now you start thinking that the cow is divine. Now she is no more a cow; she is a god, a goddess. You serve her, you love her, you pat her, you give her a bath, you do everything-but now she is a goddess. God is hidden there. And come after three months.'\nAfter three months the man was totally different, radiant with new energy. The disciple of Kabir were a little puzzled -- Ìs he just joking with this man?' But when the man came, they were surprised. he had almost become a new man, a new being; and he fell at Kabir's feet and said, `Tremendous it is! I have found my God. And the day I found him in my cow, I found him everywhere.'\nWhenever your love falls, no need to escape and renounce. Let your love become your prayer.\nWHO TEACHES YOU TO BE STILL IN THE MIDST OF ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES.\nEVER IMMERSED IN BLISS, HAVING NO FEAR IN HIS MIND, HE KEEPS THE\nSPIRIT OF UNION IN THE MIDST OF ALL ENJOYMENTS.\nAnd Kabir says: Don't escape from enjoyments. Remember, they are his gifts. And don't escape from the worldly activities; remain passive. Move in the crowd and remain alone.\nThe real thing is to be alone-not to be lonely. And one can be alone in the crowd, and you can be in a crowd when sitting in a Himalayan cave-it all depends on your mind. So the change has to be inner, not outer.\nTHE INFINITE DWELLING OF THE INFINITE BEING IS EVERYWHERE: IN EARTH, WATER, SKY, AND AIR:\nFIRM AS THE THUNDERBOLT, THE SEAT OF THE SEEKER IS ESTABLISHED\nABOVE THE VOID.\nHE WHO IS WITHIN IS WITHOUT: I SEE HIM AND NONE ELSE.\nYou just become empty of your self. Empty yourself, become void... and you will become the seat, you will become the abode, you will become the temple.\nO BROTHER: WHEN I WAS FORGETFUL, MY TRUE GURU SHOWED ME THE WAY.\nTHEN I LEFT ALL RITES AND CEREMONIES...\nWhen you have found the guru, what is the use of rites and ceremonies? When you have found a living Master, then what is the use of scriptures and traditions?\n`When I left my Master...\nI LEFT ALL RITES AND CEREMONIES,\nI BATHED NO MORE IN THE HOLY WATER;\nTHEN I LEARNED THAT IT WAS I ALONE WHO WAS MAD, AND THE WHOLE\nWORLD BESIDE ME WAS SANE; AND I HAD DISTURBED THESE WISE PEOPLE.\nThis must be you experience too, of all sannyasins. People will think you mad.\nAnd Kabir says: Since I have left foolish things -- I don't go to take a bath in the holy ganges and don't go to the temple and I don't do any ritual-people Think I have gone mad.\nWhenever you will come in close contact with a Master, the world will think you have gone mad. They are all sane, wise people. Their wisdom never leads them anywhere, their sanity never gives them a single glimpse of bliss; their sanity is nothing but their misery, and their wisdom is nothing but all stupidity-but still they think they are sane and they are wise, they should be blissful. If they are really sane, they would show intelligence, creativity. But they don't show anything.\nBut people who come in close contact with a Master and are illuminated by his being will look mad. Always it has been so, and always it will be so. So of people think you are mad, don't be worried-they were thinking that even about Kabir.\nTHEN I LEARNED THAT IT WAS I ALONE WHO WAS MAD, AND THE WHOLE WORLD BESIDE ME WAS SANE;\nAND I HAD DISTURBED THESE WISE PEOPLE.\nFROM THAT TIME FORTH I KNEW NO MORE HOW TO ROLL IN THE DUST IN\nOBEISANCE:\nI DO NOT RING THE TEMPLE BELL;\nI DO NOT SET THE IDOL ON ITS THRONE:\nI DO NOT WORSHIP THE IMAGE WITH FLOWERS.\nIT IS NOT THE AUSTERITIES THAT MORTIFY THE FLESH WHICH ARE PLEASING TO THE LORD.\nAnd Kabir declares: If you mortify yourself you are a perverted being, and God is not happy with you. If you torture yourself you are a masochist, and God is not happy with you. God is happy when you are happy, God is happy in you happiness... because he is hiding in you deepest core. When you torture yourself you torture God-how can he be happy? When you become a masochist and people start worshipping you like a MAHATMA, you are a masochist, a perverted being, insane-and torturing the God within yourself.\nHelpless is he, helpless like a small child. You an torture him easily. IT IS NOT THE AUSTERITIES THAT MORTIFY THE FLESH WHICH ARE PLEASING TO THE LORD.\nWHEN YOU LEAVE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND KILL YOUR SENSES YOU DO\nNOT PLEASE THE LORD...\nListen to these rebellious maxims. It is not that when you destroy your senses God is pleased; rather, he is pleased when your sensitivity goes to a peak. When you can see more beauty in the world, When you can hear more music in the world, when you can love more deeply, when you can be more alive, he is happy.\nWHEN YOU LEAVE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND KILL YOUR SENSES, YOU DO NOT PLEASE THE LORD: THE MAN WHO IS KIND AND WHO PRACTISES RIGHTEOUSNESS,WHO REMAINS PASSIVE AMIDST THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD, WHO CONSIDERS\nALL CREATURES ON EARTH AS HIS OWN SELF. HE ATTAINS THE IMMORTAL BEING, THE TRUE GOD IS EVER WITH HIM. KABIR SAYS:\n`HE ATTAINS THE TRUE NAME WHOSE WORDS ARE PURE, AND WHO IS FREE FROM PRIDE AND CONCEIT.'\nOne who is kind to himself and others, only one who loves himself and others.… You have been taught: `Never love yourself.' You have been taught: `Never be kind to yourself.' You have been taught to never forgive yourself. You have been taught much self-torture: you are praised in the same proportion as you torture yourself. If you want to become a MAHATMA you have to be a masochist-there is no other way. I f you are happy, joyous, delighted in your being, nobody is going to worship you.Who worships a happy man? Have you seen any happy man being worshiped? People worship sad longface, dead, dull, stupid people who can torture themselves. Their only art is that they can torture themselves; they are cruel to themselves, they are violent.\nKabir says: Be kind, and let kindness flow through you. Love yourself, and only then can you love others too. In deep love, in deep sensitivity, God is pleased.\nThe whole point is that you have to become a spiritual hedonist. That's my whole teaching too: become a spiritual hedonist. There are spiritual people but they are hedonists, and there are hedonist who are not spiritual. The West is hedonist but not spiritual; materialist. The East is spiritual but not hedonist-and both have missed. A higher synthesis is needed: hedonim and spiritualism. When they meet, the total man is born. And that total man is the enlightened man, that total man is the holy man.\nThe Divine Melody Chapter #2\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7492","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_divine_melody/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_divine_melody/>The Divine Melody</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: God is dwelling everywhere</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7492 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Divine_Melody/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IS FREE FROM PRIDE AND CONCEIT.'</p><p>What is religion? Religion is falling in tune with the whole, falling
in love with the whole, falling in a togetherness with the whole. A
religious person is one who is not against the whole and the irreligious
is one who is fighting the whole, is in conflict with the whole. The
religious person is life-affirmative. The irreligious person is
life-negative.</p><p>To the religious person all is good -- his affirmation is absolute
and total. Nothing is wrong; even if it appears at times that it is
wrong, it cannot be wrong. It must be a misunderstanding, a
misinterpretation. It must be based somewhere in our ignorance because
we don't know the whole story. So maybe some part looks as if not
fitting with the whole. We have not heard the whole song, so some note
appears to fall out of line.</p><p>But everything has to be good if there is God. God is the guarantee
of goodness. Evil, as such, cannot exist. If it appears, it must be a
nightmare of our own minds; we must have created it.</p><p>The religious mind denies not. His affirmation is absolute,
unconditional. He says yes to existence. And his yes has no conditions
-- remember it; when he says yes he means it. If you find a person who
says no to existence, to life, to this and that, then remember, he is
just an egoist -- not religious at all. He is fighting the whole, trying
to prove himself a conqueror, trying to prove that he is something
special. He is doomed to fail. His frustration is sooner or later going
to be;it cannot be avoided for long, it is predestined. It is
predestined by his own attitude of conflict. Religion is cooperation --
cooperation with all that is.</p><p>Try to understand it as deeply as possible because only then will you
be able to understand this mystic singer Kabir. He is a lover of life.
He does not deny, he does not negate, he does not condemn, he never sees
anything bad anywhere. Once you have had a vision of the whole, all
becomes sublime. Then there is nothing secular;everything is sacred, and
the whole existence is the temple of God, and the whole life is a
prayer.</p><p>Walking, you walk in God. Dancing, you dance in God. Sleeping, you
sleep in God --</p><p>because nothing else exists than him.</p><p>God is the guarantee of goodness. God means the good. The good is the
substratum of existence, so evil is not possible. Evil is impossible. We
must have misrepresented; we must have brought our own ideas, concepts,
doctrines; we must have created our own stupid private notions of how
things should be. Things simply ARE.There is no SHOULD in existence. The
idea of should is brought by man -- and once you bring the idea of
should, existence is divided into two: good and bad. Once you say
`Things should be like this', you have moved away from reality, you have
moved away from that which is. And only that which is, IS; nothing else.
Reality is here as it is; don't bring the should, otherwise the
condemnation comes.</p><p>In the West, Albert Schweitzer has created a very false notion about
the East. He was a great thinker, but unfortunately not acquainted with
the Eastern mind at all. And he was too Western. He has created a notion
that East and Eastern religions are life-denying, life-negative. It is
utter nonsense. And you will see, when we enter into Kabir you will see:
more life-affirmation is not possible, more love for live is not
possible. Even Jesus is not so life-affirmative as Kabir. Where else can
you find a temple like Khajuraho, more life-affirmative? Where</p><p>can you find an occult science like Tantra, more life-affirming?</p><p>Where can you find such absolute YES? Life is God -- and there is no
other god; and worship of life is worship -- and there is no other
worship.</p><p>But Schweitzer got his ideas because the Christian missionaries have
been interpreting the Eastern religion in such a way that it looks
life-negative. Of course there have been a few thinkers in the East who
ARE life-negative, but they are very few, and the main current of
Eastern religiousness does not consist only of them. In fact they are by
the side of the road; they are not the main flow of Eastern
consciousness. But Christian missionaries emphasized those life-
negative thinkers, and, emphasized their life-negativities more and
more, to create an atmosphere in the West as if Christianity is
life-affirmative. The truth is just the reverse: Christianity is not
life-affirmative. It has not loved man, it has not loved this world, it
has not danced, it has not laughed.</p><p>Go to a Christian church and you feel as if you have entered a
cemetery -- dead, very serious, corpse-like. You enter a church and you
start feeling that you are also becoming serious. The very vibe is not
of laughter, no. Christians say Jesus never laughed. I don't believe it
-- I cannot believe it, because I know Jesus better.</p><p>But Christians say Jesus never laughed If I write the gospels, I
would write that Jesus laughed his whole life. In fact, when he was
crucified he had a belly laughter. He laughed tremendously, uproariously
-- because this was just ridiculous. To try to kill that which cannot be
killed, to try to kill Jesus -- the very idea is ridiculous, he must
have laughed. I can still hear his laughter But</p><p>Christians have not heard his laughter; they have based their
religion more on the cross than on Christ.</p><p>Christianity would have been benefitted tremendously if the cross had
been forgotten --</p><p>because with the cross, death comes in. I call Christianity
`crossianity'. It is a religion of death, of the cross -- serious, sad.
If Christianity had paid more attention to Jesus, then a totally
different world view would have arisen. More emphasis should have been
given to the resurrected Christ -- not to the crucified. Then
Christianity would have been more life-affirmative, even death could not
kill, even the cross could not destroy -- Jesus is resurrected. Then
Christianity</p><p>could have danced, then there would have been singing and
celebration, and churches would have been more human, But that didn't
happen; the whole of Christianity became attached too much to the
cross.</p><p>In fact, we are all too much attached to death. Death leaves a
greater impression in us. If somebody is alive we don't bother to be
happy with him, but if he dies we cry. We had never thought about it
before, that that man was alive just a day before and we could have
danced together and we could have celebrated a few moments and we could
have allowed benediction to enter -- we never thought about it. Now he
is dead, now we cry. We don't seem to be interested too much in life, we
seem to be interested too much in death.</p><p>I have heard...</p><p>A great enemy of Voltaire died. They were lifelong enemies,
critisising each other.</p><p>Somebody rushed to Voltaire to release the news and said, `Your great
enemy is dead.'</p><p>Shocked, Voltaire said, Ì will miss him tremendously.' He started
crying and he said, 'He was a great man and it will be difficult to find
a greater man than him. His intelligence was tremendously sharp and his
whole life was a beautiful life.'</p><p>The man who had come to release the news could not believe these
words, that Voltaire would say these words -- he was expecting that he
would be happy. Seeing him shocked, Voltaire said, 'All these things are
true, provided he is really dead. Provided he is really dead -- if he is
still alive, then forget all this.'</p><p>When a person is dead he becomes good. We declare people good only
when they are dead. Alive, they are not good; alive, they are not worth
friendship; alive we fight. Dead</p><p>,we praise them to high pinacles. I have heard...</p><p>A miserly man died. The widow went to the priest and asked him, `How
much will it cost? -- you have to deliver a speech.'</p><p>He said,` There are speeches and speeches. The best will cost two
hundred dollars.'</p><p>`Two hundred dollars?' the woman said. `My husband would not have
allowed that much of a luxury. Isn't there a cheaper speech/'</p><p>Them man said, `There are hundred-dollars -- but then I will not be
able to praise him much.'</p><p>The woman said, `Still come a little lower.'</p><p>And the priest said, `Fifty dollars is still too much.'</p><p>Then he said, Òkay, ten dollars -- but remember, then I will have to
tell the truth.'</p><p>When a person dies, we start telling lies... beautiful lies. In India
everybody dies and goes to heaven -- even politicians. Nobody seems to
go to hell; hell must be absolutely empty.</p><p>Death seems to be very important to us. We are death-obsessed. That's
why Christians made too much fuss about the cross -- that became a
symbol. A religion that is centered on the concept of the cross and
death and crucifixion cannot be a religion of life-affirmation.
Schweitzer is wrong. He should have read Kabir -- his whole being would
have been benefitted tremendously.</p><p>Kabir is REALLY the religious person. His declaration about life is
of tremendous trust.</p><p>He does not say to you to renounce anything. He says rather, `Bring
everything to God and bring God to everything.' You will be surprised by
his assertions: these assertions are tremendously revolutionary.</p><p>A few things more ,before we enter the songs.</p><p>Religion is not traditional -- cannot be by its very nature.
Tradition is that which is dead.</p><p>Tradition is that which has passed away, tradition is just the dust
of the past, tradition is just the memory. Religion is always alive,
breathing. Religion can never be traditional.</p><p>Whenever religion becomes traditional, it serves the Devil more than
God. Then it serves death more than life. Then it serves politicians,
priests, organizations, churches, but it doesn't serve the spirit of
man. Then it is no more an opening towards the future.</p><p>Tradition looks back; we have to go forward. Looking backward is
meaningless; not only meaningless, but harmful too, dangerous -- because
we cannot go backwards, we have to go forwards, and looking backwards
and moving forwards is bound to create trouble.</p><p>The second thing: religion is not in the scriptures, cannot be.
Scriptures are dead letters.</p><p>Yes, there was religion some day, throbbing in those words when they
were being uttered by an alive Master. When Krishna told Srimat Bhagavad
Gita to Arjuna, it was alive. It was alive because of Krishna, it was
illuminated because of Krishna -- when Krishna disappeared, the Bhagavad
Gita became a corpse. Dead words: you can go on analyzing those words,
interpreting this way and that... There are one thousand commentaries on
the Gita -- famous ones; there are many more. In fact, whenever anybody
reads the Gita, he has his own meaning of it. Krishna's meaning is lost;
it disappeared with Krishna himself.</p><p>The snake has passed... only the track on the sand is left. That
track you go on worshipping as a scripture.</p><p>When Jesus walked on earth and talked to his disciples, it was a
throbbing truth, throbbing with life -- alive, vibrating, pulsating. The
word was not dead; the word was God, the word was truth itself. The word
had a heart in it. The word was suffused with love, experience,
existence, being. When Jesus has gone, life is gone. Then you can
collect words and you can make as many gospels as you want. Those
gospels are going to be of no help.</p><p>Real religion is never in the scriptures. And a real religious seeker
does not go in search of scriptures, he goes in search of a Master -- a
living Master. That is one of the basic tenets of Kabir's understanding:
SATGURU -- the living Master. Go and search for a living Master! If you
can come in contact with a living Master then dead scriptures will
become alive again. They become alive only VIA the living Master --
there is no other way, because the living Master is the only scripture.
When the living Master touches the Bhagavad Gita it will become</p><p>alive; when he touches the gospel, the gospel will become alive. When
he recites the Koran, the Koran will again become alive. He will give
his own life to these words, they will start throbbing. But directly you
cannot find religion in the scriptures.</p><p>So religion is not in the tradition and religion is not in the
scriptures and religion is not in the rituals. Rituals are formalities.
Unless you are in communion with a living Master, rituals are a dead
weight. They will burden you, they will dry you, they will kill you, and
you will be lost in infinite formalities. With a living Master, a new
ritual is born. It comes out of the contact; it has a context to it, a
living reference to it. It is not learned by dead tradition being
transferred from one generation to another. You live it -- and through
living it, you learn it.</p><p>When you come to a living Master, deep down something in you wants to
bow down. It is not that you are going to do a certain formality -- if
you are doing, it is meaningless.</p><p>But something really down in your spirit, deep in your spirit, deep
in your center, wants to bow down. Then bowing to a Master is no more
ritualistic. It is alive, it is meaningful, it is not an empty gesture.
But you can just go on bowing down to anybody, because you have been
taught to bow down -- then it is useless. Try to see the difference.
When something is born into you out of your spontaneity, then it is
true. When you have to do something as a duty, it is untrue. `Duty' is a
dirty word. If something is born out of love, good. If something is born
out of duty, avoid it, never do it -- because that is dangerous.</p><p>If you learn the ways of duty too much, you will forget the ways of
love. Duty is against love. Duty is a false substitute for love.</p><p>Religion is not in the rituals. Of course, whenever there is religion
there is ritual</p><p>-- but that is a totally different matter. How can you avoid when
Buddha walks amongst you, how can you avoid touching his feet?
Impossible. You can do only two things and both are rituals: either you
have to touch his feet, or you have to throw stones at him. Both are
rituals -- one is that of the enemy and one is that of the friend, but
both are rituals. You cannot neglect Buddha, you cannot be indifferent,
that's all. The phenomenon is such that you cannot just bypass. Either
you have to become a friend or you have to become an enemy; you have to
choose. You have to have an attitude -- that attitude is ritual. But
then it is born into your heart, not learned from somebody else. It
simply arises in your</p><p>being.</p><p>Religion, wherever it is, always brings rituals; but when the
religion disappears, the rituals become dead. Don't carry the corpse.
Yes, you loved your mother very much and now she is dead -- what are you
going to do? Are you going to carry her corpse for your whole life? You
have to burn it or bury it. You have to get rid of it, you cannot go on
carrying it. But this same thing happens as far as religion is
concerned. You loved the Buddha so much, and great passion arose in your
soul, and great worship and great songs were born in his presence... now
he is gone, you continue the song. By and by, it is a far away echo of
the echo... goes on fading.</p><p>When the pope speaks in the Vatican, it is not Jesus' voice at all --
cannot be. When Jesus speaks, he speaks on his own authority. When the
pope speaks, he speaks on the authority of Jesus. A real Master speaks
on his own authority, he is his sole authority.</p><p>Religion is not in the tradition, not in the rituals, and NOT in the
so-called religions --</p><p>Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan. Religion has no adjective to it.
Religion is simply religion, as love is love. Do you call love
Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan? If love is neither Christian nor Hindu nor
Mohammedan, then why should God be Christian, Hindu and Mohammedan? Has
not Jesus said</p><p>`God is Love'? Religion is not in the religions; religion is pure of
all adjectives, pure of all definitions, and each one has to seek
it.</p><p>Nobody can be born into a religion, religion has to be born into you.
You have to open your soul and receive religion. It is showering all
around... but you are carrying toys, substitutes, false coins, in your
hands, and thinking you are having religion. In the church it is not, in
the mosque it is not, in the temple it is not. Go somewhere where a
living Master is: it is there. And that too exists only for a few
moments -- the Master is gone, and the religion disappears.</p><p>Hence Kabir's insistence for a SATGURU -- for a true Master Religion
is individual, one has to seek it on one's own. It is not a social
phenomenon, it has nothing to do with the crowd and the collective. It
is a private thing, as intimate as love. You come to it alone, in deep
intimacy, privacy... you open your heart. Religion is spontaneous in the
sense that you cannot learn it. You can be it, but</p><p>you cannot learn it. It is as spontaneous as love. Have you ever
learnt what love is?And that day will be a doomsday, when man will have
to learn how to love. That day seems to be coming closer every day, in
the West particularly, and more particularly in America. Books are being
written: How to Love, How to be Friendly -- foolish books, because if
man has forgotten how to love, no book can teach it. To teach humanity
how to love is as if somebody goes to the fish and teaches the fish to
swim -- that will be foolish. And so is the case with religion. Religion
cannot be taught, it can only be caught; it is a sort of infection. You
can go wherever a holy person exists and you can catch it, you can
imbibe it.</p><p>Religion is a rebellion. It is a rebellion against death, it is
rebellion against all that is dead; it is rebellion against the outside:
it is rebellion against politics, greed, society, culture, civilization.
Religion is a rebellion: it says we have to listen to the innermost core
of our being and follow it wherever it leads. Wherever... unafraid of
the consequences, we will listen to the small still voice within and
follow it. Religion is a risk. Those people who are after security too
much can never become religious; it is a dangerous thing. If you pass
through it, you will be passing through a crucifixion... but only after
the crucifixion is resurrection.</p><p>Now listen to the sutras of Kabir.</p><p>HE IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM OF THE FORMLESS TO THE
VISION OF THESE EYES...</p><p>Now if the real Master is the basic thing to search and seek for,
then of course a definition is needed: Who is the real Master? Whom to
call the real Master? How to know? Kabir says:</p><p>HE IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM OF THE FORMLESS TO THE
VISION OF THESE EYES</p><p>... in whose presence the formless descends and becomes a presence...
through whom you can have a look at the farthest star... through whom
you can have a feeling of God himself... through whose words silence
speaks, and through whose eyes the infinite peeks at you. And if you
hold his hand, you will suddenly see: the hand is his, but not only his
-</p><p>- God is holding your hand through him. He is a vehicle, a bamboo
flute on the lips of the infinite. He gives form to the formless, he is
the embodiment of the formless.</p><p>You have to be very open and vulnerable, only then will you be able
to feel a Master.</p><p>Don't go to a Master with a negative attitude, otherwise you will
never reach him. The very negative attitude will not allow his vibe to
reach you. The negative attitude will not allow you to move into the
same wavelength in which he lives. Hence trust is needed.</p><p>Hence, love is needed. Otherwise you will go empty and you will come
empty -- and when you will come empty you will say,`This is not the real
Master. I went empty and I have come empty.' If you are not open, you
will come empty. Only if you are open is there a possibility to feel.
And don't be afraid of open-ness. If you are open and the Master is not
real, nothing will happen; and you will know it, and you will know it
certainly, that this is not for you, that this is not the man you are
seeking. But be open --</p><p>because if you are open, only then can you know whether he is true or
not. If you are closed, already closed, then there is no possibility. In
fact, if you are closed, sooner or later you will become a victim of
somebody who is a pseudo-Master -- because pseudo-Masters try to
convince you argumentatively.</p><p>The real Masters are very paradoxical, very contradictory. They are
as contradictory as life itself, because they embody life. They are as
inconsistent as God himself, because they embody God. They are not
logical, they are very illogical -- because they are superlogical,
because they are bringing something which cannot be grasped through
logic.</p><p>In the closeness of a real Master you will feel you are close to an
abyss... but if you are open -- only then. If you are not open, you will
become a victim to some pseudo-person who can convince you, who can talk
you in, who can seduce you in. For example, if you are greedy he will
talk about greed. He will tell you how much you are going to gain out of
the meditation, the prayer. He will persuade your greed, how much you
are going to have in heaven if you follow him. He will promise you much.
A true Master never promises anything. In fact he shatters you
completely -- your greed, your desire, your idea of becoming</p><p>somebody, being somebody -- he shatters all in all. A real Master is
a rock against which your boat is completely shattered... your whole
mind is shattered. He drives you crazy; he does not argue. His argument
is more of his being than of his words.</p><p>But we are greedy. We live through greed, we are afraid, full of fear
-- somebody gives us consolation, we become victims. A real Master is
not a consolation, he is not a solace.</p><p>He is, in fact, death to you. He kills you, he destroys you, he is
very destructive... but creativity is possible only when the old is
destroyed. When the old ceases to be, the new can enter in.</p><p>I have heard a beautiful anecdote. Meditate over it.…</p><p>The letter from Sean to his old, old mother was heartening. `Dear
mother,' he wrote, Ì</p><p>am sending you some pills that a witch doctor gave me and if you take
one, it will take years of your life.'</p><p>He came home a few weeks later, and there was a beautiful young woman
outside his house rocking a pram in which a baby lay sucking a
bottle.</p><p>`Where's my mother?' he asked.</p><p>Àrrah, don't be silly,' she said. Ì'm your mother and these pills
were marvellous.'</p><p>Ìmagine!' said Sean. Òne pill, and you're as beautiful as anyone
could be -- and what's more, you were able to have a baby. Lord, but
they were powerful!'</p><p>`You madman!' she cried. `That's not a baby, that's your father. He
took two;'</p><p>Avoid greed -- otherwise you will take two pills. And there are many
people who are selling things like that. Witch doctors.…</p><p>A Master is not here to fulfill your greed, he is here to destroy
your greed. Because once greed is destroyed, you become available to
yourself. If you are greedy you are never available to yourself. Greed
becomes desire, desire becomes a projection in the future.</p><p>And you are always wandering somewhere in the future; you are never
herenow. Greed takes you away from yourself: greed has to be
destroyed.</p><p>A Master never promises you anything -- but only in the presence of a
Master something becomes possible. He will not tell you: Ì will take
death away from you', or `You will become immortal'. He is not giving
you nectar, elixir, ambrosia. Of course, being with a Master one becomes
immortal -- but not that he MAKES you immortal. He simply takes you deep
into the existence of death.</p><p>Just look at it: he takes you deep into the experience of death. That
is what deep meditation is all about -- a death *experience. And when
you have known your death, watched it, suddenly you realize you are
separate from it. It happens, but it never happens to you. It happens on
the periphery, it never reaches to the center. It happens to the body,
it never happens to you. And the body is nothing but your abode. You
have changed many bodies, and you will change many more -- but you are
immortal. But a real Master does not promise it. He delivers it one day,
but there is no promise for it. If you are seeking one state where fear
will dissolve, some state where your greed will be fulfilled, some state
where you will be titilated constantly with pleasure, paradise, then you
are bound to become a victim of some pseudo-person.</p><p>SATGURU means the real Master. A SATGURU means the pseudo-Master. HE
IS THE REAL MASTER, WHO CAN REVEAL THE FORM</p><p>OF THE FORMLESS TO THE VISION OF THESE EYES: WHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE
WAY OF ATTAINING HIM.…</p><p>THE SIMPLE WAY -- not complex methods, not yoga postures, not very
complicated rituals. He teaches simple ways, very simple, that anybody
who wants to do it can do it right now. His ways are so simple and
spontaneous that you will be surprised why you did not discover them
yourself. They are so simple! Once the Master has taught you, once you
have known the beauty of them, once you have tasted a little, you will
be simply surprised why you could not discover them -- they are so
simple.</p><p>The real Master is not technical, he is simple -- because there is no
technique to achieve God. God is not somewhere at the end of a
technique, no. God is already available to you.</p><p>You are in God;you just have to shake yourself a little so that you
can become a little more alert. Just a little more alertness, that's
all.</p><p>Sometimes you do become alert, but you become alert also in a very
unconscious way.</p><p>You are driving a car and suddenly you see that a bus is coming and
the driver seems to be drunk or mad and you see no possibility of
avoiding the accident. The accident is going to be; it becomes almost a
certainty. In that moment you become alert, very alert, but that
alertness is unconscious. You are alert, but you are not alert that you
are alert.</p><p>In some dangerous situation you become alert, but that alertness is
unconscious. A Master simply teaches you how to be alert with full
consciousness. He teaches you conscious awareness. Now you may be a
little puzzled, because... conscious awareness?</p><p>You think consciousness means awareness, awareness means
consciousness. No. There are moments when you are aware but not
conscious. If somebody comes suddenly with a pistol in his hand and
forces the pistol on your chest, you will be aware but not conscious.
Thinking will stop. The shock is so sudden, so unexpectedly sudden, and
cannot figure out what is going to happen, and death is so close... in
that shock, your mind stops. Your constantly spinning mind spins no
more. Your constantly chattering mind is simply shocked into silence:
you become aware. But this awareness is unconscious.</p><p>The Master teaches only one thing: how to be consciously aware. And
that's a very simple thing. You can start doing it any moment; you can
apply awareness, consciousness, to any activity that you go on doing.If
you are walking on the road, just walk consciously. Take each step in
deep alertness. Listening to me, right now, listen attentively. You are
listening attentively but that attention may be unconscious. Become
conscious of the attentiveness, and suddenly you will see a tremendous
blessing descends in you. Out of nowhere, suddenly it is there. Just a
moment of conscious alertness and your doors open and God enters in --
as if he was just waiting there at the door, knocking and knocking and
knocking. But you are so much preoccupied.…</p><p>Kabir says:</p><p>WHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE WAY OF ATTAINING HIM.…</p><p>People who teach complex ways simply show that they have not known
God -- because God needs no expertise. And people who teach complex ways
have a reason to teach complex ways :so that they always can say to you
Ìf you are not doing the thing rightly, how can you hope to attain?'</p><p>Have you heard a beautiful story of Khalil Gibran?..</p><p>A man used to move from town to town. He was a great teacher and he
used to say to people, `Come and follow me, and I will show you the way
to God.' But people were engaged. They had so many thousands of things
to do and they would say, `We worship you, we respect you, and one day
we are coming to follow you -- but right now it is difficult.'</p><p>Nobody is ready now -- that's why so many pseudo-Masters can exist.
Saint Augustine, in his confessions says: Ì used to pray to God when I
was young, "God save me, but not right now. Save me but not right now"
-- because I was indulging in so many things,' he says, ànd I wanted to
enjoy all that is available. So this was not to be heard
immediately.</p><p>I was saying the prayer because it has to be said formally, but I
would always say, "Save me Lord, but not right now."'</p><p>So this preacher went from town to town, and people would say, `Not
right now. We will come one day.' And he was very happy because nobody
ever followed him and there was no trouble. A madman one day said, Òkay,
I am coming.' He became a little afraid, but he said -- he was a very
clever and cunning man -- he said, `Come.' And he would give him such
complex procedures as are almost impossible to do. But the man was
really mad. He would do them, and even this teacher could not find any
fault. And the man continued. The teacher was thinking he would get
fed-up sooner or later.</p><p>One year passed, two years passed, and he would say, `When?' The
disciple was too much! -- and he would ask again and again,`Now, what
else to do?' And he was doing everything! Even the Master became afraid
-- now he could not think what else to say for him to do, and he was
doing EVERYTHING.</p><p>Six years passed, and one day the disciple said, `How long is it
still? I am ready to do anything but you are not giving me anything.' He
said, `Listen: the truth is, in your company I have lost my own way. I
used to know where he is, but since you have come You just have mercy on
me and leave me.'</p><p>Complex procedures have been invented by cunning people. First nobody
is ready to do them; good -- the pseudo-Master can exist, because his
techniques will never be put to any experimentation. Second if somebody
tries to do it, they are so complex that it can always be said that you
are not doing them rightly.They are so complex that you cannot trust
yourself and you are always afraid that something may go wrong. But a
real Master will give you very simple techniques -- anybody of average
intelligence, of average health, can do them.</p><p>WHO TEACHES THE SIMPLE WAY OF ATTAINING HIM, THAT IS OTHER THAN RITES
OR CEREMONIES...</p><p>He never teaches you rituals, rites and ceremonies. He may teach you
celebration</p><p>-- but never ceremonies. Celebration is of the heart, and ceremony is
just a ritual of the mind.</p><p>WHO DOES NOT MAKE YOU CLOSE THE DOORS, AND HOLD THE BREATH, AND
RENOUNCE THE WORLD...</p><p>The real Master is all for the world, because this world is a
manifestation of God. This world is full of God. Every rock is so
crowded with God, and every tree and every bird and all that exists is
so full, overflowing with God... where to go? and for what? Whom to
renounce? and for what? And how can one renounce? -- because wherever
you are in God, and wherever you are you are in this world... because
there is no other world.</p><p>HE DOES NOT MAKE YOU CLOSE YOUR DOORS, AND HOLD YOUR BREATH, AND
RENOUNCE THE WORLD:</p><p>WHO MAKES YOU PERCEIVE THE SUPREME SPIRIT WHENEVER THE MIND</p><p>ATTACHES ITSELF...</p><p>Just look at the beauty if this sutra. Kabir says:</p><p>WHO MAKES YOU PERCEIVE THE SUPREME SPIRIT WHENEVER THE MIND</p><p>ATTACHES ITSELF...</p><p>He says: Don't be worried. Whenever you mind feels attachment, don't
be afraid of the attachment: go deep into it and try to find God
there... and you will find him there. You love a woman-no need to escape
from her: look deep into her eyes... and you will find God there. God is
welling up everywhere. You love your child-don't renounce the world and
don't throw the child to this hungry, violent, ugly world, don't abandon
the child to the wolves: look into the eyes of the child. Put ears to
his heart and listen deeply... and you will find God there.</p><p>Kabir says: Unconditionally, whenever the mind attaches itself,
perceive the supreme self.</p><p>I have heard about a man who came to Kabir and he wanted to know god,
and Kabir asked him, "Don't you love somebody?"</p><p>He said, `Sorry, I don't love anybody.'</p><p>Kabir said, Ànybody will do, but you love-because unless you love,
there is no bridge.'</p><p>The man was a little shy but then he confessed, `Yes, I love. I love
my cow.' A poor man, and he had one cow and nothing else.</p><p>Kabir said, `Perfectly good. That will do.'</p><p>The man asked, `Then what have I to do now?'</p><p>He said, `Now you start thinking that the cow is divine. Now she is
no more a cow; she is a god, a goddess. You serve her, you love her, you
pat her, you give her a bath, you do everything-but now she is a
goddess. God is hidden there. And come after three months.'</p><p>After three months the man was totally different, radiant with new
energy. The disciple of Kabir were a little puzzled -- Ìs he just joking
with this man?' But when the man came, they were surprised. he had
almost become a new man, a new being; and he fell at Kabir's feet and
said, `Tremendous it is! I have found my God. And the day I found him in
my cow, I found him everywhere.'</p><p>Whenever your love falls, no need to escape and renounce. Let your
love become your prayer.</p><p>WHO TEACHES YOU TO BE STILL IN THE MIDST OF ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES.</p><p>EVER IMMERSED IN BLISS, HAVING NO FEAR IN HIS MIND, HE KEEPS THE</p><p>SPIRIT OF UNION IN THE MIDST OF ALL ENJOYMENTS.</p><p>And Kabir says: Don't escape from enjoyments. Remember, they are his
gifts. And don't escape from the worldly activities; remain passive.
Move in the crowd and remain alone.</p><p>The real thing is to be alone-not to be lonely. And one can be alone
in the crowd, and you can be in a crowd when sitting in a Himalayan
cave-it all depends on your mind. So the change has to be inner, not
outer.</p><p>THE INFINITE DWELLING OF THE INFINITE BEING IS EVERYWHERE: IN EARTH,
WATER, SKY, AND AIR:</p><p>FIRM AS THE THUNDERBOLT, THE SEAT OF THE SEEKER IS ESTABLISHED</p><p>ABOVE THE VOID.</p><p>HE WHO IS WITHIN IS WITHOUT: I SEE HIM AND NONE ELSE.</p><p>You just become empty of your self. Empty yourself, become void...
and you will become the seat, you will become the abode, you will become
the temple.</p><p>O BROTHER: WHEN I WAS FORGETFUL, MY TRUE GURU SHOWED ME THE WAY.</p><p>THEN I LEFT ALL RITES AND CEREMONIES...</p><p>When you have found the guru, what is the use of rites and
ceremonies? When you have found a living Master, then what is the use of
scriptures and traditions?</p><p>`When I left my Master...</p><p>I LEFT ALL RITES AND CEREMONIES,</p><p>I BATHED NO MORE IN THE HOLY WATER;</p><p>THEN I LEARNED THAT IT WAS I ALONE WHO WAS MAD, AND THE WHOLE</p><p>WORLD BESIDE ME WAS SANE; AND I HAD DISTURBED THESE WISE PEOPLE.</p><p>This must be you experience too, of all sannyasins. People will think
you mad.</p><p>And Kabir says: Since I have left foolish things -- I don't go to
take a bath in the holy ganges and don't go to the temple and I don't do
any ritual-people Think I have gone mad.</p><p>Whenever you will come in close contact with a Master, the world will
think you have gone mad. They are all sane, wise people. Their wisdom
never leads them anywhere, their sanity never gives them a single
glimpse of bliss; their sanity is nothing but their misery, and their
wisdom is nothing but all stupidity-but still they think they are sane
and they are wise, they should be blissful. If they are really sane,
they would show intelligence, creativity. But they don't show
anything.</p><p>But people who come in close contact with a Master and are
illuminated by his being will look mad. Always it has been so, and
always it will be so. So of people think you are mad, don't be
worried-they were thinking that even about Kabir.</p><p>THEN I LEARNED THAT IT WAS I ALONE WHO WAS MAD, AND THE WHOLE WORLD
BESIDE ME WAS SANE;</p><p>AND I HAD DISTURBED THESE WISE PEOPLE.</p><p>FROM THAT TIME FORTH I KNEW NO MORE HOW TO ROLL IN THE DUST IN</p><p>OBEISANCE:</p><p>I DO NOT RING THE TEMPLE BELL;</p><p>I DO NOT SET THE IDOL ON ITS THRONE:</p><p>I DO NOT WORSHIP THE IMAGE WITH FLOWERS.</p><p>IT IS NOT THE AUSTERITIES THAT MORTIFY THE FLESH WHICH ARE PLEASING
TO THE LORD.</p><p>And Kabir declares: If you mortify yourself you are a perverted
being, and God is not happy with you. If you torture yourself you are a
masochist, and God is not happy with you. God is happy when you are
happy, God is happy in you happiness... because he is hiding in you
deepest core. When you torture yourself you torture God-how can he be
happy? When you become a masochist and people start worshipping you like
a MAHATMA, you are a masochist, a perverted being, insane-and torturing
the God within yourself.</p><p>Helpless is he, helpless like a small child. You an torture him
easily. IT IS NOT THE AUSTERITIES THAT MORTIFY THE FLESH WHICH ARE
PLEASING TO THE LORD.</p><p>WHEN YOU LEAVE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND KILL YOUR SENSES YOU DO</p><p>NOT PLEASE THE LORD...</p><p>Listen to these rebellious maxims. It is not that when you destroy
your senses God is pleased; rather, he is pleased when your sensitivity
goes to a peak. When you can see more beauty in the world, When you can
hear more music in the world, when you can love more deeply, when you
can be more alive, he is happy.</p><p>WHEN YOU LEAVE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND KILL YOUR SENSES, YOU DO NOT
PLEASE THE LORD: THE MAN WHO IS KIND AND WHO PRACTISES RIGHTEOUSNESS,WHO
REMAINS PASSIVE AMIDST THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD, WHO CONSIDERS</p><p>ALL CREATURES ON EARTH AS HIS OWN SELF. HE ATTAINS THE IMMORTAL
BEING, THE TRUE GOD IS EVER WITH HIM. KABIR SAYS:</p><p>`HE ATTAINS THE TRUE NAME WHOSE WORDS ARE PURE, AND WHO IS FREE FROM
PRIDE AND CONCEIT.'</p><p>One who is kind to himself and others, only one who loves himself and
others.… You have been taught: `Never love yourself.' You have been
taught: `Never be kind to yourself.' You have been taught to never
forgive yourself. You have been taught much self-torture: you are
praised in the same proportion as you torture yourself. If you want to
become a MAHATMA you have to be a masochist-there is no other way. I f
you are happy, joyous, delighted in your being, nobody is going to
worship you.Who worships a happy man? Have you seen any happy man being
worshiped? People worship sad longface, dead, dull, stupid people who
can torture themselves. Their only art is that they can torture
themselves; they are cruel to themselves, they are violent.</p><p>Kabir says: Be kind, and let kindness flow through you. Love
yourself, and only then can you love others too. In deep love, in deep
sensitivity, God is pleased.</p><p>The whole point is that you have to become a spiritual hedonist.
That's my whole teaching too: become a spiritual hedonist. There are
spiritual people but they are hedonists, and there are hedonist who are
not spiritual. The West is hedonist but not spiritual; materialist. The
East is spiritual but not hedonist-and both have missed. A higher
synthesis is needed: hedonim and spiritualism. When they meet, the total

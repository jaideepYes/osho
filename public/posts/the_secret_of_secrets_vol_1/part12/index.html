I apologize – because dogs are so innocent. It is not fair at all. The second question:\nQuestion 2\nWHAT IS NEUROSIS AND WHAT IS THE CURE FOR IT?\nNeurosis has never been so epidemic in the past as it is now. It is almost becoming a normal state of human mind. It has to be understood.\nThe past was spiritually more healthy, and the reason was that mind was not fed so many things simultaneously; the mind was not overloaded. The modern mind is overloaded, and that which remains unassimilated creates neurosis. It is as if you go on eating and stuffing your body. That which is not digested by the body will prove to be poisonous. And what you eat is less important than what you hear and see. From your eyes, from your ears, from all your senses, you go on receiving a thousand and one things each moment. And there is no extra assimilation time. It is as if one were constantly sitting at the dining table, eating, eating, twenty-four hours a day.\nThis is the situation of the modern mind: it is overloaded; so many things are burdening it. It is not any surprise that it breaks down. There is a limit to every mechanism. And mind is one of the most subtle and delicate of mechanisms.\nA really healthy person is one who takes fifty percent of his time to assimilate his experiences. Fifty percent action, fifty percent inaction – that is the right balance. Fifty percent thinking, fifty percent meditation – that is the cure.\nMeditation is nothing but a time when you can relax utterly into yourself, when you close all your doors, all your senses, to the outside stimulus. You disappear from the world. You forget the world as if it exists no more – no newspapers, no radio, no television, no people. You are alone in your innermost being, relaxed, at home.\nIn these moments, all that has become accumulated is assimilated. That which is worthless is thrown out. Meditation functions like a double-edged sword: on the one hand it assimilates all that is nourishing, and it rejects and throws out all that is junk.\nBut meditation has disappeared from the world. In the old days, people were naturally meditative. Life was uncomplicated, and people had enough time just to sit and do nothing, or look at the stars, or watch the trees, or listen to the birds. People had intervals of deep passivity. In those moments you become more and more healthy and whole.\nNeurosis means you are carrying such a load in the mind that you are dying under it. You cannot move. There is no question of your consciousness flying. You cannot even creep – the burden is too much. And the burden goes on increasing every moment. One cracks up. It is very natural.\nA few things to be understood. Neurosis is the mouse endlessly trying the dead end, not learning. Yes, not learning is neurosis – that is the first definition. You go on trying the dead end.\nYou have been angry. How many times have you been angry? And how many times have you repented of being angry? Still, let there be a stimulus and your reaction will again be the same. You have not learned a thing. You have been greedy and greed has created more and more misery. You know it – greed has never given anybody blissfulness – but you are still greedy, you still go on being greedy. You don’t learn.\nNon-learning creates neurosis, is neurosis.\nLearning means assimilation. You try one thing and then you find that it doesn’t work. You drop it. You move in another direction, you try another alternative. This is wise, this is intelligent. Just knocking your head against a wall where you know perfectly well there is no door is neurosis.\nPeople are getting more and more neurotic because they go on trying the dead end, they go on trying that which doesn’t work. The man who is capable of learning never becomes neurotic – cannot become. He immediately sees the point that this is a wall. He drops the whole idea. He starts moving into other dimensions. There are other alternatives available. He has learned something.\nIt is said of Edison that he was trying one experiment in which he failed seven hundred times. His colleagues became desperate. Three years were wasted and he went on trying new alternatives\nagain and again. And every morning he came with great enthusiasm – the same enthusiasm that he had come with on the first day. And three years were wasted.\nOne day his colleagues gathered together and they said to him, ‘We don’t see the point. We have failed seven hundred times. It is time to drop the experimentation.’ Edison is reported to have said, ‘What are you saying – failed? We have learned that seven hundred alternatives were wrong alternatives. It has been a great experience! Today I am not going to try the same experiment, I have found another one. We are coming closer to the truth. How many false alternatives can there be? There must be a limit. If there are one thousand false alternatives, then seven hundred have already been dropped and only three hundred are left. And then we will be reaching the right point.’\nThis is learning. Trying one experiment, seeing that it doesn’t work, trying an alternative, seeing that it doesn’t work, the wise man drops it. The fool clings to it. The fool calls it consistency. The fool says, ‘I did it yesterday and I am going to do it today, too. And I will do it tomorrow.’ He is stubborn, pig-headed. He says, ‘How can I leave it? I have invested so much in it. I cannot change it.’ Then he goes on insisting on it and his whole life is wasted. And as death comes closer, he is desperate, he is hopeless. Deep down in his guts he knows perfectly well that he is going to fail. He has failed so many times and he is still trying the same thing without learning anything at all.\nThis creates neurosis. The man who is capable of learning will never become neurotic.\nA disciple will never become neurotic. A disciple means one who is capable of learning. Never become knowledgeable; always be in the process of learning.\nKnowledgeability drives people neurotic. It is not just accidental that professors, philosophers, psychiatrists, scholars, easily go mad. They have learned and they have reached the conclusion that there is no more to learn. The moment you decide that there is no more to learn, you have stopped growing. To stop growing is neurosis – that is the second definition.\nThe world was very different in the past, obviously. About six weeks’ worth of sensory stimuli six hundred years ago is what we now get in a day. Six weeks’ worth of stimulation, information, we are getting in a single day – about forty times the pressure to learn and adapt. Modern man has to be capable of learning more than man has ever been before, because there is more to learn now. Modern man has to become capable of adapting to new situations every day because the world is changing so fast. It is a great challenge.\nA great challenge, if accepted, will help tremendously in the expansiOn of consciousness. Either modern man is going to be utterly neurotic or modern man is going to be transformed by the very pressure. It depends on how you take it. One thing is certain: there is no way of going back. The sensory stimuli will go on increasing more and more. You will be getting more and more information and life will be changing, with faster and faster rhythms. And you will have to be capable of learning, of adapting, to new things.\nIn the past man lived in an almost static world. Everything was static. You would leave the world exactly as your father had left it to you. You would not have changed anything at all. Nothing was changed. There was no question of learning too much. A little bit of learning was enough. And then you had spaces in your mind, empty spaces, which helped people to remain sane. Now there is no more empty space, unless you create it deliberately.\nMeditation is needed today more than ever before. Meditation is needed so much that it is almost a question of life and death. In the past it was a luxury; few people – a Buddha, a Mahavira, a Krishna – were interested in it. Other people were naturally silent, naturally happy, sane. There was no need for them to think of meditation; in an unconscious way they were meditating. Life was moving so silently, moving so slowly, that even the most stupid people were capable of adapting to it. Now the change is so tremendously fast, with such speed, that even the most intelligent people feel incapable of adapting to it. Every day life is different, and you have to learn again – you have to learn and learn again and again. You can never stop learning now; it has to be a life-long process. To the very point of death you will have to remain a learner, only then can you remain sane, can you avoid neurosis. And the pressure is great – forty times greater.\nHow to relax this pressure? You will have to go deliberately into meditative moments. If a person is not meditating at least one hour a day, then neurosis will not be accidental, he will create it himself.\nFor one hour he should disappear from the world into his own being. For one hour he should be so alone that nothing penetrates him – no memory, no thought, no imagination; for one hour no content in his consciousness, and that will rejuvenate him and that will refresh him. That will release new sources of energy in him and he will be back in the world, younger, fresher, more able to learn, with more wonder in his eyes, with more awe in his heart – again a child.\nThis pressure to learn, and the old habit of not learning, is driving people crazy. The modern mind is really super-loaded, and no time is given to digest it, to assimilate it into one’s own being. That is where meditation comes in and becomes more significant than ever. Without giving time for the mind to rest in meditation we repress all of the messages that are pouring in continuously. We refuse to learn – we say we have not got time. Then the messages begin to accumulate. If you don’t have time enough to listen to the messages that your mind is receiving continuously, they start accumulating – just like files accumulating on your table, piles of letters accumulating on your table, because you have not time enough to read and answer them. Exactly like that your mind becomes cluttered – so many files waiting to be looked into, so many letters to be read, to be answered, so many challenges to be taken, to be faced.\nI have heard...\nMulla Nasrudin was saying one day, ‘If something wrong happens today, I will not have time for at least three months to look into it. So many wrong things have already happened which are waiting there. If something wrong happens today,’ he said, ‘I will not have time to look into it for three months at least.’\nA queue. You can see that queue inside yourself – and the queue goes on growing. And the bigger the queue, the less and less space you have; the bigger the queue, the more and more noise inside – because everything that you have accumulated demands your attention.\nThis usually starts at about the age of five when real learning virtually stops, and this lasts until death. In the old days it was okay. Five or seven years were enough to learn all that you would need in your life; that would do. Seven years’ learning would do for seventy years of life. But now that is not possible. You cannot stop learning because new things are always happening and you cannot face those new things with old ideas. You cannot depend on your parents and their knowledge, you\ncannot even depend on your teachers in the school and the university, because what they are talking about is already out of date. Much more has happened. Much water has gone down the Ganges.\nThis was my experience. When I was a student I was surprised at my professors’ knowledge because it was thirty years old. It was when they were young that they had gathered it from their teachers. Since then they had not looked at what had happened That knowledge was absolutely useless. I was constantly in conflict with my professors, I was thrown out of many colleges, expelled, because the professors said that they could not cope with me. And I was not creating any trouble, I was simply making them aware that what they were saying was out of date. But that hurts the ego. They had learned it in their own university days and they were thinking that the world had stopped then and there.\nNow students cannot depend on teachers and children cannot depend on their parents, hence a great rebellion is on the way all over the world. It has nothing to do with anything else. Students cannot respect their teachers anymore unless those teachers continuously learn. They cannot be respected. For what? There is no reason. And children cannot respect their parents because the approach of their parents looks very primitive. Small children are becoming aware that what their parents say is out of date. Parents will have to continuously learn if they want to help their children to grow and teachers will have to continuously learn. Now no one can stop learning. And this speed is going to grow continuously.\nSo, one thing: learning has not to be stopped, otherwise you will go neurotic; because to stop learning means you are accumulating information which you have not assimilated, digested, which has not become your blood and your bones and your marrow. It will hang around you with great insistence to be taken in.\nSecondly: you will need time to relax. This pressure is too much. You will need some time to disappear from this pressure. Sleep cannot help you anymore because sleep itself is becoming overburdened. Your day is so overloaded that when you go to sleep only the body falls limp on the bed, but the mind continues to sort things out. That’s what you call dreaming: it is nothing but a desperate effort of the mind to sort things out because you won’t give any time to it.\nYou have to relax consciously into meditation. A few minutes of deep meditation will keep you non-neurotic.\nIn meditation the mind unclutters, experiences are digested, and the overload disappears, leaving the mind fresh and young and clear and clean.\nIn the past the input volume was one-tenth of one’s time and the meditative time was nine-tenths. Now just the reverse is the case: nine-tenths input volume time and one-tenth meditative time. Very rarely do you relax. Very rarely do you just sit silently, doing nothing. Even that one-tenth time of unconscious meditation is disappearing. Once that happens, man will be utterly mad. And that is happening.\nWhat do I mean by unconscious meditative time? You simply go into the garden, you play around with your children – that is unconscious meditative time. Or you swim in the swimming pool – that is unconscious meditative time. Or you mow your lawn, or you listen to the birds – that is unconscious\nmeditative time. That too is disappearing because whenever people have time, they are sitting before their TVs, glued to their seats.\nNow, tremendously dangerous information is being put into your mind by the TV. You will not be able to digest it. Or you are reading newspapers. All kinds of nonsense is being fed to you. Whenever you have time you put the radio or the TV on. Or someday you are feeling very good and you want to relax and you go to the movie. What kind of relaxation is this? The movie will not allow you relaxation, because information is continuously thrown into you.\nRelaxation means no information is thrown into you. Listening to a cuckoo will do, because no information is fed to you. Listening to music will do, because no information is thrown into you. Music has no language; it is pure sound. It does not give any message; it simply delights you. Dancing will be good, music will be good, working in the garden will be good, playing with children will be good, or just sitting doing nothing will be good. This is the cure. And if you do it consciously, the impact will be greater.\nCreate a balance. Neurosis is an unbalanced state of mind: too much activity and no inactivity at all, too much masculine and no feminine at all, too much yang and too little of yin. And you have to be fifty-fifty. You have to keep a deep balance. A symmetry is needed inside you. You have to be an ARDHANA-RISHWAR, half man, half woman, then you will never go neurotic.\nAnd that is the whole process of the book, THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. It will make you disappear as man, as woman; it will make you one whole, one unity; it will give you individuation.\nIndividuality is neither male nor female, it is simple unity. Strive to achieve it between time spent doing versus time spent not doing. This is wholeness. This is what Buddha called his Middle Way, MAJJHIM NIKAYA. Just be exactly in the middle. And remember, you can become unbalanced to the other extreme too; you can become too inactive. That will be dangerous also. That has its own pitfalls and dangers. If you become too inactive, your life loses dance, your life loses joy, you start becoming dead.\nSo I am not saying become inactive, I am saying let there be a balance between action and inaction. Let them balance each other and you be just in the middle. Let them be two wings of your being. No wing should be bigger than the other.\nIn the West, action has become too great; inaction has disappeared. In the East, inaction became too great and action disappeared. The West knows affluence, richness, on the outside and poverty inside; the East knows richness, affluence, inside and poverty on the outside. Both are in misery because both have chosen extremes.\nMy approach is neither Eastern nor Western, my approach is neither male nor female, my approach is neither of action nor inactiOn, my approach is that of utter balance, symmetry, in you. Hence I say to my sannyasins: Don’t leave the world. Be in the world and yet be not of it. This is what Taoists call WEI WU WEI, action through inaction – the meeting of yin and yang, anima and animus; it brings enlightenment. Imbalance is neurosis; balance is enlightenment.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nARE ALL WOMEN REALLY SOFT, FEMININE AND LOVING?\nI have not said that – that all women are really soft, feminine and loving. Neither are all men aggressive, violent, ambitious, hard. Because deep down in you the consciousness is neither. The anima and the animus, the male and the female exist in your body chemistry. You can be a man physically, but deep inside you may have chosen the feminine part. A woman may be a woman physically but she may have chosen the masculine part – both parts are available – then the body remains feminine but the woman will become masculine.\nThat is what is happening to women connected with the Women’s Liberation movement: they are dropping their feminineness, they are becoming as aggressive as man. They are trying to compete with all kinds of foolishnesses that man has. They want to have all those foolishnesses themselves, too – they cannot be left behind.\nThe idea of being equal is creating a foolish idea of being similar. To be equal does not mean to be similar. Equality is a totally different dimension; similarity is different.\nYes, a woman can choose her masculine part too much, she can become identified with it, then her softness will disappear. A man can choose his feminineness, then his hardness will disappear. The body will remain sexually male or female, but the quality surrounding the body, the vibe, will have to be that which you have chosen inside. A man can choose to be a woman inside, a woman can choose to be a man inside.\nAnd it is not a choice that you make once and forever, you can change it every moment. There are moments when a woman is very soft and there are moments when she can be very hard, very cruel. There are moments when a man is very hard, aggressive, but there are moments when he can be very soft. Even a Ghengis Khan is very soft to his children. To his wife he is very soft.\nI have heard...\nThe plain and strongly-built daughter of a Field-Marshal was engaged to be married to a young officer on her father’s staff. ‘Couldn’t you do something for Frank now that he has asked me to marry him?’ she asked her father one day.\n‘There’s not much I can do really,’ replied the Field-Marshal, ‘except get him a medal for gallantry.’ He was undersized, meek, diffident, and subdued, and he had applied for a job as a night-watchman.\n‘Yes,’ said the manager, dubiously, ‘but the fact is we want someone who is restless and uneasy, especially at night – someone who thinks the worst of everybody, someone who sleeps with one eye open. The kind of person, in short, who, when roused, is the devil himself.’\n‘Alright,’ said the meek lad, as he walked away, ‘I’ll send my wife.’\nIt depends on what you choose inside you. It is a choice. The body is not your choice, but the vibe that will surround your body is a choice. And if you choose consciously, you will have great freedom in your being, because you will know who you are and what you are doing with your body.\nThe body is tremendously potential – much can happen through it – but people take it for granted. It is as if a beautiful guitar has been given to you as a present and you just keep it, not knowing the potential of it. You can play on the guitar, you can learn to play on the guitar, and great music will be born. And then it depends on you what kind of music it will be. You can create a music which is sad, you can create a music which is celebrating, you can create music which is violent, you can create a music which is soothing, loving, silent.\nThere are kinds of music. Classical music has a different quality: it soothes, it brings you to a silence, rest. Modern pop music makes you restless, sexual; it drives you into a kind of frenzy. But the instruments are the same – as are bodies.\nA really wise person chooses to play what kind of music he wants to play on the body. You can make your body like a Buddha or you can become a Mohammed Ali. It depends on you. Look at Buddha’s body – how soft, although he is a man; how feminine, although he is a man. He has chosen grace.\nIt depends on you. It is your choice. You are not confined by your chemistry. You can be confined only if you remain unconscious in your chemistry, otherwise your chemistry has infinite potential: it can be put to a thousand and one uses. And to learn how to use one’s body, how to behave with one’s body, how to relate with one’s body, is a great art. Millions of people just take their body for granted; they never search for its possibilities. Their body remains a seed. It never becomes a Golden Flower.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nYOUR DISCOURSE ON POLITICS AND THE POISON IT IS WAS EXTRAORDINARY! I HAVE LIVED IN MANY COMMUNITIES, ALL SINCERE AND WELL-MEANING, YET EVERYWHERE I WAS APPALLED AT THE UNCONSCIOUS POLITICAL AMBITION AND INTRIGUES WHICH ARE UNDERLYING AND DORMANT BUT COME UP IN SPITE OF THE GOOD INTENTIONS.\nHOW ARE YOU HANDLING IT HERE? ARE YOU ALLOWING IT FREE PLAY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN WORK IT OUT OF THEIR SYSTEMS – OR ARE YOU NIPPING IT IN THE BUD AND WEEDING OUT THOSE THAT SHOW THE SLIGHTEST TENDENCIES?\nMY HUMBLE EXPERIENCE IS THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN NEVER, NEVER GET ANYTHING GOING WITHOUT POLITICS – WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES HIGHER AND HIGHER IN THE POWER GAME. THEY ARE ALL OVER – PERHAPS EVEN HERE – SPREADING THEIR POISON.\nStilwell, I don’t believe in repressing anything – not even the poisonous politics – because repressed, it remains in your system; sooner or later it will take you over. And the longer it has been repressed, the more dangerous it becomes, because the deeper it goes into your very source of being. And if you are poisoned at your very source, at the very centre, then it becomes really difficult to uproot it.\nMy approach about everything is to bring it to the surface. So I never nip anything in the bud, I help it to become a flower. And after the flowering, the flower starts withering of its own accord. That’s the natural way.\nSo in my commune, nothing is prevented. Ambitions are allowed, accepted, as being part of human beings, their ignorance, their unawareness. But I make my people aware that these are games. So play them, but play consciously. Become more and more alert and never let them become serious. If they don’t become serious, there is no need to become afraid of them. The problem is that when a game becomes so serious then you forget completely that it is a game.\nThat’s where the politician is lost. He thinks he is doing something very serious. He is doing something very silly, but he thinks he is doing something very serious. All that is needed is to make him aware that this is a game. If you want to play it, play, but don’t become so serious about it. Keep a little bit of humour. A sense of humour is one of the greatest keys to transform human personalities.\nYes, you are right! Here also – because these people come from the world and they bring all kinds of infections from the world. They are not coming here fresh, they have been already conditioned. Ambition has already been put into them – their parents, the society, church, school, college, university. Everywhere they have been poisoned; they bring all that poison here. You cannot nip it in the bud otherwise they will become split and hypocritical. Then on the surface they will show humility, humbleness, and deep down they will think, ‘There is nobody more humble than me’ – and politics has come in. Deep down they will think, ‘I am the greatest egoless person in the world’ – but the ‘greatest’.\nNow a new kind of ambition has entered. It is the same ambition, now the direction is new. And it is more subtle, and, of course, more dangerous too. And now it is pious, because it is in the name of religion. So even the poison no longer looks like poison; it is labelled nectar. It is religious poison, pious poison, and it is more difficult to get rid of the pious poison.\nSo I don’t repress anything and I don’t help any kind of repression, I help people to bring whatsoever they have in them to the surface. I help them to be aware of it, to watch it, to see the foolishness of it, to see the stupidity of it – not because I say it is stupid, because if I say something and you only believe it, you will repress it. I help you – my function here is to help you become aware on your own. The day you see the stupidity of it, it will drop of its own accord.\nSo I have created all kinds of games here. Yes, there is a hierarchy too so people who want to play, they can play the game of hierarchy. But sooner or later – because the whole effort is to make them conscious – they become aware that this is a game. And the moment THEY see it is a game, they are out of it. Seeing something as a game makes you laugh at it – a hearty laugh at your own self. And when a man can laugh at his own stupidities he is becoming wise. Laughter has to come out of awareness.\nAmbitious people also laugh. Just the other day I was reading that when Jimmy Carter came to power he was laughing so beautifully that you could have counted his teeth. And some people have counted – eleven teeth were showing. Now only seven are showing. Now the smile is disappearing because his prestige is falling every day. People’s expectations are not fulfilled: what he has promised he cannot deliver. Only seven! Soon you will see five, three, two. By the time he goes, the smile will have disappeared completely. You will not see a single tooth. This is not real laughter. Even this laughter is political, managed, practised, cultivated.\nThere is a different kind of laughter that comes to you when you see all kinds of foolishnesses that you have been in – and how seriously. When you see the whole ridiculousness of your life pattern, your whole gestalt and its stupidity – but not because I say or Buddha says or Master Lu-tsu says... It is not a question of belief, it is not a question of somebody else’s belief, it is not a question of somebody else’s knowledge and you borrow it – borrowed knowledge never helps – it has to arise in you.\nMy effort here is to make you aware of all that is hidden in you. All that you have been doing unconsciously has to be done consciously, that’s all. And sometimes miracles happen.\nOnce a professor came to me. His problem, and it was really a problem, because to be a professor and have such a problem is really difficult – his problem was that he walked like a woman. So whenever he passed by students would come and laugh and giggle and he felt really bad. What to do about it? And he had been to the doctors and the psychoanalysts and they could not help. They said, ‘What can we do?’ From his very childhood he had been walking that way. And he tried not to walk like that, and the more he tried, the more he failed.\nThere is a certain law – hypnotists call it the law of reverse effect. You try hard to do something and just the opposite happens.\nSo he was trying hard. His whole effort, his whole mind was concerned with not walking like a woman, but he was walking like a woman more and more. I told him, ‘Just do one thing – because it is a miracle that you can walk like a woman, it is really a miracle.’ He said, ‘What are you saying?’ I said, ‘It is a miracle! A woman can walk that way because of a different musculature. Because of the womb she walks in a certain way. No man can walk like that. You are unique!’ He said, ‘What are you saying? And everybody is laughing at me.’ I said, ‘You are really unique. You have done something miraculous. It is magical. You forget all about it. My suggestion is that you start walking consciously like a woman. Make it a point to walk like a woman.’ He said, ‘What are you suggesting? I have tried my whole life not to walk like a woman, then too I walk like a woman. And if I start walking like a woman what will happen?’ I said, ‘You just try in front of me.’ And at least twenty, thirty people were sitting there. He said, ‘Here?’ I said ‘Here. You try.’\nHe tried and he failed! He could not – he could not walk like a woman. And he looked very surprised. He said, ‘What happened?’ I said, ‘You have to understand the law of reverse effect. Now go to the university, anywhere, and consciously try to walk like a woman – because it is very difficult to walk like a woman unless you are a woman.’ And since then he has not walked like a woman. He became conscious of it. It was an unconscious mechanism. Unconsciousness was the root cause of it. Just become conscious, and it disappears.\nMan’s problems are rooted in the unconscious. And what do you go on doing? You go on repressing those problems into the unconscious. Where else will you repress them? There is nowhere else to repress them. Whenever you repress something, you repress it into the unconscious. That’s how the unconscious is created.\nI don’t have an unconscious because I never repress anything. The unconscious is created by repressions. The child does not have an unconscious. By and by he will have. And the old man has more of the unconscious than the conscious because he has been repressing his whole life.\nThe unconscious functions like a basement. Whatsoever is useless, you throw into the basement. It accumulates there. It becomes a junkyard. That is what your unconscious is. And from the unconscious, things arise and take possession of you. All the ghosts that take possession of you come from the unconscious not from the graveyards. Your unconscious is the graveyard where those ghosts are born, and whenever they can find an opportunity, an occasion, to sneak up and possess you, they will possess you. And they possess with revenge, with a vengeance.\nNow, to repress it is to help the unconscious more. That is the law of reverse effect. Your unconscious will become more and more powerful. You are feeding it and nourishing it. My whole approach is that consciousness is liberation. Awareness is the solution. Just become more conscious of whatsoever you are doing.\nOnce it happened...\nA thief came to a great Master, Nagarjuna. He had come for a certain reason.\nNagarjuna used to live naked – one of the great Indian mystics and one of the greatest alchemists. He would have been the right person to comment on THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER.\nC.G. Jung was not the right person to comment on it.\nHe came into a great capital. The queen was a follower of Nagarjuna. She came with a golden begging bowl and told Nagarjuna, ‘Give your wooden begging bowl to me. I will keep it as a treasure. And I have brought this golden begging bowl for you.’ She was afraid that maybe Nagarjuna would say, ‘I don’t touch gold, I am an ascetic.’ But Nagarjuna was an enlightened person, he said, ‘Okay.’ So he took the golden begging bowl studded with valuable diamonds.\nA thief saw Nagarjuna moving with the golden begging bowl, naked, and all those diamonds shining in the sun. He said, ‘Look! How long can this man have this? Somebody is going to take it from him. Why not me? This naked man cannot keep it long. From where did he get it?’\nSo the thief followed Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna was staying outside the capital in the ruins of an old temple where there were no doors, not even windows – nothing – just walls all falling down, just a small shelter. A little bit of roof was still safe. The thief said, ‘How will he protect his valuable thing? In the night at least he will go to sleep.’\nSo he waited outside by the side of the wall near a window. Nagarjuna wanted to have a little sleep in the afternoon – that was his habit. Seeing the thief following him, he knew perfectly well why he was following. He was not following Nagarjuna, he was following the golden bowl, so why force him to wait there? He was going to take it anyway. ‘When I fall asleep,’ thought Nagarjuna, ‘he will take it, so why force him to wait unnecessarily?’ He threw the begging bowl out of the window. The thief could not believe what was happening. But this man looked really charismatic naked, so beautiful, so divine-looking, with such a precious thing with him, and he had thrown it! Now the thief could not leave. He was so attracted by the person, so enchanted, almost hypnotized. He looked in through the window and said, ‘Sir, can I come in and have a Little chit-chat with you?’\nNagarjuna said, ‘That’s why I threw the bowl outside – so that you could come in. You would have come in when I had gone to sleep but that would have been meaningless. Come in!’ The thief came\nin and he said, ‘Looking at you, seeing that you can throw such a valuable thing away so easily – and I know why you have thrown it, you have thrown it away i-or me – a great desire has arisen in me. Will there ever be a time when I will also be so detached, so aloof, so free of possessions as you are?’ Nagarjuna said, ‘The time has come. Accidentally you are already caught. I will give you the secret of how to become transcendental to the world, how to go beyond, how not to possess.’\nThe man said, ‘But let me first tell you that I am a thief. And I have gone to many saints before, but they all say – because I am a well-known thief – they all say, “First stop stealing, only then can you meditate.” So let me tell you first. You may not know.’ Nagarjuna said, ‘Then it simply shows that you have never been to a saint up to now. They must have been ex-thieves; otherwise who cares who you are? And why make it a condition that first you have to stop stealing? I will give you the meditation. It is very simple: you go on stealing. Just do one thing: do it consciously, do it with full awareness. When you are going to steal, move fully aware, alert to what you are doing. And after fifteen days you report to me.’\nBut by the seventh day the thief was back and he said, ‘You deceived me. For seven days continuously I have not been able to steal. And it was not that I was prevented, I reach the places where great treasures are available, but I cannot do it. If I become aware, I start laughing at my foolishness. What am I doing – stealing things which will be taken away from me? Sooner or later I will have to die. The whole thing looks so childish. If I become aware, I cannot steal. If I steal, I lose my awareness. Both cannot go together.’\nNagarjuna said, ‘Then you decide. Whichever you choose, you can choose. You can drop awareness and steal or, if you want to have awareness, then drop stealing.’ And the man said, ‘I have tasted awareness. It is impossible to drop it. I will drop stealing, because awareness is far more valuable, far more significant. I have only tasted a little bit of it, but it gives such joy. And I have been stealing my whole life, and I have accumulated many valuable things in my house, but they have never given me any joy. They only give me more and more fear.’\nAwareness is the only secret key: it transforms. It doesn’t matter what your illness is, awareness is the only medicine: it cures all illness. If you are politically minded – and everybody is... In some way or other everybody is trying to be more powerful than the other. Even in relationships politics continue – the husband tries to be more powerful than the wife, the wife tries to be more powerful than the husband – hence the constant conflict, even between parents and children. Everywhere there is conflict. It is all politics, different faces of politics.\nSo when you come to me I cannot expect you to come without politics – that is impossible. If you are without politics, you will not need to come – wherever you are, God will come to you. When you come here I accept all your human weaknesses. I have no condemnation. I don’t tell you to repress; I don’t want to make you feel guilty about anything. If you want to play the game of politics you are allowed to play it – with only one condition: become more and more alert while playing it. Have a sense of humour, and then all is well. Sooner or later it will wither away of its own accord.\nAnd so is the case with sensuality, sexuality; so is the case with possessiveness; so is the case with everything that man suffers from.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nBELOVED OSHO, THIS MORNING IN THE LECTURE, I WENT SO DEEP THAT I WAS SURE THE BODY WAS GOING TO DIE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I BECAME VERY AFRAID AND STRUGGLED BACK TO THE SURFACE. NOW I AM AFRAID IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. WHAT TO DO?\nSaguna, you are a fool. You should have allowed it to happen. You missed a great opportunity. If at any time you again start feeling that you are dying in my presence, die immediately! That means your ego was on the verge of disappearing and something tremendously valuable was about to happen. You missed it.\nBut the first time it happens that way to everybody. One shrinks back in fear, escapes back into his ego, clings, holds. Where can you find a better place to die? If you can die in my presence you will attain to life, eternal life, life abundant. If you can die in satsang, in the presence of the Master, you will be resurrected.\nBut that courage has to be there. Gather your courage, and next time it starts happening, let it happen.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nIS PSYCHOANALYSIS REALLY THAT USELESS?\nNo, not always. Sometimes it helps too. Meditate on this story.\nFelix Simons was a nice guy but a social flop. Although he was thirty-five, he had never conquered his childhood habit of bedwetting. Finally, one of his friends told him, ‘Look, Felix, you might as well know the truth. We’re all very fond of you, but nobody can stand to come into your house because it smells, and you’re driving your wife up a wall. Why don’t you see a psychiatrist about your problem? Enuresis is not too uncommon and it can be cured. Get it over with once and for all!’\nFelix was convinced. After six months of treatment he ran into the same friend. ‘Well, Felix, did you take my advice?’\n‘Yes,’ answered Felix, ‘I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist three times a week for six months now.’ ‘Well, have you had any results?’\n‘Oh,’ beamed Felix, ‘great results!’ ‘You don’t wet your bed anymore?’\n‘I still do, but now I’m proud of it!’\nPsychoanalysis helps only in this way. It makes you proud of things you have been guilty about. Religion has created guilt in people. Psychoanalysis has moved to the other extreme – psychoanalysis is a reaction to religious guilt. This has to be understood.\nReligion has done a great wrong to humanity. It has wounded the human heart by creating guilt. It lives on guilt – the whole religious world. Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, these are only different names for the same trick – how to create guilt in people. Once you have created guilt in people, they are caught in your net; you can exploit them. Guilt is the spider’s net. Make people feel guilty and they are in your power. Then you can manipulate them. You can force them to surrender. You can force them to do things for you, for the church, for the priest. They are guilty. They are afraid they are going to suffer, they want to find a way out.\nFirst create guilt, then they are bound to come to you, because they will have to find a way out of guilt. Then tell them to pray, then tell them to do some ritual, some mantra. But first the guilt has to be created.\nI have heard...\nTwo persons were doing great business. They were partners. The business was simple. One would enter a town in the night and throw coal tar on people windows, and after two, three days, the other would come to clean. And he would make it known in the town that he knew how to clean coal tar from the windows. By the time he had cleaned the windows, the other would have prepared another town for him. Then he would go to the other town. They were doing really great business. They were partners.\nReligion depends on creating guilt. First throw coal tar on people’s hearts and then tell them how to cleanse it. And then they have to pay for it.\nPsychoanalysis is a reaction. I don’t call it a revolution but only a reaction. It reacted against this whole business and it started doing the opposite: it makes you proud of your things. It says, ‘This is perfectly normal. If you are wetting your bed this is perfectly normal. There is nothing wrong in it. You should be really proud of it.’ It gives support to you as you are.\nReligion condemns you as you are. Psychoanalysis convinces you that you are the only way you can be, and you are perfectly right, you are okay. That is the message of psychoanalysis. Both are wrong. Neither do you need to feel guilty nor do you need to feel perfectly okay. If you feel guilty you will fall victim to the church, to the priest, and they will exploit you. If you start feeling you are perfectly okay, you become dormant; your growth stops.\nYou have to know one thing: that life means evolution, growth, life means going higher and higher – to new planitudes, to new planes of being. There is no need to feel guilty for what you are, but there is every need to have a tremendous longing to rise higher, because you are a seed, a potential, and you can become God. If you accept yourself as you are and you settle with it, you will remain a seed. You will never become a tree and you will never be able to have a dialogue with the stars. You will not be able to play with the wind and the rain and the sun. You will remain shrunk into a seed. But\nthere is no need to feel guilty. A seed is a seed – there is no need to feel guilty – but the seed has to become a tree. There is really a great need to inquire into one’s potential. Never feel guilty, never feel proud. Just feel tremendously happy that a great opportunity has been given to you to grow.\nAnd this whole life is a challenge to growth. That is true religion and that is true psychology too – because a true religion cannot be anything other than a true psychology. I call that psychology ‘the psychology of the Buddhas’. It does not make you feel guilty; it accepts you, it loves you, but it doesn’t make you feel proud to be as you are. It gives you a great challenge to be more than you are. It gives you a divine discontent. It makes you aflame with a desire to go higher and higher – not higher than others, but higher than yourself. Tomorrow should not be just a repetition of today – that is the meaning of divine discontent. Today should not be just a repetition of yesterday, otherwise you have not lived. Today must bring some new gifts to you, some new flowers, some new rays. Some new windows MUST open today.\nTo feel guilty means to remain possessed by the past; to feel proud means to remain wherever you are, whatsoever you are. To have a divine discontent means to grow, to search, to seek, to explore. And life is nothing but an adventure, a constant adventure, into the unknown.\nSo I don’t want you to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel proud. When you drop both, real life begins.\nAnd the last question:\nQuestion 7\nWHY IS COMMUNICATION SO DIFFICULT?\nIt is not only difficult, it is impossible. It is really a miracle if sometimes it happens, because two persons are two persons. Their past experiences are different, their gestalt is different, their knowledge is different, their personalities are different. They are two worlds. They speak different languages; it may be the same language, but they speak different languages. They give different meaning to words, different nuances, different shades and different colours.\nWhen you are looking at a rose flower and if there are five persons looking at the rose flower, don’t think for a single moment that you are looking at the same rose flower – you cannot; only five Buddhas standing beside the flower will be able to look at the same rose flower. You cannot, because five Buddhas means five zeros, five no-minds. Only two no-minds can commune because there is nothing to hinder now, nothing to interpret with. It is direct.\nBut when five minds are standing beside the rose flower they only believe that they are looking at the same rose flower, because they have different ideas of the rose, different experiences of the rose, different past impacts of the rose. All that is there in their eyes, layer upon layer. This rose is so far away, so distant.\nFor example, one may have loved a woman who was obsessed by roses, but she betrayed him. Now the rose will only remind him of that betrayal and the woman. That is not the others’ experience. The other may have seen a dead man garlanded with a rose garland. The rose will remind him of\ndeath – he may feel a little fear. The third may have his own experience of the rose. It will depend. And that’s how it is with each experience .\nOnly two no-minds can communicate. Even without words, communication happens. It is a communion. But minds are bound to clash, conflict.\nI will tell you a few stories. First:\nSeated in an elegantly appointed restaurant, Chico Marx was studying the oversized menu when the head waiter approached his table. The waiter folded his hands in front of him and with proper Continental demeanour enquired, ‘And what is your pleasure, Monsieur?’\n‘Girls,’ Chico replied. ‘What’s yours?’ The second story:\nThe young husband and his bride flew to Miami for their honeymoon and for days neither hide nor hair was seen of them. On the morning of the sixth day, they entered the dining-room for breakfast. As the waiter approached them for their order the bride turned to her husband and said coyly, ‘You know what I’d like, honey, don’t you?’\n‘Yes, I know,’ he replied wearily, ‘but we have got to eat some time too!’ And the third story:\nThe boss had been after his secretary for almost a year. He had been suggesting all kinds of things to her. On this particular evening he was unusually persistent.\n‘Oh, come on!’ he said. ‘Let’s go out and have supper, then go to the theatre, then to a nightclub and then we will go up to my apartment.’\nThe blond clipped back, ‘I would like you to comprehend that I am adamant and didactic in my refusal of your salacious, mendacious and denigrating proposition.’\nThe boss said, ‘I don’t get it.’\nThe secretary answered, ‘That’s just what I have been trying to tell you.’\nLanguage is the problem. Different experiences, different minds, different pasts, different patterns, different habits, different personalities.\nYou ask me why it is difficult to communicate. It is not only difficult, it is almost impossible. If once in a while it happens, feel tremendously fortunate. Yes, once in a while it happens. When you are deeply in love with somebody, it happens. Then language is not needed, then your very presence, your very vibe communicates. Then, for a moment, in deep love, you slip out of your minds. In deep love, for a moment you become Buddhas, you become no-minds.\nSo only in rare moments of love does communication happen, otherwise it is always a quarrel, a subtle conflict. You say one thing, the other understands something else. The other says something, you understand something else. If you really want to communicate, become more and more loving – because love is needed, not language. Language is a barrier, love is a bridge.\nIf you really want to communicate, start slipping out of your mind. Become more and more zeros, no-minds, and suddenly you will see miracles happening.\nIt is happening here. The new people who come here are not in tune with me. For a few days I say something, they understand something else. But as they become more and more open to my love, communication starts happening. To those who have really lived long with me and have become intimate, to those with whom the barrier of language has disappeared, just a look in their eyes or just a touch of my hand, and there is communication – not only communication, but communion.\nThat’s why just recently I have started a new way of communing with my sannyasins: just to touch them, just to let them feel my energy. The more you become intimate with me, the less and less words will be needed – because you will start hearing me, and then there will be no need of words. I will continue to speak for those who will be coming – more and more will be coming, thousands are on the way – but those who have been here with me long enough or deep enough... And depth can happen even in a single moment. It is not only a question of time, it is a question of intensity.\nSometimes it happens that when a person comes to me for the first time, the first moment of contact, and he becomes intimate as if he has been with me for many lives. And not only do I feel that, he also immediately feels that he has come home, that this is the place he has been searching for his whole life or for many lives. Then communication immediately happens, then there is no conflict.\nIn fact, the moment that there is communion and there is no conflict is the moment of your real initiation. Then what I say is secondary, what I am becomes primary. Then you relate to me directly. Then you are not distracted by my words – because I am not a consistent man, I contradict myself. And I contradict myself deliberately to help you to get rid of your expectation of consistency, to help you to get rid of language. Listening to me contradicting myself again and again, slowly slowly you will see that words are only games; you will not be serious about words. The day that awakening has happened in you, you relate to me directly. Then there is no medium needed; then you are bridged.\nI am in love, I am love. The moment you are in love and you become love, communion happens. Communion is a function of love, not of language. In fact, language functions as a hindrance, not as a help.\nRemember it: to be with me is to be with an emptiness, a nobody. I have nothing to offer to you, I have nothing to teach you, I have no philosophy. I am, but I have no philosophy. I am, but I have nothing to offer. I am, but I have nothing to teach. And you have to learn to be with this l-amness. And then you will know what communion is.\nCommunion is a phenomenon of love, a flowering of love. It has nothing to do with language, with words – not at all; it is silence.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9556","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_1/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_secret_of_secrets_vol_1/>The Secret of Secrets, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">12 To Create a Balance</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9556 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Secret_of_Secrets_Vol_1/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I apologize – because dogs are so innocent. It is not
fair at all. The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS NEUROSIS AND WHAT IS THE CURE FOR IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Neurosis has never been so epidemic in the past as it is now. It is
almost becoming a normal state of human mind. It has to be
understood.</p><p><br></p><p>The past was spiritually more healthy, and the reason was that mind
was not fed so many things simultaneously; the mind was not overloaded.
The modern mind is overloaded, and that which remains unassimilated
creates neurosis. It is as if you go on eating and stuffing your body.
That which is not digested by the body will prove to be poisonous. And
what you eat is less important than what you hear and see. From your
eyes, from your ears, from all your senses, you go on receiving a
thousand and one things each moment. And there is no extra assimilation
time. It is as if one were constantly sitting at the dining table,
eating, eating, twenty-four hours a day.</p><p>This is the situation of the modern mind: it is overloaded; so many
things are burdening it. It is not any surprise that it breaks down.
There is a limit to every mechanism. And mind is one of the most subtle
and delicate of mechanisms.</p><p><br></p><p>A really healthy person is one who takes fifty percent of his time to
assimilate his experiences. Fifty percent action, fifty percent inaction
– that is the right balance. Fifty percent thinking, fifty percent
meditation – that is the cure.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is nothing but a time when you can relax utterly into
yourself, when you close all your doors, all your senses, to the outside
stimulus. You disappear from the world. You forget the world as if it
exists no more – no newspapers, no radio, no television, no people. You
are alone in your innermost being, relaxed, at home.</p><p><br></p><p>In these moments, all that has become accumulated is assimilated.
That which is worthless is thrown out. Meditation functions like a
double-edged sword: on the one hand it assimilates all that is
nourishing, and it rejects and throws out all that is junk.</p><p><br></p><p>But meditation has disappeared from the world. In the old days,
people were naturally meditative. Life was uncomplicated, and people had
enough time just to sit and do nothing, or look at the stars, or watch
the trees, or listen to the birds. People had intervals of deep
passivity. In those moments you become more and more healthy and
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Neurosis means you are carrying such a load in the mind that you are
dying under it. You cannot move. There is no question of your
consciousness flying. You cannot even creep – the burden is too much.
And the burden goes on increasing every moment. One cracks up. It is
very natural.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things to be understood. Neurosis is the mouse endlessly trying
the dead end, not learning. Yes, not learning is neurosis – that is the
first definition. You go on trying the dead end.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been angry. How many times have you been angry? And how many
times have you repented of being angry? Still, let there be a stimulus
and your reaction will again be the same. You have not learned a thing.
You have been greedy and greed has created more and more misery. You
know it – greed has never given anybody blissfulness – but you are still
greedy, you still go on being greedy. You don’t learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Non-learning creates neurosis, is neurosis.</p><p><br></p><p>Learning means assimilation. You try one thing and then you find that
it doesn’t work. You drop it. You move in another direction, you try
another alternative. This is wise, this is intelligent. Just knocking
your head against a wall where you know perfectly well there is no door
is neurosis.</p><p><br></p><p>People are getting more and more neurotic because they go on trying
the dead end, they go on trying that which doesn’t work. The man who is
capable of learning never becomes neurotic – cannot become. He
immediately sees the point that this is a wall. He drops the whole idea.
He starts moving into other dimensions. There are other alternatives
available. He has learned something.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of Edison that he was trying one experiment in which he
failed seven hundred times. His colleagues became desperate. Three years
were wasted and he went on trying new alternatives</p><p>again and again. And every morning he came with great enthusiasm –
the same enthusiasm that he had come with on the first day. And three
years were wasted.</p><p><br></p><p>One day his colleagues gathered together and they said to him, ‘We
don’t see the point. We have failed seven hundred times. It is time to
drop the experimentation.’ Edison is reported to have said, ‘What are
you saying – failed? We have learned that seven hundred alternatives
were wrong alternatives. It has been a great experience! Today I am not
going to try the same experiment, I have found another one. We are
coming closer to the truth. How many false alternatives can there be?
There must be a limit. If there are one thousand false alternatives,
then seven hundred have already been dropped and only three hundred are
left. And then we will be reaching the right point.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is learning. Trying one experiment, seeing that it doesn’t work,
trying an alternative, seeing that it doesn’t work, the wise man drops
it. The fool clings to it. The fool calls it consistency. The fool says,
‘I did it yesterday and I am going to do it today, too. And I will do it
tomorrow.’ He is stubborn, pig-headed. He says, ‘How can I leave it? I
have invested so much in it. I cannot change it.’ Then he goes on
insisting on it and his whole life is wasted. And as death comes closer,
he is desperate, he is hopeless. Deep down in his guts he knows
perfectly well that he is going to fail. He has failed so many times and
he is still trying the same thing without learning anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>This creates neurosis. The man who is capable of learning will never
become neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple will never become neurotic. A disciple means one who is
capable of learning. Never become knowledgeable; always be in the
process of learning.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledgeability drives people neurotic. It is not just accidental
that professors, philosophers, psychiatrists, scholars, easily go mad.
They have learned and they have reached the conclusion that there is no
more to learn. The moment you decide that there is no more to learn, you
have stopped growing. To stop growing is neurosis – that is the second
definition.</p><p><br></p><p>The world was very different in the past, obviously. About six weeks’
worth of sensory stimuli six hundred years ago is what we now get in a
day. Six weeks’ worth of stimulation, information, we are getting in a
single day – about forty times the pressure to learn and adapt. Modern
man has to be capable of learning more than man has ever been before,
because there is more to learn now. Modern man has to become capable of
adapting to new situations every day because the world is changing so
fast. It is a great challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>A great challenge, if accepted, will help tremendously in the
expansiOn of consciousness. Either modern man is going to be utterly
neurotic or modern man is going to be transformed by the very pressure.
It depends on how you take it. One thing is certain: there is no way of
going back. The sensory stimuli will go on increasing more and more. You
will be getting more and more information and life will be changing,
with faster and faster rhythms. And you will have to be capable of
learning, of adapting, to new things.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past man lived in an almost static world. Everything was
static. You would leave the world exactly as your father had left it to
you. You would not have changed anything at all. Nothing was changed.
There was no question of learning too much. A little bit of learning was
enough. And then you had spaces in your mind, empty spaces, which helped
people to remain sane. Now there is no more empty space, unless you
create it deliberately.</p><p>Meditation is needed today more than ever before. Meditation is
needed so much that it is almost a question of life and death. In the
past it was a luxury; few people – a Buddha, a Mahavira, a Krishna –
were interested in it. Other people were naturally silent, naturally
happy, sane. There was no need for them to think of meditation; in an
unconscious way they were meditating. Life was moving so silently,
moving so slowly, that even the most stupid people were capable of
adapting to it. Now the change is so tremendously fast, with such speed,
that even the most intelligent people feel incapable of adapting to it.
Every day life is different, and you have to learn again – you have to
learn and learn again and again. You can never stop learning now; it has
to be a life-long process. To the very point of death you will have to
remain a learner, only then can you remain sane, can you avoid neurosis.
And the pressure is great – forty times greater.</p><p><br></p><p>How to relax this pressure? You will have to go deliberately into
meditative moments. If a person is not meditating at least one hour a
day, then neurosis will not be accidental, he will create it
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>For one hour he should disappear from the world into his own being.
For one hour he should be so alone that nothing penetrates him – no
memory, no thought, no imagination; for one hour no content in his
consciousness, and that will rejuvenate him and that will refresh him.
That will release new sources of energy in him and he will be back in
the world, younger, fresher, more able to learn, with more wonder in his
eyes, with more awe in his heart – again a child.</p><p><br></p><p>This pressure to learn, and the old habit of not learning, is driving
people crazy. The modern mind is really super-loaded, and no time is
given to digest it, to assimilate it into one’s own being. That is where
meditation comes in and becomes more significant than ever. Without
giving time for the mind to rest in meditation we repress all of the
messages that are pouring in continuously. We refuse to learn – we say
we have not got time. Then the messages begin to accumulate. If you
don’t have time enough to listen to the messages that your mind is
receiving continuously, they start accumulating – just like files
accumulating on your table, piles of letters accumulating on your table,
because you have not time enough to read and answer them. Exactly like
that your mind becomes cluttered – so many files waiting to be looked
into, so many letters to be read, to be answered, so many challenges to
be taken, to be faced.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was saying one day, ‘If something wrong happens today,
I will not have time for at least three months to look into it. So many
wrong things have already happened which are waiting there. If something
wrong happens today,’ he said, ‘I will not have time to look into it for
three months at least.’</p><p><br></p><p>A queue. You can see that queue inside yourself – and the queue goes
on growing. And the bigger the queue, the less and less space you have;
the bigger the queue, the more and more noise inside – because
everything that you have accumulated demands your attention.</p><p><br></p><p>This usually starts at about the age of five when real learning
virtually stops, and this lasts until death. In the old days it was
okay. Five or seven years were enough to learn all that you would need
in your life; that would do. Seven years’ learning would do for seventy
years of life. But now that is not possible. You cannot stop learning
because new things are always happening and you cannot face those new
things with old ideas. You cannot depend on your parents and their
knowledge, you</p><p>cannot even depend on your teachers in the school and the university,
because what they are talking about is already out of date. Much more
has happened. Much water has gone down the Ganges.</p><p><br></p><p>This was my experience. When I was a student I was surprised at my
professors’ knowledge because it was thirty years old. It was when they
were young that they had gathered it from their teachers. Since then
they had not looked at what had happened That knowledge was absolutely
useless. I was constantly in conflict with my professors, I was thrown
out of many colleges, expelled, because the professors said that they
could not cope with me. And I was not creating any trouble, I was simply
making them aware that what they were saying was out of date. But that
hurts the ego. They had learned it in their own university days and they
were thinking that the world had stopped then and there.</p><p><br></p><p>Now students cannot depend on teachers and children cannot depend on
their parents, hence a great rebellion is on the way all over the world.
It has nothing to do with anything else. Students cannot respect their
teachers anymore unless those teachers continuously learn. They cannot
be respected. For what? There is no reason. And children cannot respect
their parents because the approach of their parents looks very
primitive. Small children are becoming aware that what their parents say
is out of date. Parents will have to continuously learn if they want to
help their children to grow and teachers will have to continuously
learn. Now no one can stop learning. And this speed is going to grow
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>So, one thing: learning has not to be stopped, otherwise you will go
neurotic; because to stop learning means you are accumulating
information which you have not assimilated, digested, which has not
become your blood and your bones and your marrow. It will hang around
you with great insistence to be taken in.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly: you will need time to relax. This pressure is too much. You
will need some time to disappear from this pressure. Sleep cannot help
you anymore because sleep itself is becoming overburdened. Your day is
so overloaded that when you go to sleep only the body falls limp on the
bed, but the mind continues to sort things out. That’s what you call
dreaming: it is nothing but a desperate effort of the mind to sort
things out because you won’t give any time to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to relax consciously into meditation. A few minutes of deep
meditation will keep you non-neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation the mind unclutters, experiences are digested, and the
overload disappears, leaving the mind fresh and young and clear and
clean.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past the input volume was one-tenth of one’s time and the
meditative time was nine-tenths. Now just the reverse is the case:
nine-tenths input volume time and one-tenth meditative time. Very rarely
do you relax. Very rarely do you just sit silently, doing nothing. Even
that one-tenth time of unconscious meditation is disappearing. Once that
happens, man will be utterly mad. And that is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>What do I mean by unconscious meditative time? You simply go into the
garden, you play around with your children – that is unconscious
meditative time. Or you swim in the swimming pool – that is unconscious
meditative time. Or you mow your lawn, or you listen to the birds – that
is unconscious</p><p>meditative time. That too is disappearing because whenever people
have time, they are sitting before their TVs, glued to their seats.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, tremendously dangerous information is being put into your mind
by the TV. You will not be able to digest it. Or you are reading
newspapers. All kinds of nonsense is being fed to you. Whenever you have
time you put the radio or the TV on. Or someday you are feeling very
good and you want to relax and you go to the movie. What kind of
relaxation is this? The movie will not allow you relaxation, because
information is continuously thrown into you.</p><p><br></p><p>Relaxation means no information is thrown into you. Listening to a
cuckoo will do, because no information is fed to you. Listening to music
will do, because no information is thrown into you. Music has no
language; it is pure sound. It does not give any message; it simply
delights you. Dancing will be good, music will be good, working in the
garden will be good, playing with children will be good, or just sitting
doing nothing will be good. This is the cure. And if you do it
consciously, the impact will be greater.</p><p><br></p><p>Create a balance. Neurosis is an unbalanced state of mind: too much
activity and no inactivity at all, too much masculine and no feminine at
all, too much yang and too little of yin. And you have to be
fifty-fifty. You have to keep a deep balance. A symmetry is needed
inside you. You have to be an ARDHANA-RISHWAR, half man, half woman,
then you will never go neurotic.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the whole process of the book, THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN
FLOWER. It will make you disappear as man, as woman; it will make you
one whole, one unity; it will give you individuation.</p><p><br></p><p>Individuality is neither male nor female, it is simple unity. Strive
to achieve it between time spent doing versus time spent not doing. This
is wholeness. This is what Buddha called his Middle Way, MAJJHIM NIKAYA.
Just be exactly in the middle. And remember, you can become unbalanced
to the other extreme too; you can become too inactive. That will be
dangerous also. That has its own pitfalls and dangers. If you become too
inactive, your life loses dance, your life loses joy, you start becoming
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not saying become inactive, I am saying let there be a
balance between action and inaction. Let them balance each other and you
be just in the middle. Let them be two wings of your being. No wing
should be bigger than the other.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, action has become too great; inaction has disappeared.
In the East, inaction became too great and action disappeared. The West
knows affluence, richness, on the outside and poverty inside; the East
knows richness, affluence, inside and poverty on the outside. Both are
in misery because both have chosen extremes.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is neither Eastern nor Western, my approach is neither
male nor female, my approach is neither of action nor inactiOn, my
approach is that of utter balance, symmetry, in you. Hence I say to my
sannyasins: Don’t leave the world. Be in the world and yet be not of it.
This is what Taoists call WEI WU WEI, action through inaction – the
meeting of yin and yang, anima and animus; it brings enlightenment.
Imbalance is neurosis; balance is enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>ARE ALL WOMEN REALLY SOFT, FEMININE AND LOVING?</p><p><br></p><p>I have not said that – that all women are really soft, feminine and
loving. Neither are all men aggressive, violent, ambitious, hard.
Because deep down in you the consciousness is neither. The anima and the
animus, the male and the female exist in your body chemistry. You can be
a man physically, but deep inside you may have chosen the feminine part.
A woman may be a woman physically but she may have chosen the masculine
part – both parts are available – then the body remains feminine but the
woman will become masculine.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what is happening to women connected with the Women’s
Liberation movement: they are dropping their feminineness, they are
becoming as aggressive as man. They are trying to compete with all kinds
of foolishnesses that man has. They want to have all those foolishnesses
themselves, too – they cannot be left behind.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of being equal is creating a foolish idea of being similar.
To be equal does not mean to be similar. Equality is a totally different
dimension; similarity is different.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a woman can choose her masculine part too much, she can become
identified with it, then her softness will disappear. A man can choose
his feminineness, then his hardness will disappear. The body will remain
sexually male or female, but the quality surrounding the body, the vibe,
will have to be that which you have chosen inside. A man can choose to
be a woman inside, a woman can choose to be a man inside.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not a choice that you make once and forever, you can change
it every moment. There are moments when a woman is very soft and there
are moments when she can be very hard, very cruel. There are moments
when a man is very hard, aggressive, but there are moments when he can
be very soft. Even a Ghengis Khan is very soft to his children. To his
wife he is very soft.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>The plain and strongly-built daughter of a Field-Marshal was engaged
to be married to a young officer on her father’s staff. ‘Couldn’t you do
something for Frank now that he has asked me to marry him?’ she asked
her father one day.</p><p><br></p><p>‘There’s not much I can do really,’ replied the Field-Marshal,
‘except get him a medal for gallantry.’ He was undersized, meek,
diffident, and subdued, and he had applied for a job as a
night-watchman.</p><p>‘Yes,’ said the manager, dubiously, ‘but the fact is we want someone
who is restless and uneasy, especially at night – someone who thinks the
worst of everybody, someone who sleeps with one eye open. The kind of
person, in short, who, when roused, is the devil himself.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Alright,’ said the meek lad, as he walked away, ‘I’ll send my
wife.’</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on what you choose inside you. It is a choice. The body is
not your choice, but the vibe that will surround your body is a choice.
And if you choose consciously, you will have great freedom in your
being, because you will know who you are and what you are doing with
your body.</p><p>The body is tremendously potential – much can happen through it – but
people take it for granted. It is as if a beautiful guitar has been
given to you as a present and you just keep it, not knowing the
potential of it. You can play on the guitar, you can learn to play on
the guitar, and great music will be born. And then it depends on you
what kind of music it will be. You can create a music which is sad, you
can create a music which is celebrating, you can create music which is
violent, you can create a music which is soothing, loving, silent.</p><p><br></p><p>There are kinds of music. Classical music has a different quality: it
soothes, it brings you to a silence, rest. Modern pop music makes you
restless, sexual; it drives you into a kind of frenzy. But the
instruments are the same – as are bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>A really wise person chooses to play what kind of music he wants to
play on the body. You can make your body like a Buddha or you can become
a Mohammed Ali. It depends on you. Look at Buddha’s body – how soft,
although he is a man; how feminine, although he is a man. He has chosen
grace.</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you. It is your choice. You are not confined by your
chemistry. You can be confined only if you remain unconscious in your
chemistry, otherwise your chemistry has infinite potential: it can be
put to a thousand and one uses. And to learn how to use one’s body, how
to behave with one’s body, how to relate with one’s body, is a great
art. Millions of people just take their body for granted; they never
search for its possibilities. Their body remains a seed. It never
becomes a Golden Flower.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR DISCOURSE ON POLITICS AND THE POISON IT IS WAS EXTRAORDINARY! I
HAVE LIVED IN MANY COMMUNITIES, ALL SINCERE AND WELL-MEANING, YET
EVERYWHERE I WAS APPALLED AT THE UNCONSCIOUS POLITICAL AMBITION AND
INTRIGUES WHICH ARE UNDERLYING AND DORMANT BUT COME UP IN SPITE OF THE
GOOD INTENTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW ARE YOU HANDLING IT HERE? ARE YOU ALLOWING IT FREE PLAY SO THAT
PEOPLE CAN WORK IT OUT OF THEIR SYSTEMS – OR ARE YOU NIPPING IT IN THE
BUD AND WEEDING OUT THOSE THAT SHOW THE SLIGHTEST TENDENCIES?</p><p><br></p><p>MY HUMBLE EXPERIENCE IS THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN NEVER, NEVER GET
ANYTHING GOING WITHOUT POLITICS – WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES HIGHER AND
HIGHER IN THE POWER GAME. THEY ARE ALL OVER – PERHAPS EVEN HERE –
SPREADING THEIR POISON.</p><p><br></p><p>Stilwell, I don’t believe in repressing anything – not even the
poisonous politics – because repressed, it remains in your system;
sooner or later it will take you over. And the longer it has been
repressed, the more dangerous it becomes, because the deeper it goes
into your very source of being. And if you are poisoned at your very
source, at the very centre, then it becomes really difficult to uproot
it.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach about everything is to bring it to the surface. So I
never nip anything in the bud, I help it to become a flower. And after
the flowering, the flower starts withering of its own accord. That’s the
natural way.</p><p>So in my commune, nothing is prevented. Ambitions are allowed,
accepted, as being part of human beings, their ignorance, their
unawareness. But I make my people aware that these are games. So play
them, but play consciously. Become more and more alert and never let
them become serious. If they don’t become serious, there is no need to
become afraid of them. The problem is that when a game becomes so
serious then you forget completely that it is a game.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s where the politician is lost. He thinks he is doing something
very serious. He is doing something very silly, but he thinks he is
doing something very serious. All that is needed is to make him aware
that this is a game. If you want to play it, play, but don’t become so
serious about it. Keep a little bit of humour. A sense of humour is one
of the greatest keys to transform human personalities.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you are right! Here also – because these people come from the
world and they bring all kinds of infections from the world. They are
not coming here fresh, they have been already conditioned. Ambition has
already been put into them – their parents, the society, church, school,
college, university. Everywhere they have been poisoned; they bring all
that poison here. You cannot nip it in the bud otherwise they will
become split and hypocritical. Then on the surface they will show
humility, humbleness, and deep down they will think, ‘There is nobody
more humble than me’ – and politics has come in. Deep down they will
think, ‘I am the greatest egoless person in the world’ – but the
‘greatest’.</p><p><br></p><p>Now a new kind of ambition has entered. It is the same ambition, now
the direction is new. And it is more subtle, and, of course, more
dangerous too. And now it is pious, because it is in the name of
religion. So even the poison no longer looks like poison; it is labelled
nectar. It is religious poison, pious poison, and it is more difficult
to get rid of the pious poison.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t repress anything and I don’t help any kind of repression,
I help people to bring whatsoever they have in them to the surface. I
help them to be aware of it, to watch it, to see the foolishness of it,
to see the stupidity of it – not because I say it is stupid, because if
I say something and you only believe it, you will repress it. I help you
– my function here is to help you become aware on your own. The day you
see the stupidity of it, it will drop of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>So I have created all kinds of games here. Yes, there is a hierarchy
too so people who want to play, they can play the game of hierarchy. But
sooner or later – because the whole effort is to make them conscious –
they become aware that this is a game. And the moment THEY see it is a
game, they are out of it. Seeing something as a game makes you laugh at
it – a hearty laugh at your own self. And when a man can laugh at his
own stupidities he is becoming wise. Laughter has to come out of
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Ambitious people also laugh. Just the other day I was reading that
when Jimmy Carter came to power he was laughing so beautifully that you
could have counted his teeth. And some people have counted – eleven
teeth were showing. Now only seven are showing. Now the smile is
disappearing because his prestige is falling every day. People’s
expectations are not fulfilled: what he has promised he cannot deliver.
Only seven! Soon you will see five, three, two. By the time he goes, the
smile will have disappeared completely. You will not see a single tooth.
This is not real laughter. Even this laughter is political, managed,
practised, cultivated.</p><p>There is a different kind of laughter that comes to you when you see
all kinds of foolishnesses that you have been in – and how seriously.
When you see the whole ridiculousness of your life pattern, your whole
gestalt and its stupidity – but not because I say or Buddha says or
Master Lu-tsu says... It is not a question of belief, it is not a
question of somebody else’s belief, it is not a question of somebody
else’s knowledge and you borrow it – borrowed knowledge never helps – it
has to arise in you.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here is to make you aware of all that is hidden in you. All
that you have been doing unconsciously has to be done consciously,
that’s all. And sometimes miracles happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a professor came to me. His problem, and it was really a
problem, because to be a professor and have such a problem is really
difficult – his problem was that he walked like a woman. So whenever he
passed by students would come and laugh and giggle and he felt really
bad. What to do about it? And he had been to the doctors and the
psychoanalysts and they could not help. They said, ‘What can we do?’
From his very childhood he had been walking that way. And he tried not
to walk like that, and the more he tried, the more he failed.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a certain law – hypnotists call it the law of reverse
effect. You try hard to do something and just the opposite happens.</p><p><br></p><p>So he was trying hard. His whole effort, his whole mind was concerned
with not walking like a woman, but he was walking like a woman more and
more. I told him, ‘Just do one thing – because it is a miracle that you
can walk like a woman, it is really a miracle.’ He said, ‘What are you
saying?’ I said, ‘It is a miracle! A woman can walk that way because of
a different musculature. Because of the womb she walks in a certain way.
No man can walk like that. You are unique!’ He said, ‘What are you
saying? And everybody is laughing at me.’ I said, ‘You are really
unique. You have done something miraculous. It is magical. You forget
all about it. My suggestion is that you start walking consciously like a
woman. Make it a point to walk like a woman.’ He said, ‘What are you
suggesting? I have tried my whole life not to walk like a woman, then
too I walk like a woman. And if I start walking like a woman what will
happen?’ I said, ‘You just try in front of me.’ And at least twenty,
thirty people were sitting there. He said, ‘Here?’ I said ‘Here. You
try.’</p><p><br></p><p>He tried and he failed! He could not – he could not walk like a
woman. And he looked very surprised. He said, ‘What happened?’ I said,
‘You have to understand the law of reverse effect. Now go to the
university, anywhere, and consciously try to walk like a woman – because
it is very difficult to walk like a woman unless you are a woman.’ And
since then he has not walked like a woman. He became conscious of it. It
was an unconscious mechanism. Unconsciousness was the root cause of it.
Just become conscious, and it disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s problems are rooted in the unconscious. And what do you go on
doing? You go on repressing those problems into the unconscious. Where
else will you repress them? There is nowhere else to repress them.
Whenever you repress something, you repress it into the unconscious.
That’s how the unconscious is created.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have an unconscious because I never repress anything. The
unconscious is created by repressions. The child does not have an
unconscious. By and by he will have. And the old man has more of the
unconscious than the conscious because he has been repressing his whole
life.</p><p>The unconscious functions like a basement. Whatsoever is useless, you
throw into the basement. It accumulates there. It becomes a junkyard.
That is what your unconscious is. And from the unconscious, things arise
and take possession of you. All the ghosts that take possession of you
come from the unconscious not from the graveyards. Your unconscious is
the graveyard where those ghosts are born, and whenever they can find an
opportunity, an occasion, to sneak up and possess you, they will possess
you. And they possess with revenge, with a vengeance.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, to repress it is to help the unconscious more. That is the law
of reverse effect. Your unconscious will become more and more powerful.
You are feeding it and nourishing it. My whole approach is that
consciousness is liberation. Awareness is the solution. Just become more
conscious of whatsoever you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened...</p><p><br></p><p>A thief came to a great Master, Nagarjuna. He had come for a certain
reason.</p><p><br></p><p>Nagarjuna used to live naked – one of the great Indian mystics and
one of the greatest alchemists. He would have been the right person to
comment on THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER.</p><p>C.G. Jung was not the right person to comment on it.</p><p><br></p><p>He came into a great capital. The queen was a follower of Nagarjuna.
She came with a golden begging bowl and told Nagarjuna, ‘Give your
wooden begging bowl to me. I will keep it as a treasure. And I have
brought this golden begging bowl for you.’ She was afraid that maybe
Nagarjuna would say, ‘I don’t touch gold, I am an ascetic.’ But
Nagarjuna was an enlightened person, he said, ‘Okay.’ So he took the
golden begging bowl studded with valuable diamonds.</p><p><br></p><p>A thief saw Nagarjuna moving with the golden begging bowl, naked, and
all those diamonds shining in the sun. He said, ‘Look! How long can this
man have this? Somebody is going to take it from him. Why not me? This
naked man cannot keep it long. From where did he get it?’</p><p><br></p><p>So the thief followed Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna was staying outside the
capital in the ruins of an old temple where there were no doors, not
even windows – nothing – just walls all falling down, just a small
shelter. A little bit of roof was still safe. The thief said, ‘How will
he protect his valuable thing? In the night at least he will go to
sleep.’</p><p><br></p><p>So he waited outside by the side of the wall near a window. Nagarjuna
wanted to have a little sleep in the afternoon – that was his habit.
Seeing the thief following him, he knew perfectly well why he was
following. He was not following Nagarjuna, he was following the golden
bowl, so why force him to wait there? He was going to take it anyway.
‘When I fall asleep,’ thought Nagarjuna, ‘he will take it, so why force
him to wait unnecessarily?’ He threw the begging bowl out of the window.
The thief could not believe what was happening. But this man looked
really charismatic naked, so beautiful, so divine-looking, with such a
precious thing with him, and he had thrown it! Now the thief could not
leave. He was so attracted by the person, so enchanted, almost
hypnotized. He looked in through the window and said, ‘Sir, can I come
in and have a Little chit-chat with you?’</p><p><br></p><p>Nagarjuna said, ‘That’s why I threw the bowl outside – so that you
could come in. You would have come in when I had gone to sleep but that
would have been meaningless. Come in!’ The thief came</p><p>in and he said, ‘Looking at you, seeing that you can throw such a
valuable thing away so easily – and I know why you have thrown it, you
have thrown it away i-or me – a great desire has arisen in me. Will
there ever be a time when I will also be so detached, so aloof, so free
of possessions as you are?’ Nagarjuna said, ‘The time has come.
Accidentally you are already caught. I will give you the secret of how
to become transcendental to the world, how to go beyond, how not to
possess.’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, ‘But let me first tell you that I am a thief. And I
have gone to many saints before, but they all say – because I am a
well-known thief – they all say, “First stop stealing, only then can you
meditate.” So let me tell you first. You may not know.’ Nagarjuna said,
‘Then it simply shows that you have never been to a saint up to now.
They must have been ex-thieves; otherwise who cares who you are? And why
make it a condition that first you have to stop stealing? I will give
you the meditation. It is very simple: you go on stealing. Just do one
thing: do it consciously, do it with full awareness. When you are going
to steal, move fully aware, alert to what you are doing. And after
fifteen days you report to me.’</p><p><br></p><p>But by the seventh day the thief was back and he said, ‘You deceived
me. For seven days continuously I have not been able to steal. And it
was not that I was prevented, I reach the places where great treasures
are available, but I cannot do it. If I become aware, I start laughing
at my foolishness. What am I doing – stealing things which will be taken
away from me? Sooner or later I will have to die. The whole thing looks
so childish. If I become aware, I cannot steal. If I steal, I lose my
awareness. Both cannot go together.’</p><p><br></p><p>Nagarjuna said, ‘Then you decide. Whichever you choose, you can
choose. You can drop awareness and steal or, if you want to have
awareness, then drop stealing.’ And the man said, ‘I have tasted
awareness. It is impossible to drop it. I will drop stealing, because
awareness is far more valuable, far more significant. I have only tasted
a little bit of it, but it gives such joy. And I have been stealing my
whole life, and I have accumulated many valuable things in my house, but
they have never given me any joy. They only give me more and more
fear.’</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness is the only secret key: it transforms. It doesn’t matter
what your illness is, awareness is the only medicine: it cures all
illness. If you are politically minded – and everybody is... In some way
or other everybody is trying to be more powerful than the other. Even in
relationships politics continue – the husband tries to be more powerful
than the wife, the wife tries to be more powerful than the husband –
hence the constant conflict, even between parents and children.
Everywhere there is conflict. It is all politics, different faces of
politics.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you come to me I cannot expect you to come without politics –
that is impossible. If you are without politics, you will not need to
come – wherever you are, God will come to you. When you come here I
accept all your human weaknesses. I have no condemnation. I don’t tell
you to repress; I don’t want to make you feel guilty about anything. If
you want to play the game of politics you are allowed to play it – with
only one condition: become more and more alert while playing it. Have a
sense of humour, and then all is well. Sooner or later it will wither
away of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>And so is the case with sensuality, sexuality; so is the case with
possessiveness; so is the case with everything that man suffers
from.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, THIS MORNING IN THE LECTURE, I WENT SO DEEP THAT I WAS
SURE THE BODY WAS GOING TO DIE RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I BECAME VERY
AFRAID AND STRUGGLED BACK TO THE SURFACE. NOW I AM AFRAID IT WILL HAPPEN
AGAIN. WHAT TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Saguna, you are a fool. You should have allowed it to happen. You
missed a great opportunity. If at any time you again start feeling that
you are dying in my presence, die immediately! That means your ego was
on the verge of disappearing and something tremendously valuable was
about to happen. You missed it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the first time it happens that way to everybody. One shrinks back
in fear, escapes back into his ego, clings, holds. Where can you find a
better place to die? If you can die in my presence you will attain to
life, eternal life, life abundant. If you can die in satsang, in the
presence of the Master, you will be resurrected.</p><p><br></p><p>But that courage has to be there. Gather your courage, and next time
it starts happening, let it happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>IS PSYCHOANALYSIS REALLY THAT USELESS?</p><p><br></p><p>No, not always. Sometimes it helps too. Meditate on this story.</p><p>Felix Simons was a nice guy but a social flop. Although he was
thirty-five, he had never conquered his childhood habit of bedwetting.
Finally, one of his friends told him, ‘Look, Felix, you might as well
know the truth. We’re all very fond of you, but nobody can stand to come
into your house because it smells, and you’re driving your wife up a
wall. Why don’t you see a psychiatrist about your problem? Enuresis is
not too uncommon and it can be cured. Get it over with once and for
all!’</p><p><br></p><p>Felix was convinced. After six months of treatment he ran into the
same friend. ‘Well, Felix, did you take my advice?’</p><p>‘Yes,’ answered Felix, ‘I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist three times a
week for six months now.’ ‘Well, have you had any results?’</p><p>‘Oh,’ beamed Felix, ‘great results!’ ‘You don’t wet your bed
anymore?’</p><p>‘I still do, but now I’m proud of it!’</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis helps only in this way. It makes you proud of things
you have been guilty about. Religion has created guilt in people.
Psychoanalysis has moved to the other extreme – psychoanalysis is a
reaction to religious guilt. This has to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion has done a great wrong to humanity. It has wounded the human
heart by creating guilt. It lives on guilt – the whole religious world.
Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, these are only different names for the
same trick – how to create guilt in people. Once you have created guilt
in people, they are caught in your net; you can exploit them. Guilt is
the spider’s net. Make people feel guilty and they are in your power.
Then you can manipulate them. You can force them to surrender. You can
force them to do things for you, for the church, for the priest. They
are guilty. They are afraid they are going to suffer, they want to find
a way out.</p><p><br></p><p>First create guilt, then they are bound to come to you, because they
will have to find a way out of guilt. Then tell them to pray, then tell
them to do some ritual, some mantra. But first the guilt has to be
created.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>Two persons were doing great business. They were partners. The
business was simple. One would enter a town in the night and throw coal
tar on people windows, and after two, three days, the other would come
to clean. And he would make it known in the town that he knew how to
clean coal tar from the windows. By the time he had cleaned the windows,
the other would have prepared another town for him. Then he would go to
the other town. They were doing really great business. They were
partners.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion depends on creating guilt. First throw coal tar on people’s
hearts and then tell them how to cleanse it. And then they have to pay
for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis is a reaction. I don’t call it a revolution but only a
reaction. It reacted against this whole business and it started doing
the opposite: it makes you proud of your things. It says, ‘This is
perfectly normal. If you are wetting your bed this is perfectly normal.
There is nothing wrong in it. You should be really proud of it.’ It
gives support to you as you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion condemns you as you are. Psychoanalysis convinces you that
you are the only way you can be, and you are perfectly right, you are
okay. That is the message of psychoanalysis. Both are wrong. Neither do
you need to feel guilty nor do you need to feel perfectly okay. If you
feel guilty you will fall victim to the church, to the priest, and they
will exploit you. If you start feeling you are perfectly okay, you
become dormant; your growth stops.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to know one thing: that life means evolution, growth, life
means going higher and higher – to new planitudes, to new planes of
being. There is no need to feel guilty for what you are, but there is
every need to have a tremendous longing to rise higher, because you are
a seed, a potential, and you can become God. If you accept yourself as
you are and you settle with it, you will remain a seed. You will never
become a tree and you will never be able to have a dialogue with the
stars. You will not be able to play with the wind and the rain and the
sun. You will remain shrunk into a seed. But</p><p>there is no need to feel guilty. A seed is a seed – there is no need
to feel guilty – but the seed has to become a tree. There is really a
great need to inquire into one’s potential. Never feel guilty, never
feel proud. Just feel tremendously happy that a great opportunity has
been given to you to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>And this whole life is a challenge to growth. That is true religion
and that is true psychology too – because a true religion cannot be
anything other than a true psychology. I call that psychology ‘the
psychology of the Buddhas’. It does not make you feel guilty; it accepts
you, it loves you, but it doesn’t make you feel proud to be as you are.
It gives you a great challenge to be more than you are. It gives you a
divine discontent. It makes you aflame with a desire to go higher and
higher – not higher than others, but higher than yourself. Tomorrow
should not be just a repetition of today – that is the meaning of divine
discontent. Today should not be just a repetition of yesterday,
otherwise you have not lived. Today must bring some new gifts to you,
some new flowers, some new rays. Some new windows MUST open today.</p><p><br></p><p>To feel guilty means to remain possessed by the past; to feel proud
means to remain wherever you are, whatsoever you are. To have a divine
discontent means to grow, to search, to seek, to explore. And life is
nothing but an adventure, a constant adventure, into the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t want you to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel
proud. When you drop both, real life begins.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHY IS COMMUNICATION SO DIFFICULT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only difficult, it is impossible. It is really a miracle if
sometimes it happens, because two persons are two persons. Their past
experiences are different, their gestalt is different, their knowledge
is different, their personalities are different. They are two worlds.
They speak different languages; it may be the same language, but they
speak different languages. They give different meaning to words,
different nuances, different shades and different colours.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are looking at a rose flower and if there are five persons
looking at the rose flower, don’t think for a single moment that you are
looking at the same rose flower – you cannot; only five Buddhas standing
beside the flower will be able to look at the same rose flower. You
cannot, because five Buddhas means five zeros, five no-minds. Only two
no-minds can commune because there is nothing to hinder now, nothing to
interpret with. It is direct.</p><p><br></p><p>But when five minds are standing beside the rose flower they only
believe that they are looking at the same rose flower, because they have
different ideas of the rose, different experiences of the rose,
different past impacts of the rose. All that is there in their eyes,
layer upon layer. This rose is so far away, so distant.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, one may have loved a woman who was obsessed by roses,
but she betrayed him. Now the rose will only remind him of that betrayal
and the woman. That is not the others’ experience. The other may have
seen a dead man garlanded with a rose garland. The rose will remind him
of</p><p>death – he may feel a little fear. The third may have his own
experience of the rose. It will depend. And that’s how it is with each
experience .</p><p><br></p><p>Only two no-minds can communicate. Even without words, communication
happens. It is a communion. But minds are bound to clash, conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you a few stories. First:</p><p>Seated in an elegantly appointed restaurant, Chico Marx was studying
the oversized menu when the head waiter approached his table. The waiter
folded his hands in front of him and with proper Continental demeanour
enquired, ‘And what is your pleasure, Monsieur?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Girls,’ Chico replied. ‘What’s yours?’ The second story:</p><p>The young husband and his bride flew to Miami for their honeymoon and
for days neither hide nor hair was seen of them. On the morning of the
sixth day, they entered the dining-room for breakfast. As the waiter
approached them for their order the bride turned to her husband and said
coyly, ‘You know what I’d like, honey, don’t you?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Yes, I know,’ he replied wearily, ‘but we have got to eat some time
too!’ And the third story:</p><p>The boss had been after his secretary for almost a year. He had been
suggesting all kinds of things to her. On this particular evening he was
unusually persistent.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Oh, come on!’ he said. ‘Let’s go out and have supper, then go to the
theatre, then to a nightclub and then we will go up to my
apartment.’</p><p><br></p><p>The blond clipped back, ‘I would like you to comprehend that I am
adamant and didactic in my refusal of your salacious, mendacious and
denigrating proposition.’</p><p><br></p><p>The boss said, ‘I don’t get it.’</p><p><br></p><p>The secretary answered, ‘That’s just what I have been trying to tell
you.’</p><p><br></p><p>Language is the problem. Different experiences, different minds,
different pasts, different patterns, different habits, different
personalities.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me why it is difficult to communicate. It is not only
difficult, it is almost impossible. If once in a while it happens, feel
tremendously fortunate. Yes, once in a while it happens. When you are
deeply in love with somebody, it happens. Then language is not needed,
then your very presence, your very vibe communicates. Then, for a
moment, in deep love, you slip out of your minds. In deep love, for a
moment you become Buddhas, you become no-minds.</p><p>So only in rare moments of love does communication happen, otherwise
it is always a quarrel, a subtle conflict. You say one thing, the other
understands something else. The other says something, you understand
something else. If you really want to communicate, become more and more
loving – because love is needed, not language. Language is a barrier,
love is a bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to communicate, start slipping out of your mind.
Become more and more zeros, no-minds, and suddenly you will see miracles
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is happening here. The new people who come here are not in tune
with me. For a few days I say something, they understand something else.
But as they become more and more open to my love, communication starts
happening. To those who have really lived long with me and have become
intimate, to those with whom the barrier of language has disappeared,
just a look in their eyes or just a touch of my hand, and there is
communication – not only communication, but communion.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why just recently I have started a new way of communing with
my sannyasins: just to touch them, just to let them feel my energy. The
more you become intimate with me, the less and less words will be needed
– because you will start hearing me, and then there will be no need of
words. I will continue to speak for those who will be coming – more and
more will be coming, thousands are on the way – but those who have been
here with me long enough or deep enough... And depth can happen even in
a single moment. It is not only a question of time, it is a question of
intensity.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it happens that when a person comes to me for the first
time, the first moment of contact, and he becomes intimate as if he has
been with me for many lives. And not only do I feel that, he also
immediately feels that he has come home, that this is the place he has
been searching for his whole life or for many lives. Then communication
immediately happens, then there is no conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the moment that there is communion and there is no conflict
is the moment of your real initiation. Then what I say is secondary,
what I am becomes primary. Then you relate to me directly. Then you are
not distracted by my words – because I am not a consistent man, I
contradict myself. And I contradict myself deliberately to help you to
get rid of your expectation of consistency, to help you to get rid of
language. Listening to me contradicting myself again and again, slowly
slowly you will see that words are only games; you will not be serious
about words. The day that awakening has happened in you, you relate to
me directly. Then there is no medium needed; then you are bridged.</p><p><br></p><p>I am in love, I am love. The moment you are in love and you become
love, communion happens. Communion is a function of love, not of
language. In fact, language functions as a hindrance, not as a help.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it: to be with me is to be with an emptiness, a nobody. I
have nothing to offer to you, I have nothing to teach you, I have no
philosophy. I am, but I have no philosophy. I am, but I have nothing to
offer. I am, but I have nothing to teach. And you have to learn to be
with this l-amness. And then you will know what communion is.</p><p><br></p><p>Communion is a phenomenon of love, a flowering of love. It has
nothing to do with language, with words – not at all; it is silence.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

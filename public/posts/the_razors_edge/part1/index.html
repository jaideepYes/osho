DISCOURSE COMES AND IT JUST EXPANDS TO FILL THE SILENCE, LEAVING A BREATHING HEART AND A PAIR OF EARS HANGING FROM NOWHERE. IT FEELS LIKE BEING AN ORGASM. OH OSHO, ARE YOU EVEN TURNING THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL INTO THE LIGHT NIGHT OF THE SOUL?\nPrem Amrito, it is exactly the definition of mysticism: the transformation of the dark night of the soul into a light night of the soul.\nIt is my work and it is your work, too. All these people who have gathered here are in search of light, life, love, laughter; and all these divine qualities have been destroyed by centuries of exploitation – by all kinds of priests, bureaucrats, politicians, by all those who have been in some kind of power.\nBut they have not been successful in destroying you. They have been successful only in suppressing you; they have not killed you, they have only poisoned you. And your poison can be taken out, and you can become alive again – which is your birthright.\nYou are saying, “All day, I have this melted sensation.” This is the beginning of disappearing – disappearing into the whole. First, you will feel just as if you are melting, ice melting...”like something inside me dissolving in the glow of your love.”\n2\nSomething certainly is dissolving in everyone, more or less, except those few unfortunate ones who stand on the bank of a river and remain thirsty. But what is dissolving is not your reality; it is the unreal in which your reality has been repressed, covered. Once the unreal dissolves, the false disappears. Suddenly, you will have for the first time, an inner experience of sunrise – light all over the inner horizon of your sky.\n“Discourse comes and it just expands.” Spirituality is very contagious; if there are so many people around you in the same space, it helps tremendously. And if someone who has come back home is amongst you, his very presence starts giving you the direction, the dimension in which you have to expand, move, melt, merge.\n“Discourse comes and it just expands to fill the silence.” Perhaps this is the only place on the whole earth where so many people are sitting in immense silence – not only on the outside but inside too. And silence gives space. Words, thoughts, are all disturbances.\nSilence is an opening to the infinite.\nYou can expand to infinity – it all depends on your courage. And courage also comes as your experience grows, as you see that the more you expand, the more beautiful life becomes; the more you expand, the more love showers on you; the more you expand... everything takes on a new psychedelic dimension. It becomes more colorful, more alive, more dancing. The ordinary world suddenly starts changing into something extraordinary. The mundane becomes the sacred. And these are the most significant moments in life – when the mundane becomes sacred.\nAll the religions have been enemies of mankind for the simple reason that they have divided the mundane from the sacred. Rather than bridging them, they have been continuously conditioning the human mind that they are opposites, enemies, and you have to renounce one if you want to get the other.\nIf you want victory and success in the mundane world, you have to forget about the sacred completely. And to forget it, the best way is to deny it – it does not exist at all. Otherwise, how will you forget it? It will always remain somewhere in the corner, nagging you.\nJust the other day, I was informed that in the Soviet Union – atheism is their religion – every child has to be conditioned from the very beginning in atheism. It is not different, it is the same: somewhere it is the Catholic religion, somewhere it is Protestant, somewhere it is Hindu, somewhere it is Buddhist. In the Soviet Union, it is atheist. Somewhere it is God, somewhere it is no God. But the society never leaves you anywhere to search for yourself. It gives you ready-made answers. And in life, ready- made answers are not only futile, not only poisonous, but almost murderous.\nThe information was about many countries within the Soviet Union which are Mohammedan – used to be Mohammedan. Now, officially they are all atheists. But they have not forgotten; something of the sacred still lingers – even against the whole propaganda machine of the Soviet Union, which is one of the most efficient, dictatorial, which allows no criticism, no freedom of thinking.\nThose Mohammedans have to pretend that they are atheists. But in Mohammedanism, five prayers are prescribed every day – from morning till you to go bed. It is very difficult in the Soviet Union to\ndo five prayers. They have changed the name of the five prayers; they don’t call it prayer, they call it physical exercise. Five times every day... it is good for the body and for the mind. They cannot mention the soul.\nSixty or seventy years of continuous propaganda, conditioning – but the sacred is just standing by. And thousands of years of conditioning all over the world against the mundane, but the mundane has not disappeared. In India, they even reached to the extreme – they have been preaching for almost two thousand years that the mundane world does not exist; it is maya, it is illusion, it only appears.\nI was staying with a shankaracharya, and he was discussing the illusoriness of the world. I told him, “There is no need to argue. You just pass through the wall. Don’t go through the door. And it will be enough; I will be convinced and I will remain your devotee for my whole life.”\nHe said, “Go through the wall? What kind of argument is this?”\nI said, “It is not a question of argument. It will simply prove whether the wall is real or illusory.”\nYou can condition the human mind, but the mundane is there. And even the person who preaches continuallythe first shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, who created this theory of illusion and\npropounded it with great argumentation – he also needs food, he also needs water, he also needs clothes. And I am wondering why none of his followers ever objected, ever asked, “What is the need of these illusory things? And how can an illusory food become nourishment? And if it becomes nourishment, then to call it illusory is nonsense.”\nThis was one side of the game: the people who wanted to emphasize spirituality had to deny the reality of the world which surrounds you everywhere. And there have been people who have been denying the spiritual, saying, “Man has no soul. He is just a robot created by nature, and when he dies, everything dies. So don’t be bothered about the inner world; there is no inner. All that is real is outside, and all the talk about the inner is unreal, illusory.”\nOn the surface, you may think these two parties are against each other. But my own understanding is different: they are using the same argument. They belong to the same category, to the same mind: choose one half – which half you choose is not the point, both are against the whole.\nMy effort is to make you aware that both are real, both are together in deep harmony. And the idea of their opposition destroys your life. Hence I say, the moments when you come to know that the sacred and the mundane are one – the sacred is the inside of the mundane, and the mundane is the outside of the sacred – then you have a total conception of reality.\n“leaving a breathing heart and a pair of ears hanging from nowhere.” When you are absolutely\nsilent and have become only a listening, naturally you will feel as if two ears are hanging from nowhere. This is the right way of listening, and “a breathing heart” deepens the silence; it does not disturb it.\nAmrito, you are right when you say, “It feels like being an orgasm.” It is. It is a love affair with the whole. It is a meeting with eternity, and it is an orgasm that can remain with you twenty-four hours – day in, day out.\nAn enlightened man remains orgasmic in every moment of his life. Orgasm is no longer an incident that happens and disappears; it becomes his natural way of being. His blissfulness is so much, and he is so deeply in tune with existence that orgasm is no longer an incident, it is his very life.\n“Oh Osho, are you even turning the dark night of the soul into the light night of the soul?” That is the purpose for which we all have gathered here. This mystery school, or this university of alchemy, has only one purpose – to transform the baser metals into gold; to transform the dead into the living; to transform the dark into the light; to transform you from your mortality into the immortal.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I WAS IN SWEDEN, I FELT MY HEART OPENING UP FOR YOU, FILLING ME WITH A DEEP FEELING OF LOVE AND JOY. NOW THAT I AM IN POONA, MY HEART SEEMS TO BE CLOSED AGAIN, RESISTING YOUR LOVE. THIS FILLS ME WITH SORROW. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nCarina Anderson, the time when you were in Sweden, I was just in your imagination. You were feeling your heart opening, but there was nobody to enter into your heart. You were feeling a deep fulfillment of love and joy, but that was all made of the same stuff dreams are made of.\nNow that you are here, things are totally different. Keeping your heart open will make you afraid, because it is easy to let me in, but it is very difficult to throw me out.\nI come into you like a guest, and soon you start feeling you are a guest and I am a host – hence, the fear. Here, you are resisting my love, and you are saying, “This fills me with sorrow.” It is natural that it will fill you with sorrow – you must have dreamt so much, imagined so much, hoped so much and things have not turned out the way you wanted them to be.\nYou are asking, “What should I do?” Go back to Sweden, Poona, anyway, is not a good place to stay. And at least your heart was opening there. Although there was no guest knocking on your doors, at least you were imagining love, joy; and here you are closed, full of fear, and feeling sad and wondering what has happened.\nSo if you are a coward, then the easiest way is simply to go back to Sweden – as you enter the plane, your heart will start opening again and you will start feeling love for me. But don’t return – enjoy your dreams. If you cannot enjoy the reality, why unnecessarily feel sad and sorrowful? But if you are courageous, then Poona cannot do anything to you. Then let your heart be open and don’t be afraid of love.\nIn life, the only thing that one should not be afraid of is love.\nBut people are more afraid of love than anything else, because love is a kind of death. Your ego has to die. Only then will your heart be spacious enough for love to come in. But I warn you: beware! I come as a guest and soon I become the host. If you are ready to take the risk.… So many of the people here have taken the risk, and once they have taken the risk, they are grateful that this tremendous transformation became possible for them.\nWhenever love comes in, it cannot be a guest, because it comes in and never goes. It becomes your very being, your very song, your very dance.\nSo either you can go right now back to Sweden and dream your dreams – but they are soap bubbles; you are simply wasting your time – or be here, take courage and accept the challenge: open your heart and let me in. Then I will be coming with you to Sweden – and on just one ticket, two persons! I have been traveling all over the world this way.\nThe governments and parliaments think that they are preventing me, but they don’t know my ways – that wherever one of my sannyasins enters, I also enter with him. They can prevent me, but they cannot prevent my millions of sannyasins.\nAnd I have distributed my love to everyone, deserving or undeserving, because that is my way of thinking. Everyone deserves love, just as everyone deserves breathing. Everybody is worthy of love, just as everybody is worthy of living.\nLove is the nourishment of your soul.\nYou can choose... but don’t be saddened, in sorrow. If you want to just imagine things, then you can imagine anything. It is easy for millions of people in the world to pray to God because it is all imagination. If by chance it happens that they meet God, then there will be difficulty. Then immediately they will want to escape, and they will start finding a thousand and one complaints. They will start laying many judgements upon God.\nFor example, if you meet God and he turns out to be Chinese, are you going to tolerate him – with five, six hairs in his beard, with long cheek bones? Or, who knows, maybe He is black. And maybe there is a possibility he is a woman... a black woman with a chinese face! You will run back to Sweden so fast. It was good in Sweden, God was your imagination. Whatever you wanted.…\nIn India, the god Krishna, in his temples... there are beautiful temples of Krishna all over India, and he is one of the most colorful men. He has to be given food two times a day, just as every Indian eats. Every afternoon he takes a nap. In the night, when he goes to sleep, the doors are closed.\nIt is your imagination; whatever you want to do.… If you don’t give him food, he cannot lodge a complaint in the Bund Garden Police Station. The poor fellow is imprisoned already in a temple, and nobody knows... and nobody has ever thought about a cup of tea in the morning.\nTimes have changed. If Krishna were alive, he would have learnt to drink tea – it is not such a sin. But Hindus cannot offer tea to Krishna. They keep him in a swing, and the priest goes on pulling the rope of the swing so he is completely enjoying the swing. In rich temples, it is a golden swing, or a silver swing.\nIn one of the cities where I lived for a few months, there was a very famous temple of Krishna just in front of my house. So I used to go just to see what was happening there. I told the priest, “One thing you should remember: the whole day, keeping the poor fellow on the swing, and the rope is being pulled – the rope pullers go on changing but that poor fellow... the whole day – I think it will create nausea. You should be a little more compassionate.”\nHe said, “But that’s what the scriptures say.”\nI said, “You follow scriptures? Or do you have some intelligence, too? And if the scriptures say, ‘Go on pulling the swing the whole day,’ then at least take poor Krishna out for a morning walk outside in the garden – and go on pulling the swing as much as you want. Where are your scriptures? Is it written in them that Krishna has to be in the swing?”\nHe said, “That is not written.”\nI said, “Then it is your own idea – swing, do whatever you want. And this is idiotic: keeping the priests changing, now that electricity is available. Just plug the swing into the electricity and it will keep swinging – Krishna or no Krishna.”\nHe said, “You should not say such things. It is irreligious.” I said, “I think that what you are doing is irreligious.”\nIn every country, in every religion, people worship dead saints, because dead saints are very easy. You tell them to lie down, they lie down. You tell them to sit up, they sit up. They are very obedient. But a living saint, a living sage, is not going to be obedient to you. You will have to be surrendered to him. But the imaginary god is surrendered to you – that’s the joy.\nSo in Sweden, you must have been doing things to me of which I am not aware. Here you cannot do those things to me – I am not your imagination. But your imagination is not going to give you a new life. And your imagination is not going to open your eyes to the ultimate truth.\nI can help you to be authentic, to be joyous, to be ecstatic, but you will have to pay the price. And the price is not much – I just want your dreams.\nGive me your dreams, and I can give you reality.\nReality is already with you; your dreams are like clouds, hiding it. Just give me your dreams. I ask nothing from my disciples except their dreams, their lies, their falsities.\nAnd once they are without any falseness, they don’t need anything from anybody. They have everything within themselves. They have brought it with their birth.\nSo you can decide. Either you can go alone to Sweden, or if you want me also to be with you, then you will have to wait a little more, gather courage. If so many people with open hearts have not died, if so many people are ready and available for my love, for my blessings, for my being, for my presenceAnd no harm has happened to them, except that they have become a little crazy. They\nsing more, they dance more, they laugh more, they love more. They are more. So you can choose.\nCarina Anderson, be very careful in choosing, because you may not find a man like me again. Sweden will remain there. I am not going to be here always. And when you have come so far, just a little more, a little closerAnd you know perfectly well how to open the heart, because you\nwere doing it in Sweden. You know perfectly well how to be loving and joyful. Give it a try here too.\nNobody is ever harmed by love, and nobody is ever harmed by opening the heart. Everybody has always become more enriched, more blessed.\nBut you can choose reality – or your dreams. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nONCE YOU SAID TO ME THAT I AM ENERGY AND AWARENESS. I USE THIS AS A KEY. THE OTHER DAY, WHILE SPEAKING ABOUT THE DISCIPLE TOUCHING THE MASTER’S FEET, YOU SAID ENERGY ALWAYS MOVES DOWNWARDS, LIKE WATER. I HAVE FELT ENERGY SHOWERING DOWN, BUT I HAVE ALSO FELT ENERGY SOARING UPWARDS, LIKE A FLAME. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS?\nPrem Shunyo, life has so many aspects, that it is almost impossible to contain all those aspects in one statement. When I said that energy always moves downwards, like water, it was in a particular context. The context was the disciple touching the feet of the master.\nIf he wants to get the master’s energy he has to be humble, and available to the downgoing energy. Just as, in the East, for centuries the disciple has been touching the feet of the master, the master has been touching the head of the disciple with his hands. This way the disciple gets energy on his own accord, from the feet; and from the master’s hands, compassion. And a circle starts happening. If the disciple is not holding himself back, then he will feel what Amrito was calling “orgasm,” energy showering on the disciple from the master; but it is energy coming from above, downwards. This was the context, when I said all energy moves downwards.\nBut your experience is absolutely true. When the master’s energy showers on the disciple, and if the disciple is totally ready, the energy is so much that the disciple becomes aflame; the energy becomes fire. And like flames, the energy starts moving upwards. You all have felt it without understanding it. Sometimes you feel your hands are moving upwards, in spite of yourself. You are not doing it. You are not the doer; your hands have become like a flame which wants to reach to the stars. This is the overflow of energy.\nOrdinarily energy moves downwards; but if the disciple is able to attract the master’s energy in such quantity that it starts flowing all around him, he cannot contain it – it is too much to contain. The very fact of abundance makes the energy move upwards.\nAnd the feeling, Shunyo, is perfectly right. You say, “I have felt energy showering down, but I have also felt energy soaring upwards, like a flame.” That is the second step. First, you have to be so humble – just like a valley – that from the mountains, rivers can descend into you. Once you have too much... you should remember that at a certain point, quantitative changes become qualitative changes.\nFor example, at one hundred degrees water suddenly starts evaporating, moving upwards. Ordinarily water flows downwards, but at a hundred degrees of heat a qualitative change happens. The whole direction changes; the water becomes a new phenomena: vapor. It is the same water\n– it starts moving upwards. Almost similar is the case if energy falling into you makes you so hot, so full... then you will feel a second step: the energy moving upwards like flames. So whatever you have experienced is not against reality.\nWhat I was saying was only in a particular context. In Shunyo’s context I can also be a witness. I have seen it, and many of you may have felt that whenever I come close to her, she starts moving her hands upwards – not only her hands upwards, but she starts saying things that... I don’t think she understands what she is saying. The whole experience is just so much that it wants expression.\nSlowly, slowly, it is going to happen to everyone. But only when it happens is it meaningful to talk to you about it. I don’t say many things to you. I will wait for the right moment, when you have some experience, so that my words don’t just go above your heads but go directly like arrows into your hearts.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN YOU ARE DANCING, SOMETIMES YOU SUDDENLY LIFT YOUR ARMS HIGH AND STOP IN MID-AIR FOR A MOMENT. IN THAT MOMENT, FOR ME, EVERYTHING STOPS, DISAPPEARS, AND THEN I FEEL MYSELF LIFTED UPWARDS, TOO. IT IS AN EXQUISITE FEELING. OSHO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH US? IT SEEMS THAT THE FORMLESS IS RESPONDING TO THE FORMLESS.\nPrem Arup, you are right. It is the formless responding to the formless. Just like Shunyo, this is your experience and may be the experience of a few other people.\nThere are moments when suddenly I stop for a second, just to give you a taste – the taste when everything stops: time, space, mind, everything stops. But it is possible only if you are totally in tune with me and you are moving with me. If you are partially with me, then the experience will not happen. If you are totally with me and moving with me and then suddenly I stop, I give you a moment which is certainly exquisite, a moment of ecstasy.\nYou are asking, “What are You doing to us?” I am trying to get you to come back home. You have gone far away, wandering after ephemeral things, wandering after dreams. And I want you to come back home – because that which can give you contentment, that which can give you fulfillment is not out there, it is in here; it is not in any other time, but now. And the feeling of a stop – a total stop\n– is nothing but an experience of herenow.\nI can give you only the taste, and once you have got the taste, then you will be in search of it. Then there is no way to prevent you. The most fundamental thing is a taste. You have heard words, beautiful words, but they have not driven you into a mad search. I want to give not only words to you, but some content. And that is possible only by giving you some taste.\nAnd the time is ripe. For so many of my sannyasins, the first flowers of spring have started showing. More and more flowers will be blossoming. And you have to be very impatiently patient – with a deep longing, but without any demands. Because I cannot be here forever. And I have waited long\nenough; now it is time that I should start giving you the taste. Words I have given you many – that was a preparation. Seeds I have sown many, and now that the spring is very close, you have to be courageous, and total, and intensively with me – in my silence, in my joy.\nIt is time that the duality between you and me is dropped.\nThose who are intelligent should drop it immediately. Those who are a little less intelligent will take a little time. I have a little time more to linger on your shore... but it cannot be very long.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nALTHOUGH YOU DON’T KNOW ME PERSONALLY, EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nAnand Prageet, I don’t know anybody personally, but I know everybody essentially, I know everybody spiritually.\nPersonality is a false thing. It is a mask: your name, your address, your profession, your photograph – passport size – your identity cards. What is your personality made of? – just these kind of things. Otherwise you come into the world without any name, without any address, without any religion, without any nation, without any race. You come as just a tabula rasa – so clean, so clear, crystal clear. That is your essentiality. But that is the essentiality of everyone, so it does not matter whether I know you personally or not. All personalities are false. And the essential being within you is the same.\nThe day I came to know myself, I came to know you too.\nThat’s why everything is happening. I can understand your puzzlement, your problem: how is this possible? Because people think that unless you are known personally, how can I do anything for you? The reality is just the opposite: Unless I know you spiritually, I cannot do anything. And you don’t know your own spirituality. You know your face, just the way the mirror shows it. Have you seen a house of mirrors, where there are different kinds of mirrors? In some mirrors you are so long, like a pillar; in some mirrors you are so small, like a pygmy; in some mirrors you even get afraid seeing your own face. But have you any guarantee that the mirror you have in your bathroom is the right mirror? And who decides what is the right mirror? But that is your only acquaintance with yourself.\nThere is a beautiful story about Mulla Nasruddin: He had gone for a pilgrimage to Kaaba, the Mohammedan holy land. And there were millions of pilgrims – because it is expected by the Mohammedan scriptures that every Mohammedan, at least once in his life, must go to Kaaba; otherwise he is not considered to be a real Mohammedan.\nSo even the poorest Mohammedans sell their houses, sell their ornaments, their land, everything, because at least once in their life they have to go to Kaaba. So every year there is a great gathering. All caravanserais are full, all hotels are full.\nNowhere was there any vacancy, and Mulla was very tired. He clung to the feet of the manager of a hotel and he said, “Whatever you can do... but there must be some place in your big hotel, and I’m so tired – walking in the desert for miles. Just have mercy on me!”\nThe manager said, “I can understand your trouble, but all the rooms are full. Only one room can I manage to smuggle you into, because the man who is staying inside is snoring so loudly, he will not be able to know. You go silently and sleep. At least till morning that man is not going to wake up, and even if he wakes up, he will not find me. In the morning we will see – somehow we will persuade him.”\nMulla went in; the room was a double bedroom. The man was snoring, so the manager left him there. And Mulla lay went on the bed with his shoes, with his cap, with his coat, everything – just as he was when he entered the hotel. Naturally it was very difficult to sleep with his shoes and his hat and his coat, and it was hot – Saudi Arabia is the hottest place – and on top of it all, the snoring man was by his side. He was snoring so loudly that even if you were at ease you could not sleep.\nMulla was tossing and turning – his tossing and turning woke up the man. And the man watched in the darkness of the room to see what was happening. Slowly, slowly he could see that Mulla had his shoes on, cap on, coat on... and it was so hot. He could not resist the temptation.\nHe said, “Listen, in the first place you have illegally entered my room. I have booked the whole room, for the simple reason that I snore so much that if somebody else is there he cannot sleep. And if he cannot sleep, then he creates trouble, and then I cannot sleep. But you kept silent for so long and suddenly you started tossing and turning. I opened my eyes; I said, ‘My God, again another person!’ But forget all about it – it is midnight, where will you go? But why do you have your shoes and cap on?”\nMulla Nasruddin said, “There is a problem. The problem is that if I take off my shoes, and my cap, and my coat – and in fact I am accustomed to sleeping naked, and unless I am naked I cannot sleep – if I take off everything and go to sleep naked, you are also sleeping naked. That is the trouble.”\n“But what is the trouble? I am sleeping naked, you are sleeping naked.”\nMulla said, “You don’t understand. In the morning, how am I going to recognize who is who? Just to keep my identity, I was keeping my hat, my shoes, my coat. That way I will be certain that there is no problem: I am Mulla Nasruddin, this guy is somebody else. But both naked.”\nThe man said, “I will suggest one thing to you, because this way neither you can sleep nor I can sleep.” And the man also thought that this was a strange type of man, who thinks that if he is naked he will lose his identity. He said, “Just before us, a family must have stayed in the room, and their child has left a doll. So what I will do is I will tie the doll to your feet, and then you can sleep perfectly well. In the morning you can see that the doll is on your feet, so you are Mulla Nasruddin.”\nMulla said, “I’m so grateful to you.” He dropped all his clothes, and the other man found that doll in a corner and tied it to the feet of Mulla. The man was laughing all the time inside, thinking “I have never come across such a man.” And then he had an idea in the middlewhen Mulla was snoring,\nhe changed the doll. He tied it to his own feet and went to sleep.\nIn the morning when Mulla looked at his feet, he jumped out of his bed, ran out of the room, naked, shouting, “One thing is certain: that man is Mulla Nasruddin. The problem is: who am I? Can anybody say? Can anybody recognize me? Where is the manager? He had seen me in the night, perhaps he can recognize me.”\nYour personalities are nothing but dolls tied to your feet. I don’t have to know your personal life, your personality. I don’t have to be acquainted with you personally; I know you essentially. By knowing myself, I have known you all. By dissolving my own problems I know your problems, and I know the key to how they can be dissolved.\nThe day I became aware of myself I came to know the sinner and the saint both. I have known those who are asleep, and those who have become awakened. So there is no problem in it. If you are here listening to me... and all that I am saying is: drop your personality, drop your ego. Be humble, and be open. Be silent, be alert and conscious, and miracles are bound to happen to you.\nAnd remember: I will not be responsible for those miracles. You yourself will be responsible for your miracles. You need not even feel thankful towards me. Your gratitude has to go towards the whole existence. I was just a stranger who met you on the way, and we talked a little, gossiped a little – I don’t have gospels, but only gossips – and then we parted, you on your own way, I on my own way.\nThere is no need for me to know you personally, nor is there any need for you to know me personally. What is needed is an essential bridge between your being and my being. In silence that happens automatically.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5772","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/>The Razor\'s Edge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 Miracles are bound to happen</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5772 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Razors_Edge/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

DISSOLVING IN THE GLOW OF YOUR LOVE. DISCOURSE COMES AND IT JUST EXPANDS
TO FILL THE SILENCE, LEAVING A BREATHING HEART AND A PAIR OF EARS
HANGING FROM NOWHERE. IT FEELS LIKE BEING AN ORGASM. OH OSHO, ARE YOU
EVEN TURNING THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL INTO THE LIGHT NIGHT OF THE
SOUL?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Amrito, it is exactly the definition of mysticism: the
transformation of the dark night of the soul into a light night of the
soul.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my work and it is your work, too. All these people who have
gathered here are in search of light, life, love, laughter; and all
these divine qualities have been destroyed by centuries of exploitation
– by all kinds of priests, bureaucrats, politicians, by all those who
have been in some kind of power.</p><p><br></p><p>But they have not been successful in destroying you. They have been
successful only in suppressing you; they have not killed you, they have
only poisoned you. And your poison can be taken out, and you can become
alive again – which is your birthright.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “All day, I have this melted sensation.” This is the
beginning of disappearing – disappearing into the whole. First, you will
feel just as if you are melting, ice melting...”like something inside me
dissolving in the glow of your love.”</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>Something certainly is dissolving in everyone, more or less, except
those few unfortunate ones who stand on the bank of a river and remain
thirsty. But what is dissolving is not your reality; it is the unreal in
which your reality has been repressed, covered. Once the unreal
dissolves, the false disappears. Suddenly, you will have for the first
time, an inner experience of sunrise – light all over the inner horizon
of your sky.</p><p><br></p><p>“Discourse comes and it just expands.” Spirituality is very
contagious; if there are so many people around you in the same space, it
helps tremendously. And if someone who has come back home is amongst
you, his very presence starts giving you the direction, the dimension in
which you have to expand, move, melt, merge.</p><p><br></p><p>“Discourse comes and it just expands to fill the silence.” Perhaps
this is the only place on the whole earth where so many people are
sitting in immense silence – not only on the outside but inside too. And
silence gives space. Words, thoughts, are all disturbances.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence is an opening to the infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>You can expand to infinity – it all depends on your courage. And
courage also comes as your experience grows, as you see that the more
you expand, the more beautiful life becomes; the more you expand, the
more love showers on you; the more you expand... everything takes on a
new psychedelic dimension. It becomes more colorful, more alive, more
dancing. The ordinary world suddenly starts changing into something
extraordinary. The mundane becomes the sacred. And these are the most
significant moments in life – when the mundane becomes sacred.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been enemies of mankind for the simple reason
that they have divided the mundane from the sacred. Rather than bridging
them, they have been continuously conditioning the human mind that they
are opposites, enemies, and you have to renounce one if you want to get
the other.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want victory and success in the mundane world, you have to
forget about the sacred completely. And to forget it, the best way is to
deny it – it does not exist at all. Otherwise, how will you forget it?
It will always remain somewhere in the corner, nagging you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, I was informed that in the Soviet Union – atheism
is their religion – every child has to be conditioned from the very
beginning in atheism. It is not different, it is the same: somewhere it
is the Catholic religion, somewhere it is Protestant, somewhere it is
Hindu, somewhere it is Buddhist. In the Soviet Union, it is atheist.
Somewhere it is God, somewhere it is no God. But the society never
leaves you anywhere to search for yourself. It gives you ready-made
answers. And in life, ready- made answers are not only futile, not only
poisonous, but almost murderous.</p><p><br></p><p>The information was about many countries within the Soviet Union
which are Mohammedan – used to be Mohammedan. Now, officially they are
all atheists. But they have not forgotten; something of the sacred still
lingers – even against the whole propaganda machine of the Soviet Union,
which is one of the most efficient, dictatorial, which allows no
criticism, no freedom of thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Those Mohammedans have to pretend that they are atheists. But in
Mohammedanism, five prayers are prescribed every day – from morning till
you to go bed. It is very difficult in the Soviet Union to</p><p>do five prayers. They have changed the name of the five prayers; they
don’t call it prayer, they call it physical exercise. Five times every
day... it is good for the body and for the mind. They cannot mention the
soul.</p><p><br></p><p>Sixty or seventy years of continuous propaganda, conditioning – but
the sacred is just standing by. And thousands of years of conditioning
all over the world against the mundane, but the mundane has not
disappeared. In India, they even reached to the extreme – they have been
preaching for almost two thousand years that the mundane world does not
exist; it is maya, it is illusion, it only appears.</p><p><br></p><p>I was staying with a shankaracharya, and he was discussing the
illusoriness of the world. I told him, “There is no need to argue. You
just pass through the wall. Don’t go through the door. And it will be
enough; I will be convinced and I will remain your devotee for my whole
life.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Go through the wall? What kind of argument is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not a question of argument. It will simply prove
whether the wall is real or illusory.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can condition the human mind, but the mundane is there. And even
the person who preaches continually<span class=s4></span>the first
shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, who created this theory of illusion
and</p><p>propounded it with great argumentation – he also needs food, he also
needs water, he also needs clothes. And I am wondering why none of his
followers ever objected, ever asked, “What is the need of these illusory
things? And how can an illusory food become nourishment? And if it
becomes nourishment, then to call it illusory is nonsense.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was one side of the game: the people who wanted to emphasize
spirituality had to deny the reality of the world which surrounds you
everywhere. And there have been people who have been denying the
spiritual, saying, “Man has no soul. He is just a robot created by
nature, and when he dies, everything dies. So don’t be bothered about
the inner world; there is no inner. All that is real is outside, and all
the talk about the inner is unreal, illusory.”</p><p><br></p><p>On the surface, you may think these two parties are against each
other. But my own understanding is different: they are using the same
argument. They belong to the same category, to the same mind: choose one
half – which half you choose is not the point, both are against the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is to make you aware that both are real, both are together
in deep harmony. And the idea of their opposition destroys your life.
Hence I say, the moments when you come to know that the sacred and the
mundane are one – the sacred is the inside of the mundane, and the
mundane is the outside of the sacred – then you have a total conception
of reality.</p><p><br></p><p>“<span class=s4></span>leaving a breathing heart and a pair of ears
hanging from nowhere.” When you are absolutely</p><p>silent and have become only a listening, naturally you will feel as
if two ears are hanging from nowhere. This is the right way of
listening, and “a breathing heart” deepens the silence; it does not
disturb it.</p><p><br></p><p>Amrito, you are right when you say, “It feels like being an orgasm.”
It is. It is a love affair with the whole. It is a meeting with
eternity, and it is an orgasm that can remain with you twenty-four hours
– day in, day out.</p><p>An enlightened man remains orgasmic in every moment of his life.
Orgasm is no longer an incident that happens and disappears; it becomes
his natural way of being. His blissfulness is so much, and he is so
deeply in tune with existence that orgasm is no longer an incident, it
is his very life.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh Osho, are you even turning the dark night of the soul into the
light night of the soul?” That is the purpose for which we all have
gathered here. This mystery school, or this university of alchemy, has
only one purpose – to transform the baser metals into gold; to transform
the dead into the living; to transform the dark into the light; to
transform you from your mortality into the immortal.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN I WAS IN SWEDEN, I FELT MY HEART OPENING UP FOR YOU, FILLING ME
WITH A DEEP FEELING OF LOVE AND JOY. NOW THAT I AM IN POONA, MY HEART
SEEMS TO BE CLOSED AGAIN, RESISTING YOUR LOVE. THIS FILLS ME WITH
SORROW. WHAT SHOULD I DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Carina Anderson, the time when you were in Sweden, I was just in your
imagination. You were feeling your heart opening, but there was nobody
to enter into your heart. You were feeling a deep fulfillment of love
and joy, but that was all made of the same stuff dreams are made of.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that you are here, things are totally different. Keeping your
heart open will make you afraid, because it is easy to let me in, but it
is very difficult to throw me out.</p><p><br></p><p>I come into you like a guest, and soon you start feeling you are a
guest and I am a host – hence, the fear. Here, you are resisting my
love, and you are saying, “This fills me with sorrow.” It is natural
that it will fill you with sorrow – you must have dreamt so much,
imagined so much, hoped so much and things have not turned out the way
you wanted them to be.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “What should I do?” Go back to Sweden, Poona, anyway,
is not a good place to stay. And at least your heart was opening there.
Although there was no guest knocking on your doors, at least you were
imagining love, joy; and here you are closed, full of fear, and feeling
sad and wondering what has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are a coward, then the easiest way is simply to go back to
Sweden – as you enter the plane, your heart will start opening again and
you will start feeling love for me. But don’t return – enjoy your
dreams. If you cannot enjoy the reality, why unnecessarily feel sad and
sorrowful? But if you are courageous, then Poona cannot do anything to
you. Then let your heart be open and don’t be afraid of love.</p><p><br></p><p>In life, the only thing that one should not be afraid of is love.</p><p><br></p><p>But people are more afraid of love than anything else, because love
is a kind of death. Your ego has to die. Only then will your heart be
spacious enough for love to come in. But I warn you: beware! I come as a
guest and soon I become the host. If you are ready to take the risk.… So
many of the people here have taken the risk, and once they have taken
the risk, they are grateful that this tremendous transformation became
possible for them.</p><p>Whenever love comes in, it cannot be a guest, because it comes in and
never goes. It becomes your very being, your very song, your very
dance.</p><p><br></p><p>So either you can go right now back to Sweden and dream your dreams –
but they are soap bubbles; you are simply wasting your time – or be
here, take courage and accept the challenge: open your heart and let me
in. Then I will be coming with you to Sweden – and on just one ticket,
two persons! I have been traveling all over the world this way.</p><p><br></p><p>The governments and parliaments think that they are preventing me,
but they don’t know my ways – that wherever one of my sannyasins enters,
I also enter with him. They can prevent me, but they cannot prevent my
millions of sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have distributed my love to everyone, deserving or undeserving,
because that is my way of thinking. Everyone deserves love, just as
everyone deserves breathing. Everybody is worthy of love, just as
everybody is worthy of living.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the nourishment of your soul.</p><p><br></p><p>You can choose... but don’t be saddened, in sorrow. If you want to
just imagine things, then you can imagine anything. It is easy for
millions of people in the world to pray to God because it is all
imagination. If by chance it happens that they meet God, then there will
be difficulty. Then immediately they will want to escape, and they will
start finding a thousand and one complaints. They will start laying many
judgements upon God.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if you meet God and he turns out to be Chinese, are you
going to tolerate him – with five, six hairs in his beard, with long
cheek bones? Or, who knows, maybe He is black. And maybe there is a
possibility he is a woman... a black woman with a chinese face! You will
run back to Sweden so fast. It was good in Sweden, God was your
imagination. Whatever you wanted.…</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the god Krishna, in his temples... there are beautiful
temples of Krishna all over India, and he is one of the most colorful
men. He has to be given food two times a day, just as every Indian eats.
Every afternoon he takes a nap. In the night, when he goes to sleep, the
doors are closed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is your imagination; whatever you want to do.… If you don’t give
him food, he cannot lodge a complaint in the Bund Garden Police Station.
The poor fellow is imprisoned already in a temple, and nobody knows...
and nobody has ever thought about a cup of tea in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Times have changed. If Krishna were alive, he would have learnt to
drink tea – it is not such a sin. But Hindus cannot offer tea to
Krishna. They keep him in a swing, and the priest goes on pulling the
rope of the swing so he is completely enjoying the swing. In rich
temples, it is a golden swing, or a silver swing.</p><p><br></p><p>In one of the cities where I lived for a few months, there was a very
famous temple of Krishna just in front of my house. So I used to go just
to see what was happening there. I told the priest, “One thing you
should remember: the whole day, keeping the poor fellow on the swing,
and the rope is being pulled – the rope pullers go on changing but that
poor fellow... the whole day – I think it will create nausea. You should
be a little more compassionate.”</p><p>He said, “But that’s what the scriptures say.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You follow scriptures? Or do you have some intelligence,
too? And if the scriptures say, ‘Go on pulling the swing the whole day,’
then at least take poor Krishna out for a morning walk outside in the
garden – and go on pulling the swing as much as you want. Where are your
scriptures? Is it written in them that Krishna has to be in the
swing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is not written.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then it is your own idea – swing, do whatever you want. And
this is idiotic: keeping the priests changing, now that electricity is
available. Just plug the swing into the electricity and it will keep
swinging – Krishna or no Krishna.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You should not say such things. It is irreligious.” I said,
“I think that what you are doing is irreligious.”</p><p>In every country, in every religion, people worship dead saints,
because dead saints are very easy. You tell them to lie down, they lie
down. You tell them to sit up, they sit up. They are very obedient. But
a living saint, a living sage, is not going to be obedient to you. You
will have to be surrendered to him. But the imaginary god is surrendered
to you – that’s the joy.</p><p><br></p><p>So in Sweden, you must have been doing things to me of which I am not
aware. Here you cannot do those things to me – I am not your
imagination. But your imagination is not going to give you a new life.
And your imagination is not going to open your eyes to the ultimate
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>I can help you to be authentic, to be joyous, to be ecstatic, but you
will have to pay the price. And the price is not much – I just want your
dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Give me your dreams, and I can give you reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Reality is already with you; your dreams are like clouds, hiding it.
Just give me your dreams. I ask nothing from my disciples except their
dreams, their lies, their falsities.</p><p><br></p><p>And once they are without any falseness, they don’t need anything
from anybody. They have everything within themselves. They have brought
it with their birth.</p><p><br></p><p>So you can decide. Either you can go alone to Sweden, or if you want
me also to be with you, then you will have to wait a little more, gather
courage. If so many people with open hearts have not died, if so many
people are ready and available for my love, for my blessings, for my
being, for my presence<span class=s4></span>And no harm has happened
to them, except that they have become a little crazy. They</p><p>sing more, they dance more, they laugh more, they love more. They are
more. So you can choose.</p><p><br></p><p>Carina Anderson, be very careful in choosing, because you may not
find a man like me again. Sweden will remain there. I am not going to be
here always. And when you have come so far, just a little more, a little
closer<span class=s4></span>And you know perfectly well how to open
the heart, because you</p><p>were doing it in Sweden. You know perfectly well how to be loving and
joyful. Give it a try here too.</p><p>Nobody is ever harmed by love, and nobody is ever harmed by opening
the heart. Everybody has always become more enriched, more blessed.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can choose reality – or your dreams. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ONCE YOU SAID TO ME THAT I AM ENERGY AND AWARENESS. I USE THIS AS A
KEY. THE OTHER DAY, WHILE SPEAKING ABOUT THE DISCIPLE TOUCHING THE
MASTER’S FEET, YOU SAID ENERGY ALWAYS MOVES DOWNWARDS, LIKE WATER. I
HAVE FELT ENERGY SHOWERING DOWN, BUT I HAVE ALSO FELT ENERGY SOARING
UPWARDS, LIKE A FLAME. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Shunyo, life has so many aspects, that it is almost impossible
to contain all those aspects in one statement. When I said that energy
always moves downwards, like water, it was in a particular context. The
context was the disciple touching the feet of the master.</p><p><br></p><p>If he wants to get the master’s energy he has to be humble, and
available to the downgoing energy. Just as, in the East, for centuries
the disciple has been touching the feet of the master, the master has
been touching the head of the disciple with his hands. This way the
disciple gets energy on his own accord, from the feet; and from the
master’s hands, compassion. And a circle starts happening. If the
disciple is not holding himself back, then he will feel what Amrito was
calling “orgasm,” energy showering on the disciple from the master; but
it is energy coming from above, downwards. This was the context, when I
said all energy moves downwards.</p><p><br></p><p>But your experience is absolutely true. When the master’s energy
showers on the disciple, and if the disciple is totally ready, the
energy is so much that the disciple becomes aflame; the energy becomes
fire. And like flames, the energy starts moving upwards. You all have
felt it without understanding it. Sometimes you feel your hands are
moving upwards, in spite of yourself. You are not doing it. You are not
the doer; your hands have become like a flame which wants to reach to
the stars. This is the overflow of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily energy moves downwards; but if the disciple is able to
attract the master’s energy in such quantity that it starts flowing all
around him, he cannot contain it – it is too much to contain. The very
fact of abundance makes the energy move upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>And the feeling, Shunyo, is perfectly right. You say, “I have felt
energy showering down, but I have also felt energy soaring upwards, like
a flame.” That is the second step. First, you have to be so humble –
just like a valley – that from the mountains, rivers can descend into
you. Once you have too much... you should remember that at a certain
point, quantitative changes become qualitative changes.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, at one hundred degrees water suddenly starts
evaporating, moving upwards. Ordinarily water flows downwards, but at a
hundred degrees of heat a qualitative change happens. The whole
direction changes; the water becomes a new phenomena: vapor. It is the
same water</p><p>– it starts moving upwards. Almost similar is the case if energy
falling into you makes you so hot, so full... then you will feel a
second step: the energy moving upwards like flames. So whatever you have
experienced is not against reality.</p><p><br></p><p>What I was saying was only in a particular context. In Shunyo’s
context I can also be a witness. I have seen it, and many of you may
have felt that whenever I come close to her, she starts moving her hands
upwards – not only her hands upwards, but she starts saying things
that... I don’t think she understands what she is saying. The whole
experience is just so much that it wants expression.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly, it is going to happen to everyone. But only when it
happens is it meaningful to talk to you about it. I don’t say many
things to you. I will wait for the right moment, when you have some
experience, so that my words don’t just go above your heads but go
directly like arrows into your hearts.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN YOU ARE DANCING, SOMETIMES YOU SUDDENLY LIFT YOUR ARMS HIGH AND
STOP IN MID-AIR FOR A MOMENT. IN THAT MOMENT, FOR ME, EVERYTHING STOPS,
DISAPPEARS, AND THEN I FEEL MYSELF LIFTED UPWARDS, TOO. IT IS AN
EXQUISITE FEELING. OSHO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH US? IT SEEMS THAT THE
FORMLESS IS RESPONDING TO THE FORMLESS.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Arup, you are right. It is the formless responding to the
formless. Just like Shunyo, this is your experience and may be the
experience of a few other people.</p><p><br></p><p>There are moments when suddenly I stop for a second, just to give you
a taste – the taste when everything stops: time, space, mind, everything
stops. But it is possible only if you are totally in tune with me and
you are moving with me. If you are partially with me, then the
experience will not happen. If you are totally with me and moving with
me and then suddenly I stop, I give you a moment which is certainly
exquisite, a moment of ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “What are You doing to us?” I am trying to get you to
come back home. You have gone far away, wandering after ephemeral
things, wandering after dreams. And I want you to come back home –
because that which can give you contentment, that which can give you
fulfillment is not out there, it is in here; it is not in any other
time, but now. And the feeling of a stop – a total stop</p><p>– is nothing but an experience of herenow.</p><p><br></p><p>I can give you only the taste, and once you have got the taste, then
you will be in search of it. Then there is no way to prevent you. The
most fundamental thing is a taste. You have heard words, beautiful
words, but they have not driven you into a mad search. I want to give
not only words to you, but some content. And that is possible only by
giving you some taste.</p><p><br></p><p>And the time is ripe. For so many of my sannyasins, the first flowers
of spring have started showing. More and more flowers will be
blossoming. And you have to be very impatiently patient – with a deep
longing, but without any demands. Because I cannot be here forever. And
I have waited long</p><p>enough; now it is time that I should start giving you the taste.
Words I have given you many – that was a preparation. Seeds I have sown
many, and now that the spring is very close, you have to be courageous,
and total, and intensively with me – in my silence, in my joy.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time that the duality between you and me is dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are intelligent should drop it immediately. Those who are a
little less intelligent will take a little time. I have a little time
more to linger on your shore... but it cannot be very long.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ALTHOUGH YOU DON’T KNOW ME PERSONALLY, EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. HOW
IS THIS POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Prageet, I don’t know anybody personally, but I know everybody
essentially, I know everybody spiritually.</p><p><br></p><p>Personality is a false thing. It is a mask: your name, your address,
your profession, your photograph – passport size – your identity cards.
What is your personality made of? – just these kind of things. Otherwise
you come into the world without any name, without any address, without
any religion, without any nation, without any race. You come as just a
tabula rasa – so clean, so clear, crystal clear. That is your
essentiality. But that is the essentiality of everyone, so it does not
matter whether I know you personally or not. All personalities are
false. And the essential being within you is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The day I came to know myself, I came to know you too.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why everything is happening. I can understand your puzzlement,
your problem: how is this possible? Because people think that unless you
are known personally, how can I do anything for you? The reality is just
the opposite: Unless I know you spiritually, I cannot do anything. And
you don’t know your own spirituality. You know your face, just the way
the mirror shows it. Have you seen a house of mirrors, where there are
different kinds of mirrors? In some mirrors you are so long, like a
pillar; in some mirrors you are so small, like a pygmy; in some mirrors
you even get afraid seeing your own face. But have you any guarantee
that the mirror you have in your bathroom is the right mirror? And who
decides what is the right mirror? But that is your only acquaintance
with yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story about Mulla Nasruddin: He had gone for a
pilgrimage to Kaaba, the Mohammedan holy land. And there were millions
of pilgrims – because it is expected by the Mohammedan scriptures that
every Mohammedan, at least once in his life, must go to Kaaba; otherwise
he is not considered to be a real Mohammedan.</p><p><br></p><p>So even the poorest Mohammedans sell their houses, sell their
ornaments, their land, everything, because at least once in their life
they have to go to Kaaba. So every year there is a great gathering. All
caravanserais are full, all hotels are full.</p><p>Nowhere was there any vacancy, and Mulla was very tired. He clung to
the feet of the manager of a hotel and he said, “Whatever you can do...
but there must be some place in your big hotel, and I’m so tired –
walking in the desert for miles. Just have mercy on me!”</p><p><br></p><p>The manager said, “I can understand your trouble, but all the rooms
are full. Only one room can I manage to smuggle you into, because the
man who is staying inside is snoring so loudly, he will not be able to
know. You go silently and sleep. At least till morning that man is not
going to wake up, and even if he wakes up, he will not find me. In the
morning we will see – somehow we will persuade him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla went in; the room was a double bedroom. The man was snoring, so
the manager left him there. And Mulla lay went on the bed with his
shoes, with his cap, with his coat, everything – just as he was when he
entered the hotel. Naturally it was very difficult to sleep with his
shoes and his hat and his coat, and it was hot – Saudi Arabia is the
hottest place – and on top of it all, the snoring man was by his side.
He was snoring so loudly that even if you were at ease you could not
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla was tossing and turning – his tossing and turning woke up the
man. And the man watched in the darkness of the room to see what was
happening. Slowly, slowly he could see that Mulla had his shoes on, cap
on, coat on... and it was so hot. He could not resist the
temptation.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Listen, in the first place you have illegally entered my
room. I have booked the whole room, for the simple reason that I snore
so much that if somebody else is there he cannot sleep. And if he cannot
sleep, then he creates trouble, and then I cannot sleep. But you kept
silent for so long and suddenly you started tossing and turning. I
opened my eyes; I said, ‘My God, again another person!’ But forget all
about it – it is midnight, where will you go? But why do you have your
shoes and cap on?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, “There is a problem. The problem is that if I
take off my shoes, and my cap, and my coat – and in fact I am accustomed
to sleeping naked, and unless I am naked I cannot sleep – if I take off
everything and go to sleep naked, you are also sleeping naked. That is
the trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But what is the trouble? I am sleeping naked, you are sleeping
naked.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “You don’t understand. In the morning, how am I going to
recognize who is who? Just to keep my identity, I was keeping my hat, my
shoes, my coat. That way I will be certain that there is no problem: I
am Mulla Nasruddin, this guy is somebody else. But both naked.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I will suggest one thing to you, because this way
neither you can sleep nor I can sleep.” And the man also thought that
this was a strange type of man, who thinks that if he is naked he will
lose his identity. He said, “Just before us, a family must have stayed
in the room, and their child has left a doll. So what I will do is I
will tie the doll to your feet, and then you can sleep perfectly well.
In the morning you can see that the doll is on your feet, so you are
Mulla Nasruddin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “I’m so grateful to you.” He dropped all his clothes, and
the other man found that doll in a corner and tied it to the feet of
Mulla. The man was laughing all the time inside, thinking “I have never
come across such a man.” And then he had an idea in the middle<span class=s4></span>when Mulla was snoring,</p><p>he changed the doll. He tied it to his own feet and went to
sleep.</p><p>In the morning when Mulla looked at his feet, he jumped out of his
bed, ran out of the room, naked, shouting, “One thing is certain: that
man is Mulla Nasruddin. The problem is: who am I? Can anybody say? Can
anybody recognize me? Where is the manager? He had seen me in the night,
perhaps he can recognize me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Your personalities are nothing but dolls tied to your feet. I don’t
have to know your personal life, your personality. I don’t have to be
acquainted with you personally; I know you essentially. By knowing
myself, I have known you all. By dissolving my own problems I know your
problems, and I know the key to how they can be dissolved.</p><p><br></p><p>The day I became aware of myself I came to know the sinner and the
saint both. I have known those who are asleep, and those who have become
awakened. So there is no problem in it. If you are here listening to
me... and all that I am saying is: drop your personality, drop your ego.
Be humble, and be open. Be silent, be alert and conscious, and miracles
are bound to happen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember: I will not be responsible for those miracles. You
yourself will be responsible for your miracles. You need not even feel
thankful towards me. Your gratitude has to go towards the whole
existence. I was just a stranger who met you on the way, and we talked a
little, gossiped a little – I don’t have gospels, but only gossips – and
then we parted, you on your own way, I on my own way.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need for me to know you personally, nor is there any need
for you to know me personally. What is needed is an essential bridge
between your being and my being. In silence that happens
automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

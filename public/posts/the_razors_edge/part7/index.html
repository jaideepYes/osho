AND WHAT TO DO WITH THE SECRETS IN OUR HEARTS WHEN THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPRESS THEM?\nKrishna Priya, there is some misunderstanding. There is no question in the world which cannot be asked. Yes, there are answers which cannot be answered. A question always comes from the mind; hence the mind always finds appropriate words for it. But the answer comes from your very being, from your depths of silence where no words have ever entered. The territory of the words and language is the mind, and that is also the territory of the questions. Every question can be brought into words – only when you start feeling the answers, then the problem arises.\nI have been watching you for almost ten years. You have gone through such a transformation that what you are thinking is a question, is not a question. You have come very close to the answer – that’s why you cannot find words. But this is something that happens very rarely to very blessed souls. You should feel blissful, fortunate and grateful to existence.\nThe misunderstanding is also very natural, because the mind is well acquainted only with questions. When for the first time you are pregnant with an answer, it is a natural misunderstanding of the mind that there is some question because the answer, mind knows not, and the answer, mind cannot express.\nYou are saying, “What to do with the question when there are no words for it?” Then it is absolutely certain it is not a question. It is an answer, and you are not supposed to do anything at all.\nA question has to be solved:\nAn answer has to be lived.\nSo what is arising in you – the peace, the silence, the joy that I can see in your eyes, on your face, the tremendous change... because you used to be very seriousYou have moved almost\none-hundred-and-eighty degrees. You radiate joy.\nDrop the misunderstanding that it is a question and rejoice that it is the answer. It will never find any words; it has never found any expression. Yes, your eyes may show it, your face may radiate it, your very gestures may have the grace of it, but words are too small and too trivial and too mundane – their approach is very limited.\nThe answer is beyond the mind. Those who go on seeking through the mind go on coming upon new questions. The very few people who have found the answer are those who have gone beyond mind, beyond words, beyond language.\nYou are saying, “And what to do with the secrets in our hearts when there is no way to express them?” Nothing has to be done; they will find their way of their own accord.\nYou have to understand one thing very clearly: there are things which you cannot do, but which happen. If somebody says to you,“love me”... now, love cannot be commanded, love cannot be ordered, and if – according to the order and according to the commandment – you make an effort to love, it is going to be phony; it cannot be an authentic reality.\nWhat is arising in your being is thrilling your heart. It will find its own way to happen – in a dance, in a song, or in just deep silence which is not negative, but immensely full.in some creativity, or\nanything that you do – your being will find its way to do it in a new way that you have never done before, with great love.\nYou are not supposed to find expression for your experiences and the secrets that are arising in your being. They are far bigger than you; you cannot manage them. You are left far behind; those secrets, those answers happen only when you are not. Who is going to express them? Neither are there words to express, nor is there a person to express them. Now the experience itself will find its way, just as the rivers find their way to the ocean, just as roots find their way rising into trees and blossoming into flowers.\nLooking at the roots and the flowers you may not see any connection at all – roots are ugly, and the flowers are so beautiful – but all the juice and all the color and all the beauty and all the fragrance that the flower has, have been given by the roots. The roots have been carrying those flowers for years in their womb. The seeds are never beautiful, but they can give birth to great beauty. You just wait.…\nI can understand your impatience, because you are too full and you want to shower just like a raincloud, but it is not within your capacity. Neither have you found it, nor is it in your hands to\nexpress it. On the contrary, it will be right to say it has found you. And now it will find its way in some creative act, in some loving act, in something that indicates that it is not coming from the mind. You have given it birth just as a woman gives birth to a child. She does not create it; it grows of its own accord, and a day comes when it comes out of the womb.\nEvery meditator has to remember it: One day you will be pregnant with God – whether you are man or woman does not matter – and the unknown will find its way. You are simply to relax and follow it.\nYou are not to become a guide, but you have to be guided by it. You have to become just a shadow. It becomes the reality and you become the shadow, and wherever the reality moves, the shadow moves. This is the experience everybody else is waiting here for. And the same question will be asked by many, sometime or other.\nIt is good, Krishna Priya, that you have asked it, because it is not only your question, it is going to be the question of many. Those who can be patient enough, those who can wait for the divine to take shape in their being, will have the same question, exactly in the same words.\nBut don’t become tense because the experience is so new. And don’t be afraid, because it may lead you in new ways which you are not acquainted with, untrodden by you ever before – not even dreamt, not even imagined.\nThis is the moment when trust is needed. Trust in existence, not in any belief system, not in any priest, not in any church, not in any holy book, but in existence. All around you the trees are so deeply trusting, the rivers are trusting, the mountains are trusting, the millions of stars are trusting. The whole existence is a tremendous experiment of trust.\nAnd this is the right moment for you to become part of this immense experiment of trust. Let life lead your way. Give your hand to existence without any doubt and without any question. And never ask where it is leading you – it always leads to your destiny, and it never fails.\nThose who cannot trust, they fail, because they think themselves wiser than the whole world, the whole existence. What is your wisdom? What is your intelligence? not even a dewdrop. And when the ocean has called you, trust it – take a jump and disappear into it.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU ARE THE WELL. ALL THE TIME WHEN I CAME THERE WAS FRESH WATER WAITING FOR ME, CLEANING AND PURIFYING ME, TAKING ME APART AND PUTTING ME TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT, MORE BEAUTIFUL WAY. NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FEEL THE COURAGE TO BE SO CLOSE THAT I CAN SEE MY FACE MIRRORED IN YOUR WATER. I’M AFRAID, OSHO, AND ALSO FULL OF JOY.\nChitbodhi, man is accustomed to misery; hence, he is never afraid of misery. However great, when misery happens, he knows it.\nBut man is absolutely unacquainted with joy. He has forgotten the very language of joy. His mind is full of tensions, anxieties, anguishes, anger, violence, jealousy. Nothing makes him afraid – they are all old companions, he knows them perfectly well. He has lived with them, although it has been a suffering, it has been a hell. But this is one of the significant factors to be understood about man: he can adapt himself to any conditions.\nIt happened in Egypt nearabout three thousand years ago: There was a monastery, and the monastery had an underground graveyard. Whenever any monk died, the great stone that was covering the way to the graveyard underneath was removed, and the monk’s body was lowered down in deep darkness. The tunnel was miles long – a natural tunnel.\nThousands of monks have been lowered into that tunnel, and according to the Egyptian convention every monk was given some money, some clothes, and some food, because he was going for a pilgrimage. It was sixty feet deep and miles long.\nIt happened that a monk had not died, but was in a coma. Others thought that he had died, and they opened the graveyard, lowered the monk, closed the graveyard... and after a few hours the monk came to consciousness. He could not believe where he was – immense darkness, darkness so deep, as he had never seen, because not even a ray of light had ever entered into that tunnel. And such a stink, because so many dead bodies had become rotten – all around there were bodies and bodies, and they were all dead.\nHe shouted as much as he could, although he knew deep down that his voice would not reach to the monks in the monastery because it was sixty feet deep and then a huge rock always closed.… He had himself closed that rock many times. But as a last resort, he tried shouting with all his might, “I am alive!” But nobody heard it.\nAnd you will be surprised to know the immense adaptability of man. You may think that he must have committed suicide – you are wrong. He lived in the hope that someday some monk will die, and the rock will be removed – then he can shout.\nBut meanwhile there was a little food that he has been sent with, and after that food, he started eating rotten food sent with other dead bodies which had become just skeletons.\nIt took ten years for another monk to die, although this monk was praying every day to God, “There are so many old monks” But God has never heard anybody. Over the time of ten years he became\na cannibal; he started eating the flesh of dead bodies. Not only that, he started collecting the money that had been given to each monk when he died, and the clothes – in the hope that when he would be rescued, he would take all these clothes and all this money.\nAnd slowly, slowly he forgot that the graveyard was stinking; he forgot that he was living the ugliest life possible. For water, there was nothing else than the water that was coming from the rocks, and he knew that the water was from the gutters of the monastery. He started drinking that water; he could not have even touched it before, but there was no other way. The lust for life is so tremendous that man can manageThat water which was coming was so dirty, but for him it was almost nectar;\nit was life-giving. And he was the only living man in that miles-long tunnel.\nAs he was moving around in the darkness, slowly, slowly his eyes became accustomed to seeing a little bit in the darkness. And dead people, just skeletons – nobody was there to prevent him, so he was searching everybody, finding money, clothes.\nAnd when after ten years the rock was removed, he shouted back up. People had completely forgotten about him. They pulled him out, but he said, “First you pull up my clothes” – he had a big pile of clothes. People could not believe that.… Then he said, “Now pull up my money.” So they pulled up his money – he had collected the money from thousands of people. After all his treasures were taken out, he came out.\nIt was difficult for him to open his eyes in the sunlight. He had grown such a long beard that it was touching the floor, and he was looking so healthy. People could not believe it and said, “How have you managed? You used to be very thin, and you have collected so much weight!” And when they heard his story they could not believe that a man can do this. When you think about it, putting yourself in his placeFirst it is shocking, but soon you will understand that what he did, you would\nhave done also.\nHe lived twenty years more. And again his eyes became accustomed to light. Now he himself could not believe that those ten years – it seemed almost like a nightmare that is ended.\nChitbodhi, you are afraid because you are feeling the first stirrings of joy. It is unknown territory. Your heart you are feeling for the first time. The heart is not just what the medical people say, or the physiologists say – a pumping station. The heart that the mystics and the poets talk about has nothing to do with the heart that medical science talks about.\nBehind almost every physical organ there is a parallel to it – just behind it, a spiritual receptivity. Behind your eyes, there are eyes which see things, which these eyes cannot see. And behind your ears, there are ears which can hear music, that these ears cannot hear. And behind your physical heart, there is a spiritual heart which knows love – which this heart has no idea about – which knows joy.\nThe physical heart can be changed, and a plastic heart may be far better because a plastic heart cannot have a heart failure. There are, around the world, thousands of people moving about with an artificial heart. But that artificial heart cannot love. Just put two artificial hearts close to each other and see what kind of dialogue happens. Nothing will happen; there are just two dead things. They can do the function of purifying your blood, of taking in the oxygen, of throwing out the carbon dioxide; but love is neither oxygen nor carbon dioxide. Love is not a question of breathing – everybody is breathing.\nSo remember, whenever I talk about the heart, I am not talking about the heart medical science talks about – this is something behind it. Each of your senses has a parallel sense behind it.\nIf you hear me, you can hear in two ways. Either you can hear only with your outer ear, or you can hear with your inner ear too. When your outer and inner ear both hear, then it is listening; otherwise it is only hearing.\nWhen your outer eyes and inner eyes both see, then the same existence becomes so psychedelic, so colorful.The same tree is greener than it has ever been – and not only greener, each leaf has\nits own energy aura. The whole tree is surrounded by an energy aura, radiating rays.\nIn the Soviet Union one man has developed a new photography, Kirlian photography. He uses such sensitive plates that he can picture not only the trees in his plates, but trees with their energy aura surrounding them.\nWhen your inner eyes are together with your outer eyes and there is a harmony, you will see this whole existence is a festival of lights, that everything is radiating light, is surrounded by beautiful light, soft... every man is surrounded.\nAnd a man can be known by his aura. The ordinary man has only nearabout a one-inch aura all around his body, but as your meditation deepens your aura becomes bigger – two inches, three inches, four inches, five inches.\nAs your meditation deepens you are surrounded with more and more light coming from your inner being.\nYou have seen the pictures of Buddha or Jesus with a circle of light around their head, an aura, and people think that it is simply mythology. Now Kirlian photography proves it – it is not mythology. Kirlian photography says that that kind of round aura happens only when somebody has reached to his very innermost core, when somebody is awakened – a Gautam Buddha. Then his whole head radiates something of the eternal.\nBut when things start happening for the first time, one feels afraid. When a young boy, fourteen years old, becomes for the first time aware of his sexuality, he feels afraid, embarrassed, becomes very uptight, is worried: “What is happening? If somebody comes to knowAnd what am I supposed\nto do with it?” A new energy has become available of which he was not aware at all up to now. And when spiritual energy becomes available to you, it is a million-times-bigger phenomenon.You feel\njoy, you feel blissfulness, and at the same time a trembling, a fear – but this fear will disappear.\nIt is a natural process. As you become more and more accustomed to the new state of joyfulness, fear will be reduced. Soon you will find there is no fear at all. And to be fearless is a tremendously great achievement, because fear is part of your death. If you become fearless, you have tasted something which is deathless.\nIn your joy you have come close to the deathless, in your joy you have come to your immortality.\nYou are saying, Chitbodhi, “You are the well. All the time when I came there was fresh water waiting for me – cleaning and purifying me, taking me apart and putting me together in a different more beautiful way. Now, for the first time, I feel the courage to be so close that I can see my face mirrored in your water. I’m afraid, Osho, and also full of joy.”\nGive all your energy to joy, and fear will disappear. Ignore fear, don’t pay any attention to fear, because the more attention you pay to it, the longer it will linger on. Pour yourself totally in the direction from where joy is arising, and fear will disappear just as darkness disappears when you bring light in.\nJoy is light. And joy is the beginning of a great pilgrimage which ends in finding God. So go on – without any fear, because existence always protects those who trust it. Relax, give yourself to\nexistence and allow the joy to overwhelm you. Let it become your wings, so that you can reach to the stars.\nA joyful heart is very close to the stars.\nIt is only the sad and the sorrowful and the miserable who are going towards hell. They are creating their hell. The joyful and the singing and the dancing and the celebrating are creating their paradise by each of their songs, by each of their dances.\nIt is in your hands whether to create paradise or to fall into a darkness, into hellfire. These are not outside you; these both are within you. It all depends what you choose to be.\nChoose to be divine, choose to be more and more a celebrant, choose to be festive, so more and more flowers can blossom in your being, and more and more fragrance can become available to you.\nAnd this way will not only help you, Chitbodhi, it will help all those with whom you come in contact. Joy is as infectious as any disease. When you see a few people dancing, suddenly you feel your feet are ready. You may try to control them, because control has been taught to you, but your body wants to join the dance. Whenever you have an opportunity to laugh, join; whenever you have an opportunity to dance, join; whenever you have an opportunity to sing, sing – and one day you will find you have created your paradise.\nIt is not that one goes to paradise; paradise is not somewhere in the sky – it is something that one creates around himself.\nIt is a good beginning. With all my blessings, go deeper, in spite of any fear. Never listen to negative things, because if you listen to them they can poison you, they can destroy your joy – keep it pure, unpolluted. And here are people who will dance with you, who will celebrate, because you have taken the first step towards God.\nAnd I want to remind you that the first step is almost half the journey. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHIS VERSE I SEND TO YOU FROM “GITANJALI.” IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, LIKE YOU, MASTER. “I KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER,\nI EVER LISTEN IN SILENT AMAZEMENT.\nTHE LIGHT OF THY MUSIC ILLUMINES THE WORLD,\nTHE LIFE BREATH OF THY MUSIC RUNS FROM SKY TO SKY, THE HOLY STREAM OF THY MUSIC BREAKS THROUGH ALL\nSTONY OBSTACLES AND RUSHES ON. MY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY SONG, BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR VOICE.\nI WOULD SPEAK, BUT SPEECH BREAKS NOT INTO SONG,\nAND I CRY OUT BAFFLED, AH, THOU HAS MADE MY HEART CAPTIVE IN THE ENDLESS MESHES OF THY MUSIC, MY MASTER.”\nChandra, Rabindranath Tagore, although he belongs to this century, echoes thousands-of-years\n-old longings and dreams of the East. He belongs to the seers of the UPANISHADS. He is the only man this century has produced whose words can be compared to the five-thousand-year-old UPANISHADS.\nThose UPANISHADS were songs of the first seers of humanity, but it is a strange fact that truth remains the same. Everything changes, but the truth is eternal. Five thousand years of distance, but whatever Rabindranath sings, appears to be coming from the days of the UPANISHADS, of those days of humanity’s childhood – so innocent and so pure.\nMan was not yet corrupted by religions, organized faiths; man was not yet under the slavery of the priests; man was not yet divided into Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians and Jews. Humanity was still one.\nThe seers of the UPANISHADS were as innocent as every child is – it was easy for them to sing those beautiful songs of tremendous meaning. But for Rabindranath, being a twentieth-century man, it was certainly a miracle that he dropped five thousand years of knowledgeability and became a child again. Every mystic has to become a child again.\nThese few lines are from “Gitanjali,” Rabindranath’s book for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Gitanjali means “offering of songs.”\nSomebody asked Rabindranath, “Why have you chosen this title?” He said, “I don’t have anything else to offer to God except my imperfect songs.”\nOn his death bed, an old friend had come to console Rabindranath, and he told him, “You should be dying with absolute contentment, because you are perhaps the greatest poet in the whole world.” In the West, Shelley has two thousand songs which can be put to music. Rabindranath has six thousand songs, and of far greater significance than any of the songs that Shelley has. That old friend was saying to Rabindranath, “You should die absolutely contented. You have achieved something – a peak no one has ever been able to achieve.”\nRabindranath opened his eyes and said, “Keep quiet! – because I know I have not been able to sing the song I had come to sing. I am an utter failure. I am dying with tears in my eyes.” And he did die with tears in his eyes.\nHe said to his friend, “I am praying to God! ‘Give me a little time more, because in this whole life that you have given to me, I have been simply arranging my instruments. Now that the instruments are ready, you are taking me away – and the song that I have come to sing remains unsung.’”\nThe friend could not believe what Rabindranath was saying. He said, “Then what about your six thousand songs?”\nRabindranath said, “Those are all failures. Six thousand efforts to sing the song that I have come to sing, but each time I failed. I was trying hard to sing the song that was just on my tongue, but the moment I expressed it, it was something else. It was not the same quality, the same depth, the same beauty. When it was within me it was a living reality, and when it was spoken it was something dead. People have appreciated my songs, and I have been crying in my nights, ‘Will I be able to sing it? Or I will always be a failure.’”\nThis is one of the fundamental qualities of greatness, because the longing and the dream are so high, and the human reach is so small. The longing is for the moon, and the human reach is so small that only small people can be contented about their creativity. The greater the man, the more he will feel he has failed.\nAlthough Rabindranath has given such beautiful songs that there is no comparison, he had a comparison which nobody from the outside had any idea about. He had a song deep in his soul, very alive, ready to burst forth, and he always compared his songs with his inner feeling. He found that what he wanted to express had remained behind. Although he had been able to put together beautiful words, the life was no longer in them, the heart was no longer beating in them. They are faraway echoes of the song he wanted to sing.\nI KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER.\nHe is asking God Himself...\nI KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER. I EVER LISTEN IN SILENT AMAZEMENT.\nTHE LIGHT OF THY MUSIC ILLUMINES THE WORLD,\nTHE LIFE BREATH OF THY MUSIC RUNS FROM SKY TO SKY, THE HOLY STREAM OF THY MUSIC BREAKS THROUGH\nALL STONY OBSTACLES AND RUSHES ON. MY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY SONG, BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR VOICE.\nI HAVE GOT THE SONG, BUT WHERE IS THE VOICE?\nWHERE ARE THE WORDS?”\nHe is saying, “You have given me the song, but you have made me so poor that I don’t have the voice to sing it” – and he was a beautiful singer, he was a great musician. He created a new kind of music altogether, which is called “Rabindra music.”\nIndia has a tremendously long history of great musicians; it has explored all the dimensions possible, and for hundreds of years nobody has been able to add anything new. Rabindranath has added a new dimension, but still his longing is so great that whatever he does falls short.\nMY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY SONG, BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR VOICE.\nI WOULD SPEAK, BUT SPEECH BREAKS NOT INTO SONG, AND I CRY OUT BAFFLED...\nWhen he was awarded the Nobel prize and he addressed the Nobel committee, he said, “You have awarded my tears. As far as the songs are concerned, I am still struggling to find voice for them.”\nAH, THOU HAS MADE MY HEART CAPTIVE IN THE ENDLESS MESHES OF THY MUSIC, MY MASTER.\nYou have imprisoned me in endless meshes of music; I am unable to find the way out. I tried this way, I tried that way – my whole life I have been trying and trying and trying – but nothing seems to succeed.\nThis awareness makes him not only a poet, but a mystic too. In this whole century there have been many poets, but Rabindranath is a category by himself.\nThe poets, the painters, the musicians, the sculptors are very egoist people; they are continuously bragging about their painting, about their music, about their poetry. Rabindranath belongs to a totally different category – he is so humble. And I would like to say to you that the greater you are, the humbler you become. The higher the peak of your being, the deeper will be the valley by your side. The greater your being, the deeper will be your feeling that you could have done much more, but you have done so little.\nThe last words he said on his deathbed were, “I am worried. What will I say to God? – that you had sent me to sing just one song, and I could not even manage to do it.”\nThis should also be the experience of all meditators, because the deeper your meditation goes, the more and more your ego disappears. Finally it leaves you just a nobody – anonymous, no name, no fame. In that great nothingness, you become one with the whole universe.\nQuestion 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIT SEEMS, THAT EVERYWHERE WE ARE, AND NOW THAT WE ARE IN INDIA, THE SAME STUPID, SILLY, SKY-ROCKETING CHARGES ARE PUT ON US. THESE REPRESSED BEINGS – POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE, VIOLENT PEOPLE, GREEDY PEOPLE – WOULD THREATEN US WITH BULLDOZERS AND FORCED ENTRIES INTO THE ASHRAM. THEY ALSO CHARGE US WITH OBSCENITY, DRUGS, ETC. OSHO, YOU HAVE BEEN TOO COMPASSIONATE WITH ALL THESE IDIOTS – THE BLIND, THE DEAF, AND THE DUMB SOCIETY. KINDLY PUT MORE LIGHT ON THIS BURNING ISSUE.\nGurudayal Singh, it is a right observation that the people are blind, that they are deaf, that they are insane, that they are utterly prejudiced, irrational in their beliefs. But because of all this, they need more compassion. You cannot say that because people are sick and ill the doctor should simply leave them. When people are sick and ill they need more compassion.\nIt is a great opportunity for you. In spite of their misbehavior, mistreatment, ugly lies, you can still remain silent, peaceful, loving and compassionate. And if you become enlightened in this society, the whole credit will go to the society. There is no need to be angry about them. What can they do? They have been handed down all this garbage for centuries. They are victims; they need all the compassion that is possible.\nI would like you to remember Jesus. At the last moment on the cross he raised his eyes and hands towards the sky and said, “Father, forgive these people, because they know not what they are doing.” In that moment Jesus reached his highest experience of life, his highest ecstasy. The love and the compassion that were in his eyes and heart for those who were crucifying him have made him go through a fire test, and he came out pure gold.\nSo I can understand... the world is going to be against me. It is not their fault, it is my fault. They are fast asleep, dreaming great dreams, and I am trying to wake them up. Naturally they are getting angry. They are living with their beliefs, consoled, and I am disturbing their beliefs. I am trying to say to them, “Your beliefs are only beliefs; you have to drop them and to search for truth on your own.”\nBecause I am disturbing their consolation, the fault is mine. And of course they are in the majority. People ordinarily think that if so many people are thinking in the same way as they think, it must be true. But they don’t know that truth is not to be decided by voting; truth is to be decided by experience.\nThe whole world may be against me, still it does not disturb me, for the simple reason that whatever I am saying is my own experience; I am saying it on my own authority. And those who are with me – and Gurudayal Singh has been with me for almost twenty-five years, a beautiful human being – naturally get worried and concerned, “What kind of humanity have we got?”\nAll the countries proclaim democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, respect for the individual, and every country practices just the opposite. There is no respect for the individual; there is no respect for individual freedom of expression.\nJust a few days ago, one of my friends was looking at the files of the CID department in New Delhi, because the chief of the CID department is his friend, and the chief was not aware that he is my friend also. He saw my name there... all kinds of charges, without any evidence.\nThe chief told him first, “He is a dangerous man.” Now you should give some evidence. Have I killed somebody? Have I thrown any bomb or dynamite at somebody? Am I a terrorist, a murderer? But no, just this much is enough, “He is a dangerous man, and he has to be silenced.”\nMy friend was very much shocked and he asked the chief, “What do you mean, ‘he has to be silenced?’ Do you mean he has to be assassinated, killed?”\nHe said, “No, that is not the meaning of it. ‘Silenced’ means we have to make every effort that no country allows him in, and we will not allow people coming from other countries to meet him. Naturally, he will not be able to corrupt people’s minds.”\nMy friend just jokingly said, “But have you any evidence that he has corrupted anybody’s mind? And do you remember – the same was the charge against Socrates, that he corrupts people’s minds?”\nAnd just today I received from the police commissioner a new list in which he states that every talk that I deliver should be taped by the police. And before it is published they will scrutinize it they will do the editing work. And he said, “I have come from Bombay – meeting my boss – receiving all these instructions.”\nOne of my sannyasins has asked the parliament in Germany, “It is now over one year since you decided that Osho cannot enter into Germany. In the first place, it was absolutely illegal to say that Osho cannot enter into Germany. It was absolutely illegal – a man who has never been to your country, who has never broken any of your laws, who has done no harm to anybody in Germany.… Why should the parliament decide that this man cannot enter? Not only that, but his jet airplane cannot land on any airport in Germany, even for refueling. It is time that you withdraw it.”\nSo it has been reconsidered, and today I received their reconsidered order. Again the same charges that, “He is a dangerous man, and his entry into Germany will disturb many people. He is on the list of the international police, Interpol, as a wanted man. So we cannot withdraw the order – the order is reinforced.”\nBut I love the words, “He is a wanted man by the Interpol.” At least some consolation – somebody, somewhere wants me.\nGurudayal, don’t take these people seriously, because crucifixion is out of date. And they have committed that mistake once. By crucifying Jesus they created Christianity, and Jews are still repenting about it.\nI am not saying this without any foundation. The attorney general of America, answering a press conference, said, “We did not put Osho into jail because we don’t want him to become a martyr. That will help his disciples to become more sympathetic, more loving towards him, more surrendered towards him. We cannot take that risk.”\nBut the desire is clear – if the risk was not there, they would have liked to put me into jail for my whole life, or to kill me – but the fear that that may create a greater movement.What I cannot do\nalive, their killing me may do.\nIn two thousand years people have learned something; otherwise there is no reason.If they had\npoisoned Socrates, killed Mansoor, crucified Jesus, they could have killed me any day. The desire is there, but also a great fear: If they kill me, then my words and my people will become stronger, my death will bring them together. My people will become a force in changing the whole future of humanity.\nSo they are trying more sophisticated ways: silencing me.\nThey don’t know that, according to me, they are only retarded people. If they can find a way of preventing my people, I can find a way of bringing my people there. For the whole year they have been trying to silence me, and I am still speaking. And all the governments of the world and all the religious heads of the world are together in the conspiracy against a single man – that shows how much intelligence they have.\nI told my sannyasins, “Drop the orange clothes, drop the mala, so there is no identity left that you are sannyasins.” Unless India wants to lose all its tourists, they cannot prevent my people from coming. Now my people are not sannyasins, but just tourists. And they cannot lose their tourists, because India earns nearabout fifteen million dollars per year from tourists. So all that I have to do is just tell my people, “Behave more stupidly, don’t look intelligent.”\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6248","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/>The Razor\'s Edge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 When the ocean has called you</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6248 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Razors_Edge/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND WHAT
TO DO WITH THE SECRETS IN OUR HEARTS WHEN THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPRESS
THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna Priya, there is some misunderstanding. There is no question
in the world which cannot be asked. Yes, there are answers which cannot
be answered. A question always comes from the mind; hence the mind
always finds appropriate words for it. But the answer comes from your
very being, from your depths of silence where no words have ever
entered. The territory of the words and language is the mind, and that
is also the territory of the questions. Every question can be brought
into words – only when you start feeling the answers, then the problem
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been watching you for almost ten years. You have gone through
such a transformation that what you are thinking is a question, is not a
question. You have come very close to the answer – that’s why you cannot
find words. But this is something that happens very rarely to very
blessed souls. You should feel blissful, fortunate and grateful to
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>The misunderstanding is also very natural, because the mind is well
acquainted only with questions. When for the first time you are pregnant
with an answer, it is a natural misunderstanding of the mind that there
is some question because the answer, mind knows not, and the answer,
mind cannot express.</p><p>You are saying, “What to do with the question when there are no words
for it?” Then it is absolutely certain it is not a question. It is an
answer, and you are not supposed to do anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>A question has to be solved:</p><p><br></p><p>An answer has to be lived.</p><p><br></p><p>So what is arising in you – the peace, the silence, the joy that I
can see in your eyes, on your face, the tremendous change... because you
used to be very serious<span class=s4></span>You have moved almost</p><p>one-hundred-and-eighty degrees. You radiate joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the misunderstanding that it is a question and rejoice that it
is the answer. It will never find any words; it has never found any
expression. Yes, your eyes may show it, your face may radiate it, your
very gestures may have the grace of it, but words are too small and too
trivial and too mundane – their approach is very limited.</p><p><br></p><p>The answer is beyond the mind. Those who go on seeking through the
mind go on coming upon new questions. The very few people who have found
the answer are those who have gone beyond mind, beyond words, beyond
language.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “And what to do with the secrets in our hearts when
there is no way to express them?” Nothing has to be done; they will find
their way of their own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to understand one thing very clearly: there are things which
you cannot do, but which happen. If somebody says to you,“love me”...
now, love cannot be commanded, love cannot be ordered, and if –
according to the order and according to the commandment – you make an
effort to love, it is going to be phony; it cannot be an authentic
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>What is arising in your being is thrilling your heart. It will find
its own way to happen – in a dance, in a song, or in just deep silence
which is not negative, but immensely full.<span class=s4></span>in
some creativity, or</p><p>anything that you do – your being will find its way to do it in a new
way that you have never done before, with great love.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not supposed to find expression for your experiences and the
secrets that are arising in your being. They are far bigger than you;
you cannot manage them. You are left far behind; those secrets, those
answers happen only when you are not. Who is going to express them?
Neither are there words to express, nor is there a person to express
them. Now the experience itself will find its way, just as the rivers
find their way to the ocean, just as roots find their way rising into
trees and blossoming into flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the roots and the flowers you may not see any connection
at all – roots are ugly, and the flowers are so beautiful – but all the
juice and all the color and all the beauty and all the fragrance that
the flower has, have been given by the roots. The roots have been
carrying those flowers for years in their womb. The seeds are never
beautiful, but they can give birth to great beauty. You just wait.…</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand your impatience, because you are too full and you
want to shower just like a raincloud, but it is not within your
capacity. Neither have you found it, nor is it in your hands to</p><p>express it. On the contrary, it will be right to say it has found
you. And now it will find its way in some creative act, in some loving
act, in something that indicates that it is not coming from the mind.
You have given it birth just as a woman gives birth to a child. She does
not create it; it grows of its own accord, and a day comes when it comes
out of the womb.</p><p><br></p><p>Every meditator has to remember it: One day you will be pregnant with
God – whether you are man or woman does not matter – and the unknown
will find its way. You are simply to relax and follow it.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to become a guide, but you have to be guided by it. You
have to become just a shadow. It becomes the reality and you become the
shadow, and wherever the reality moves, the shadow moves. This is the
experience everybody else is waiting here for. And the same question
will be asked by many, sometime or other.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good, Krishna Priya, that you have asked it, because it is not
only your question, it is going to be the question of many. Those who
can be patient enough, those who can wait for the divine to take shape
in their being, will have the same question, exactly in the same
words.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t become tense because the experience is so new. And don’t be
afraid, because it may lead you in new ways which you are not acquainted
with, untrodden by you ever before – not even dreamt, not even
imagined.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the moment when trust is needed. Trust in existence, not in
any belief system, not in any priest, not in any church, not in any holy
book, but in existence. All around you the trees are so deeply trusting,
the rivers are trusting, the mountains are trusting, the millions of
stars are trusting. The whole existence is a tremendous experiment of
trust.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the right moment for you to become part of this immense
experiment of trust. Let life lead your way. Give your hand to existence
without any doubt and without any question. And never ask where it is
leading you – it always leads to your destiny, and it never fails.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who cannot trust, they fail, because they think themselves
wiser than the whole world, the whole existence. What is your wisdom?
What is your intelligence? not even a dewdrop. And when the ocean has
called you, trust it – take a jump and disappear into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU ARE THE WELL. ALL THE TIME WHEN I CAME THERE WAS FRESH WATER
WAITING FOR ME, CLEANING AND PURIFYING ME, TAKING ME APART AND PUTTING
ME TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT, MORE BEAUTIFUL WAY. NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I FEEL THE COURAGE TO BE SO CLOSE THAT I CAN SEE MY FACE MIRRORED IN
YOUR WATER. I’M AFRAID, OSHO, AND ALSO FULL OF JOY.</p><p><br></p><p>Chitbodhi, man is accustomed to misery; hence, he is never afraid of
misery. However great, when misery happens, he knows it.</p><p>But man is absolutely unacquainted with joy. He has forgotten the
very language of joy. His mind is full of tensions, anxieties,
anguishes, anger, violence, jealousy. Nothing makes him afraid – they
are all old companions, he knows them perfectly well. He has lived with
them, although it has been a suffering, it has been a hell. But this is
one of the significant factors to be understood about man: he can adapt
himself to any conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in Egypt nearabout three thousand years ago: There was a
monastery, and the monastery had an underground graveyard. Whenever any
monk died, the great stone that was covering the way to the graveyard
underneath was removed, and the monk’s body was lowered down in deep
darkness. The tunnel was miles long – a natural tunnel.</p><p><br></p><p>Thousands of monks have been lowered into that tunnel, and according
to the Egyptian convention every monk was given some money, some
clothes, and some food, because he was going for a pilgrimage. It was
sixty feet deep and miles long.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that a monk had not died, but was in a coma. Others
thought that he had died, and they opened the graveyard, lowered the
monk, closed the graveyard... and after a few hours the monk came to
consciousness. He could not believe where he was – immense darkness,
darkness so deep, as he had never seen, because not even a ray of light
had ever entered into that tunnel. And such a stink, because so many
dead bodies had become rotten – all around there were bodies and bodies,
and they were all dead.</p><p><br></p><p>He shouted as much as he could, although he knew deep down that his
voice would not reach to the monks in the monastery because it was sixty
feet deep and then a huge rock always closed.… He had himself closed
that rock many times. But as a last resort, he tried shouting with all
his might, “I am alive!” But nobody heard it.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will be surprised to know the immense adaptability of man.
You may think that he must have committed suicide – you are wrong. He
lived in the hope that someday some monk will die, and the rock will be
removed – then he can shout.</p><p><br></p><p>But meanwhile there was a little food that he has been sent with, and
after that food, he started eating rotten food sent with other dead
bodies which had become just skeletons.</p><p><br></p><p>It took ten years for another monk to die, although this monk was
praying every day to God, “There are so many old monks<span class=s4></span>” But God has never heard anybody. Over the time of
ten years he became</p><p>a cannibal; he started eating the flesh of dead bodies. Not only
that, he started collecting the money that had been given to each monk
when he died, and the clothes – in the hope that when he would be
rescued, he would take all these clothes and all this money.</p><p><br></p><p>And slowly, slowly he forgot that the graveyard was stinking; he
forgot that he was living the ugliest life possible. For water, there
was nothing else than the water that was coming from the rocks, and he
knew that the water was from the gutters of the monastery. He started
drinking that water; he could not have even touched it before, but there
was no other way. The lust for life is so tremendous that man can
manage<span class=s4></span>That water which was coming was so dirty,
but for him it was almost nectar;</p><p>it was life-giving. And he was the only living man in that miles-long
tunnel.</p><p>As he was moving around in the darkness, slowly, slowly his eyes
became accustomed to seeing a little bit in the darkness. And dead
people, just skeletons – nobody was there to prevent him, so he was
searching everybody, finding money, clothes.</p><p>And when after ten years the rock was removed, he shouted back up.
People had completely forgotten about him. They pulled him out, but he
said, “First you pull up my clothes” – he had a big pile of clothes.
People could not believe that.… Then he said, “Now pull up my money.” So
they pulled up his money – he had collected the money from thousands of
people. After all his treasures were taken out, he came out.</p><p>It was difficult for him to open his eyes in the sunlight. He had
grown such a long beard that it was touching the floor, and he was
looking so healthy. People could not believe it and said, “How have you
managed? You used to be very thin, and you have collected so much
weight!” And when they heard his story they could not believe that a man
can do this. When you think about it, putting yourself in his place<span class=s4></span>First it is shocking, but soon you will understand
that what he did, you would</p><p>have done also.</p><p><br></p><p>He lived twenty years more. And again his eyes became accustomed to
light. Now he himself could not believe that those ten years – it seemed
almost like a nightmare that is ended.</p><p>Chitbodhi, you are afraid because you are feeling the first stirrings
of joy. It is unknown territory. Your heart you are feeling for the
first time. The heart is not just what the medical people say, or the
physiologists say – a pumping station. The heart that the mystics and
the poets talk about has nothing to do with the heart that medical
science talks about.</p><p>Behind almost every physical organ there is a parallel to it – just
behind it, a spiritual receptivity. Behind your eyes, there are eyes
which see things, which these eyes cannot see. And behind your ears,
there are ears which can hear music, that these ears cannot hear. And
behind your physical heart, there is a spiritual heart which knows love
– which this heart has no idea about – which knows joy.</p><p>The physical heart can be changed, and a plastic heart may be far
better because a plastic heart cannot have a heart failure. There are,
around the world, thousands of people moving about with an artificial
heart. But that artificial heart cannot love. Just put two artificial
hearts close to each other and see what kind of dialogue happens.
Nothing will happen; there are just two dead things. They can do the
function of purifying your blood, of taking in the oxygen, of throwing
out the carbon dioxide; but love is neither oxygen nor carbon dioxide.
Love is not a question of breathing – everybody is breathing.</p><p>So remember, whenever I talk about the heart, I am not talking about
the heart medical science talks about – this is something behind it.
Each of your senses has a parallel sense behind it.</p><p>If you hear me, you can hear in two ways. Either you can hear only
with your outer ear, or you can hear with your inner ear too. When your
outer and inner ear both hear, then it is listening; otherwise it is
only hearing.</p><p>When your outer eyes and inner eyes both see, then the same existence
becomes so psychedelic, so colorful.<span class=s4></span>The same
tree is greener than it has ever been – and not only greener, each leaf
has</p><p>its own energy aura. The whole tree is surrounded by an energy aura,
radiating rays.</p><p>In the Soviet Union one man has developed a new photography, Kirlian
photography. He uses such sensitive plates that he can picture not only
the trees in his plates, but trees with their energy aura surrounding
them.</p><p><br></p><p>When your inner eyes are together with your outer eyes and there is a
harmony, you will see this whole existence is a festival of lights, that
everything is radiating light, is surrounded by beautiful light, soft...
every man is surrounded.</p><p><br></p><p>And a man can be known by his aura. The ordinary man has only
nearabout a one-inch aura all around his body, but as your meditation
deepens your aura becomes bigger – two inches, three inches, four
inches, five inches.</p><p><br></p><p>As your meditation deepens you are surrounded with more and more
light coming from your inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen the pictures of Buddha or Jesus with a circle of light
around their head, an aura, and people think that it is simply
mythology. Now Kirlian photography proves it – it is not mythology.
Kirlian photography says that that kind of round aura happens only when
somebody has reached to his very innermost core, when somebody is
awakened – a Gautam Buddha. Then his whole head radiates something of
the eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>But when things start happening for the first time, one feels afraid.
When a young boy, fourteen years old, becomes for the first time aware
of his sexuality, he feels afraid, embarrassed, becomes very uptight, is
worried: “What is happening? If somebody comes to know<span class=s4></span>And what am I supposed</p><p>to do with it?” A new energy has become available of which he was not
aware at all up to now. And when spiritual energy becomes available to
you, it is a million-times-bigger phenomenon.<span class=s4></span>You
feel</p><p>joy, you feel blissfulness, and at the same time a trembling, a fear
– but this fear will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a natural process. As you become more and more accustomed to
the new state of joyfulness, fear will be reduced. Soon you will find
there is no fear at all. And to be fearless is a tremendously great
achievement, because fear is part of your death. If you become fearless,
you have tasted something which is deathless.</p><p><br></p><p>In your joy you have come close to the deathless, in your joy you
have come to your immortality.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, Chitbodhi, “You are the well. All the time when I
came there was fresh water waiting for me – cleaning and purifying me,
taking me apart and putting me together in a different more beautiful
way. Now, for the first time, I feel the courage to be so close that I
can see my face mirrored in your water. I’m afraid, Osho, and also full
of joy.”</p><p><br></p><p>Give all your energy to joy, and fear will disappear. Ignore fear,
don’t pay any attention to fear, because the more attention you pay to
it, the longer it will linger on. Pour yourself totally in the direction
from where joy is arising, and fear will disappear just as darkness
disappears when you bring light in.</p><p><br></p><p>Joy is light. And joy is the beginning of a great pilgrimage which
ends in finding God. So go on – without any fear, because existence
always protects those who trust it. Relax, give yourself to</p><p>existence and allow the joy to overwhelm you. Let it become your
wings, so that you can reach to the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>A joyful heart is very close to the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only the sad and the sorrowful and the miserable who are going
towards hell. They are creating their hell. The joyful and the singing
and the dancing and the celebrating are creating their paradise by each
of their songs, by each of their dances.</p><p><br></p><p>It is in your hands whether to create paradise or to fall into a
darkness, into hellfire. These are not outside you; these both are
within you. It all depends what you choose to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Choose to be divine, choose to be more and more a celebrant, choose
to be festive, so more and more flowers can blossom in your being, and
more and more fragrance can become available to you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this way will not only help you, Chitbodhi, it will help all
those with whom you come in contact. Joy is as infectious as any
disease. When you see a few people dancing, suddenly you feel your feet
are ready. You may try to control them, because control has been taught
to you, but your body wants to join the dance. Whenever you have an
opportunity to laugh, join; whenever you have an opportunity to dance,
join; whenever you have an opportunity to sing, sing – and one day you
will find you have created your paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that one goes to paradise; paradise is not somewhere in the
sky – it is something that one creates around himself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good beginning. With all my blessings, go deeper, in spite of
any fear. Never listen to negative things, because if you listen to them
they can poison you, they can destroy your joy – keep it pure,
unpolluted. And here are people who will dance with you, who will
celebrate, because you have taken the first step towards God.</p><p><br></p><p>And I want to remind you that the first step is almost half the
journey. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THIS VERSE I SEND TO YOU FROM “GITANJALI.” IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, LIKE
YOU, MASTER. “I KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER,</p><p>I EVER LISTEN IN SILENT AMAZEMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>THE LIGHT OF THY MUSIC ILLUMINES THE WORLD,</p><p>THE LIFE BREATH OF THY MUSIC RUNS FROM SKY TO SKY, THE HOLY STREAM OF
THY MUSIC BREAKS THROUGH ALL</p><p>STONY OBSTACLES AND RUSHES ON. MY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY SONG,
BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR VOICE.</p><p>I WOULD SPEAK, BUT SPEECH BREAKS NOT INTO SONG,</p><p><br></p><p>AND I CRY OUT BAFFLED, AH, THOU HAS MADE MY HEART CAPTIVE IN THE
ENDLESS MESHES OF THY MUSIC, MY MASTER.”</p><p><br></p><p>Chandra, Rabindranath Tagore, although he belongs to this century,
echoes thousands-of-years</p><p>-old longings and dreams of the East. He belongs to the seers of the
UPANISHADS. He is the only man this century has produced whose words can
be compared to the five-thousand-year-old UPANISHADS.</p><p><br></p><p>Those UPANISHADS were songs of the first seers of humanity, but it is
a strange fact that truth remains the same. Everything changes, but the
truth is eternal. Five thousand years of distance, but whatever
Rabindranath sings, appears to be coming from the days of the
UPANISHADS, of those days of humanity’s childhood – so innocent and so
pure.</p><p><br></p><p>Man was not yet corrupted by religions, organized faiths; man was not
yet under the slavery of the priests; man was not yet divided into
Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians and Jews. Humanity was still
one.</p><p><br></p><p>The seers of the UPANISHADS were as innocent as every child is – it
was easy for them to sing those beautiful songs of tremendous meaning.
But for Rabindranath, being a twentieth-century man, it was certainly a
miracle that he dropped five thousand years of knowledgeability and
became a child again. Every mystic has to become a child again.</p><p><br></p><p>These few lines are from “Gitanjali,” Rabindranath’s book for which
he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Gitanjali means “offering of songs.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Rabindranath, “Why have you chosen this title?” He
said, “I don’t have anything else to offer to God except my imperfect
songs.”</p><p><br></p><p>On his death bed, an old friend had come to console Rabindranath, and
he told him, “You should be dying with absolute contentment, because you
are perhaps the greatest poet in the whole world.” In the West, Shelley
has two thousand songs which can be put to music. Rabindranath has six
thousand songs, and of far greater significance than any of the songs
that Shelley has. That old friend was saying to Rabindranath, “You
should die absolutely contented. You have achieved something – a peak no
one has ever been able to achieve.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath opened his eyes and said, “Keep quiet! – because I know
I have not been able to sing the song I had come to sing. I am an utter
failure. I am dying with tears in my eyes.” And he did die with tears in
his eyes.</p><p>He said to his friend, “I am praying to God! ‘Give me a little time
more, because in this whole life that you have given to me, I have been
simply arranging my instruments. Now that the instruments are ready, you
are taking me away – and the song that I have come to sing remains
unsung.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The friend could not believe what Rabindranath was saying. He said,
“Then what about your six thousand songs?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath said, “Those are all failures. Six thousand efforts to
sing the song that I have come to sing, but each time I failed. I was
trying hard to sing the song that was just on my tongue, but the moment
I expressed it, it was something else. It was not the same quality, the
same depth, the same beauty. When it was within me it was a living
reality, and when it was spoken it was something dead. People have
appreciated my songs, and I have been crying in my nights, ‘Will I be
able to sing it? Or I will always be a failure.’”</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the fundamental qualities of greatness, because the
longing and the dream are so high, and the human reach is so small. The
longing is for the moon, and the human reach is so small that only small
people can be contented about their creativity. The greater the man, the
more he will feel he has failed.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Rabindranath has given such beautiful songs that there is no
comparison, he had a comparison which nobody from the outside had any
idea about. He had a song deep in his soul, very alive, ready to burst
forth, and he always compared his songs with his inner feeling. He found
that what he wanted to express had remained behind. Although he had been
able to put together beautiful words, the life was no longer in them,
the heart was no longer beating in them. They are faraway echoes of the
song he wanted to sing.</p><p><br></p><p>I KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>He is asking God Himself...</p><p><br></p><p>I KNOW NOT HOW THOU SINGEST, MY MASTER. I EVER LISTEN IN SILENT
AMAZEMENT.</p><p>THE LIGHT OF THY MUSIC ILLUMINES THE WORLD,</p><p><br></p><p>THE LIFE BREATH OF THY MUSIC RUNS FROM SKY TO SKY, THE HOLY STREAM OF
THY MUSIC BREAKS THROUGH</p><p>ALL STONY OBSTACLES AND RUSHES ON. MY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY
SONG, BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR VOICE.</p><p>I HAVE GOT THE SONG, BUT WHERE IS THE VOICE?</p><p>WHERE ARE THE WORDS?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, “You have given me the song, but you have made me so
poor that I don’t have the voice to sing it” – and he was a beautiful
singer, he was a great musician. He created a new kind of music
altogether, which is called “Rabindra music.”</p><p><br></p><p>India has a tremendously long history of great musicians; it has
explored all the dimensions possible, and for hundreds of years nobody
has been able to add anything new. Rabindranath has added a new
dimension, but still his longing is so great that whatever he does falls
short.</p><p><br></p><p>MY HEART LONGS TO JOIN IN THY SONG, BUT VAINLY STRUGGLES FOR
VOICE.</p><p>I WOULD SPEAK, BUT SPEECH BREAKS NOT INTO SONG, AND I CRY OUT
BAFFLED...</p><p>When he was awarded the Nobel prize and he addressed the Nobel
committee, he said, “You have awarded my tears. As far as the songs are
concerned, I am still struggling to find voice for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>AH, THOU HAS MADE MY HEART CAPTIVE IN THE ENDLESS MESHES OF THY
MUSIC, MY MASTER.</p><p>You have imprisoned me in endless meshes of music; I am unable to
find the way out. I tried this way, I tried that way – my whole life I
have been trying and trying and trying – but nothing seems to
succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>This awareness makes him not only a poet, but a mystic too. In this
whole century there have been many poets, but Rabindranath is a category
by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The poets, the painters, the musicians, the sculptors are very egoist
people; they are continuously bragging about their painting, about their
music, about their poetry. Rabindranath belongs to a totally different
category – he is so humble. And I would like to say to you that the
greater you are, the humbler you become. The higher the peak of your
being, the deeper will be the valley by your side. The greater your
being, the deeper will be your feeling that you could have done much
more, but you have done so little.</p><p><br></p><p>The last words he said on his deathbed were, “I am worried. What will
I say to God? – that you had sent me to sing just one song, and I could
not even manage to do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>This should also be the experience of all meditators, because the
deeper your meditation goes, the more and more your ego disappears.
Finally it leaves you just a nobody – anonymous, no name, no fame. In
that great nothingness, you become one with the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS, THAT EVERYWHERE WE ARE, AND NOW THAT WE ARE IN INDIA, THE
SAME STUPID, SILLY, SKY-ROCKETING CHARGES ARE PUT ON US. THESE REPRESSED
BEINGS – POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE, VIOLENT PEOPLE, GREEDY PEOPLE – WOULD
THREATEN US WITH BULLDOZERS AND FORCED ENTRIES INTO THE ASHRAM. THEY
ALSO CHARGE US WITH OBSCENITY, DRUGS, ETC. OSHO, YOU HAVE BEEN TOO
COMPASSIONATE WITH ALL THESE IDIOTS – THE BLIND, THE DEAF, AND THE DUMB
SOCIETY. KINDLY PUT MORE LIGHT ON THIS BURNING ISSUE.</p><p>Gurudayal Singh, it is a right observation that the people are blind,
that they are deaf, that they are insane, that they are utterly
prejudiced, irrational in their beliefs. But because of all this, they
need more compassion. You cannot say that because people are sick and
ill the doctor should simply leave them. When people are sick and ill
they need more compassion.</p><p>It is a great opportunity for you. In spite of their misbehavior,
mistreatment, ugly lies, you can still remain silent, peaceful, loving
and compassionate. And if you become enlightened in this society, the
whole credit will go to the society. There is no need to be angry about
them. What can they do? They have been handed down all this garbage for
centuries. They are victims; they need all the compassion that is
possible.</p><p>I would like you to remember Jesus. At the last moment on the cross
he raised his eyes and hands towards the sky and said, “Father, forgive
these people, because they know not what they are doing.” In that moment
Jesus reached his highest experience of life, his highest ecstasy. The
love and the compassion that were in his eyes and heart for those who
were crucifying him have made him go through a fire test, and he came
out pure gold.</p><p>So I can understand... the world is going to be against me. It is not
their fault, it is my fault. They are fast asleep, dreaming great
dreams, and I am trying to wake them up. Naturally they are getting
angry. They are living with their beliefs, consoled, and I am disturbing
their beliefs. I am trying to say to them, “Your beliefs are only
beliefs; you have to drop them and to search for truth on your own.”</p><p>Because I am disturbing their consolation, the fault is mine. And of
course they are in the majority. People ordinarily think that if so many
people are thinking in the same way as they think, it must be true. But
they don’t know that truth is not to be decided by voting; truth is to
be decided by experience.</p><p>The whole world may be against me, still it does not disturb me, for
the simple reason that whatever I am saying is my own experience; I am
saying it on my own authority. And those who are with me – and Gurudayal
Singh has been with me for almost twenty-five years, a beautiful human
being – naturally get worried and concerned, “What kind of humanity have
we got?”</p><p>All the countries proclaim democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of
movement, respect for the individual, and every country practices just
the opposite. There is no respect for the individual; there is no
respect for individual freedom of expression.</p><p>Just a few days ago, one of my friends was looking at the files of
the CID department in New Delhi, because the chief of the CID department
is his friend, and the chief was not aware that he is my friend also. He
saw my name there... all kinds of charges, without any evidence.</p><p>The chief told him first, “He is a dangerous man.” Now you should
give some evidence. Have I killed somebody? Have I thrown any bomb or
dynamite at somebody? Am I a terrorist, a murderer? But no, just this
much is enough, “He is a dangerous man, and he has to be silenced.”</p><p><br></p><p>My friend was very much shocked and he asked the chief, “What do you
mean, ‘he has to be silenced?’ Do you mean he has to be assassinated,
killed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, that is not the meaning of it. ‘Silenced’ means we have
to make every effort that no country allows him in, and we will not
allow people coming from other countries to meet him. Naturally, he will
not be able to corrupt people’s minds.”</p><p><br></p><p>My friend just jokingly said, “But have you any evidence that he has
corrupted anybody’s mind? And do you remember – the same was the charge
against Socrates, that he corrupts people’s minds?”</p><p><br></p><p>And just today I received from the police commissioner a new list in
which he states that every talk that I deliver should be taped by the
police. And before it is published they will scrutinize it they will do
the editing work. And he said, “I have come from Bombay – meeting my
boss – receiving all these instructions.”</p><p><br></p><p>One of my sannyasins has asked the parliament in Germany, “It is now
over one year since you decided that Osho cannot enter into Germany. In
the first place, it was absolutely illegal to say that Osho cannot enter
into Germany. It was absolutely illegal – a man who has never been to
your country, who has never broken any of your laws, who has done no
harm to anybody in Germany.… Why should the parliament decide that this
man cannot enter? Not only that, but his jet airplane cannot land on any
airport in Germany, even for refueling. It is time that you withdraw
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So it has been reconsidered, and today I received their reconsidered
order. Again the same charges that, “He is a dangerous man, and his
entry into Germany will disturb many people. He is on the list of the
international police, Interpol, as a wanted man. So we cannot withdraw
the order – the order is reinforced.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I love the words, “He is a wanted man by the Interpol.” At least
some consolation – somebody, somewhere wants me.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurudayal, don’t take these people seriously, because crucifixion is
out of date. And they have committed that mistake once. By crucifying
Jesus they created Christianity, and Jews are still repenting about
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying this without any foundation. The attorney general of
America, answering a press conference, said, “We did not put Osho into
jail because we don’t want him to become a martyr. That will help his
disciples to become more sympathetic, more loving towards him, more
surrendered towards him. We cannot take that risk.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the desire is clear – if the risk was not there, they would have
liked to put me into jail for my whole life, or to kill me – but the
fear that that may create a greater movement.<span class=s4></span>What I cannot do</p><p>alive, their killing me may do.</p><p>In two thousand years people have learned something; otherwise there
is no reason.<span class=s4></span>If they had</p><p>poisoned Socrates, killed Mansoor, crucified Jesus, they could have
killed me any day. The desire is there, but also a great fear: If they
kill me, then my words and my people will become stronger, my death will
bring them together. My people will become a force in changing the whole
future of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>So they are trying more sophisticated ways: silencing me.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t know that, according to me, they are only retarded people.
If they can find a way of preventing my people, I can find a way of
bringing my people there. For the whole year they have been trying to
silence me, and I am still speaking. And all the governments of the
world and all the religious heads of the world are together in the
conspiracy against a single man – that shows how much intelligence they
have.</p><p><br></p><p>I told my sannyasins, “Drop the orange clothes, drop the mala, so
there is no identity left that you are sannyasins.” Unless India wants
to lose all its tourists, they cannot prevent my people from coming. Now
my people are not sannyasins, but just tourists. And they cannot lose
their tourists, because India earns nearabout fifteen million dollars
per year from tourists. So all that I have to do is just tell my people,
“Behave more stupidly, don’t look intelligent.”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

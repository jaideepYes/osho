SOMETIMES MUCH LONGING IS THERE, BUT I REALLY DON’T KNOW FOR WHAT. I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE US IN THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT AGAIN, I HAVE ONLY A FANTASY OF WHAT THIS MEANS. AND WHO WANTS TO BE THERE WHEN THIS LIFE IS SO INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL. AM I MISSING THE POINT? IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD? PLEASE COMMENT.\nAnand Parigyan, I am sorry to say that you are missing the point. This life is beautiful, this existence is wonderful, this moment is ecstatic; but there is much more. This is only the beginning, and to stop at the beginning is very unfortunate. And deep down you are also feeling it; otherwise this question would not have arisen.\nYou are saying, “It is so wonderful to be a river, to sing and dance and celebrate with you, but who wants to reach the ocean?” But why has the question of the ocean arisen at all in you? Apparently it looks like you do not want to reach the ocean – the river is beautiful; its song is beautiful, its dance is beautiful. But melting into the ocean, it melts into a bigger song. Merging into the ocean, it merges into the universal music, into the eternal dance.\nRivers come and go; the ocean remains. And the whole dance of the river, its song, its beauty, is because of the ocean. It is dancing and is joyful because the ocean is coming closer every moment. If the same river is lost in a desert, all dance will disappear, all song will disappear. That will be a death.\nThe river is so tremendously blissful because it knows it is going to the ocean. At the ocean it appears on the one hand as if the river has disappeared, but in fact only the banks disappear – the river remains. And the banks are a bondage. The river was dancing, but its feet were chained. Those banks were its prison. The dance will remain, will become freer – so vast that perhaps you cannot see it, because the river is not going to disappear; it is going to become the ocean.\nYou have raised a significant question, because it happens to all those who follow the path. Even the beginning is so beautiful that many think they have arrived and there is no need to go any further.\nOne has to remember that each beginning has to be transformed not into a stopover forever, but into a new beginning. And the journey is infinite, so whenever you feel, “This is the place to stop,” you will always be wrong, because existence stops nowhere. It simply goes on evolving. It has no limits, no boundaries.\nLooked at from the point of view of the river – and you are not the river, you are just watching the river – it seems to be lost in the ocean. But you can say just the contrary – that the ocean is lost in the river.\nKabir, one of the great mystics of this country, when he was young and for the first time felt the melting and merging with the divine, he wrote a small poem – two lines of which are:\nTHE DEWDROP DISAPPEARS INTO THE OCEAN.\nKabir is no more. Although Kabir had started to search, what he wanted to find has been found; but the searcher has disappeared.\nThose lines are beautiful, but before dying, just on his deathbed, he called his son, Kamaal, and said, “You change those two lines. It is true that Kabir has disappeared. The seeker has disappeared; although what he had started out to find has been found. But the second line... I was too young, and the experience was too new.\n“I am sorry that I wrote it, that the dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean. Now at my ripe old age, I can see that something just the contrary of what I had written had happened. So change it, write:\nTHE OCEAN HAS DISAPPEARED INTO THE DEW DROP.”\nBoth are true, but the second has deeper implications. It is not only man who is in search of God. It is not only that man disappears in God; God is also in search of man.\nAnd when the meeting happens, it is far more significant to say that the God disappears into the man. And you are aware of it; otherwise the question would not have come to your mind.\nYou are saying, “Who wants to reach the ocean?”\nIt is just like an old parable of Aesop. A fox was trying to reach to the fruits which were hanging, ripe, on a tall tree. But her jump always fell short. She tried hard, again and again, but she could not reach the fruits. A small rabbit was watching the whole thing. The fox was not aware that there was somebody watching. Tired, the fox moved away from the tree, and the rabbit asked, “Uncle, what happened?” And the fox said, “The fruits are not yet ripe. And who cares about fruits which are not ripe?”\nThere have been many sannyasins who used to live on the campus, in other houses, and sometimes they were moved to Lao Tzu. And they wrote a letter to me saying, “We owe an apology to You, because living in other houses, we were always thinking, ‘Who cares to live in Lao Tzu.’ But now that we have come to live in Lao Tzu, we know perfectly well that we were repressing our desire, our longing, to be in Lao Tzu, and just consoling ourselves, ‘Who cares.’”\nParigyan, don’t be like the fox in Aesop’s parable. Don’t say, “Who cares for the ocean.” The whole dance of the river is for the ocean. It is moving from the mountain just like a newly married girl, running to meet her lover.\nOne of India’s great emperors, Akbar, in his autobiography, AKBAR NAMMA, has written many significant things. But one story is relevant to your question. It was an actual incident.\nHe had gone hunting in the forest, and then lost his way. The sun was setting – and that was the time for Mohammedans to do their prayer – so he sat under a tree to do Namaj, the Mohammedan prayer.\nWhile he was in the middle of his prayer a young girl ran by his side, almost hitting him as she went by. He could not speak; he was immediately very angry. In the first place nobody in his prayers should be disturbed. And he was not just anybody; he was the emperor of the country. And this girl had not even said, “I am sorry.” She had not even looked back. She went rushing on to wherever she was going.\nHis prayer finished, Akbar waited for the girl, because she would have to come back to the village. Where she had gone, there was only deep forest for miles.\nFinally she came back. Akbar was still angry, and he said, “You seem to be very rude, uncivilized – couldn’t you see that I was praying? And I am not just anybody, I am the emperor of the country.”\nThe girl said, “I am sorry, but as far as I am concerned, I never saw you. My body may have touched your body, but I don’t even remember that your body touched mine, because I was going to meet my lover, who is coming after many years. I wanted to meet him just on the road that passes a few miles away. And I was so full of my lover and his sweet memories that I was almost not myself. So just forgive me. It was not deliberate on my part to disturb you; I was not even aware of it.\n“But I want to ask you one question. I was going to meet just an ordinary lover. And you were praying to the greatest lover of the world, to God, and you were disturbed. You became angry, and you have been waiting here to punish me. It was not prayer. You were repeating those words just like a parrot; otherwise you would not have known who had gone by, who had touched you, you would have been so deeply involved with the ultimate beloved.”\nAkbar was a very sensible man – perhaps the most sensible emperor India has known. He asked the girl to forgive him. And she had taught him a great lesson. He told her, “You are right. Your love was authentic. My prayer was false, just routine.”\nWhen the river is dancing and singing and rushing it is going to the ocean to its lover, to its ultimate beloved. There is nothing wrong in experiencing the beauty of this moment. But remember, this beauty has to grow more; each coming moment it has to bring more flowers, more songs, more dances.\nAnd deep down you are longing for those; hence you say, “Who cares? Who wants to reach the ocean? Sometimes much longing is there.” Longing for what? – because you have stopped your being from taking note that all your dance and joy is for the ocean. Now you cannot find the object of your longing.\n“Sometimes much longing is there, but I really don’t know for what.” You yourself are preventing it; otherwise it is in your heart – the ocean.\n“I was so happy to hear you say that you will recognize us in the universal consciousness.” Again, the same thing. Mind goes on repeating the same mistakes. “But again I have only a fantasy of what this means. And who wants to be there when this life is so incredibly wonderful.”\nBut do you think this is the limit? Do you think this is all? You know perfectly well. You may suppress it, but your being knows that this is not all. This is only the beginning – don’t make it an end. In fact, there is no end. It is always beginning, reaching higher and higher, deeper and deeper, closer and closer.\nBut it is always beginning. And this is the grandeur of life – that you will never come to a full stop, because the full stop means death. It is good to have many commas and semicolons in your life, but don’t have any full stops. Keep it open, and your dance will become richer, and your song will become celestial.\nSannyas is the pilgrimage – just the pilgrimage in search of something which you will many times think has been found, and again you will have to realize: this is a new beginning, not an end. From eternity to eternity, from one sky to another sky, we go on moving.\nOur dance is forever.\nYou know you are missing the point; hence you ask, “Am I missing the point? Is there something that needs to be understood?” There is much that has to be understood. And you are missing the point – it has to be consciously recognized.\nYou become satisfied with so small, so little. A spiritual seeker remains in a strange balance. He is contented with whatever he has got, but he never loses his discontent for more. It is a difficult point to understand, because it appears contradictory. It seems either you should be contented or discontented. But the spiritual seeker is both: he is contented with whatever life has given, but he knows there is much more; hence, he is discontented too... contented with the past and discontented for the future. Hence, he goes on discovering new treasures every moment.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE FLOWERS THAT ARE BLOSSOMING AROUND YOU REJOICE IN THE MORNING DEWDROPS, THE SUNSHINE, IN THE SILENT, COOL BREEZE. A SEED, LIKE ME, IS IN NEED OF MORE TANGIBLE AND BASIC STUFF LIKE EARTH AND WATER. THESE FLOWERS GOT THEIR SOIL AND WATER ALREADY IN THE PAST, BUT I MISSED. BUT YOU ARE STILL MY MASTER, SO TELL ME, IS THERE NO HOPE FOR ME ANYMORE? BELOVED OSHO, PLEASE HELP.\nDeva Priya, it does not matter at what time you have arrived to me – in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, or even in the middle of the night – what matters is that you have arrived. You will have to be a little patient, because those who have come before are having flowers, fragrance, foliage.\nBut rather than becoming jealous of them, take courage from their experience, because the seed needs great courage. Unless the seed is ready to die in the earth there is no possibility of any sprout being born. The death of the seed is the birth of the plant. Seeing all those bushes and plants full of flowers will give you encouragement so that you need not be afraid. Your seed also contains many flowers, much future, much joy. And if I have been able to give other plants their basic needs like earth and water, I will become your earth, your water too.\nBut you are new and must be wondering whether this miracle that has happened to other trees is going to happen to you, or not. It all depends on you. If you are ready to die as a seed, as an ego, immediately you will start growing, blossoming. The spring always waits at the door – just you have to gather courage to disappear in the earth. And the master is nothing but an excuse for your ego to die.\nYou are afraid to lose your ego because you don’t know, if you lose your ego, what will remain. But look around – and you are aware that people are blossoming. They were also in the same state in which you are, but they arrived in the morning and you have come in the evening.\nIn India we have a proverb: If a man is lost in the morning and comes back home in the evening, he should not be called “the lost”. He has arrived, what does it matter whether it was morning or evening? All that is significant is arriving home.\nI am going to be your earth and I am going to be your water – just as I have been the earth and water to others. Allow your seed to disappear. The moment the disciple disappears in the master, spring has come. Then thousands of flowers will be yours. Right now, also they are with you, but only as a potential. They need actualization; and for actualization the seed has to die.\nIt is one of the mysteries of life, that the seed protects your potential until it finds the right soil. But the seed is blind. It is a protective layer, but the protective layer can become an imprisonment if you start clinging with it. Say goodbye to it. Be grateful to it that it protected you till you reached the place where you could discard it. And you can come out of it with all your glory, with all your beauty.\nEvery man is born with the potential of the divine in him; no man is there without the potential.\nThere is a beautiful story about Gautam Buddha’s past life, when he was not yet awakened, when he was himself a seed. But another man, his name was Deepankar, had become a buddha. His name is beautiful – deepankar means full of light. And thousands of people were coming to Deepankar to listen to his words, to sit at his feet, to have his blessings, to find a discipline from him and an encouragement.\nThe man who was going to become Gautam Buddha in the next life also went to see him. He was so beautiful, so silent, so serene, so blissful, that the man who was going to become Gautam Buddha in the next life, although he had come with all kinds of skepticism and doubts, forgot all his skepticism, forgot all his doubts, and fell to the feet of Deepankar Buddha. His very presence was enough to dispel the darkness of his skepticism. But he was very much puzzled – as he stood up, Deepankar Buddha bowed down and touched the feet of this unknown man.\nHe was puzzled, and he said, “My touching your feet is perfectly right. I am wandering in darkness; you have arrived and you are full of light. I had come with many doubts, but just seeing you, looking into your eyes, they all have disappeared. I have never felt such silence, such serenity. It is perfectly right for me to touch your feet in gratitude. But what have you done? Why have you touched my feet? – an ignorant man, unconscious of his own self?”\nDeepankar laughed and he said, “Don’t be worried. It is only a question of morning and evening.” The man said, ” What do you mean by morning and evening?”\nDeepankar said, “I arrived a little earlier, but I can see you... you may not be aware, but I can see that by the evening you will also have arrived. In the next life you will become awakened, enlightened. It does not matter – the seed has become actual in me, in you it is a potential, but the value is the same. And more emphatically I have touched your feet, so that you can remember when you become a Gautam Buddha, that anybody who comes to you is also a Gautam Buddha of some future life.\n“I have touched your feet so that you never forget the reverence for every human being, however lost. He may be a murderer, he may be a criminal – it does not matter. It is only a question of time. But everybody’s spring is going to come. One day all beings have to become awakened. They can delay it, they can postpone it, but they cannot cancel it.”\nBuddha used to tell that story again and again to newcomers: “Don’t be worried. I myself was worried, and when Deepankar said this to me it gave me such an upsurge of energy, such a confidence, that if Deepankar says that next life I am going to become a buddha, I have already become a buddha. It is only a question of time – and time does not matter; the whole eternity is available.”\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nMY LIFE SEEMS TO HANG FROM A SINGLE THREAD, AND THAT THREAD IS YOU. DAY BY DAY THE FEELING GROWS, AND NOW I FIND MYSELF CARING ABOUT ONLY ONE THING: BEING AS CLOSE TO YOU AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LONG A TIME AS POSSIBLE. WHILE THE TOTALITY OF THE FEELING FRIGHTENS ME A LITTLE, OVERWHELMS ME, I WOULD NOT WISH IT ANY OTHER WAY. ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE I AM DYING, I AM SO GLAD. BELOVED OSHO, AM I IMAGINING THINGS AGAIN?\nDeva Surabhi, it is not your imagination, for the simple fact that you are saying, “Although I feel like I am dying, I am so glad.” It is a basic truth of spiritual life that before you really know what life is you have to die to the old, which you had been taught is your life. It was phony, false. It was more or less acting in a drama, and sometimes the drama can become too much.\nIt happened that after the murder of Abraham Lincoln... one hundred years had passed, and the whole year was celebrated in his sacred memory. A drama was prepared, which moved all over America all through the year, playing the same drama based on the life of Abraham Lincoln. And it was a rare coincidence that they could find a man who looked like Abraham – he was lean and thin and tall and ugly. Abraham Lincoln was not a very beautiful person, as far as his face is concerned. As far as his being is concerned, he was one of the most beautiful persons.\nWhen he was fighting in the election for the presidentship, a little girl suggested to him, “If you grew a small beard, that would make your face look more beautiful,” because he had marks on his face from small pox. First he laughed, but he thanked the girl and he thought it over. And he grew the beard, and with the beard his face took a totally new shape.\nThis man had the beard, had the same kind of eyes, the same nose, the same height; so he was given the part of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln used to stutter a little once in a while, so he was taught to stutter. He was also a little lame – one leg was a little longer than the other – so they tried to make one of this man’s legs a little longer by traction, pulling it – just a little longer so he started walking like a lame man.\nThey trained him to speak the way Abraham Lincoln used to speak – one hundred year-old language, words which were in fashion in those days. And he proved to be a perfect actor. Anybody could have misunderstood, seeing him, that he was Abraham Lincoln.\nAnd for one year he was moving around the whole continent playing the same drama, three times a day – in the morning, in the evening, in the night. The poor man got so much obsessed with it that when he came home he still walked the way Abraham Lincoln used to walk; he still talked in one hundred year-old language, and he still stuttered.\nHis wife, his children, his father and mother all laughed. They said, “You have done enough – one year – now, drop it. And let your other leg also be lengthened so that you stop this business of walking like a lame man. And there is no need to stutter.”\nBut he said, “I am Abraham Lincoln.”\nFirst they thought he was joking, but soon they realized it was not a joke. He had started believing that he was Abraham Lincoln. They tried in every possible way... but once he had seen the glory of being the President of America and one of the greatest men of history, he was not ready to descend down back to being an ordinary human being.\nHe was brought to the psychoanalyst, but to no effect; he would behave just like Abraham Lincoln. And he would ask the psychoanalyst, “What is missing in me that you are so worried? What is the problem? Why am I not accepted as Abraham Lincoln? You show me any fault.” And it was true,\nthere was no fault.\nFinally the psychoanalyst said , “This is beyond.this is not a case of mental derangement. He has\nbecome obsessed, and he will understand only when he has been assassinated. But then there will be no point. And if you assassinate him, perhaps he may think that he was right – even dying, he will die exactly like Abraham Lincoln. He has died many times on the stage, although the assassination was false. But he knew how to fall, what to say, what Abraham Lincoln’s last words were. Even if he is assassinated, he will do his act to the very last.”\nYou will think that this is a rare story, but the fact is, you are all living a personality which has been imposed on you.\nMy father used to introduce me to guests: “He is very obedient,” and I would immediately tell the guest, “He is saying something absolutely wrong. I am not obedient.”\nAnd he would tell me, “That at least in front of the guests, you could have remained silent.”\nI said, “I cannot, because this is the way people are falsified. If I go on accepting that ‘I am obedient, I am obedient, I am obedient...’ I may start being obedient, which is not true. You should introduce me saying ‘This boy is very disobedient.’ Then I will remain silent, because you are saying something true.”\nHe said, “But it looks very awkward to introduce your own son to somebody saying, ‘He is very disobedient,’ as if disobedience is a quality.”\nI said, “It is a quality. Obedience is just a kind of death. The person has no individuality of his own; he has become only an actor. And I don’t want to become an actor.”\nThere was a fair just a few miles away from my village. I went to the fair. My father was worried, and he came in search of me. He knew that I must have gone to the fair. He was worried because in that fair there were prostitutes, magicians, gamblers and all kinds of things used to happen. And the fair continued for one month.\nSo he got hold of me on the third day, and he asked me, “Why did not you tell me that you want to go to the fair?”\nI said, “Because I wanted to go.”\nFor a moment, he was silent, and he said, “If you wanted to gothat’s what I am saying, that you\nshould have told me.”\nI said, “I could not afford to tell you, because then going to the fair would have been impossible. I really wanted to go. So you make it a note in your mind that when I don’t ask for something, that means I really want to do it. And when I ask about something, I do not care whether you say no or yes – it does not matter.\n“So any nonessential thing I will ask, but any essential thing I am not going to ask – because, why commit a double crime? First, I am going whether you say yes or no, and then there is a second crime, that I am disobeying you. At least I came to the fair without disobeying anybody, just obeying myself.”\nWithout your being aware, your parents, your teachers, your neighbors, your friends... all are putting things around you, creating an image of you. And because the image brings respect, honor, you start holding it. But you don’t know it is the death of your real being. You become an actor; life becomes a drama where you smile when your heart is not with your lips, where you cry, but those tears are crocodile tears.\nI used to live with one of my father’s sisters. Her husband’s sister died – she had come for treatment, and she had also been living in the same house. She had been old, crippled, and it was a burden on the family, so nobody was really sad about her death – in fact everybody said privately, “It is good. For the family it is good, and for her also because she was suffering too much.” But you cannot say these things publicly.\nI used to sit outside on the lawn, and my father’s sister told me, “Whenever somebody comes – neighbors come, relatives come” For at least a few days this whole drama continued. So she had\ntold me, “Whenever you see that some relative is coming...” just to give consolation about herAnd\nnobody needed the consolation; in fact, the death of the woman had consoled everybody.\nBut my father’s sister had to cry and weep, so I had to push the button: “Get ready.” Because it is not easy when you don’t want to cry, but in India it is easy. She used to pull her ghunghat down so you could not see her face, and she used to keep waterThe moment I would push the button, she\nwould immediately put a few drops of water on her face, pull down her ghunghat – cover her face in the sari – and would start talking about how untimely it was that the old woman had died. I was amazed at the whole thing.\nOne day a very close relative came and I did not give the signal. I told the man, “You go in.” And she was not prepared. She was very angry at me saying, “I could not manageI could just pull my\nghunghat down, but I could not show the tears. What will the man think?”\nI said, “What happened.I think something must have gone wrong with the electricity. It is not my\nfault, I had pushed the button.”\nShe said, “Then you should take care that nothing goes wrong, because I was in such an awkward position. I was sitting with a friend, laughing and enjoying, when the man entered. Suddenly I had to change from laughing to crying, and I could not manage the tears. Then to put the water on in front of him would have been too much.”\nYou are living acts, but you are not allowing your reality to function.\nSurabhi, your personality has to die, has to be discarded, so that your individuality, in its authenticity, starts functioning. To be an individual is a beautiful experience, and to be just carrying a bogus personality around yourself is nothing but misery.\nBecause of the personality, your individuality cannot grow. Slowly, slowly, you become so identified with the personality that you forget the individuality – you become Abraham Lincoln. But however accurately you become Abraham Lincoln, it is not going to give you joy, contentment, blissfulness, because you are false, and these things don’t happen to anybody who is false. Be sincere and be truthful, and your joy will know no bounds.\nYou are saying, “Although I feel like I am dying, I am so glad.” This statement is possible only if you are really going through the process; otherwise you would not have been able to put this contradiction together.\nIt is not your imagination. Allow that which is dying; help it to die – the sooner it dies the better. Then whatever remains will be your innocence – the individuality that you had brought into the world, but which the world corrupted. It corrupts, and it succeeds in corrupting everyone because small children cannot do anything.\nListening to the birds, I remember.… Just outside my classroom in the high school there were beautiful mango trees. And mango trees are where cuckoos make their nests. This is the cuckoo that is calling, and there is nothing sweeter than the sound of a cuckoo.\nSo I used to sit by the window, looking out at the birds, at the trees, and my teachers were very much annoyed. They said, “You have to look at the blackboard.”\nI said, “It is my life, and I have every right to choose where to look. Outside is so beautiful – the birds singing, and the flowers, and the trees, and the sun coming through the trees – that I don’t think your blackboard can be a competitor.”\nHe was so angry that he told me, “Then you can go out and stand there outside the window unless you are ready to look at the blackboard – because I am teaching you mathematics, and you are looking at the trees and the birds.”\nI said, “This is a great reward you are giving me, not a punishment.” And I said goodbye to him. He said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “I will never come in, I will be standing every day outside the window.”\nHe said, “You must be crazy. I will report to your father, to your family: ‘You are wasting money on him, and he’s standing outside.’”\nI said, “You can do anything you want to do. I know how to manage things with my father. And he knows perfectly well that if I have decided then I will remain outside the window – nothing can change it.”\nThe principal used to see me standing outside the window every day when he came for a round. He was puzzled at what I was doing there every day. On the third or fourth day he came to me, and he said, “What are you doing? Why do you go on standing here?”\nI said, “I have been rewarded.” He said, “Rewarded? For what?”\nI said, “You just stand by my side and listen to the songs of the birds. And the beauty of the trees.… Do you think looking at the blackboard and that stupid teacher... because only stupid people become teachers; they cannot find any other employment. Mostly they are third class graduates. So neither do I want to look at that teacher, nor do I want to look at the blackboard. As far as mathematics is concerned, you need not be worried – I will manage it. But I cannot miss this beauty.”\nHe stood by my side, and he said, “Certainly it is beautiful. I have been a principal for twenty years in this school, and I never came here. And I agree with you that this is a reward. As far as mathematics is concerned, I am an M.Sc. in mathematics. You can come to my house anytime, and I will teach you mathematics – but you continue to stand outside.”\nSo I got a better teacher, the principal of the school, who was a better mathematician. And my mathematics teacher was very much puzzled. He thought that I would get tired after a few days, but the whole month passed. Then he came out, and he said, “I am sorry, because it hurts me continuously the whole time I am in the class that I have forced you to stand out here. And you have not done any harm. You can sit inside and look wherever you want.”\nI said, “Now it is too late.”\nHe said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “I mean that now I enjoy being outside. Sitting behind the window only a very small portion of the trees and the birds is available; here all the thousands of mango trees are available. And as far as mathematics is concerned, the principal is teaching me himself; every evening I go to him.”\nHe said, “What?”\nI said, “Yes, because he agreed with me that this is a reward.”\nHe went directly to the principal and said, “This is not good. I had punished him and you are encouraging him.” The principal said, “Forget punishment and encouragement – you should also stand outside sometime. Now I cannot wait; otherwise I used to go for the round as a routine, but now I cannot wait. The first thing I have to do is to go for the round and stay with that boy and look at the trees.\n“For the first time, I have learned that there are better things than mathematics – the sounds of the birds, the flowers, the green trees, the sun rays coming through the trees, the wind blowing, singing its song through the trees. Once in a while you should also go and accompany him.”\nHe came back very sorry and said, “The principal told me what has happened, so what should I do?” He asked me, “Should I take the whole class out?”\nI said, “That would be great. We can sit under these trees, and you can teach your mathematics. But I am not going to come in the class, even if you make me fail – which you cannot do, because I now know more mathematics than any student in the class. And I have a better teacher. You are a third class B.Sc., and he is a first class gold medalist M.Sc.”\nFor a few days he thought about it, and one morning when I went there I saw that the whole class was sitting under the trees. I said, “Your heart is still alive; mathematics has not killed it.”\nBut every child has to follow so many things, so many people, that by the time he has grown up, become adult, it is too late – the personality has taken over, and the individuality is forgotten.\nSurabhi, let the individuality die. It is not individuality that you have been thinking of, up to now, as your individuality – let it die. It is simply personality; and when it has died, without leaving any trace behind, you will find yourself. For the first time you will meet yourself, and that meeting becomes the beginning of spiritual growth.\nIt is not your imagination. The personality may be telling you, “It is all imagination.” I don’t believe in imagination. I destroy all kinds of imaginations so that you can know your consciousness without any dreams, without any projections, without any imaginations – just pure awareness. And that pure awareness is the door to the divine.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes,Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6172","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/>The Razor\'s Edge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 Our dance is forever</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6172 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Razors_Edge/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WITH YOU, BUT WHO WANTS TO REACH THE OCEAN? SOMETIMES MUCH LONGING IS
THERE, BUT I REALLY DON’T KNOW FOR WHAT. I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY
THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE US IN THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT AGAIN, I
HAVE ONLY A FANTASY OF WHAT THIS MEANS. AND WHO WANTS TO BE THERE WHEN
THIS LIFE IS SO INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL. AM I MISSING THE POINT? IS THERE
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD? PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Parigyan, I am sorry to say that you are missing the point.
This life is beautiful, this existence is wonderful, this moment is
ecstatic; but there is much more. This is only the beginning, and to
stop at the beginning is very unfortunate. And deep down you are also
feeling it; otherwise this question would not have arisen.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “It is so wonderful to be a river, to sing and dance
and celebrate with you, but who wants to reach the ocean?” But why has
the question of the ocean arisen at all in you? Apparently it looks like
you do not want to reach the ocean – the river is beautiful; its song is
beautiful, its dance is beautiful. But melting into the ocean, it melts
into a bigger song. Merging into the ocean, it merges into the universal
music, into the eternal dance.</p><p>Rivers come and go; the ocean remains. And the whole dance of the
river, its song, its beauty, is because of the ocean. It is dancing and
is joyful because the ocean is coming closer every moment. If the same
river is lost in a desert, all dance will disappear, all song will
disappear. That will be a death.</p><p><br></p><p>The river is so tremendously blissful because it knows it is going to
the ocean. At the ocean it appears on the one hand as if the river has
disappeared, but in fact only the banks disappear – the river remains.
And the banks are a bondage. The river was dancing, but its feet were
chained. Those banks were its prison. The dance will remain, will become
freer – so vast that perhaps you cannot see it, because the river is not
going to disappear; it is going to become the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>You have raised a significant question, because it happens to all
those who follow the path. Even the beginning is so beautiful that many
think they have arrived and there is no need to go any further.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to remember that each beginning has to be transformed not
into a stopover forever, but into a new beginning. And the journey is
infinite, so whenever you feel, “This is the place to stop,” you will
always be wrong, because existence stops nowhere. It simply goes on
evolving. It has no limits, no boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>Looked at from the point of view of the river – and you are not the
river, you are just watching the river – it seems to be lost in the
ocean. But you can say just the contrary – that the ocean is lost in the
river.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir, one of the great mystics of this country, when he was young
and for the first time felt the melting and merging with the divine, he
wrote a small poem – two lines of which are:</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEWDROP DISAPPEARS INTO THE OCEAN.</p><p>Kabir is no more. Although Kabir had started to search, what he
wanted to find has been found; but the searcher has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Those lines are beautiful, but before dying, just on his deathbed, he
called his son, Kamaal, and said, “You change those two lines. It is
true that Kabir has disappeared. The seeker has disappeared; although
what he had started out to find has been found. But the second line... I
was too young, and the experience was too new.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am sorry that I wrote it, that the dewdrop has disappeared into
the ocean. Now at my ripe old age, I can see that something just the
contrary of what I had written had happened. So change it, write:</p><p><br></p><p>THE OCEAN HAS DISAPPEARED INTO THE DEW DROP.”</p><p>Both are true, but the second has deeper implications. It is not only
man who is in search of God. It is not only that man disappears in God;
God is also in search of man.</p><p>And when the meeting happens, it is far more significant to say that
the God disappears into the man. And you are aware of it; otherwise the
question would not have come to your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “Who wants to reach the ocean?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like an old parable of Aesop. A fox was trying to reach to
the fruits which were hanging, ripe, on a tall tree. But her jump always
fell short. She tried hard, again and again, but she could not reach the
fruits. A small rabbit was watching the whole thing. The fox was not
aware that there was somebody watching. Tired, the fox moved away from
the tree, and the rabbit asked, “Uncle, what happened?” And the fox
said, “The fruits are not yet ripe. And who cares about fruits which are
not ripe?”</p><p><br></p><p>There have been many sannyasins who used to live on the campus, in
other houses, and sometimes they were moved to Lao Tzu. And they wrote a
letter to me saying, “We owe an apology to You, because living in other
houses, we were always thinking, ‘Who cares to live in Lao Tzu.’ But now
that we have come to live in Lao Tzu, we know perfectly well that we
were repressing our desire, our longing, to be in Lao Tzu, and just
consoling ourselves, ‘Who cares.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Parigyan, don’t be like the fox in Aesop’s parable. Don’t say, “Who
cares for the ocean.” The whole dance of the river is for the ocean. It
is moving from the mountain just like a newly married girl, running to
meet her lover.</p><p><br></p><p>One of India’s great emperors, Akbar, in his autobiography, AKBAR
NAMMA, has written many significant things. But one story is relevant to
your question. It was an actual incident.</p><p><br></p><p>He had gone hunting in the forest, and then lost his way. The sun was
setting – and that was the time for Mohammedans to do their prayer – so
he sat under a tree to do Namaj, the Mohammedan prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was in the middle of his prayer a young girl ran by his
side, almost hitting him as she went by. He could not speak; he was
immediately very angry. In the first place nobody in his prayers should
be disturbed. And he was not just anybody; he was the emperor of the
country. And this girl had not even said, “I am sorry.” She had not even
looked back. She went rushing on to wherever she was going.</p><p><br></p><p>His prayer finished, Akbar waited for the girl, because she would
have to come back to the village. Where she had gone, there was only
deep forest for miles.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally she came back. Akbar was still angry, and he said, “You seem
to be very rude, uncivilized – couldn’t you see that I was praying? And
I am not just anybody, I am the emperor of the country.”</p><p><br></p><p>The girl said, “I am sorry, but as far as I am concerned, I never saw
you. My body may have touched your body, but I don’t even remember that
your body touched mine, because I was going to meet my lover, who is
coming after many years. I wanted to meet him just on the road that
passes a few miles away. And I was so full of my lover and his sweet
memories that I was almost not myself. So just forgive me. It was not
deliberate on my part to disturb you; I was not even aware of it.</p><p>“But I want to ask you one question. I was going to meet just an
ordinary lover. And you were praying to the greatest lover of the world,
to God, and you were disturbed. You became angry, and you have been
waiting here to punish me. It was not prayer. You were repeating those
words just like a parrot; otherwise you would not have known who had
gone by, who had touched you, you would have been so deeply involved
with the ultimate beloved.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Akbar was a very sensible man – perhaps the most sensible emperor
India has known. He asked the girl to forgive him. And she had taught
him a great lesson. He told her, “You are right. Your love was
authentic. My prayer was false, just routine.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the river is dancing and singing and rushing it is going to the
ocean to its lover, to its ultimate beloved. There is nothing wrong in
experiencing the beauty of this moment. But remember, this beauty has to
grow more; each coming moment it has to bring more flowers, more songs,
more dances.</p><p><br></p><p>And deep down you are longing for those; hence you say, “Who cares?
Who wants to reach the ocean? Sometimes much longing is there.” Longing
for what? – because you have stopped your being from taking note that
all your dance and joy is for the ocean. Now you cannot find the object
of your longing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sometimes much longing is there, but I really don’t know for what.”
You yourself are preventing it; otherwise it is in your heart – the
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was so happy to hear you say that you will recognize us in the
universal consciousness.” Again, the same thing. Mind goes on repeating
the same mistakes. “But again I have only a fantasy of what this means.
And who wants to be there when this life is so incredibly
wonderful.”</p><p><br></p><p>But do you think this is the limit? Do you think this is all? You
know perfectly well. You may suppress it, but your being knows that this
is not all. This is only the beginning – don’t make it an end. In fact,
there is no end. It is always beginning, reaching higher and higher,
deeper and deeper, closer and closer.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is always beginning. And this is the grandeur of life – that
you will never come to a full stop, because the full stop means death.
It is good to have many commas and semicolons in your life, but don’t
have any full stops. Keep it open, and your dance will become richer,
and your song will become celestial.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is the pilgrimage – just the pilgrimage in search of
something which you will many times think has been found, and again you
will have to realize: this is a new beginning, not an end. From eternity
to eternity, from one sky to another sky, we go on moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Our dance is forever.</p><p><br></p><p>You know you are missing the point; hence you ask, “Am I missing the
point? Is there something that needs to be understood?” There is much
that has to be understood. And you are missing the point – it has to be
consciously recognized.</p><p>You become satisfied with so small, so little. A spiritual seeker
remains in a strange balance. He is contented with whatever he has got,
but he never loses his discontent for more. It is a difficult point to
understand, because it appears contradictory. It seems either you should
be contented or discontented. But the spiritual seeker is both: he is
contented with whatever life has given, but he knows there is much more;
hence, he is discontented too... contented with the past and
discontented for the future. Hence, he goes on discovering new treasures
every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE FLOWERS THAT ARE BLOSSOMING AROUND YOU REJOICE IN THE MORNING
DEWDROPS, THE SUNSHINE, IN THE SILENT, COOL BREEZE. A SEED, LIKE ME, IS
IN NEED OF MORE TANGIBLE AND BASIC STUFF LIKE EARTH AND WATER. THESE
FLOWERS GOT THEIR SOIL AND WATER ALREADY IN THE PAST, BUT I MISSED. BUT
YOU ARE STILL MY MASTER, SO TELL ME, IS THERE NO HOPE FOR ME ANYMORE?
BELOVED OSHO, PLEASE HELP.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Priya, it does not matter at what time you have arrived to me –
in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, or even in the middle
of the night – what matters is that you have arrived. You will have to
be a little patient, because those who have come before are having
flowers, fragrance, foliage.</p><p><br></p><p>But rather than becoming jealous of them, take courage from their
experience, because the seed needs great courage. Unless the seed is
ready to die in the earth there is no possibility of any sprout being
born. The death of the seed is the birth of the plant. Seeing all those
bushes and plants full of flowers will give you encouragement so that
you need not be afraid. Your seed also contains many flowers, much
future, much joy. And if I have been able to give other plants their
basic needs like earth and water, I will become your earth, your water
too.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are new and must be wondering whether this miracle that has
happened to other trees is going to happen to you, or not. It all
depends on you. If you are ready to die as a seed, as an ego,
immediately you will start growing, blossoming. The spring always waits
at the door – just you have to gather courage to disappear in the earth.
And the master is nothing but an excuse for your ego to die.</p><p><br></p><p>You are afraid to lose your ego because you don’t know, if you lose
your ego, what will remain. But look around – and you are aware that
people are blossoming. They were also in the same state in which you
are, but they arrived in the morning and you have come in the
evening.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have a proverb: If a man is lost in the morning and comes
back home in the evening, he should not be called “the lost”. He has
arrived, what does it matter whether it was morning or evening? All that
is significant is arriving home.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to be your earth and I am going to be your water – just as
I have been the earth and water to others. Allow your seed to disappear.
The moment the disciple disappears in the master, spring has come. Then
thousands of flowers will be yours. Right now, also they are with you,
but only as a potential. They need actualization; and for actualization
the seed has to die.</p><p>It is one of the mysteries of life, that the seed protects your
potential until it finds the right soil. But the seed is blind. It is a
protective layer, but the protective layer can become an imprisonment if
you start clinging with it. Say goodbye to it. Be grateful to it that it
protected you till you reached the place where you could discard it. And
you can come out of it with all your glory, with all your beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Every man is born with the potential of the divine in him; no man is
there without the potential.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story about Gautam Buddha’s past life, when he
was not yet awakened, when he was himself a seed. But another man, his
name was Deepankar, had become a buddha. His name is beautiful –
deepankar means full of light. And thousands of people were coming to
Deepankar to listen to his words, to sit at his feet, to have his
blessings, to find a discipline from him and an encouragement.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who was going to become Gautam Buddha in the next life also
went to see him. He was so beautiful, so silent, so serene, so blissful,
that the man who was going to become Gautam Buddha in the next life,
although he had come with all kinds of skepticism and doubts, forgot all
his skepticism, forgot all his doubts, and fell to the feet of Deepankar
Buddha. His very presence was enough to dispel the darkness of his
skepticism. But he was very much puzzled – as he stood up, Deepankar
Buddha bowed down and touched the feet of this unknown man.</p><p><br></p><p>He was puzzled, and he said, “My touching your feet is perfectly
right. I am wandering in darkness; you have arrived and you are full of
light. I had come with many doubts, but just seeing you, looking into
your eyes, they all have disappeared. I have never felt such silence,
such serenity. It is perfectly right for me to touch your feet in
gratitude. But what have you done? Why have you touched my feet? – an
ignorant man, unconscious of his own self?”</p><p><br></p><p>Deepankar laughed and he said, “Don’t be worried. It is only a
question of morning and evening.” The man said, ” What do you mean by
morning and evening?”</p><p>Deepankar said, “I arrived a little earlier, but I can see you... you
may not be aware, but I can see that by the evening you will also have
arrived. In the next life you will become awakened, enlightened. It does
not matter – the seed has become actual in me, in you it is a potential,
but the value is the same. And more emphatically I have touched your
feet, so that you can remember when you become a Gautam Buddha, that
anybody who comes to you is also a Gautam Buddha of some future
life.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have touched your feet so that you never forget the reverence for
every human being, however lost. He may be a murderer, he may be a
criminal – it does not matter. It is only a question of time. But
everybody’s spring is going to come. One day all beings have to become
awakened. They can delay it, they can postpone it, but they cannot
cancel it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to tell that story again and again to newcomers: “Don’t
be worried. I myself was worried, and when Deepankar said this to me it
gave me such an upsurge of energy, such a confidence, that if Deepankar
says that next life I am going to become a buddha, I have already become
a buddha. It is only a question of time – and time does not matter; the
whole eternity is available.”</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MY LIFE SEEMS TO HANG FROM A SINGLE THREAD, AND THAT THREAD IS YOU.
DAY BY DAY THE FEELING GROWS, AND NOW I FIND MYSELF CARING ABOUT ONLY
ONE THING: BEING AS CLOSE TO YOU AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LONG A TIME AS
POSSIBLE. WHILE THE TOTALITY OF THE FEELING FRIGHTENS ME A LITTLE,
OVERWHELMS ME, I WOULD NOT WISH IT ANY OTHER WAY. ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE I
AM DYING, I AM SO GLAD. BELOVED OSHO, AM I IMAGINING THINGS AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Surabhi, it is not your imagination, for the simple fact that
you are saying, “Although I feel like I am dying, I am so glad.” It is a
basic truth of spiritual life that before you really know what life is
you have to die to the old, which you had been taught is your life. It
was phony, false. It was more or less acting in a drama, and sometimes
the drama can become too much.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that after the murder of Abraham Lincoln... one hundred
years had passed, and the whole year was celebrated in his sacred
memory. A drama was prepared, which moved all over America all through
the year, playing the same drama based on the life of Abraham Lincoln.
And it was a rare coincidence that they could find a man who looked like
Abraham – he was lean and thin and tall and ugly. Abraham Lincoln was
not a very beautiful person, as far as his face is concerned. As far as
his being is concerned, he was one of the most beautiful persons.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was fighting in the election for the presidentship, a little
girl suggested to him, “If you grew a small beard, that would make your
face look more beautiful,” because he had marks on his face from small
pox. First he laughed, but he thanked the girl and he thought it over.
And he grew the beard, and with the beard his face took a totally new
shape.</p><p><br></p><p>This man had the beard, had the same kind of eyes, the same nose, the
same height; so he was given the part of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham
Lincoln used to stutter a little once in a while, so he was taught to
stutter. He was also a little lame – one leg was a little longer than
the other – so they tried to make one of this man’s legs a little longer
by traction, pulling it – just a little longer so he started walking
like a lame man.</p><p><br></p><p>They trained him to speak the way Abraham Lincoln used to speak – one
hundred year-old language, words which were in fashion in those days.
And he proved to be a perfect actor. Anybody could have misunderstood,
seeing him, that he was Abraham Lincoln.</p><p><br></p><p>And for one year he was moving around the whole continent playing the
same drama, three times a day – in the morning, in the evening, in the
night. The poor man got so much obsessed with it that when he came home
he still walked the way Abraham Lincoln used to walk; he still talked in
one hundred year-old language, and he still stuttered.</p><p><br></p><p>His wife, his children, his father and mother all laughed. They said,
“You have done enough – one year – now, drop it. And let your other leg
also be lengthened so that you stop this business of walking like a lame
man. And there is no need to stutter.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he said, “I am Abraham Lincoln.”</p><p>First they thought he was joking, but soon they realized it was not a
joke. He had started believing that he was Abraham Lincoln. They tried
in every possible way... but once he had seen the glory of being the
President of America and one of the greatest men of history, he was not
ready to descend down back to being an ordinary human being.</p><p><br></p><p>He was brought to the psychoanalyst, but to no effect; he would
behave just like Abraham Lincoln. And he would ask the psychoanalyst,
“What is missing in me that you are so worried? What is the problem? Why
am I not accepted as Abraham Lincoln? You show me any fault.<span class=s4></span>” And it was true,</p><p>there was no fault.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the psychoanalyst said , “This is beyond.<span class=s4></span>this is not a case of mental derangement. He has</p><p>become obsessed, and he will understand only when he has been
assassinated. But then there will be no point. And if you assassinate
him, perhaps he may think that he was right – even dying, he will die
exactly like Abraham Lincoln. He has died many times on the stage,
although the assassination was false. But he knew how to fall, what to
say, what Abraham Lincoln’s last words were. Even if he is assassinated,
he will do his act to the very last.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will think that this is a rare story, but the fact is, you are
all living a personality which has been imposed on you.</p><p><br></p><p>My father used to introduce me to guests: “He is very obedient,” and
I would immediately tell the guest, “He is saying something absolutely
wrong. I am not obedient.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he would tell me, “That at least in front of the guests, you
could have remained silent.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I cannot, because this is the way people are falsified. If I
go on accepting that ‘I am obedient, I am obedient, I am obedient...’ I
may start being obedient, which is not true. You should introduce me
saying ‘This boy is very disobedient.’ Then I will remain silent,
because you are saying something true.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But it looks very awkward to introduce your own son to
somebody saying, ‘He is very disobedient,’ as if disobedience is a
quality.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is a quality. Obedience is just a kind of death. The
person has no individuality of his own; he has become only an actor. And
I don’t want to become an actor.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was a fair just a few miles away from my village. I went to the
fair. My father was worried, and he came in search of me. He knew that I
must have gone to the fair. He was worried because in that fair there
were prostitutes, magicians, gamblers and all kinds of things used to
happen. And the fair continued for one month.</p><p><br></p><p>So he got hold of me on the third day, and he asked me, “Why did not
you tell me that you want to go to the fair?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Because I wanted to go.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment, he was silent, and he said, “If you wanted to go<span class=s4></span>that’s what I am saying, that you</p><p>should have told me.”</p><p>I said, “I could not afford to tell you, because then going to the
fair would have been impossible. I really wanted to go. So you make it a
note in your mind that when I don’t ask for something, that means I
really want to do it. And when I ask about something, I do not care
whether you say no or yes – it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>“So any nonessential thing I will ask, but any essential thing I am
not going to ask – because, why commit a double crime? First, I am going
whether you say yes or no, and then there is a second crime, that I am
disobeying you. At least I came to the fair without disobeying anybody,
just obeying myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without your being aware, your parents, your teachers, your
neighbors, your friends... all are putting things around you, creating
an image of you. And because the image brings respect, honor, you start
holding it. But you don’t know it is the death of your real being. You
become an actor; life becomes a drama where you smile when your heart is
not with your lips, where you cry, but those tears are crocodile
tears.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with one of my father’s sisters. Her husband’s sister
died – she had come for treatment, and she had also been living in the
same house. She had been old, crippled, and it was a burden on the
family, so nobody was really sad about her death – in fact everybody
said privately, “It is good. For the family it is good, and for her also
because she was suffering too much.” But you cannot say these things
publicly.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to sit outside on the lawn, and my father’s sister told me,
“Whenever somebody comes – neighbors come, relatives come<span class=s4></span>” For at least a few days this whole drama continued.
So she had</p><p>told me, “Whenever you see that some relative is coming...” just to
give consolation about her<span class=s4></span>And</p><p>nobody needed the consolation; in fact, the death of the woman had
consoled everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>But my father’s sister had to cry and weep, so I had to push the
button: “Get ready.” Because it is not easy when you don’t want to cry,
but in India it is easy. She used to pull her ghunghat down so you could
not see her face, and she used to keep water<span class=s4></span>The
moment I would push the button, she</p><p>would immediately put a few drops of water on her face, pull down her
ghunghat – cover her face in the sari – and would start talking about
how untimely it was that the old woman had died. I was amazed at the
whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a very close relative came and I did not give the signal. I
told the man, “You go in.” And she was not prepared. She was very angry
at me saying, “I could not manage<span class=s4></span>I could just
pull my</p><p>ghunghat down, but I could not show the tears. What will the man
think?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What happened.<span class=s4></span>I think something must
have gone wrong with the electricity. It is not my</p><p>fault, I had pushed the button.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Then you should take care that nothing goes wrong, because
I was in such an awkward position. I was sitting with a friend, laughing
and enjoying, when the man entered. Suddenly I had to change from
laughing to crying, and I could not manage the tears. Then to put the
water on in front of him would have been too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are living acts, but you are not allowing your reality to
function.</p><p>Surabhi, your personality has to die, has to be discarded, so that
your individuality, in its authenticity, starts functioning. To be an
individual is a beautiful experience, and to be just carrying a bogus
personality around yourself is nothing but misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the personality, your individuality cannot grow. Slowly,
slowly, you become so identified with the personality that you forget
the individuality – you become Abraham Lincoln. But however accurately
you become Abraham Lincoln, it is not going to give you joy,
contentment, blissfulness, because you are false, and these things don’t
happen to anybody who is false. Be sincere and be truthful, and your joy
will know no bounds.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “Although I feel like I am dying, I am so glad.” This
statement is possible only if you are really going through the process;
otherwise you would not have been able to put this contradiction
together.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not your imagination. Allow that which is dying; help it to die
– the sooner it dies the better. Then whatever remains will be your
innocence – the individuality that you had brought into the world, but
which the world corrupted. It corrupts, and it succeeds in corrupting
everyone because small children cannot do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to the birds, I remember.… Just outside my classroom in the
high school there were beautiful mango trees. And mango trees are where
cuckoos make their nests. This is the cuckoo that is calling, and there
is nothing sweeter than the sound of a cuckoo.</p><p><br></p><p>So I used to sit by the window, looking out at the birds, at the
trees, and my teachers were very much annoyed. They said, “You have to
look at the blackboard.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is my life, and I have every right to choose where to
look. Outside is so beautiful – the birds singing, and the flowers, and
the trees, and the sun coming through the trees – that I don’t think
your blackboard can be a competitor.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was so angry that he told me, “Then you can go out and stand there
outside the window unless you are ready to look at the blackboard –
because I am teaching you mathematics, and you are looking at the trees
and the birds.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is a great reward you are giving me, not a punishment.”
And I said goodbye to him. He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p>I said, “I will never come in, I will be standing every day outside
the window.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You must be crazy. I will report to your father, to your
family: ‘You are wasting money on him, and he’s standing outside.’”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You can do anything you want to do. I know how to manage
things with my father. And he knows perfectly well that if I have
decided then I will remain outside the window – nothing can change
it.”</p><p>The principal used to see me standing outside the window every day
when he came for a round. He was puzzled at what I was doing there every
day. On the third or fourth day he came to me, and he said, “What are
you doing? Why do you go on standing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have been rewarded.” He said, “Rewarded? For what?”</p><p>I said, “You just stand by my side and listen to the songs of the
birds. And the beauty of the trees.… Do you think looking at the
blackboard and that stupid teacher... because only stupid people become
teachers; they cannot find any other employment. Mostly they are third
class graduates. So neither do I want to look at that teacher, nor do I
want to look at the blackboard. As far as mathematics is concerned, you
need not be worried – I will manage it. But I cannot miss this
beauty.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stood by my side, and he said, “Certainly it is beautiful. I have
been a principal for twenty years in this school, and I never came here.
And I agree with you that this is a reward. As far as mathematics is
concerned, I am an M.Sc. in mathematics. You can come to my house
anytime, and I will teach you mathematics – but you continue to stand
outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I got a better teacher, the principal of the school, who was a
better mathematician. And my mathematics teacher was very much puzzled.
He thought that I would get tired after a few days, but the whole month
passed. Then he came out, and he said, “I am sorry, because it hurts me
continuously the whole time I am in the class that I have forced you to
stand out here. And you have not done any harm. You can sit inside and
look wherever you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Now it is too late.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I mean that now I enjoy being outside. Sitting behind the
window only a very small portion of the trees and the birds is
available; here all the thousands of mango trees are available. And as
far as mathematics is concerned, the principal is teaching me himself;
every evening I go to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Yes, because he agreed with me that this is a reward.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went directly to the principal and said, “This is not good. I had
punished him and you are encouraging him.” The principal said, “Forget
punishment and encouragement – you should also stand outside sometime.
Now I cannot wait; otherwise I used to go for the round as a routine,
but now I cannot wait. The first thing I have to do is to go for the
round and stay with that boy and look at the trees.</p><p><br></p><p>“For the first time, I have learned that there are better things than
mathematics – the sounds of the birds, the flowers, the green trees, the
sun rays coming through the trees, the wind blowing, singing its song
through the trees. Once in a while you should also go and accompany
him.”</p><p>He came back very sorry and said, “The principal told me what has
happened, so what should I do?” He asked me, “Should I take the whole
class out?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That would be great. We can sit under these trees, and you
can teach your mathematics. But I am not going to come in the class,
even if you make me fail – which you cannot do, because I now know more
mathematics than any student in the class. And I have a better teacher.
You are a third class B.Sc., and he is a first class gold medalist
M.Sc.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a few days he thought about it, and one morning when I went there
I saw that the whole class was sitting under the trees. I said, “Your
heart is still alive; mathematics has not killed it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But every child has to follow so many things, so many people, that by
the time he has grown up, become adult, it is too late – the personality
has taken over, and the individuality is forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>Surabhi, let the individuality die. It is not individuality that you
have been thinking of, up to now, as your individuality – let it die. It
is simply personality; and when it has died, without leaving any trace
behind, you will find yourself. For the first time you will meet
yourself, and that meeting becomes the beginning of spiritual
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not your imagination. The personality may be telling you, “It
is all imagination.” I don’t believe in imagination. I destroy all kinds
of imaginations so that you can know your consciousness without any
dreams, without any projections, without any imaginations – just pure
awareness. And that pure awareness is the door to the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes,Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

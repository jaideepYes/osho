BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. CONTINUE EASY, AND YOU ARE RIGHT.\nTHE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY.”\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT?\nAnand Shanti, Chuang Tzu is very rare – in a way the most unique mystic in the whole history of man. His uniqueness is that he talks in absurdities. All his poems and stories are just absurd. And his reason to choose absurdity as his expression is very significant: the mind has to be silenced. With anything rational, it cannot stop; it goes on and on. Anything logical and the mind finds nourishment through it. It is only the absurd that suddenly shocks the mind – it is beyond mind’s grasp.\nHis stories, his poems and his other statements are so absurd that either people simply left him, thinking that he is mad.Those who were courageous enough to remain with him found that no\nother meditation is needed. Just listening to his absurd statements, the mind stops functioning. And that is the meaning of meditation.\nMeditation is not of the mind.\nMost of the Western translations of treatises from the East on meditation have fallen in the same track. They have used the word meditation as if it is concentration. And in fact the English word meditation seems to be synonymous with concentration.\nEnglish has three words – concentration, contemplation, meditation. None of them comes even close to the Eastern word dhyana, that became in China ch’an and in Japan zen. The root is the Sanskrit word dhyana, and it will be very good for you to understand the distinction. In concentration your mind is focused, narrowed only on one object.\nA famous story about one of the great master archersArjuna says that his teacher, Dronacharya,\nwas giving the final examination of his disciples. He had put a dead bird far away on a tree as a target.\nHe asked one of his disciples, Duryodhana, “What are you seeing?” Duryodhana said, “Everything! The trees, the sun rising behind them, the bird that you have put as a target. I am seeing everything.”\nDronacharya asked another disciple; he said, “I see only the bird.” He is more concentrated. Duryodhana has his mind spread all over the place. The second disciple says he is seeing only the bird. But the master is not satisfied.\nHe asks Arjuna, “What are you seeing?” Arjuna says, “Only the eye of the bird that you have told us is going to be the target. I don’t see anything else.” His concentration has come even more narrow. And for an archer, this kind of concentration is needed. But meditation is not archery.\nContemplation is not being concentrated on a single object, but thinking about the same object from every possible aspect. For example, somebody is contemplating about love – what does it mean? He remains confined to a certain line of thinking, not to a certain object, but to a certain subject.\nAnd “meditation”, in all the languages of the world except the Indian, Chinese and Japanese, also gives the feeling.The archer is concentrated, but he is not concerned with the eye, the bull’s –\neye. His concern is how to shoot the arrow so that it reaches the eye; his concern is not to miss the target.\nMeditation, as far as Western languages are concerned, is going deeply into one object – thinking, in its deeper implications. Contemplation was linear; you were thinking about a subject from all possible aspects, but the mind was moving. In meditation the mind is not moving. It is similar to concentration without any arrows. Your thoughts are the arrows, but they are hitting the same subject deeper and deeper and deeper – not in a line, not horizontal but vertical.\nThere is no word in Western languages which can translate the word dhyana absolutely and adequately. “Meditation” has been chosen because there is no other word, but it is a wrong choice. Out of the three words, it is the best, but dhyana, ch’an or zen have a totally different meaning: mind has stopped.\nIn concentration mind has narrowed, in contemplation it is flowing in a line on a particular subject, in meditation it is concentrated, and instead of arrows it is throwing thoughts deeper and deeper into the same object. But all three processes belong to the mind.\nDhyana means the mind has been put aside. There is no concentration, there is no contemplation, there is no meditation. It is a state of no-mind; it is absolute silence, not even a small stirring of any thought.\nIn the East, so many devices have been tried... how to stop the mind chattering continuously, how to bypass it, how to stop it, how to go beyond it. Chuang Tzu has his own, unique contribution. He talks to his disciples in absurdities, and the mind cannot tackle them. The mind needs something reasonable, rational, logical; that is its territory. The absurd is beyond it.\nI have told you the famous story about Chuang Tzu: One morning he woke up with tears in his eyes, so sad and so depressed. His disciples had never seen him sad or depressed or with tears; he is an enlightened master... what has happened? They all rushed and enquired, “Can we be of some help?” Chuang Tzu said, “I don’t think so.” They said, “Still, we want to know what is the problem that is torturing you so much. You are beyond problems!”\nChuang Tzu said, “I used to be, but last night I saw a dream and it has disturbed my whole attainment, achievement, self-realization, enlightenment – everything has gone down the drain.”\nThey said, “Just a dream?” He said, “It was not just a dream, it has shattered me into pieces.” They said, “Still, please tell us the dream!”\nThe dream was that Chuang Tzu saw that he had become a butterfly. All the disciples laughed. They said, “Unnecessarily being depressed and crying and tears and thinking that your enlightenment and self-realization have all gone down the drain.It is an ordinary dream, nothing to be worried about\nit. In dreams people see themselves becoming many things, but a dream is a dream.”\nChuang Tzu said, “I understand that a dream is a dream. The problem is that I am worried, who am I? If Chuang Tzu in his sleep can dream that he has become a butterfly, a butterfly in her dream can see she has become Chuang Tzu. And now I am puzzled. Who am I? – a Chuang Tzu or a butterfly?\n“If Chuang Tzu is capable of dreaming himself to be a butterfly, you cannot cancel the possibility of a butterfly taking a nap on the rose bushes and dreaming that she has become Chuang Tzu. Who can prevent her? And the question is, have I awakened, or is the butterfly dreaming that she is Chuang Tzu? You tell me who I am! – the butterfly or Chuang Tzu.”\nThey were all at a loss... what to say? This man goes on finding such absurd things. Millions of people for millions of years have been dreaming, but nobody has raised this question. You have been dreaming, but have you ever raised this question? – that when you wake up perhaps it is the beginning of a new dream.\nWhat makes you so certain that you are not dreaming? – in the dream you were so certain that you are a butterfly, and now you are so certain that you are Chuang Tzu. There is no difference in\ncertainty. In fact when you are awake the possibility of suspicion is there, you can doubt; but when you are dreaming, there is even no doubt at all, no suspicion, no question mark – you are simply a butterfly.\nHe said, “Sit down and meditate and find out the answer – who am I?” They looked at each other – how to meditate upon it, how to think about it? It is unthinkable, it is beyond the mind. His closest disciple, Lieh Tzu, had gone out to the nearest village. He returned; he saw the whole scene: Chuang Tzu in tears sitting on his bed, all the disciples with closed eyes, their minds completely stuck.\nWhat can the mind say about it? The question is absurd. He asked one of the disciples who was near the door, “What is the matter? It seems to be really serious! I have never seen such seriousness here. And why is our master crying? Has somebody died or something?”\nThe disciple said, “He has created a new absurdity. Nobody has died and nothing has happened; he is torturing us and nothing else! Now we have to meditate upon it.” And he told him the problem. Lieh Tzu said, “Don’t be worried. You meditate; I am coming.”\nHe went out, brought a bucket full of ice-cold water and poured it on Chuang Tzu. And Chuang Tzu said laughingly, “If you had been here before you would have saved all these idiots! They are looking so serious, as if they are really thinking. And you would have saved my tears and my misery. Just wait; don’t pour the water, it is too cold.”\nLieh Tzu said, “Has your problem been solved or not?” Chuang Tzu said, “It is solved – you are my successor!”\nIt is not a question to be solved by the mind. The mind is absolutely impotent.\nChuang Tzu has hundreds of stories and he must have had a very strange kind of genius – even to invent those stories is not easy – but his teaching was very simple. And those who remained with him; all became enlightened. That is a rare phenomenon. He defeated even his own master Lao Tzu – a few people became enlightened, but most of Lao Tzu’s disciples remained in their old ignorance. He defeated Gautam Buddha – a few of his disciples became enlightened, but that was a very small proportion, because he had thousands of disciples and not more than a dozen became enlightened.\nChuang Tzu has a rare position in the history of mystics. All his disciples became enlightened.… he would not leave you unless you had become enlightened. He was so much after you that finally people decided that it was better to become enlightened. Every day new torture... the only way to save yourself is to become enlightened. But his method was very simple, and this poem, Anand Shanti, tells in a very aphoristic way his whole approach.\n“Easy is right.” Nobody has dared to say it ever. On the contrary, people make the right as difficult as possible. To you, who have all been conditioned by different traditions, the wrong is easy, and the right is arduous. It needs training, it needs discipline, it needs repression, it needs renouncing the world, it needs renouncing the pleasures.…\nLies are easy, truth is difficult – that is the common conditioning of humanity. But Chuang Tzu is certainly a man of tremendous insight. He says, easy is right. Then why have people been making right difficult? All your saints have been making right very difficult.\nThere is a psychology behind it: only the difficult is attractive to your ego. The more difficult is the task, the more the ego feels challenged.\nClimbing Everest was difficult; hundreds of people had died before Edmund Hillary reached the top alive. For the whole century groups upon groups of mountaineers had been coming, and when Edmund Hillary reached, there was nothing to be found! Just at the very peak there is not even space enough... only one person can stand there, on the highest point. He was asked, “What prompted you? Knowing perfectly well that hundreds of mountaineers have lost their life during one hundred years, and not even their bodies have been found... why did you try this dangerous project?”\nHe said, “I had to try. It was hurting my ego. I am a mountaineer, I love climbing mountains, and it was humiliating that there is Everest and nobody has been able to reach there. It is not a question of finding anything, but I feel so immensely happy.”\nWhat is this happiness? You have not found anything! The happiness is that your ego has become more crystallized. You are the first man in the whole history who has reached Everest; now nobody can take your place. Anybody who will reach there will be second, third... but you have made a mark on the history; you are the first. You have not found anything, but you have found a deep nourishment for your ego. Perhaps Edmund Hillary himself is not aware of it.\nAll the religions are making the right difficult, because the difficult is attractive – attractive to the ego. But the ego is not the truth; The ego is not right. Do you see the dilemma? The ego is attracted only towards the difficult. If you want people to become saints you have to make your right, your truth, your discipline very difficult. The more difficult it is, the more egoists will be attracted, almost magnetically pulled.\nBut the ego is not right. It is the worst thing that can happen to a man. And it cannot deliver to you the right, the truth; it can only make your ego stronger. Chuang Tzu is saying in a simple statement the most pregnant statement: Easy is right. Because for the easy, ego has no attraction.\nIf you are going towards the easy, the ego starts dying. And when there is no ego left, you have arrived to your reality – the right, the truth. And truth and right have to be natural. Easy means natural; you can find them without any effort. Easy is right means natural is right, effortlessness is right, egolessness is right.\nBEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY, CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. They are just two\nsides of the same coin. If, beginning to live a right life, you find it difficult, then remember, it is not right. If, living the right, your life becomes more and more easy, more and more a let-go, flowing with the stream.…\nGoing against the stream is difficult, but going with the stream is not difficult. So either choose the easiest things in life, the most natural things in life, and you will be right; or if you want to begin the other way, remember the criterion that the right has to produce easiness in you, relaxedness in you.\nCONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. Never forget for a moment that the difficult is the food for the ego, and the ego is the barrier that makes you blind to see, makes you deaf to hear, makes your heart hard to open, makes it impossible for you to love, to dance, to sing.\nCONTINUE EASY. Your whole life should be an easy phenomenon. Then you will not be creating the ego. You will be a natural being, just ordinary. And to Chuang Tzu, and to me also, the ordinary is the most extraordinary. The people who are trying to be extraordinary have missed the goal. Just be ordinary, just be nobody.\nBut all your conditionings are so corrupting; they corrupt you. They say; to be easy is to be lazy, to be ordinary is humiliating. If you don’t try for power, for prestige, for respectability, then your life is meaningless – that has been forced into your mind.\nChuang Tzu in these simple statements is taking away all your conditionings.\nCONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. Never for a moment get attracted towards the difficult. It will make you somebody – a prime minister, a president – but it will not make you divine. Easy is divine.\nI have heard about an American super-rich man. He had all the things the world can offer and he had been striving all his life to be on the top; now he had reached and was feeling stupid inside because there was nothing on the top. If Edmund Hillary was intelligent enough, he must have felt stupid standing on Everest... for what have you been trying? The man who walked on the moon must have looked very embarrassed, although there was nobody to see him.\nThis man had come to the top as far as money is concerned, and as far as money can purchase, he had purchased everything. And now he was looking stupid. What is the point of it all? Inside he is hollow. He has no time to give to his inner growth, no time even to be acquainted with himself.\nHe dropped all his riches and rushed towards the East to find the truth, because three-fourths of his life was almost gone – just the tail has remained, the elephant has passed. But if something could be possible there were a few days left. He rushed fast. He went from one master to another master, but nobody could satisfy him, because whatever they were saying was again another trip of the ego. And he was well acquainted with that trip.\nIt does not matter whether you are accumulating money or whether you are accumulating virtue, whether you are becoming respectable here or you are becoming respectable hereafter – it does not matter, it is the same game. Whether you are becoming a world-famous celebrity or a world- worshiped saint, there is no difference; both are ego numbers.\nAnd they were all telling him difficult disciplines and difficult, arduous ways of finding the truth; they were all saying, “It may not be possible in this life, but start anyhow. In the next life maybeThe\njourney is long, the goal is a faraway star.”\nBut now nobody could deceive him. He had found that just becoming somebody special is an exercise in stupidity. Finally he heard about a saint who lived in the Himalayas. And people said, “If you are not satisfied with him, you will never be satisfied with anybody. Then forget the whole thing.”\nSo tired and tattered, walking for miles, finally he found the old man. He was very happy seeing the old man, but was shocked. Before he could say anything, the old man said, “Are you an American?”\nHe said, “Yes, I am.”\nThe old man said, “Very good. Have you got any American cigarettes with you?”\nHe said, “My God, where have I come! I have come to seek truth, to find the right.” He pulled out\ncigarettes and the old man started smoking.\nThe American said, “You have not even asked me for what I have come here, tired, hungry”\nHe said, “That does not matter.”\nThe American said, “I have come to find the truth!”\nThe old man said, “Truth? You do one thing, you go back. And next time when you come, bring a lot of American cigarettes, because here in this place it is very difficult to find cigarettes. And I am an easy-going man, I don’t make any effort; people come on their own. But I like the best cigarettes. Here Indians come with beedies”\n“But,” the man asked, “what about my search?”\nThe old man said, “Your search? This is the discipline for you: go back, get as many cigarettes as you can get and come back and remain here with me.”\nHe asked, “Any discipline?”\nThe old man said, “I am an ordinary old man – no discipline, no religion, no philosophy – I only like to smoke cigarettes. You come here, and slowly, slowly you will also become just as ordinary as I am. And I tell you, to be ordinary, with no pretensions, is the right.”\nAnd as the man was going back, puzzled, the old man said, “Listen, at least leave your wristwatch here, because I don’t have any wristwatch so I don’t know the time, what timeAnd anyway you\nare coming back, so you can bring another wristwatch.” Chuang Tzu would have liked this old man.\nEASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. That has to be the criterion. If you feel uneasiness, tension, then what you have started cannot be right.\nCONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT.\nAnd the last part is something never to be forgotten. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY – because even to remember it is an uneasiness. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY. What is the need of\nremembering these things?\nRelax to such a point... be as natural as the trees and the birds. You will not find in the birds that somebody is a saint and somebody is a sinner; you will not find in the trees that somebody is virtuous and somebody is full of vices. Everything is easy – so easy that you need not remember it.\nI agree with Chuang Tzu with absolute, unconditional, categorical attunement. I would have loved to meet Chuang Tzu. If I were given the opportunity to meet one of the mystics of the whole human history, Chuang Tzu would be my choice. I have named this place Chuang Tzu Auditorium.\nHe was very much misunderstood. It is obvious... because he was destroying all the priests, all the popes, all the imams, all the shankaracharyas; he was destroying the so-called great commandments for being right, and destroying them so easily. He was one of the most natural men the world has seen. He has not given any discipline, he has not given any doctrine, he has not given any catechism. He has simply explained one thing: that if you can be natural and ordinary, just like the birds and the trees, you will blossom, you will have your wings open in the vast sky.\nYou don’t have to be saints. Saints are very tense – more tense than sinners. I have known both. and if there is a choice I will choose the sinners as a company rather than the saints. Saints are the worst company, because their eyes are full of judgment about everything: You should do this and you should not do that. And they start dominating you, condemning you, humiliating you, insulting you, because what they are doing is the right and what you are doing is not the right thing. They have poisoned your nature so badly that if real criminals have to be found they will be found in your saints, not in your sinners. Your sinners have not done much harm to anybody.\nI have been visiting jails, meeting the criminals, and I was surprised that they are the most innocent people. And perhaps because they are the most innocent they have been caught. The cunning ones are doing far greater crimes, but they are not caught. Every law has loopholes. The cunning ones find the loopholes first; the innocent ones get caught, because they don’t have that cunningness.\nIt is really strange that when America forced me into jail without any causeAnd since they had no\ncause, and no reason to keep me in jail, they tried, as long as they could manage, to keep me in jail before the trial began, because once the trial began they didn’t have any evidence for anything.\nBut pre-trial they kept me for twelve days. It was a good experience to knowI had known criminals,\nprisoners, but only as a visitor – and this was a totally different experience, to be one amongst them. And it is surprising that I was taken to five jails just to harass me – for twelve days they went on changing jails – but to me it was a good experience.\nAll the inmates of the jails received me, welcomed me. Behind their bars they were waving their hands and shouting, “Osho, don’t be worried, truth is always victorious.” And they were showing me the sign of victory from every cell, whenever I would enter a jail or I would get out of a jail.\nThey would send me small notes: “We love you. We don’t know you, but we have seen you on the television. We have heard you and we know you are innocent.” Looking into their eyes and looking into the eyes of the law enforcement authorities, one could see the differencewho are the real\ncriminals? The jailers, the marshals, the judges, they were the real criminals. You could see it in their eyes, in their faces.\nTo torture me they refused to supply vegetarian food because no vegetarian has ever been in their jails – “So we don’t have any arrangement.” And when the inmates heard it, they started bringing fruits, nuts, milk, which was given to them, and they would say, “Osho, you take it. We can eat non-vegetarian food and it hurts us that you are hungry, that you are starving and we cannot do\nanything.” My cell was full of fruits. And I used to tell them, “I cannot eat so many fruits, I cannot drink so much milk.”\nBut they would say, “Don’t take this opportunity from us. You are not going to be here for long. Tomorrow they will move you again.”\nAnd they would bring cuttings of my photographs from newspapers to be signed in their name, because this will be their memory – “We have lived with you, even if it was only for one day or two days.”\nIt is a very strange world in which we are living. Here criminals are rulers, here criminals are politicians, here criminals become presidents, vice presidents, prime ministers, because except the criminal, who wants power? An authentic human being wants peace, wants love, wants to be left alone, wants freedom to be himself. The very idea of dominating others is criminal.\nChuang Tzu is right that if you feel any tension, then remember, whatever you are doing is not right. And he is the only man who has given such a beautiful criterion, EASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY.\nRelax into nobodiness.\nAnd this is also my message to my sannyasins: be natural. You don’t have to be Christians, you don’t have to be Hindus, you don’t have to be Mohammedans – these are all ways of creating difficulties\n– you have to be just natural like trees and birds and animals. Become part of this relaxed universe\n– so relaxed that you forget all about easiness and you forget all about rightness. To me, this is enlightenment.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS CULTURE? IS IT AN INNER PHENOMENON? IS IT SOMETHING LIKE AN INDIAN CULTURE AND A WESTERN CULTURE? COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nNarendra, culture to me is the grace that comes to anybody who is being natural. Culture is neither Indian nor Eastern nor Western. The things that are called Eastern culture, Western culture, Indian culture are all phony; they are a kind of deception. How can culture be Indian or American or Russian? Culture is the radiance of a natural man, his graceful behavior, his effortless naturalness.\nBut these cultures that are being talked about are trainings – trainings to make you fit into a certain society, at the cost of making you unnatural, uneasy, tense, anxiety-ridden.\nI will give you a few examples. In China, for centuries, the women from their very childhood... when the woman was just a baby, they used to put iron shoes on the feet of the baby to keep her feet small. If the woman belonged to the highest and the richest society, to royal families, then they were almost incapable of walking, because their feet remained small and their bodies were allowed to\ngrow. Those small feet were not capable of carrying the body of the woman. But it was culture. People appreciated the smallest feet as the most beautiful.\nJust by seeing the feet you could decide to what kind of society she belongs: the poor, then she has big feet; the middle class, then smaller; and the highest class, very small. Royal family women were absolutely unable to walk; they were crippled in the name of culture. But nobody for centuries ever thought that the feet had to grow in proportion with the body; otherwise walking would become difficult. It was absolutely unnatural; it was painful.\nEvery society has imposed ideas on people, strange ideas. But once your mind is contaminated, you never think that it is absolutely nonsensical. In India, on Hindu holidays, or special occasions, they make a special drink – never drink it! Even if they offer it to you, simply refuse. They have given it a beautiful name, panchamrit – five nectars. And what are those five nectars? – Cow dung, the urine of the cow, the milk of the cow, the curd from the cow and the purified butter called ghee. All five things from the cow... and people drink it with great joy. It is Hindu culture; the cow is the mother.\nIn Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram there was a man, a well-educated man, professor Bhansali. He became almost a great saint, for the simple reason... for eating cow dung for six months and not eating anything else. Eating cow dung, drinking cow urine, that was his only quality. But even Mahatma Gandhi praised him, saying that he is a great saint. And when I saw him I told him, “You are an idiot!” But I said, “Don’t be worried, in my vocabulary saints and idiots are synonymous.”\nIf you look around the world, everywhere you will find such stupid things, but they are part of the culture. In Calcutta, in the temple of the mother goddess Kali, every day animals are butchered, sacrificed. And then their blood and meat is distributed as a gift from God to the devotees who gather there.\nIt goes on happening even today. And people drink that blood and that meat, feeling very grateful to God. I was there and I asked the head priest of the temple, “What happens to the animals you sacrifice?” He said, “They are fortunate, because an animal sacrificed at the feet of the mother goddess Kali goes directly to paradise.”\nI said, “Then why don’t you sacrifice your father? Why take any risk? Sacrifice your children, sacrifice your wife, sacrifice yourself and go directly to heaven, because if you die a natural death there is no certainty. You may go to hell! Be compassionate to your old father.”\nHe said, “What kind of man are you?”\nI said, “I am simply giving you advice. If you are certain that animals sacrificed go to paradise, then you will not be shocked by sacrificing your father. This is such a short-cut.”\nBut people go on deceiving others and getting deceived themselves. There have been Christian monks – and they still exist – who used to have shoes made in a special way. Inside the shoes there were nails, so that when they put on those shoes the nails would go in to their feet and create dozens of wounds in their feet. And with the wounds from the nails they would go on walking. And they were thought to be great saints because they were not attached to the body.\nIn Soviet Russia before the revolution, there was a Christian sect which went to the logical end of celibacy. Celibacy is a crime, because celibacy is unnatural. It has produced all kinds of perversions, homosexuality... and it has finally produced AIDS, which is another name of a slow death for which there is no cure.\nThat certain sect in Russia was the most respected sect of the Christians. Every year at Christmas time they would gather in their churches and they would cut off their genital organs. Men could cut off their genital organs; women could not remain behind, so they started cutting off their breasts.\nAnd inside the church there would be a pile of genitals and breasts and people were covered with blood – and there are people who are touching their feet and worshiping them because they are great celibates. This is the logical conclusion, because now, even if they want, they cannot deceive people. And it was thought to be one of the most spiritual disciplines.\nThese are not cultures; these are all superstitions.\nI know only one thing which can be called culture, and that is when your mind is absolutely silent and your being starts radiating joy – joy in ordinary things, joy in being nobody.\nLet us repeat Cuang Tzu: Easy is culture. And anything that makes you uneasy is stupid.\nJews and Mohammedans have circumcision. They cut the foreskin of the genitals of small children. It is their culture.\nI have heard about a bishop who lived opposite a rabbi, and they were continuously in competition. All religions are in competition with each other, and they are all teaching that you should not be competitive. And we are so blind that we cannot see that they teach, “You should not be competitive,” and they are all competitive.\nThey say, “God is love,” and they are all creating crusades, religious wars. Religions have killed more people than anybody else – in the name of God, in the name of love. And our blindness must be great that we cannot see that in the name of God and in the name of love crusades cannot be arranged. People have been burnt alive.\nSo both the bishop and the rabbi were in great competition. And one day in the morning the rabbi saw that the bishop has brought a new car, a new Chevrolet. He was jealous and hurt; it was very insulting. And then he saw the bishop coming out of the house with a bucket full of water, and he poured the water on the car. The rabbi could not contain his curiosity. He asked, “What are you doing?” The bishop said, “I am baptizing it. Now this car is Christian.”\nYou cannot compete with Jews. The second day the rabbi brought a Cadillac. The bishop looked at the Cadillac, felt very much hurt – “What to do with this rabbi? He is always ahead!” And then he saw the rabbi coming with the garden scissors!\nThe bishop could not contain his curiosity. He came close and he said, “What are you doing?” The rabbi was cutting the exhaust pipe! He said “I am doing circumcision. Now this car is a Jew.”\nA simple man, contented with his ordinariness, joyful just as he is, accepting him self and all that he has without any judgment – with a deep feeling of suchness that this is how existence wants me to be – is the only cultured man, because he will have a grace and a beauty which these people who are trying to become somebody cannot have.\nYou can have grace only if you relax in whatever you are. The roses have culture, because they are not competing with the lotuses. Even the smallest blade of grass has a grace and beauty, because there is no competition. It is not worried About why it hass not been made a rose bush. It is utterly satisfied with being itself.\nThis satisfaction creates an aura of grace. And this grace is neither Indian nor German nor Chinese; this grace is neither capitalist nor communist nor fascist. This grace belongs to the natural human being who has dropped all kinds of conditionings – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Jewish – and who lives not bothering to be in tune with the society, but in tune with existence. Then the music of existence flows through him, then the fragrance of existence surrounds him. It is not something to be cultivated, it is something you are born with; just give it an opportunity to grow.\nDon’t hinder its progress. Have you ever seen any deer which is not graceful? Have you seen any eagle which is not graceful? It is only man who has to cultivate it.\nIt is strange, because man is the highest part of existence which has evolved consciousness. Grace will come just like a shadow; you don’t have to cultivate it. Anything cultivated is going to be phoney. Only something natural that arises from your very being is going to be authentic, sincere, honest.\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6148","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/>The Razor\'s Edge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Easy is right</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6148 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Razors_Edge/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. CONTINUE EASY, AND YOU
ARE RIGHT.</p><p>THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT
THE GOING IS EASY.”</p><p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Shanti, Chuang Tzu is very rare – in a way the most unique
mystic in the whole history of man. His uniqueness is that he talks in
absurdities. All his poems and stories are just absurd. And his reason
to choose absurdity as his expression is very significant: the mind has
to be silenced. With anything rational, it cannot stop; it goes on and
on. Anything logical and the mind finds nourishment through it. It is
only the absurd that suddenly shocks the mind – it is beyond mind’s
grasp.</p><p><br></p><p>His stories, his poems and his other statements are so absurd that
either people simply left him, thinking that he is mad.<span class=s4></span>Those who were courageous enough to remain with him
found that no</p><p>other meditation is needed. Just listening to his absurd statements,
the mind stops functioning. And that is the meaning of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is not of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the Western translations of treatises from the East on
meditation have fallen in the same track. They have used the word
meditation as if it is concentration. And in fact the English word
meditation seems to be synonymous with concentration.</p><p><br></p><p>English has three words – concentration, contemplation, meditation.
None of them comes even close to the Eastern word dhyana, that became in
China ch’an and in Japan zen. The root is the Sanskrit word dhyana, and
it will be very good for you to understand the distinction. In
concentration your mind is focused, narrowed only on one object.</p><p><br></p><p>A famous story about one of the great master archers<span class=s4></span>Arjuna says that his teacher, Dronacharya,</p><p>was giving the final examination of his disciples. He had put a dead
bird far away on a tree as a target.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked one of his disciples, Duryodhana, “What are you seeing?”
Duryodhana said, “Everything! The trees, the sun rising behind them, the
bird that you have put as a target. I am seeing everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dronacharya asked another disciple; he said, “I see only the bird.”
He is more concentrated. Duryodhana has his mind spread all over the
place. The second disciple says he is seeing only the bird. But the
master is not satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>He asks Arjuna, “What are you seeing?” Arjuna says, “Only the eye of
the bird that you have told us is going to be the target. I don’t see
anything else.” His concentration has come even more narrow. And for an
archer, this kind of concentration is needed. But meditation is not
archery.</p><p><br></p><p>Contemplation is not being concentrated on a single object, but
thinking about the same object from every possible aspect. For example,
somebody is contemplating about love – what does it mean? He remains
confined to a certain line of thinking, not to a certain object, but to
a certain subject.</p><p><br></p><p>And “meditation”, in all the languages of the world except the
Indian, Chinese and Japanese, also gives the feeling.<span class=s4></span>The archer is concentrated, but he is not concerned
with the eye, the bull’s –</p><p>eye. His concern is how to shoot the arrow so that it reaches the
eye; his concern is not to miss the target.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation, as far as Western languages are concerned, is going
deeply into one object – thinking, in its deeper implications.
Contemplation was linear; you were thinking about a subject from all
possible aspects, but the mind was moving. In meditation the mind is not
moving. It is similar to concentration without any arrows. Your thoughts
are the arrows, but they are hitting the same subject deeper and deeper
and deeper – not in a line, not horizontal but vertical.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no word in Western languages which can translate the word
dhyana absolutely and adequately. “Meditation” has been chosen because
there is no other word, but it is a wrong choice. Out of the three
words, it is the best, but dhyana, ch’an or zen have a totally different
meaning: mind has stopped.</p><p>In concentration mind has narrowed, in contemplation it is flowing in
a line on a particular subject, in meditation it is concentrated, and
instead of arrows it is throwing thoughts deeper and deeper into the
same object. But all three processes belong to the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyana means the mind has been put aside. There is no concentration,
there is no contemplation, there is no meditation. It is a state of
no-mind; it is absolute silence, not even a small stirring of any
thought.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, so many devices have been tried... how to stop the mind
chattering continuously, how to bypass it, how to stop it, how to go
beyond it. Chuang Tzu has his own, unique contribution. He talks to his
disciples in absurdities, and the mind cannot tackle them. The mind
needs something reasonable, rational, logical; that is its territory.
The absurd is beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you the famous story about Chuang Tzu: One morning he
woke up with tears in his eyes, so sad and so depressed. His disciples
had never seen him sad or depressed or with tears; he is an enlightened
master... what has happened? They all rushed and enquired, “Can we be of
some help?” Chuang Tzu said, “I don’t think so.” They said, “Still, we
want to know what is the problem that is torturing you so much. You are
beyond problems!”</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu said, “I used to be, but last night I saw a dream and it
has disturbed my whole attainment, achievement, self-realization,
enlightenment – everything has gone down the drain.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Just a dream?” He said, “It was not just a dream, it has
shattered me into pieces.” They said, “Still, please tell us the
dream!”</p><p><br></p><p>The dream was that Chuang Tzu saw that he had become a butterfly. All
the disciples laughed. They said, “Unnecessarily being depressed and
crying and tears and thinking that your enlightenment and
self-realization have all gone down the drain.<span class=s4></span>It
is an ordinary dream, nothing to be worried about</p><p>it. In dreams people see themselves becoming many things, but a dream
is a dream.”</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu said, “I understand that a dream is a dream. The problem
is that I am worried, who am I? If Chuang Tzu in his sleep can dream
that he has become a butterfly, a butterfly in her dream can see she has
become Chuang Tzu. And now I am puzzled. Who am I? – a Chuang Tzu or a
butterfly?</p><p><br></p><p>“If Chuang Tzu is capable of dreaming himself to be a butterfly, you
cannot cancel the possibility of a butterfly taking a nap on the rose
bushes and dreaming that she has become Chuang Tzu. Who can prevent her?
And the question is, have I awakened, or is the butterfly dreaming that
she is Chuang Tzu? You tell me who I am! – the butterfly or Chuang
Tzu.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were all at a loss... what to say? This man goes on finding such
absurd things. Millions of people for millions of years have been
dreaming, but nobody has raised this question. You have been dreaming,
but have you ever raised this question? – that when you wake up perhaps
it is the beginning of a new dream.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes you so certain that you are not dreaming? – in the dream
you were so certain that you are a butterfly, and now you are so certain
that you are Chuang Tzu. There is no difference in</p><p>certainty. In fact when you are awake the possibility of suspicion is
there, you can doubt; but when you are dreaming, there is even no doubt
at all, no suspicion, no question mark – you are simply a butterfly.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Sit down and meditate and find out the answer – who am I?”
They looked at each other – how to meditate upon it, how to think about
it? It is unthinkable, it is beyond the mind. His closest disciple, Lieh
Tzu, had gone out to the nearest village. He returned; he saw the whole
scene: Chuang Tzu in tears sitting on his bed, all the disciples with
closed eyes, their minds completely stuck.</p><p><br></p><p>What can the mind say about it? The question is absurd. He asked one
of the disciples who was near the door, “What is the matter? It seems to
be really serious! I have never seen such seriousness here. And why is
our master crying? Has somebody died or something?”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple said, “He has created a new absurdity. Nobody has died
and nothing has happened; he is torturing us and nothing else! Now we
have to meditate upon it.” And he told him the problem. Lieh Tzu said,
“Don’t be worried. You meditate; I am coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went out, brought a bucket full of ice-cold water and poured it on
Chuang Tzu. And Chuang Tzu said laughingly, “If you had been here before
you would have saved all these idiots! They are looking so serious, as
if they are really thinking. And you would have saved my tears and my
misery. Just wait; don’t pour the water, it is too cold.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu said, “Has your problem been solved or not?” Chuang Tzu
said, “It is solved – you are my successor!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question to be solved by the mind. The mind is absolutely
impotent.</p><p>Chuang Tzu has hundreds of stories and he must have had a very
strange kind of genius – even to invent those stories is not easy – but
his teaching was very simple. And those who remained with him; all
became enlightened. That is a rare phenomenon. He defeated even his own
master Lao Tzu – a few people became enlightened, but most of Lao Tzu’s
disciples remained in their old ignorance. He defeated Gautam Buddha – a
few of his disciples became enlightened, but that was a very small
proportion, because he had thousands of disciples and not more than a
dozen became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu has a rare position in the history of mystics. All his
disciples became enlightened.… he would not leave you unless you had
become enlightened. He was so much after you that finally people decided
that it was better to become enlightened. Every day new torture... the
only way to save yourself is to become enlightened. But his method was
very simple, and this poem, Anand Shanti, tells in a very aphoristic way
his whole approach.</p><p><br></p><p>“Easy is right.” Nobody has dared to say it ever. On the contrary,
people make the right as difficult as possible. To you, who have all
been conditioned by different traditions, the wrong is easy, and the
right is arduous. It needs training, it needs discipline, it needs
repression, it needs renouncing the world, it needs renouncing the
pleasures.…</p><p>Lies are easy, truth is difficult – that is the common conditioning
of humanity. But Chuang Tzu is certainly a man of tremendous insight. He
says, easy is right. Then why have people been making right difficult?
All your saints have been making right very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a psychology behind it: only the difficult is attractive to
your ego. The more difficult is the task, the more the ego feels
challenged.</p><p><br></p><p>Climbing Everest was difficult; hundreds of people had died before
Edmund Hillary reached the top alive. For the whole century groups upon
groups of mountaineers had been coming, and when Edmund Hillary reached,
there was nothing to be found! Just at the very peak there is not even
space enough... only one person can stand there, on the highest point.
He was asked, “What prompted you? Knowing perfectly well that hundreds
of mountaineers have lost their life during one hundred years, and not
even their bodies have been found... why did you try this dangerous
project?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I had to try. It was hurting my ego. I am a mountaineer, I
love climbing mountains, and it was humiliating that there is Everest
and nobody has been able to reach there. It is not a question of finding
anything, but I feel so immensely happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is this happiness? You have not found anything! The happiness is
that your ego has become more crystallized. You are the first man in the
whole history who has reached Everest; now nobody can take your place.
Anybody who will reach there will be second, third... but you have made
a mark on the history; you are the first. You have not found anything,
but you have found a deep nourishment for your ego. Perhaps Edmund
Hillary himself is not aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions are making the right difficult, because the
difficult is attractive – attractive to the ego. But the ego is not the
truth; The ego is not right. Do you see the dilemma? The ego is
attracted only towards the difficult. If you want people to become
saints you have to make your right, your truth, your discipline very
difficult. The more difficult it is, the more egoists will be attracted,
almost magnetically pulled.</p><p><br></p><p>But the ego is not right. It is the worst thing that can happen to a
man. And it cannot deliver to you the right, the truth; it can only make
your ego stronger. Chuang Tzu is saying in a simple statement the most
pregnant statement: Easy is right. Because for the easy, ego has no
attraction.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are going towards the easy, the ego starts dying. And when
there is no ego left, you have arrived to your reality – the right, the
truth. And truth and right have to be natural. Easy means natural; you
can find them without any effort. Easy is right means natural is right,
effortlessness is right, egolessness is right.</p><p><br></p><p>BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY, CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. They
are just two</p><p>sides of the same coin. If, beginning to live a right life, you find
it difficult, then remember, it is not right. If, living the right, your
life becomes more and more easy, more and more a let-go, flowing with
the stream.…</p><p><br></p><p>Going against the stream is difficult, but going with the stream is
not difficult. So either choose the easiest things in life, the most
natural things in life, and you will be right; or if you want to begin
the other way, remember the criterion that the right has to produce
easiness in you, relaxedness in you.</p><p>CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. Never forget for a moment that the
difficult is the food for the ego, and the ego is the barrier that makes
you blind to see, makes you deaf to hear, makes your heart hard to open,
makes it impossible for you to love, to dance, to sing.</p><p><br></p><p>CONTINUE EASY. Your whole life should be an easy phenomenon. Then you
will not be creating the ego. You will be a natural being, just
ordinary. And to Chuang Tzu, and to me also, the ordinary is the most
extraordinary. The people who are trying to be extraordinary have missed
the goal. Just be ordinary, just be nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>But all your conditionings are so corrupting; they corrupt you. They
say; to be easy is to be lazy, to be ordinary is humiliating. If you
don’t try for power, for prestige, for respectability, then your life is
meaningless – that has been forced into your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu in these simple statements is taking away all your
conditionings.</p><p><br></p><p>CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. Never for a moment get attracted
towards the difficult. It will make you somebody – a prime minister, a
president – but it will not make you divine. Easy is divine.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about an American super-rich man. He had all the things
the world can offer and he had been striving all his life to be on the
top; now he had reached and was feeling stupid inside because there was
nothing on the top. If Edmund Hillary was intelligent enough, he must
have felt stupid standing on Everest... for what have you been trying?
The man who walked on the moon must have looked very embarrassed,
although there was nobody to see him.</p><p><br></p><p>This man had come to the top as far as money is concerned, and as far
as money can purchase, he had purchased everything. And now he was
looking stupid. What is the point of it all? Inside he is hollow. He has
no time to give to his inner growth, no time even to be acquainted with
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He dropped all his riches and rushed towards the East to find the
truth, because three-fourths of his life was almost gone – just the tail
has remained, the elephant has passed. But if something could be
possible there were a few days left. He rushed fast. He went from one
master to another master, but nobody could satisfy him, because whatever
they were saying was again another trip of the ego. And he was well
acquainted with that trip.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not matter whether you are accumulating money or whether you
are accumulating virtue, whether you are becoming respectable here or
you are becoming respectable hereafter – it does not matter, it is the
same game. Whether you are becoming a world-famous celebrity or a world-
worshiped saint, there is no difference; both are ego numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>And they were all telling him difficult disciplines and difficult,
arduous ways of finding the truth; they were all saying, “It may not be
possible in this life, but start anyhow. In the next life maybe<span class=s4></span>The</p><p>journey is long, the goal is a faraway star.”</p><p><br></p><p>But now nobody could deceive him. He had found that just becoming
somebody special is an exercise in stupidity. Finally he heard about a
saint who lived in the Himalayas. And people said, “If you are not
satisfied with him, you will never be satisfied with anybody. Then
forget the whole thing.”</p><p>So tired and tattered, walking for miles, finally he found the old
man. He was very happy seeing the old man, but was shocked. Before he
could say anything, the old man said, “Are you an American?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Very good. Have you got any American cigarettes
with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, where have I come! I have come to seek truth, to
find the right.<span class=s4></span>” He pulled out</p><p>cigarettes and the old man started smoking.</p><p><br></p><p>The American said, “You have not even asked me for what I have come
here, tired, hungry<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That does not matter.”</p><p><br></p><p>The American said, “I have come to find the truth!”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Truth? You do one thing, you go back. And next
time when you come, bring a lot of American cigarettes, because here in
this place it is very difficult to find cigarettes. And I am an
easy-going man, I don’t make any effort; people come on their own. But I
like the best cigarettes. Here Indians come with beedies<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” the man asked, “what about my search?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Your search? This is the discipline for you: go
back, get as many cigarettes as you can get and come back and remain
here with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He asked, “Any discipline?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “I am an ordinary old man – no discipline, no
religion, no philosophy – I only like to smoke cigarettes. You come
here, and slowly, slowly you will also become just as ordinary as I am.
And I tell you, to be ordinary, with no pretensions, is the right.”</p><p><br></p><p>And as the man was going back, puzzled, the old man said, “Listen, at
least leave your wristwatch here, because I don’t have any wristwatch so
I don’t know the time, what time<span class=s4></span>And anyway
you</p><p>are coming back, so you can bring another wristwatch.” Chuang Tzu
would have liked this old man.</p><p><br></p><p>EASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. That has to be the
criterion. If you feel uneasiness, tension, then what you have started
cannot be right.</p><p><br></p><p>CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last part is something never to be forgotten. THE RIGHT WAY
TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY – because even to remember it is
an uneasiness. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND
FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY. What is the need of</p><p>remembering these things?</p><p><br></p><p>Relax to such a point... be as natural as the trees and the birds.
You will not find in the birds that somebody is a saint and somebody is
a sinner; you will not find in the trees that somebody is virtuous and
somebody is full of vices. Everything is easy – so easy that you need
not remember it.</p><p>I agree with Chuang Tzu with absolute, unconditional, categorical
attunement. I would have loved to meet Chuang Tzu. If I were given the
opportunity to meet one of the mystics of the whole human history,
Chuang Tzu would be my choice. I have named this place Chuang Tzu
Auditorium.</p><p><br></p><p>He was very much misunderstood. It is obvious... because he was
destroying all the priests, all the popes, all the imams, all the
shankaracharyas; he was destroying the so-called great commandments for
being right, and destroying them so easily. He was one of the most
natural men the world has seen. He has not given any discipline, he has
not given any doctrine, he has not given any catechism. He has simply
explained one thing: that if you can be natural and ordinary, just like
the birds and the trees, you will blossom, you will have your wings open
in the vast sky.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t have to be saints. Saints are very tense – more tense than
sinners. I have known both. and if there is a choice I will choose the
sinners as a company rather than the saints. Saints are the worst
company, because their eyes are full of judgment about everything: You
should do this and you should not do that. And they start dominating
you, condemning you, humiliating you, insulting you, because what they
are doing is the right and what you are doing is not the right thing.
They have poisoned your nature so badly that if real criminals have to
be found they will be found in your saints, not in your sinners. Your
sinners have not done much harm to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been visiting jails, meeting the criminals, and I was
surprised that they are the most innocent people. And perhaps because
they are the most innocent they have been caught. The cunning ones are
doing far greater crimes, but they are not caught. Every law has
loopholes. The cunning ones find the loopholes first; the innocent ones
get caught, because they don’t have that cunningness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really strange that when America forced me into jail without
any cause<span class=s4></span>And since they had no</p><p>cause, and no reason to keep me in jail, they tried, as long as they
could manage, to keep me in jail before the trial began, because once
the trial began they didn’t have any evidence for anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But pre-trial they kept me for twelve days. It was a good experience
to know<span class=s4></span>I had known criminals,</p><p>prisoners, but only as a visitor – and this was a totally different
experience, to be one amongst them. And it is surprising that I was
taken to five jails just to harass me – for twelve days they went on
changing jails – but to me it was a good experience.</p><p><br></p><p>All the inmates of the jails received me, welcomed me. Behind their
bars they were waving their hands and shouting, “Osho, don’t be worried,
truth is always victorious.” And they were showing me the sign of
victory from every cell, whenever I would enter a jail or I would get
out of a jail.</p><p><br></p><p>They would send me small notes: “We love you. We don’t know you, but
we have seen you on the television. We have heard you and we know you
are innocent.” Looking into their eyes and looking into the eyes of the
law enforcement authorities, one could see the difference<span class=s4></span>who are the real</p><p>criminals? The jailers, the marshals, the judges, they were the real
criminals. You could see it in their eyes, in their faces.</p><p><br></p><p>To torture me they refused to supply vegetarian food because no
vegetarian has ever been in their jails – “So we don’t have any
arrangement.” And when the inmates heard it, they started bringing
fruits, nuts, milk, which was given to them, and they would say, “Osho,
you take it. We can eat non-vegetarian food and it hurts us that you are
hungry, that you are starving and we cannot do</p><p>anything.” My cell was full of fruits. And I used to tell them, “I
cannot eat so many fruits, I cannot drink so much milk.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they would say, “Don’t take this opportunity from us. You are not
going to be here for long. Tomorrow they will move you again.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they would bring cuttings of my photographs from newspapers to be
signed in their name, because this will be their memory – “We have lived
with you, even if it was only for one day or two days.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange world in which we are living. Here criminals are
rulers, here criminals are politicians, here criminals become
presidents, vice presidents, prime ministers, because except the
criminal, who wants power? An authentic human being wants peace, wants
love, wants to be left alone, wants freedom to be himself. The very idea
of dominating others is criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is right that if you feel any tension, then remember,
whatever you are doing is not right. And he is the only man who has
given such a beautiful criterion, EASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE
EASY. CONTINUE EASY AND YOU ARE RIGHT. THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO
FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax into nobodiness.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is also my message to my sannyasins: be natural. You don’t
have to be Christians, you don’t have to be Hindus, you don’t have to be
Mohammedans – these are all ways of creating difficulties</p><p>– you have to be just natural like trees and birds and animals.
Become part of this relaxed universe</p><p>– so relaxed that you forget all about easiness and you forget all
about rightness. To me, this is enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS CULTURE? IS IT AN INNER PHENOMENON? IS IT SOMETHING LIKE AN
INDIAN CULTURE AND A WESTERN CULTURE? COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Narendra, culture to me is the grace that comes to anybody who is
being natural. Culture is neither Indian nor Eastern nor Western. The
things that are called Eastern culture, Western culture, Indian culture
are all phony; they are a kind of deception. How can culture be Indian
or American or Russian? Culture is the radiance of a natural man, his
graceful behavior, his effortless naturalness.</p><p><br></p><p>But these cultures that are being talked about are trainings –
trainings to make you fit into a certain society, at the cost of making
you unnatural, uneasy, tense, anxiety-ridden.</p><p><br></p><p>I will give you a few examples. In China, for centuries, the women
from their very childhood... when the woman was just a baby, they used
to put iron shoes on the feet of the baby to keep her feet small. If the
woman belonged to the highest and the richest society, to royal
families, then they were almost incapable of walking, because their feet
remained small and their bodies were allowed to</p><p>grow. Those small feet were not capable of carrying the body of the
woman. But it was culture. People appreciated the smallest feet as the
most beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by seeing the feet you could decide to what kind of society she
belongs: the poor, then she has big feet; the middle class, then
smaller; and the highest class, very small. Royal family women were
absolutely unable to walk; they were crippled in the name of culture.
But nobody for centuries ever thought that the feet had to grow in
proportion with the body; otherwise walking would become difficult. It
was absolutely unnatural; it was painful.</p><p><br></p><p>Every society has imposed ideas on people, strange ideas. But once
your mind is contaminated, you never think that it is absolutely
nonsensical. In India, on Hindu holidays, or special occasions, they
make a special drink – never drink it! Even if they offer it to you,
simply refuse. They have given it a beautiful name, panchamrit – five
nectars. And what are those five nectars? – Cow dung, the urine of the
cow, the milk of the cow, the curd from the cow and the purified butter
called ghee. All five things from the cow... and people drink it with
great joy. It is Hindu culture; the cow is the mother.</p><p><br></p><p>In Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram there was a man, a well-educated man,
professor Bhansali. He became almost a great saint, for the simple
reason... for eating cow dung for six months and not eating anything
else. Eating cow dung, drinking cow urine, that was his only quality.
But even Mahatma Gandhi praised him, saying that he is a great saint.
And when I saw him I told him, “You are an idiot!” But I said, “Don’t be
worried, in my vocabulary saints and idiots are synonymous.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you look around the world, everywhere you will find such stupid
things, but they are part of the culture. In Calcutta, in the temple of
the mother goddess Kali, every day animals are butchered, sacrificed.
And then their blood and meat is distributed as a gift from God to the
devotees who gather there.</p><p><br></p><p>It goes on happening even today. And people drink that blood and that
meat, feeling very grateful to God. I was there and I asked the head
priest of the temple, “What happens to the animals you sacrifice?” He
said, “They are fortunate, because an animal sacrificed at the feet of
the mother goddess Kali goes directly to paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then why don’t you sacrifice your father? Why take any risk?
Sacrifice your children, sacrifice your wife, sacrifice yourself and go
directly to heaven, because if you die a natural death there is no
certainty. You may go to hell! Be compassionate to your old father.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What kind of man are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am simply giving you advice. If you are certain that
animals sacrificed go to paradise, then you will not be shocked by
sacrificing your father. This is such a short-cut.”</p><p><br></p><p>But people go on deceiving others and getting deceived themselves.
There have been Christian monks – and they still exist – who used to
have shoes made in a special way. Inside the shoes there were nails, so
that when they put on those shoes the nails would go in to their feet
and create dozens of wounds in their feet. And with the wounds from the
nails they would go on walking. And they were thought to be great saints
because they were not attached to the body.</p><p>In Soviet Russia before the revolution, there was a Christian sect
which went to the logical end of celibacy. Celibacy is a crime, because
celibacy is unnatural. It has produced all kinds of perversions,
homosexuality... and it has finally produced AIDS, which is another name
of a slow death for which there is no cure.</p><p><br></p><p>That certain sect in Russia was the most respected sect of the
Christians. Every year at Christmas time they would gather in their
churches and they would cut off their genital organs. Men could cut off
their genital organs; women could not remain behind, so they started
cutting off their breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>And inside the church there would be a pile of genitals and breasts
and people were covered with blood – and there are people who are
touching their feet and worshiping them because they are great
celibates. This is the logical conclusion, because now, even if they
want, they cannot deceive people. And it was thought to be one of the
most spiritual disciplines.</p><p><br></p><p>These are not cultures; these are all superstitions.</p><p><br></p><p>I know only one thing which can be called culture, and that is when
your mind is absolutely silent and your being starts radiating joy – joy
in ordinary things, joy in being nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us repeat Cuang Tzu: Easy is culture. And anything that makes you
uneasy is stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>Jews and Mohammedans have circumcision. They cut the foreskin of the
genitals of small children. It is their culture.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a bishop who lived opposite a rabbi, and they were
continuously in competition. All religions are in competition with each
other, and they are all teaching that you should not be competitive. And
we are so blind that we cannot see that they teach, “You should not be
competitive,” and they are all competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>They say, “God is love,” and they are all creating crusades,
religious wars. Religions have killed more people than anybody else – in
the name of God, in the name of love. And our blindness must be great
that we cannot see that in the name of God and in the name of love
crusades cannot be arranged. People have been burnt alive.</p><p><br></p><p>So both the bishop and the rabbi were in great competition. And one
day in the morning the rabbi saw that the bishop has brought a new car,
a new Chevrolet. He was jealous and hurt; it was very insulting. And
then he saw the bishop coming out of the house with a bucket full of
water, and he poured the water on the car. The rabbi could not contain
his curiosity. He asked, “What are you doing?” The bishop said, “I am
baptizing it. Now this car is Christian.”</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot compete with Jews. The second day the rabbi brought a
Cadillac. The bishop looked at the Cadillac, felt very much hurt – “What
to do with this rabbi? He is always ahead!” And then he saw the rabbi
coming with the garden scissors!</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop could not contain his curiosity. He came close and he
said, “What are you doing?” The rabbi was cutting the exhaust pipe! He
said “I am doing circumcision. Now this car is a Jew.”</p><p>A simple man, contented with his ordinariness, joyful just as he is,
accepting him self and all that he has without any judgment – with a
deep feeling of suchness that this is how existence wants me to be – is
the only cultured man, because he will have a grace and a beauty which
these people who are trying to become somebody cannot have.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have grace only if you relax in whatever you are. The roses
have culture, because they are not competing with the lotuses. Even the
smallest blade of grass has a grace and beauty, because there is no
competition. It is not worried About why it hass not been made a rose
bush. It is utterly satisfied with being itself.</p><p><br></p><p>This satisfaction creates an aura of grace. And this grace is neither
Indian nor German nor Chinese; this grace is neither capitalist nor
communist nor fascist. This grace belongs to the natural human being who
has dropped all kinds of conditionings – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan,
Jewish – and who lives not bothering to be in tune with the society, but
in tune with existence. Then the music of existence flows through him,
then the fragrance of existence surrounds him. It is not something to be
cultivated, it is something you are born with; just give it an
opportunity to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t hinder its progress. Have you ever seen any deer which is not
graceful? Have you seen any eagle which is not graceful? It is only man
who has to cultivate it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange, because man is the highest part of existence which has
evolved consciousness. Grace will come just like a shadow; you don’t
have to cultivate it. Anything cultivated is going to be phoney. Only
something natural that arises from your very being is going to be
authentic, sincere, honest.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

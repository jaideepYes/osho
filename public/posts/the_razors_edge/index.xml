Miracles are bound to happen
25 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ALL DAY, I HAVE THIS MELTED SENSATION LIKE SOMETHING INIDE ME DISSOLVING IN THE GLOW OF YOUR LOVE. DISCOURSE COMES AND IT JUST EXPANDS TO FILL THE SILENCE, LEAVING A BREATHING HEART AND A PAIR OF EARS HANGING FROM NOWHERE. IT FEELS LIKE BEING AN ORGASM.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WAS RABINDRINATH’S LONGING, HIS CREATIVE ANGST, THE VERY THING THAT IN THE END BECAME AN OBSTACLE TO HIS ENLIGHTENMENT? AM I ALSO DESTINED TO DIE WITH TEARS IN MY EYES, AND A POCKET FULL OF SONGS?

2 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY HAVE HUMAN BEINGS GONE THROUGH THIS STRUGGLE SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING? WERE THERE NOT ALREADY HIGHLY DEVELOPED CIVILIZATIONS LIVING ON THIS EARTH? AND YET THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS GOT LOST AND MAN HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY DARK PERIOD.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT GOD IS ALSO SEARCHING FOR ME? CAN I WAIT FOR HIM TO FIND ME?
Sat Vijaya, it is absolutely true that just as you are seeking God or truth or the beloved, he is also seeking you. The search is never one-sided.</description>

3 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THESE LAST DAYS, I HAVE COME FROM DISCOURSE SHAKING AND QUIVERING FROM INSIDE OUT. IT COMES AFTER YOU HAVE LEFT. ALTHOUGH MY BODY TREMBLES, IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE FEAR... OR NOT ANY FEAR THAT I HAVE KNOWN BEFORE. THE IMAGE THAT COMES IS OF ME HANGING BY MY FINGERTIPS TO A WINDOW FRAME HIGH IN THE SKY, WITH NOTHING BENEATH IT.</description>

4 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I LOVE THIS POEM BY CHUANG TZU:
“EASY IS RIGHT. BEGIN RIGHT AND YOU ARE EASY. CONTINUE EASY, AND YOU ARE RIGHT.
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EASY IS TO FORGET THE RIGHT WAY AND FORGET THAT THE GOING IS EASY.”
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT?</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO YOU AND LOOKED INTO YOUR EYES, I SAW MYSELF. AFTER SOME YEARS, LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES I FELT MYSELF INSIDE MY BODY, EACH CELL OF MY BODY AND THAT ‘SOMETHING ELSE’ INSIDE DANCING WITH ALIVENESS. LAST NIGHT I LOOKED IN YOUR EYES AND I SAW.</description>

Who created god
5 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
A FEW NIGHTS AGO IN DARSHAN, SITTING VERY CLOSE TO YOU, I WAS SUDDENLY FLOODED WITH THE WORDS “OSHO, I’M SORRY, I’M SORRY,” OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL I WAS SO FILLED WITH PAIN AND REGRET I COULD HARDLY SIT IN FRONT OF YOU. NOW, AFTER PATIPADA’S QUESTION, THE FEELING HAS RETURNED AND I FEEL SICK WITH A REMORSE WHICH I DON’T UNDERSTAND.</description>

Playing a part in the movie
5 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I SOMETIMES FAIL TO WATCH MY MIND WITH DETACHMENT. INDEED, I SOMETIMES REVEL IN ADDING JUICY TIDBITS TO MY OTHERWISE UNGUIDED FANTASIES JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT. THIS DOES HELP ME TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON MY DESIRES, BUT I SOMETIMES WONDER IF I DIDN’T GET LOST IN THE MOVIE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.</description>

6 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN DISCOURSE I FOLLOWED PAST WORDS, DISREGARDING FEELINGS, INTO AIR AND THE PATTERN OF MY BEING. IS IT REALLY THIS SIMPLE? NOW MOVING INTO MYSTERIOUS DEPTHS, NO UNIVERSAL VISIONS – JUST ME, HERE AMONGST THE BIRDS, THE TREES, THE PEOPLE – IN ALL ITS SUCHNESS.</description>

6 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
PLEASE TALK ABOUT MORALITY.
Shantam Divyama, the question about morality is immensely significant, because morality is not that which has been told to you for centuries. All the religions have exploited the idea of morality. They have been teaching in different ways, but the basic foundation is the same: unless you become moral, ethical, you cannot become religious.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE MORE I AM HERE WITH YOU, THE MORE I AM CONFUSED, EXCITED AND AMAZED THAT YOU EXIST. I HAVE BEEN A SANNYASIN FOR SEVEN YEARS AND REALIZE NOW THAT I TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED. BELOVED OSHO, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT TOOK ME SEVEN YEARS TO START SLOWLY, SLOWLY SEEING YOU?</description>

Prem Rudra, the art of living fully, totally, and intensely is not something arduous or difficult, but it has been made almost impossible. It is so simple and so obvious that there is no need to learn it.</description>

WHAT IS THE FALSE IN ME?
Atmo Khirad, everything is false in you. The false and the true cannot have a mixed existence. There is no compromise possible; either you are true or you are false.
Your whole personality is false because it has been given to you; it is not a growth.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
When the ocean has called you
28 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT TO DO WITH THE QUESTION WHEN THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR IT? AND WHAT TO DO WITH THE SECRETS IN OUR HEARTS WHEN THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPRESS THEM?
Krishna Priya, there is some misunderstanding. There is no question in the world which cannot be asked.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Our dance is forever
1 March 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO BE A RIVER, TO SING AND DANCE AND CELEBRATE WITH YOU, BUT WHO WANTS TO REACH THE OCEAN? SOMETIMES MUCH LONGING IS THERE, BUT I REALLY DON’T KNOW FOR WHAT. I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE US IN THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Love is never too much
1 March 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU LOVE US SO MUCH? IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU MEAN ME, TOO? WHEN I ALLOW MYSELF TO FEEL YOUR LOVE, TO LET MYSELF BE LOVED BY YOU, THERE IS SO MUCH PAIN AND SO MUCH GRATITUDE THAT I CANNOT SAY IT.</description>

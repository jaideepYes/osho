WERE THERE NOT ALREADY HIGHLY DEVELOPED CIVILIZATIONS LIVING ON THIS EARTH? AND YET THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS GOT LOST AND MAN HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY DARK PERIOD. IS THERE SUCH A COSMIC LAW THAT SAYS, “ONLY OUT OF THE MUD THE LOTUS CAN GROW”? AND WILL THIS EARTH EVER BECOME A GARDEN OF FLOWERS? IN DEEP GRATITUDE AND LOVE.\nPrem Jaldhara, the question that you have asked has tremendous implications in it. First, there have been many civilizations before our civilization which have reached to even higher peaks, but they all destroyed themselves because all those civilizations, including ours, have been growing in a deep imbalance. They developed great technologies, but they forgot that even the greatest technological progress is not going to make man more blissful, more peaceful, more loving, more compassionate.\nMan’s consciousness has not grown with the same pace as his scientific progress, and that has been the cause of all the old civilizations destroying themselves. There was no outer cause, no outer enemy – the enemy was within man. He created monsters as far as machines are concerned, but he himself remained very retarded, unconscious, almost asleep. And it is very dangerous to give so much power to unconscious people.\nThe same is happening today. Politicians are the lowest kind as far as consciousness is concerned. They are clever, they are cunning, they are mean, too; and they make every effort for a single goal – how to be more powerful. Their only desire is for more power – not for more peace, not for more being, not for more truth, not for more love.\nAnd what do you need more power for? – to dominate others, to destroy others. All the power accumulates in the hands of unconscious people. So on the one hand, politicians in all the civilizations that have developed and died – it would be better to say have committed suicide – had all the power in their hands. And on the other hand the genius of human intelligence was searching for more and more technological, scientific ways, and all that they discovered finally had to go into the hands of the politicians.\nIt was Albert Einstein who wrote a letter to President Roosevelt. He had escaped from Germany. In Germany he was researching atomic theory for Adolf Hitler, but reluctantly, because he was a Jew, and Adolf Hitler was killing Jews in such vast numbers that it seemed unbelievable. A single man killed six million Jews inside Germany. During the second world war Adolf Hitler was responsible for killing maybe fifty million people.\nSeeing the situation – of course Albert Einstein was not going to be killed, he was too valuable – he escaped from Germany. He did not want to make the atom bomb for Adolf Hitler. It was a simple human reaction – so many of his people, his friends, had been killed. He wrote a letter to President Roosevelt of America: “I can come to America and I can create the atom bomb. I have the whole secret with me. And whosoever has the atom bomb is going to be the victor in the second world war.” Immediately Roosevelt invited him and created all the facilities to make the atom bomb.\nBy the time the atom bomb was ready, Roosevelt was no longer president; Truman had come in his place. Germany was defeated, and it was only a question of seven days at the most – that’s what all military experts of the world agree before Japan was going to surrender. There was no way... because all the power had been coming from Germany. Japan was only an associate. And even American generals advised Truman, “Now there is no need to use atom bombs. With ordinary bombs, within seven days, Japan will have to surrender.” But Truman would not listen.\nAgain Albert Einstein wrote a letter, saying that now there was no need. But now who cares about Albert Einstein? The bombs are in the hands of the president. And Truman, for no reason at all, bombed two cities of Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Big cities... each city had more than one hundred thousand people, and within five minutes all those people had evaporated. Such destruction had never been heard of. And it was a destruction which was not needed.\nTruman was in a hurry. He was afraid that if Japan surrendered, then there would be no opportunity to use atomic bombs, which had been created with so much money. And he would not be able to show the whole world that America was the greatest power, that he was the man who holds the key to the greatest power. Those bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not meant just to defeat Japan. Their basic purpose was totally different – an ego fulfillment for President Truman: “I am the greatest, the most powerful man in the whole world, and my nation has come to the top.” This has been happening again and again.\nBefore the second world war, nobody was ready to believe that such destructive weapons had ever existed. In the old scriptures of India, the story of the Mahabharata, the great Indian war of five\nthousand years ago, is just mythological. It was inconceivable that such powerful weapons were available five thousand years ago. But since the second world war it is now absolutely clear from the description in the Mahabharata, that they had discovered something close to atomic energy. They destroyed a great civilization, but the destruction came from within their own civilization.\nAgain we are moving towards the same situation. The destruction is not coming from some other planet, we are preparing our own graves. We may be aware, we may not be aware – we are all grave diggers, and we are all digging our own graves. Right now there are only five nations who are in possession of nuclear weapons. And nuclear weapons are millions of times more powerful than the second world war atom bombs. Now scientists say that compared to modern nuclear weapons, the second world war atom bombs seem to be like fire-crackers.\nBy the year 2010, twenty-five other nations will also be nuclear powers. It is going to be beyond control – thirty nations having so much destructiveness that a single nation could destroy the whole earth. A single crazy man, a single politician, to show his power, can destroy the whole of civilization; and you have to begin from ABC. And the destruction is not only of humanity. With humanity die all the companions of humanity – the animals, the trees, the birds, the flowers – everything disappears, everything that is alive.\nThe reason is an imbalance in our evolution. We go on developing scientific technology without bothering at all that our consciousness should also evolve in the same proportion. In fact, our consciousness should be a little ahead of our technological progress.\nIf our consciousness were in the state of enlightenment.… In the hands of a Gautam Buddha, nuclear weapons are no longer dangerous. In the hands of a Gautam Buddha, nuclear weapons will be turned into some creative force – because force is always neutral; either you can destroy with it or you can find ways to create something. But right now our powers are great, and our humanity is very small. It is as if we have given bombs into the hands of children, to play with.\nYou are asking, “Why have human beings gone through this struggle since the very beginning?” It is the imbalance between the inner and the outer. The outer is easier; and the outer is objective. For example, one man, Thomas Alva Edison, creates electricity, and the whole of humanity uses it; there is no need for everyone to discover it again and again.\nInner growth is a totally different phenomenon. A Gautam Buddha may become enlightened, but that does not mean that everybody else becomes enlightened. Each individual has to find the truth by himself. So whatsoever happens on the outside goes on accumulating, piling up; all scientific progress goes on piling up. Each scientist is standing on the shoulders of other scientists. But the evolution of consciousness does not follow the same law. Each individual has to discover it by himself; he cannot stand upon the shoulders of somebody else.\nAnything objective can be shared, can be taught in the schools, in the colleges, in the universities. But the same is not true about subjectivity. I may know everything about the inner world, still I cannot hand that over to you. It is one of the fundamental laws of existence that the inner truth has to be discovered by each individual by his own efforts. It cannot be purchased in the marketplace, nor can it be stolen. Nobody can give it to you as a gift. It is not a commodity, it is not material; it is an immaterial experience.\nOne can give evidence by his individuality, by his presence, by his compassion, by his love, by his silence. But these are only evidences that something has happened inside him. He can encourage you. He can tell you that you are not going inside in vain – you will find treasures, as I have found. Each master is nothing but an argument, an evidence, an eyewitness. But the experience remains individual. Science becomes social, technology becomes social; meditation remains individual. That is the basic problem: how to create balance.\nAll the civilizations in the past.A civilization existed on Atlantis, a vast continent that was drowned\nin the Atlantic Ocean. It was thought that that too is mythology, but recent researchers have proved that still there are remnants five miles deep under the water, of great cities. And the same happened with another continent, smaller than Atlantis – Lemuria. That too was drowned in the ocean.\nIt seems to the superficial observer that it must have been a natural calamity – perhaps a great earthquake, a movement of the earth, an entering of the ocean into those great cities, volcanoes – but something natural must have happened as a calamity. But as far as I can see, those natural calamities are also caused by us.\nJust the other day I received news about one of the most beautiful forests in Germany, the famous Black Forest. Rumors have been coming for years that a part of it is dying; trees are simply dying for no visible reason. And the government of Germany has been hiding the facts. But just now the thing has become too big; you cannot cover it up. Fifty per cent of the forest has died. And the reason is not natural. The reason is the use of certain gases in the factories. Those gases are mixing with vapors, and when it rains the water becomes acidic. So if it falls on a tree, that tree dies immediately – it is poisoned. Maybe half the Black Forest is completely dead. The remaining half cannot survive either, because those gases are still being used.\nThe scientists have calculated that around the earth there is a two hundred mile thick layer surrounding the globe, of air. And in the air is a layer of ozone, which is very protective; it protects life on the earth. All of the sunrays are not good for life. The ozone layer returns a few rays – those are death rays; if they enter the atmosphere they will destroy life. And only those rays are allowed through by the ozone which are not against life, but life enhancing.\nBut stupidly, we have made holes in this layer by sending rockets to the moon – which is a simple exercise in stupidity. When the rockets went, they made great holes in the ozone layer, and when they came back they again made holes. Russia and America both have been competing in creating those holes, and only just now they have become aware that those holes have taken away some of the protective layer. Now death rays are entering into the atmosphere.\nWhen this civilization is destroyed, people may think it was a natural calamity. It is not. We have created it.\nBecause of the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases, the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere has begun to rise, and that is creating a new problem. The ice at both the poles, south and north, is melting for the first time because the temperature has never been so high. Before, the ice remained eternally settled.\nScientists calculate that by the end of this century, all the oceans of the world will have risen by four and a half feet. There have never been any floods of the oceans – and this will be a permanent rise.\nCities like Bombay and New York, which are on the seashore, will be filled with four and half feet of water.\nThis is only one calculation of one group of researchers who are working at the north pole and south pole. A third group is working on the Himalayan ice, which has been eternally there. If the temperature rises just one degree more, then the ice from the Himalayas and the Alps will start melting. And that will be a real calamity, because it will raise every ocean by forty feet. It will drown almost everything that we know as civilization; all our great ports, great cities, all will be under water. Anybody researching later on would find it to be a natural calamity – it is not. It is our own stupidity.\nWe can learn much, seeing what is happening, and then we can think introspectively about other civilizations which have disappeared, either through war or through calamities which apparently look natural. But I don’t feel that they were natural. Those civilizations must have done something stupid that caused the calamities.\n“Were there not already highly developed civilizations living on this earth?” There were, but they all got into the same mess in which we are entering; they all got into the same darkness in which we are entering. “And yet their consciousness got lost and man had to start all over again.” Their consciousness was not lost – they had no consciousness. They had just the same superficial consciousness as we have.\nWhat are you doing to prevent the calamity that is coming closer every day? The death of this earth is not far away – at the most, twenty years, twenty-five years. And that is a very optimistic attitude; for the pessimist it can happen even tomorrow. But even if we give twenty-five years to you, what are you going to do to help human consciousness rise in such a way that we can prevent the global suicide that is going to happen?\nIt is coming from many directions. Nuclear weapons are one direction which is almost completely ready. Any moment... and it is going to be a push-button war. It is not a problem of sending armies and airplanes.\nJust the other day the prime minister of the Soviet Union declared that there are thousands of submarines underneath the ocean, moving around the world. Each submarine is carrying so much nuclear power that it is equal to one thousand second world wars. One submarine... and there are thousands of submarines, Russian and American, underneath the water. The explosion can happen just by accident. There is no need for any war, just by accident.…\nThat is only one direction from which we are about to destroy ourselves. The second is creating the holes – because those experiments continue. Now the moon is not the target, nor has Mars become the target. And there is nobody to protest against all these experiments – because they are not going to help human happiness or human life in any way. Why waste energy? And why create unnecessarily destructive situations? All those gases that are rising in the air and creating acid rain.…\nFrom another dimension, the disease AIDS is spreading so fast that there is every possibility it will destroy almost two-thirds of humanity without any war. And if the oceans are filled with all the ice that the Himalayas hold, and that of the south and north poles and the Alps and other mountains, we will be drowned, just as Atlantis was drowned and Lemuria was drowned.\nThe only possible way to avoid it is to create more meditativeness in the world. But it is such an insane world that sometimes it seems almost unbelievable.\nThe police commissioner of Poona has asked that police officers should be allowed to tape every one of my discourses; they will scrutinize and edit them, and they will tell us what parts should be kept in and what parts should be left out. One has never heard that police officers can even understand what meditation is.\nThe commissioner has been saying that respected citizens of Poona should make a committee, and they should come as a commission and go through all our meditations, our therapy groups, our discourses, and they should produce a report on whether what is happening is right or not. Who are the respected citizens of Poona, and how much do they know about meditation? How much do they know about psychotherapies? How much do they know about themselves?\nBut this is the world we are in. Seeing such absurd expectations, one loses all hope for the future. Rather, tell the people of Poona to come and meditate here, send the police officers to participate in therapy groups, to participate in meditations – because there is no other way.\nIf somebody is doing Vipassana, what can you observe? Whatever is happening, is happening so deep inside the person... with closed eyes he is sitting silently. These people can only report to the newspapers that I am teaching people to be lazy, sitting and doing nothing. Naturally they cannot see what is happening inside. They do not know anything of what has happened in one hundred years in the world of psychology, and they do not know anything of what has happened in ten thousand years in the world of meditation – how many methods have been created, how deep man has reached.\nWho are these respected people? Their respectability may be because somebody has made a hospital, or somebody has opened a college, or somebody has donated to the orphans, to the poor. All these things are perfectly good – we have no objection. But because of these things they don’t become experts in meditation, and they don’t become experts in therapy.\nThey cannot even repeat twelve names of the enlightened people of the world, and they want to edit what I am saying. What will be their criterion? They know nothing of the interior world. They know nothing about the highest peaks of consciousness. They may have never heard the names like tathata, anatta. But such is the insanity of man that he even wants to judge Gautam Buddha and Mahavira and Basho and Sarmad, not knowing even the ABC’s of them.\nThis is the only effort that we are trying to make: to raise the consciousness of a few individuals, and send them to faraway corners of the world to help, wherever they are, in raising the consciousness of humanity.\nIf, in the coming twenty years, man goes through a revolution, attains a new consciousness, perhaps, what has been happening up to now can be avoided for this civilization. We should make every effort to avoid it.\nLastly, Jaldhara, you are asking, “Right now it seems to be a particularly dark period. It is, and it will become darker and darker unless everybody becomes a light unto himself and radiates light around\nhimself; unless everyone starts sharing his light and his fire with those who are thirsty and hungry for it. The dawn is not going to come automatically. You have to be fully alert to make every possible effort in helping consciousness.\nBefore the oceans rise forty feet, at least we have to make consciousness rise forty feet. The world needs at least two hundred enlightened people. Those will be the two hundred lighthouses where millions can be satisfied in their thirst for truth. It is a great struggle against darkness, but also a great opportunity and a challenge and an excitement. You have not to become serious about it. You have to do it lovingly, dancingly, with all your songs and with all your joy, because that way only, it is possible to bring the dawn and dispel the darkness.\nYes, Jaldhara, this is true. There is a cosmic law that says “Only out of the mud the lotus can grow.” The politicians, and the priests of all the religions, the governments and the bureaucracies, all are creating enough mud. Now we have to grow lotuses. You have not to be drowned in their mud; you have to sow seeds for lotuses. The lotus seed is a miracle, it transforms the mud into the most beautiful flower.\nIn the East the lotus has been almost worshiped for two reasons. One, that it arises out of the mud – every man is just mud. The English word human simply means mud. The Arabic word admi simply means mud because God made human beings out of mud. But there is a possibility of growing a lotus flower. It is the biggest flower. It opens its petals only when the sun rises and the birds start singing and the whole sky becomes colorful. And as the darkness comes and the sun sets, it again closes its petals. It is a lover of light.\nSecondly, it has a very beautiful quality – its petals, even its leaves, are so velvety that in the night dewdrops gather on the petals, on the leaves. In the early morning sun, those dewdrops shine almost like pearls – far more beautiful, creating rainbows around themselves. But the most beautiful thing is that although they are resting on the petals and on the leaves, they don’t touch the leaf. Just a small breeze comes and they slip back into the ocean, leaving no trace, no wetness on the leaves or on the lotus petals.\nThe lotus flower has been very symbolic to the East, because the East says you should live in the world but remain untouched by it. You should remain in the world, but the world should not remain in you. You should pass through the world without carrying any impression, any impact, any scratch. If by the time of death you can say that your consciousness is as pure, as innocent, as you have brought it with you at birth, you have lived a religious life, a spiritual life.\nHence, the lotus flower has become a symbol of a spiritual style of living. Untouched by the water... it grows from the mud in the water, and yet remains untouched. And it is a symbol of transformation. Mud is transformed into the most beautiful and the most fragrant flower this planet knows about. Gautam Buddha was so much in love with the lotus that he called his paradise “the lotus paradise.”\nJaldhara, with our deep meditation and gratitude for existence, it is possible that this earth can remain growing with more consciousness, with more flowers; it can become a lotus paradise.\nBut a tremendous struggle for a great revolution in human consciousness is needed, and everybody is called for that revolution. Contribute all that you can. Your whole life has to be given to the\nrevolution. You will not have another chance, another challenge – for your own growth, and for the growth of this whole beautiful planet.\nThis is the only planet in the whole of existence which is alive; its death would be a great tragedy. But it can be avoided. You have to become the soldiers for this revolution to avoid the criminal forces, the evil forces, which are getting ready to destroy us.\nI would like to end my answer with a beautiful reference. The people in America destroyed our beautiful commune, which was an oasis in the desert, which we had created with immense effort – five thousand people continuously working for five years. But America could not tolerate such happy, joyous, dancing people – so serene, so calm, so peaceful. They did everything illegal and everything criminal, but they had the power, and they destroyed the commune.\nNow they have made a memorial, a marble memorial as a symbol of their victory. But unconsciously they have written a sentence on the memorial which I loved, which I would have suggested to them to write. The sentence is, “Evil forces win only when good people remain silent.” That sentence is in our favor. That memorial they have made really says something about what happened: evil forces have won because the good people remained silent.\nAmerica is full of good people. If they had raised their voices, the commune could have been saved. But it is the weakness of good people everywhere; in private they will say, “It is perfectly good,” but in public they will join the crowd.\nGood people don’t have guts. Bad people have guts. This is the trouble. So just a few bad people have been ruling the whole of humanity, and millions of good people, seeing destructiveness, seeing violence, seeing criminality, just remain silent. They don’t want to get involved in any trouble. The bad people are in search of trouble; the good people avoid trouble.\nWe have to learn one thing, and that is, to fight for the truth, fighting for that which is beautiful, fighting for that which is good, fighting for God. I want my sannyasins to be soldiers of God; otherwise there is no hope for humanity.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT A JAPANESE BUDDHIST UNIVERSITY I HEARD THE WORD CONSCIOUSNESS. BELOVED OSHO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\nKranti Satbodha, consciousness you already have, but only in a very small proportion. It is just like an iceberg – one tenth is above water and the rest is under water. Just a little bit is conscious in you.\nI am saying something and you are listening to it; without consciousness it is not possible. These pillars of Chuang Tzu Auditorium are not listening – they don’t have consciousness. But we are aware only of a very small piece of consciousness.\nMeditation is the whole science of bringing more and more consciousness out of darkness. The only way is to be as conscious as possible twenty-four hours a day. Sitting, sit consciously, not like\na mechanical robot; walking, walk consciously, alert to each movement; listening, listen more and more consciously, so that each word comes to you in its crystal clear purity, its definitiveness. While listening, be silent, so that your consciousness is not covered by thoughts.\nJust this moment, if you are silent and conscious you can hear small insects singing their song in the trees. The darkness is not empty, the night has its own song; but if you are full of thoughts then you cannot listen to the insects. This is just an example.\nIf you become more and more silent, you may start listening to your own heartbeat, you may start listening to the flow of your own blood, because blood is continuously flowing all through your body. If you are conscious and silent, more and more clarity, creativity, intelligence, will be discovered. There are millions of geniuses who die without knowing that they were a genius. There are millions of people who don’t know why they have come, why they lived and why they are going.\nIt happened... George Bernard Shaw was traveling from London to some other place in England. The ticket checker came and Bernard Shaw looked in all his pockets, opened his suitcase – he was perspiring – the ticket was missing.\nThe ticket checker said, “I know you, everybody knows you, there is no need to be worried. You must have put it somewhere, don’t be so tense”. Bernard Shaw said, “Who is being tense about the ticket?” The ticket checker said, “Then why are you perspiring and looking so nervous?”\nHe said, “The problem is that now the question arises of where I am going. It was written on the ticket. Now, are you going to tell me where I am going? Who is going to tell me?” The ticket checker said, “How can I tell you where you are going?”\nSo Bernard Shaw said, “Then you should go and leave me alone. I have to find the ticket. It is a question of life and death. Where am I going? I must be going somewhere, because I have come to the station, purchased the ticket, entered the compartment. So one thing is certain, I must be going somewhere.”\nThis is the situation most people never come to know – their consciousness is a hidden treasure. One does not know what it contains unless you awaken it, unless you bring it into light, unless you open all the doors and enter into your own being and find every nook and corner. Consciousness in its fullness will give you the idea of who you are, and will also give you the idea of what your destiny is, of where you are supposed to go, of what your capacities are. Are you hiding a poet in your heart, or a singer, or a dancer, or a mystic?\nConsciousness is something like light. Right now you are in deep darkness inside. When you close your eyes there is darkness and nothing else.\nOne of the great philosophers of the West, C.E.M. Joad, was dying, and a friend, who was a disciple of George Gurdjieff, had come to see him. Joad asked the friend, “What do you go on doing with this strange fellow, George Gurdjieff? Why are you wasting your time? And not only you... I have heard that many people are wasting their time.”\nThe friend laughed. He said, “It is strange that those few people who are with Gurdjieff think that the whole world is wasting its time, and you are thinking that we are wasting our time.” Joad said, “I don’t have much longer to live; otherwise I would have come and compared.”\nThe friend said, “Even if you have only a few seconds more to live, it can be done here, now.” Joad agreed. The man said, “You close your eyes and just look inside, and then open your eyes and tell me what you find.”\nJoad closed his eyes, opened his eyes and said, “There is darkness and nothing else.” The friend laughed and he said, “It is not a time to laugh, because you are almost dying, but I have come at the right time. You said that you saw only darkness inside?” Joad said, “Of course.”\nAnd the man said, “You are such a great philosopher; you have written such beautiful books. Can’t you see the point, that there are two things – you and the darkness? Otherwise, who saw the darkness? Darkness cannot see itself – that much is certain – and darkness cannot report that there is only darkness.” Joad gave it consideration and he said, “My God, perhaps the people who are with Gurdjieff are not wasting their time. This is true, I have seen the darkness.”\nThe friend said, “Our whole effort is to make this”I,” the witness, stronger and more crystallized, and to change the darkness into light. And both things happen simultaneously. As the witness becomes more and more centered, the darkness becomes less and less. When the witness comes to its full flowering, that is the lotus of consciousness – all darkness disappears.”\nSatbodha, we are here in a mystery school, doing nothing else than bringing more and more crystallization to your witness, to your consciousness; so that your inner being, your interiority, becomes a light, so full and overflowing that you can share it with others.\nTo be in darkness is to be living at the minimum. And to be full of life is to live at the maximum. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSOMETIMES WHILE READING A POEM BY KABIR THERE IS AN EXPERIENCE OF “AHA,” EVEN THOUGH THE MIND DOESN’T ALWAYS COMPREHEND IT. SITTING WITH YOU IN DARSHAN I WAS REMINDED OF THIS POEM:\nIGNORANCE SHUTS THE IRON GATES BUT LOVE OPENS THEM.\nTHE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.\nKABIR SAYS, “DON’T LET A CHANCE LIKE THIS GO BY.”\nPrem Prasado, Kabir is one of the most rare human beings who has ever been on this earth. He belongs to the highest category of mystics. And strangely enough he was absolutely uneducated, uncultured, an orphan. But although living the poor life of a weaver, he has also woven some golden poems of tremendous beauty. His words are raw but very pregnant.\nIGNORANCE SHUTS THE IRON GATES.\nThis word ignorance has a beauty. Ordinarily you may not have thought about it in this way. You have always thought about ignorance as absence of knowledge; but its true meaning is, ignoring yourself, ignoring that which can become your knowing, which can become your wisdom. And the whole day, the whole life, you are continuously ignoring yourself.\nYou are taking care of everything, every trivia, but never taking any note of the most precious thing that you have – yourself. And Kabir is using the word in the same sense. Ignoring yourself is the only ignorance. It shuts the iron gates.\nBUT LOVE OPENS THEM\nThese are the words of a man who knows. If he was only a learned man he would have said that knowledge opens the doors. But instead of knowledge, only a man who knows can say, BUT LOVE OPENS THEM.\nThe mind is going to remain in ignorance; it cannot get out of it. The iron gates are closed. The mind can become knowledgeable, but it cannot become wise. It is only the heart which opens the gates. It is only love that makes you wise.\nTHE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.\nNow these are symbolic words. According to Kabir, your soul is the sleeping woman. He is using the word woman for your soul, your consciousness, because only the feminine qualities are authentically spiritual qualities. Beauty is feminine, honesty is feminine, sincerity is feminine; all that is great within your consciousness is feminine. Even the word consciousness is feminine.\nIn English it is difficult, because in English you don’t make a difference in words, you don’t make a difference between male and female in each word. But in any language that is born in the East, each word has the distinction: consciousness, awareness, samadhi, sambodhi, all are feminine. And the man of love and compassion starts having a feminine beauty and a feminine grace. The male is a little barbarous. His qualities are that of a warrior, fighter, egoist, chauvinist, fanatic, fascist. The male qualities are qualities of a Nazi.\nIt is not strange that Germany is the only country which calls its own land, the fatherland. The whole world calls their countries the motherland – Germany is a special case. It is time they should change it; they should stop calling it the fatherland because that gives male qualities the priority.\nFriedrich Nietzsche was thought of by Adolf Hitler as his master, although Adolf Hitler has not the intelligence to understand Friedrich Nietzsche – whatever he understood was simply misunderstanding. But there were a few points for which Friedrich Nietzsche was also responsible.\nHe said in a letter that the most beautiful experience of his life was when he saw, one day in the early morning when the sun had risen, a batallion of soldiers with their shining guns, and heard the\nharmonious sound of their steps: “I have never seen such a beautiful scene, nor have I heard such beautiful music as the music of the soldiers and their boots going in harmonious parade.” Nietzsche also is responsible; these types of pieces Adolf Hitler collected from Nietzsche. The soldier became the real human being, and all the qualities of a warrior became the qualities of a superman.\nBut the East has always been aware that man and his qualities may be utilitarian, useful, but they don’t have the sensitivity, the softness, the lovingness, the compassion of the woman. That is why Kabir says,\nTHE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.\nKABIR SAYS, “DON’T LET A CHANCE LIKE THIS GO BY.”\nI also say to you, Prem Prasado, Don’t let a chance like this go by. We are making every effort here to wake up your woman, to wake up your consciousness, to wake up your grace, to wake up your beauty. Don’t let a chance like this go by.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM AFRAID TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION FOR I FEEL YOUR ANSWER COULD REALLY DESTROY ME. YOUR SWORD IS SO SHARP THESE DAYS THAT EVEN THE SOUND OF THE “WHOOSH” CAN MAKE ME TREMBLE, BUT I MUST ASK NO MATTER WHAT. WHY DON’T YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?\nPrem Patipada, I am not answering your questions deliberately. First, you have been part of the gang which destroyed the commune. You were aware of many things; you never came to me to tell about them. You were aware even that my personal physician was being poisoned, that efforts were being made to kill Vivek, my caretaker.\nYou remained part of the gang, a small group which wanted to have absolute power in the commune. And anybody who was not with them their argument was, was against them. You knew everything, still you never came to tell me. Even when I started speaking, you could have written questions informing me about all these things. You never did that.\nOn the contrary, when Sheela left with her small criminal group you also left the commune, writing to me in a letter, “Osho our paths are parting and perhaps I will never be able to see you again.” You may have forgotten your letter; I don’t forget so easily. I can forgive – I have forgiven you – but I cannot forget. And you have been here since that letter, twice; you came to Bombay, you have come here.\nAnd you are afraid, not because I am going to destroy you – you are afraid because I am going to expose you.\nThat’s why I have not been answering your questions, because you have not even offered an apology to me. And you owe an apology not only to me, but to the whole commune.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND NOW THE MOMENT HAS COME THAT I AM FORCED TO LEAVE. TO BE HONEST, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT I WOULD LEAVE. MY WHOLE BEING IS SHAKING. MY HEART IS BROKEN AND MY EYES ARE FULL OF TEARS, BUT NOTHING CAN TAKE AWAY WHAT I FEEL IN YOUR PRESENCE. I AM NOT GOOD AT EXPRESSING WHAT I FEEL; IT IS JUST A FEELING OF THANKFULNESS. THANKS, OSHO, FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO STAY IN YOUR HOUSE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIFT, AND ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR BEING SO COMPASSIONATE WITH ME.\nDhyan Aum, there is no need to be full of tears because you have to go. Always remember that every going is a beginning of coming back; otherwise how will you come? So rather than emphasizing going, always emphasize coming. Go laughing, and if you love tears then the tears have to be of joy. Just for your laughter I will tell a joke.\nA young lady finds herself to be pregnant. Luckily she has a friend who is a surgeon in a hospital. “Don’t you worry,” says the friend, “I will help you.”\nSo she goes to the hospital to give birth to her baby. A Catholic priest who went to the hospital to have a gall bladder operation is very astonished to wake up from the operation with a newborn baby beside him. With some reluctance he finally accepts the surgeon’s explanation that it is his baby.\nIn the end he takes the child home and raises it as his child. When he comes to die he calls the now grown-up child to his deathbed and says, “My child, before I die I must tell you the truth. You have always believed that I am your father; I am not. In fact I am your mother. Your father is the bishop.”\nOkay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6854","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_razors_edge/>The Razor\'s Edge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">11 Bring the dawn, dispel the darkness</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6854 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Razors_Edge/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BEGINNING? WERE THERE NOT ALREADY HIGHLY DEVELOPED CIVILIZATIONS LIVING
ON THIS EARTH? AND YET THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS GOT LOST AND MAN HAD TO START
ALL OVER AGAIN. RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE A PARTICULARLY DARK PERIOD. IS
THERE SUCH A COSMIC LAW THAT SAYS, “ONLY OUT OF THE MUD THE LOTUS CAN
GROW”? AND WILL THIS EARTH EVER BECOME A GARDEN OF FLOWERS? IN DEEP
GRATITUDE AND LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Jaldhara, the question that you have asked has tremendous
implications in it. First, there have been many civilizations before our
civilization which have reached to even higher peaks, but they all
destroyed themselves because all those civilizations, including ours,
have been growing in a deep imbalance. They developed great
technologies, but they forgot that even the greatest technological
progress is not going to make man more blissful, more peaceful, more
loving, more compassionate.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s consciousness has not grown with the same pace as his
scientific progress, and that has been the cause of all the old
civilizations destroying themselves. There was no outer cause, no outer
enemy – the enemy was within man. He created monsters as far as machines
are concerned, but he himself remained very retarded, unconscious,
almost asleep. And it is very dangerous to give so much power to
unconscious people.</p><p>The same is happening today. Politicians are the lowest kind as far
as consciousness is concerned. They are clever, they are cunning, they
are mean, too; and they make every effort for a single goal – how to be
more powerful. Their only desire is for more power – not for more peace,
not for more being, not for more truth, not for more love.</p><p><br></p><p>And what do you need more power for? – to dominate others, to destroy
others. All the power accumulates in the hands of unconscious people. So
on the one hand, politicians in all the civilizations that have
developed and died – it would be better to say have committed suicide –
had all the power in their hands. And on the other hand the genius of
human intelligence was searching for more and more technological,
scientific ways, and all that they discovered finally had to go into the
hands of the politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>It was Albert Einstein who wrote a letter to President Roosevelt. He
had escaped from Germany. In Germany he was researching atomic theory
for Adolf Hitler, but reluctantly, because he was a Jew, and Adolf
Hitler was killing Jews in such vast numbers that it seemed
unbelievable. A single man killed six million Jews inside Germany.
During the second world war Adolf Hitler was responsible for killing
maybe fifty million people.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the situation – of course Albert Einstein was not going to be
killed, he was too valuable – he escaped from Germany. He did not want
to make the atom bomb for Adolf Hitler. It was a simple human reaction –
so many of his people, his friends, had been killed. He wrote a letter
to President Roosevelt of America: “I can come to America and I can
create the atom bomb. I have the whole secret with me. And whosoever has
the atom bomb is going to be the victor in the second world war.”
Immediately Roosevelt invited him and created all the facilities to make
the atom bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>By the time the atom bomb was ready, Roosevelt was no longer
president; Truman had come in his place. Germany was defeated, and it
was only a question of seven days at the most – that’s what all military
experts of the world agree before Japan was going to surrender. There
was no way... because all the power had been coming from Germany. Japan
was only an associate. And even American generals advised Truman, “Now
there is no need to use atom bombs. With ordinary bombs, within seven
days, Japan will have to surrender.” But Truman would not listen.</p><p><br></p><p>Again Albert Einstein wrote a letter, saying that now there was no
need. But now who cares about Albert Einstein? The bombs are in the
hands of the president. And Truman, for no reason at all, bombed two
cities of Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Big cities... each city had
more than one hundred thousand people, and within five minutes all those
people had evaporated. Such destruction had never been heard of. And it
was a destruction which was not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Truman was in a hurry. He was afraid that if Japan surrendered, then
there would be no opportunity to use atomic bombs, which had been
created with so much money. And he would not be able to show the whole
world that America was the greatest power, that he was the man who holds
the key to the greatest power. Those bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
were not meant just to defeat Japan. Their basic purpose was totally
different – an ego fulfillment for President Truman: “I am the greatest,
the most powerful man in the whole world, and my nation has come to the
top.” This has been happening again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the second world war, nobody was ready to believe that such
destructive weapons had ever existed. In the old scriptures of India,
the story of the Mahabharata, the great Indian war of five</p><p>thousand years ago, is just mythological. It was inconceivable that
such powerful weapons were available five thousand years ago. But since
the second world war it is now absolutely clear from the description in
the Mahabharata, that they had discovered something close to atomic
energy. They destroyed a great civilization, but the destruction came
from within their own civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>Again we are moving towards the same situation. The destruction is
not coming from some other planet, we are preparing our own graves. We
may be aware, we may not be aware – we are all grave diggers, and we are
all digging our own graves. Right now there are only five nations who
are in possession of nuclear weapons. And nuclear weapons are millions
of times more powerful than the second world war atom bombs. Now
scientists say that compared to modern nuclear weapons, the second world
war atom bombs seem to be like fire-crackers.</p><p><br></p><p>By the year 2010, twenty-five other nations will also be nuclear
powers. It is going to be beyond control – thirty nations having so much
destructiveness that a single nation could destroy the whole earth. A
single crazy man, a single politician, to show his power, can destroy
the whole of civilization; and you have to begin from ABC. And the
destruction is not only of humanity. With humanity die all the
companions of humanity – the animals, the trees, the birds, the flowers
– everything disappears, everything that is alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason is an imbalance in our evolution. We go on developing
scientific technology without bothering at all that our consciousness
should also evolve in the same proportion. In fact, our consciousness
should be a little ahead of our technological progress.</p><p><br></p><p>If our consciousness were in the state of enlightenment.… In the
hands of a Gautam Buddha, nuclear weapons are no longer dangerous. In
the hands of a Gautam Buddha, nuclear weapons will be turned into some
creative force – because force is always neutral; either you can destroy
with it or you can find ways to create something. But right now our
powers are great, and our humanity is very small. It is as if we have
given bombs into the hands of children, to play with.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “Why have human beings gone through this struggle
since the very beginning?” It is the imbalance between the inner and the
outer. The outer is easier; and the outer is objective. For example, one
man, Thomas Alva Edison, creates electricity, and the whole of humanity
uses it; there is no need for everyone to discover it again and
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Inner growth is a totally different phenomenon. A Gautam Buddha may
become enlightened, but that does not mean that everybody else becomes
enlightened. Each individual has to find the truth by himself. So
whatsoever happens on the outside goes on accumulating, piling up; all
scientific progress goes on piling up. Each scientist is standing on the
shoulders of other scientists. But the evolution of consciousness does
not follow the same law. Each individual has to discover it by himself;
he cannot stand upon the shoulders of somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything objective can be shared, can be taught in the schools, in
the colleges, in the universities. But the same is not true about
subjectivity. I may know everything about the inner world, still I
cannot hand that over to you. It is one of the fundamental laws of
existence that the inner truth has to be discovered by each individual
by his own efforts. It cannot be purchased in the marketplace, nor can
it be stolen. Nobody can give it to you as a gift. It is not a
commodity, it is not material; it is an immaterial experience.</p><p>One can give evidence by his individuality, by his presence, by his
compassion, by his love, by his silence. But these are only evidences
that something has happened inside him. He can encourage you. He can
tell you that you are not going inside in vain – you will find
treasures, as I have found. Each master is nothing but an argument, an
evidence, an eyewitness. But the experience remains individual. Science
becomes social, technology becomes social; meditation remains
individual. That is the basic problem: how to create balance.</p><p><br></p><p>All the civilizations in the past.<span class=s4></span>A
civilization existed on Atlantis, a vast continent that was drowned</p><p>in the Atlantic Ocean. It was thought that that too is mythology, but
recent researchers have proved that still there are remnants five miles
deep under the water, of great cities. And the same happened with
another continent, smaller than Atlantis – Lemuria. That too was drowned
in the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems to the superficial observer that it must have been a natural
calamity – perhaps a great earthquake, a movement of the earth, an
entering of the ocean into those great cities, volcanoes – but something
natural must have happened as a calamity. But as far as I can see, those
natural calamities are also caused by us.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received news about one of the most beautiful
forests in Germany, the famous Black Forest. Rumors have been coming for
years that a part of it is dying; trees are simply dying for no visible
reason. And the government of Germany has been hiding the facts. But
just now the thing has become too big; you cannot cover it up. Fifty per
cent of the forest has died. And the reason is not natural. The reason
is the use of certain gases in the factories. Those gases are mixing
with vapors, and when it rains the water becomes acidic. So if it falls
on a tree, that tree dies immediately – it is poisoned. Maybe half the
Black Forest is completely dead. The remaining half cannot survive
either, because those gases are still being used.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientists have calculated that around the earth there is a two
hundred mile thick layer surrounding the globe, of air. And in the air
is a layer of ozone, which is very protective; it protects life on the
earth. All of the sunrays are not good for life. The ozone layer returns
a few rays – those are death rays; if they enter the atmosphere they
will destroy life. And only those rays are allowed through by the ozone
which are not against life, but life enhancing.</p><p><br></p><p>But stupidly, we have made holes in this layer by sending rockets to
the moon – which is a simple exercise in stupidity. When the rockets
went, they made great holes in the ozone layer, and when they came back
they again made holes. Russia and America both have been competing in
creating those holes, and only just now they have become aware that
those holes have taken away some of the protective layer. Now death rays
are entering into the atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>When this civilization is destroyed, people may think it was a
natural calamity. It is not. We have created it.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases, the
temperature of the earth’s atmosphere has begun to rise, and that is
creating a new problem. The ice at both the poles, south and north, is
melting for the first time because the temperature has never been so
high. Before, the ice remained eternally settled.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists calculate that by the end of this century, all the oceans
of the world will have risen by four and a half feet. There have never
been any floods of the oceans – and this will be a permanent rise.</p><p>Cities like Bombay and New York, which are on the seashore, will be
filled with four and half feet of water.</p><p><br></p><p>This is only one calculation of one group of researchers who are
working at the north pole and south pole. A third group is working on
the Himalayan ice, which has been eternally there. If the temperature
rises just one degree more, then the ice from the Himalayas and the Alps
will start melting. And that will be a real calamity, because it will
raise every ocean by forty feet. It will drown almost everything that we
know as civilization; all our great ports, great cities, all will be
under water. Anybody researching later on would find it to be a natural
calamity – it is not. It is our own stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>We can learn much, seeing what is happening, and then we can think
introspectively about other civilizations which have disappeared, either
through war or through calamities which apparently look natural. But I
don’t feel that they were natural. Those civilizations must have done
something stupid that caused the calamities.</p><p><br></p><p>“Were there not already highly developed civilizations living on this
earth?” There were, but they all got into the same mess in which we are
entering; they all got into the same darkness in which we are entering.
“And yet their consciousness got lost and man had to start all over
again.” Their consciousness was not lost – they had no consciousness.
They had just the same superficial consciousness as we have.</p><p><br></p><p>What are you doing to prevent the calamity that is coming closer
every day? The death of this earth is not far away – at the most, twenty
years, twenty-five years. And that is a very optimistic attitude; for
the pessimist it can happen even tomorrow. But even if we give
twenty-five years to you, what are you going to do to help human
consciousness rise in such a way that we can prevent the global suicide
that is going to happen?</p><p><br></p><p>It is coming from many directions. Nuclear weapons are one direction
which is almost completely ready. Any moment... and it is going to be a
push-button war. It is not a problem of sending armies and
airplanes.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day the prime minister of the Soviet Union declared
that there are thousands of submarines underneath the ocean, moving
around the world. Each submarine is carrying so much nuclear power that
it is equal to one thousand second world wars. One submarine... and
there are thousands of submarines, Russian and American, underneath the
water. The explosion can happen just by accident. There is no need for
any war, just by accident.…</p><p><br></p><p>That is only one direction from which we are about to destroy
ourselves. The second is creating the holes – because those experiments
continue. Now the moon is not the target, nor has Mars become the
target. And there is nobody to protest against all these experiments –
because they are not going to help human happiness or human life in any
way. Why waste energy? And why create unnecessarily destructive
situations? All those gases that are rising in the air and creating acid
rain.…</p><p><br></p><p>From another dimension, the disease AIDS is spreading so fast that
there is every possibility it will destroy almost two-thirds of humanity
without any war. And if the oceans are filled with all the ice that the
Himalayas hold, and that of the south and north poles and the Alps and
other mountains, we will be drowned, just as Atlantis was drowned and
Lemuria was drowned.</p><p>The only possible way to avoid it is to create more meditativeness in
the world. But it is such an insane world that sometimes it seems almost
unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>The police commissioner of Poona has asked that police officers
should be allowed to tape every one of my discourses; they will
scrutinize and edit them, and they will tell us what parts should be
kept in and what parts should be left out. One has never heard that
police officers can even understand what meditation is.</p><p><br></p><p>The commissioner has been saying that respected citizens of Poona
should make a committee, and they should come as a commission and go
through all our meditations, our therapy groups, our discourses, and
they should produce a report on whether what is happening is right or
not. Who are the respected citizens of Poona, and how much do they know
about meditation? How much do they know about psychotherapies? How much
do they know about themselves?</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the world we are in. Seeing such absurd expectations, one
loses all hope for the future. Rather, tell the people of Poona to come
and meditate here, send the police officers to participate in therapy
groups, to participate in meditations – because there is no other
way.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody is doing Vipassana, what can you observe? Whatever is
happening, is happening so deep inside the person... with closed eyes he
is sitting silently. These people can only report to the newspapers that
I am teaching people to be lazy, sitting and doing nothing. Naturally
they cannot see what is happening inside. They do not know anything of
what has happened in one hundred years in the world of psychology, and
they do not know anything of what has happened in ten thousand years in
the world of meditation – how many methods have been created, how deep
man has reached.</p><p><br></p><p>Who are these respected people? Their respectability may be because
somebody has made a hospital, or somebody has opened a college, or
somebody has donated to the orphans, to the poor. All these things are
perfectly good – we have no objection. But because of these things they
don’t become experts in meditation, and they don’t become experts in
therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>They cannot even repeat twelve names of the enlightened people of the
world, and they want to edit what I am saying. What will be their
criterion? They know nothing of the interior world. They know nothing
about the highest peaks of consciousness. They may have never heard the
names like tathata, anatta. But such is the insanity of man that he even
wants to judge Gautam Buddha and Mahavira and Basho and Sarmad, not
knowing even the ABC’s of them.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only effort that we are trying to make: to raise the
consciousness of a few individuals, and send them to faraway corners of
the world to help, wherever they are, in raising the consciousness of
humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>If, in the coming twenty years, man goes through a revolution,
attains a new consciousness, perhaps, what has been happening up to now
can be avoided for this civilization. We should make every effort to
avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, Jaldhara, you are asking, “Right now it seems to be a
particularly dark period. It is, and it will become darker and darker
unless everybody becomes a light unto himself and radiates light
around</p><p>himself; unless everyone starts sharing his light and his fire with
those who are thirsty and hungry for it. The dawn is not going to come
automatically. You have to be fully alert to make every possible effort
in helping consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the oceans rise forty feet, at least we have to make
consciousness rise forty feet. The world needs at least two hundred
enlightened people. Those will be the two hundred lighthouses where
millions can be satisfied in their thirst for truth. It is a great
struggle against darkness, but also a great opportunity and a challenge
and an excitement. You have not to become serious about it. You have to
do it lovingly, dancingly, with all your songs and with all your joy,
because that way only, it is possible to bring the dawn and dispel the
darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Jaldhara, this is true. There is a cosmic law that says “Only
out of the mud the lotus can grow.” The politicians, and the priests of
all the religions, the governments and the bureaucracies, all are
creating enough mud. Now we have to grow lotuses. You have not to be
drowned in their mud; you have to sow seeds for lotuses. The lotus seed
is a miracle, it transforms the mud into the most beautiful flower.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East the lotus has been almost worshiped for two reasons. One,
that it arises out of the mud – every man is just mud. The English word
human simply means mud. The Arabic word admi simply means mud because
God made human beings out of mud. But there is a possibility of growing
a lotus flower. It is the biggest flower. It opens its petals only when
the sun rises and the birds start singing and the whole sky becomes
colorful. And as the darkness comes and the sun sets, it again closes
its petals. It is a lover of light.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, it has a very beautiful quality – its petals, even its
leaves, are so velvety that in the night dewdrops gather on the petals,
on the leaves. In the early morning sun, those dewdrops shine almost
like pearls – far more beautiful, creating rainbows around themselves.
But the most beautiful thing is that although they are resting on the
petals and on the leaves, they don’t touch the leaf. Just a small breeze
comes and they slip back into the ocean, leaving no trace, no wetness on
the leaves or on the lotus petals.</p><p><br></p><p>The lotus flower has been very symbolic to the East, because the East
says you should live in the world but remain untouched by it. You should
remain in the world, but the world should not remain in you. You should
pass through the world without carrying any impression, any impact, any
scratch. If by the time of death you can say that your consciousness is
as pure, as innocent, as you have brought it with you at birth, you have
lived a religious life, a spiritual life.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, the lotus flower has become a symbol of a spiritual style of
living. Untouched by the water... it grows from the mud in the water,
and yet remains untouched. And it is a symbol of transformation. Mud is
transformed into the most beautiful and the most fragrant flower this
planet knows about. Gautam Buddha was so much in love with the lotus
that he called his paradise “the lotus paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jaldhara, with our deep meditation and gratitude for existence, it is
possible that this earth can remain growing with more consciousness,
with more flowers; it can become a lotus paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>But a tremendous struggle for a great revolution in human
consciousness is needed, and everybody is called for that revolution.
Contribute all that you can. Your whole life has to be given to the</p><p>revolution. You will not have another chance, another challenge – for
your own growth, and for the growth of this whole beautiful planet.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only planet in the whole of existence which is alive; its
death would be a great tragedy. But it can be avoided. You have to
become the soldiers for this revolution to avoid the criminal forces,
the evil forces, which are getting ready to destroy us.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to end my answer with a beautiful reference. The people
in America destroyed our beautiful commune, which was an oasis in the
desert, which we had created with immense effort – five thousand people
continuously working for five years. But America could not tolerate such
happy, joyous, dancing people – so serene, so calm, so peaceful. They
did everything illegal and everything criminal, but they had the power,
and they destroyed the commune.</p><p><br></p><p>Now they have made a memorial, a marble memorial as a symbol of their
victory. But unconsciously they have written a sentence on the memorial
which I loved, which I would have suggested to them to write. The
sentence is, “Evil forces win only when good people remain silent.” That
sentence is in our favor. That memorial they have made really says
something about what happened: evil forces have won because the good
people remained silent.</p><p><br></p><p>America is full of good people. If they had raised their voices, the
commune could have been saved. But it is the weakness of good people
everywhere; in private they will say, “It is perfectly good,” but in
public they will join the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Good people don’t have guts. Bad people have guts. This is the
trouble. So just a few bad people have been ruling the whole of
humanity, and millions of good people, seeing destructiveness, seeing
violence, seeing criminality, just remain silent. They don’t want to get
involved in any trouble. The bad people are in search of trouble; the
good people avoid trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to learn one thing, and that is, to fight for the truth,
fighting for that which is beautiful, fighting for that which is good,
fighting for God. I want my sannyasins to be soldiers of God; otherwise
there is no hope for humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT A JAPANESE BUDDHIST UNIVERSITY I HEARD THE
WORD CONSCIOUSNESS. BELOVED OSHO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>Kranti Satbodha, consciousness you already have, but only in a very
small proportion. It is just like an iceberg – one tenth is above water
and the rest is under water. Just a little bit is conscious in you.</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying something and you are listening to it; without
consciousness it is not possible. These pillars of Chuang Tzu Auditorium
are not listening – they don’t have consciousness. But we are aware only
of a very small piece of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the whole science of bringing more and more
consciousness out of darkness. The only way is to be as conscious as
possible twenty-four hours a day. Sitting, sit consciously, not like</p><p>a mechanical robot; walking, walk consciously, alert to each
movement; listening, listen more and more consciously, so that each word
comes to you in its crystal clear purity, its definitiveness. While
listening, be silent, so that your consciousness is not covered by
thoughts.</p><p>Just this moment, if you are silent and conscious you can hear small
insects singing their song in the trees. The darkness is not empty, the
night has its own song; but if you are full of thoughts then you cannot
listen to the insects. This is just an example.</p><p>If you become more and more silent, you may start listening to your
own heartbeat, you may start listening to the flow of your own blood,
because blood is continuously flowing all through your body. If you are
conscious and silent, more and more clarity, creativity, intelligence,
will be discovered. There are millions of geniuses who die without
knowing that they were a genius. There are millions of people who don’t
know why they have come, why they lived and why they are going.</p><p>It happened... George Bernard Shaw was traveling from London to some
other place in England. The ticket checker came and Bernard Shaw looked
in all his pockets, opened his suitcase – he was perspiring – the ticket
was missing.</p><p>The ticket checker said, “I know you, everybody knows you, there is
no need to be worried. You must have put it somewhere, don’t be so
tense”. Bernard Shaw said, “Who is being tense about the ticket?” The
ticket checker said, “Then why are you perspiring and looking so
nervous?”</p><p>He said, “The problem is that now the question arises of where I am
going. It was written on the ticket. Now, are you going to tell me where
I am going? Who is going to tell me?” The ticket checker said, “How can
I tell you where you are going?”</p><p>So Bernard Shaw said, “Then you should go and leave me alone. I have
to find the ticket. It is a question of life and death. Where am I
going? I must be going somewhere, because I have come to the station,
purchased the ticket, entered the compartment. So one thing is certain,
I must be going somewhere.”</p><p>This is the situation most people never come to know – their
consciousness is a hidden treasure. One does not know what it contains
unless you awaken it, unless you bring it into light, unless you open
all the doors and enter into your own being and find every nook and
corner. Consciousness in its fullness will give you the idea of who you
are, and will also give you the idea of what your destiny is, of where
you are supposed to go, of what your capacities are. Are you hiding a
poet in your heart, or a singer, or a dancer, or a mystic?</p><p>Consciousness is something like light. Right now you are in deep
darkness inside. When you close your eyes there is darkness and nothing
else.</p><p>One of the great philosophers of the West, C.E.M. Joad, was dying,
and a friend, who was a disciple of George Gurdjieff, had come to see
him. Joad asked the friend, “What do you go on doing with this strange
fellow, George Gurdjieff? Why are you wasting your time? And not only
you... I have heard that many people are wasting their time.”</p><p>The friend laughed. He said, “It is strange that those few people who
are with Gurdjieff think that the whole world is wasting its time, and
you are thinking that we are wasting our time.” Joad said, “I don’t have
much longer to live; otherwise I would have come and compared.”</p><p>The friend said, “Even if you have only a few seconds more to live,
it can be done here, now.” Joad agreed. The man said, “You close your
eyes and just look inside, and then open your eyes and tell me what you
find.”</p><p><br></p><p>Joad closed his eyes, opened his eyes and said, “There is darkness
and nothing else.” The friend laughed and he said, “It is not a time to
laugh, because you are almost dying, but I have come at the right time.
You said that you saw only darkness inside?” Joad said, “Of course.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said, “You are such a great philosopher; you have written
such beautiful books. Can’t you see the point, that there are two things
– you and the darkness? Otherwise, who saw the darkness? Darkness cannot
see itself – that much is certain – and darkness cannot report that
there is only darkness.” Joad gave it consideration and he said, “My
God, perhaps the people who are with Gurdjieff are not wasting their
time. This is true, I have seen the darkness.”</p><p><br></p><p>The friend said, “Our whole effort is to make this”I,” the witness,
stronger and more crystallized, and to change the darkness into light.
And both things happen simultaneously. As the witness becomes more and
more centered, the darkness becomes less and less. When the witness
comes to its full flowering, that is the lotus of consciousness – all
darkness disappears.”</p><p><br></p><p>Satbodha, we are here in a mystery school, doing nothing else than
bringing more and more crystallization to your witness, to your
consciousness; so that your inner being, your interiority, becomes a
light, so full and overflowing that you can share it with others.</p><p><br></p><p>To be in darkness is to be living at the minimum. And to be full of
life is to live at the maximum. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>SOMETIMES WHILE READING A POEM BY KABIR THERE IS AN EXPERIENCE OF
“AHA,” EVEN THOUGH THE MIND DOESN’T ALWAYS COMPREHEND IT. SITTING WITH
YOU IN DARSHAN I WAS REMINDED OF THIS POEM:</p><p><br></p><p>IGNORANCE SHUTS THE IRON GATES BUT LOVE OPENS THEM.</p><p>THE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.</p><p>KABIR SAYS, “DON’T LET A CHANCE LIKE THIS GO BY.”</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Prasado, Kabir is one of the most rare human beings who has ever
been on this earth. He belongs to the highest category of mystics. And
strangely enough he was absolutely uneducated, uncultured, an orphan.
But although living the poor life of a weaver, he has also woven some
golden poems of tremendous beauty. His words are raw but very
pregnant.</p><p>IGNORANCE SHUTS THE IRON GATES.</p><p><br></p><p>This word ignorance has a beauty. Ordinarily you may not have thought
about it in this way. You have always thought about ignorance as absence
of knowledge; but its true meaning is, ignoring yourself, ignoring that
which can become your knowing, which can become your wisdom. And the
whole day, the whole life, you are continuously ignoring yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You are taking care of everything, every trivia, but never taking any
note of the most precious thing that you have – yourself. And Kabir is
using the word in the same sense. Ignoring yourself is the only
ignorance. It shuts the iron gates.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT LOVE OPENS THEM</p><p><br></p><p>These are the words of a man who knows. If he was only a learned man
he would have said that knowledge opens the doors. But instead of
knowledge, only a man who knows can say, BUT LOVE OPENS THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is going to remain in ignorance; it cannot get out of it.
The iron gates are closed. The mind can become knowledgeable, but it
cannot become wise. It is only the heart which opens the gates. It is
only love that makes you wise.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.</p><p>Now these are symbolic words. According to Kabir, your soul is the
sleeping woman. He is using the word woman for your soul, your
consciousness, because only the feminine qualities are authentically
spiritual qualities. Beauty is feminine, honesty is feminine, sincerity
is feminine; all that is great within your consciousness is feminine.
Even the word consciousness is feminine.</p><p><br></p><p>In English it is difficult, because in English you don’t make a
difference in words, you don’t make a difference between male and female
in each word. But in any language that is born in the East, each word
has the distinction: consciousness, awareness, samadhi, sambodhi, all
are feminine. And the man of love and compassion starts having a
feminine beauty and a feminine grace. The male is a little barbarous.
His qualities are that of a warrior, fighter, egoist, chauvinist,
fanatic, fascist. The male qualities are qualities of a Nazi.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not strange that Germany is the only country which calls its
own land, the fatherland. The whole world calls their countries the
motherland – Germany is a special case. It is time they should change
it; they should stop calling it the fatherland because that gives male
qualities the priority.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was thought of by Adolf Hitler as his master,
although Adolf Hitler has not the intelligence to understand Friedrich
Nietzsche – whatever he understood was simply misunderstanding. But
there were a few points for which Friedrich Nietzsche was also
responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>He said in a letter that the most beautiful experience of his life
was when he saw, one day in the early morning when the sun had risen, a
batallion of soldiers with their shining guns, and heard the</p><p>harmonious sound of their steps: “I have never seen such a beautiful
scene, nor have I heard such beautiful music as the music of the
soldiers and their boots going in harmonious parade.” Nietzsche also is
responsible; these types of pieces Adolf Hitler collected from
Nietzsche. The soldier became the real human being, and all the
qualities of a warrior became the qualities of a superman.</p><p><br></p><p>But the East has always been aware that man and his qualities may be
utilitarian, useful, but they don’t have the sensitivity, the softness,
the lovingness, the compassion of the woman. That is why Kabir says,</p><p><br></p><p>THE SOUND OF THE GATES OPENING WAKES THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ASLEEP.</p><p>KABIR SAYS, “DON’T LET A CHANCE LIKE THIS GO BY.”</p><p><br></p><p>I also say to you, Prem Prasado, Don’t let a chance like this go by.
We are making every effort here to wake up your woman, to wake up your
consciousness, to wake up your grace, to wake up your beauty. Don’t let
a chance like this go by.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM AFRAID TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION FOR I FEEL YOUR ANSWER COULD
REALLY DESTROY ME. YOUR SWORD IS SO SHARP THESE DAYS THAT EVEN THE SOUND
OF THE “WHOOSH” CAN MAKE ME TREMBLE, BUT I MUST ASK NO MATTER WHAT. WHY
DON’T YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Patipada, I am not answering your questions deliberately. First,
you have been part of the gang which destroyed the commune. You were
aware of many things; you never came to me to tell about them. You were
aware even that my personal physician was being poisoned, that efforts
were being made to kill Vivek, my caretaker.</p><p><br></p><p>You remained part of the gang, a small group which wanted to have
absolute power in the commune. And anybody who was not with them their
argument was, was against them. You knew everything, still you never
came to tell me. Even when I started speaking, you could have written
questions informing me about all these things. You never did that.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, when Sheela left with her small criminal group you
also left the commune, writing to me in a letter, “Osho our paths are
parting and perhaps I will never be able to see you again.” You may have
forgotten your letter; I don’t forget so easily. I can forgive – I have
forgiven you – but I cannot forget. And you have been here since that
letter, twice; you came to Bombay, you have come here.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are afraid, not because I am going to destroy you – you are
afraid because I am going to expose you.</p><p>That’s why I have not been answering your questions, because you have
not even offered an apology to me. And you owe an apology not only to
me, but to the whole commune.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND NOW THE MOMENT HAS
COME THAT I AM FORCED TO LEAVE. TO BE HONEST, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT
I WOULD LEAVE. MY WHOLE BEING IS SHAKING. MY HEART IS BROKEN AND MY EYES
ARE FULL OF TEARS, BUT NOTHING CAN TAKE AWAY WHAT I FEEL IN YOUR
PRESENCE. I AM NOT GOOD AT EXPRESSING WHAT I FEEL; IT IS JUST A FEELING
OF THANKFULNESS. THANKS, OSHO, FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME
TO STAY IN YOUR HOUSE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIFT, AND ESPECIALLY
THANK YOU FOR BEING SO COMPASSIONATE WITH ME.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyan Aum, there is no need to be full of tears because you have to
go. Always remember that every going is a beginning of coming back;
otherwise how will you come? So rather than emphasizing going, always
emphasize coming. Go laughing, and if you love tears then the tears have
to be of joy. Just for your laughter I will tell a joke.</p><p><br></p><p>A young lady finds herself to be pregnant. Luckily she has a friend
who is a surgeon in a hospital. “Don’t you worry,” says the friend, “I
will help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>So she goes to the hospital to give birth to her baby. A Catholic
priest who went to the hospital to have a gall bladder operation is very
astonished to wake up from the operation with a newborn baby beside him.
With some reluctance he finally accepts the surgeon’s explanation that
it is his baby.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end he takes the child home and raises it as his child. When
he comes to die he calls the now grown-up child to his deathbed and
says, “My child, before I die I must tell you the truth. You have always
believed that I am your father; I am not. In fact I am your mother. Your
father is the bishop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
Love is the Master Key
21 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 65. avadhu bhule ko ghar lawe HE IS DEAR TO ME INDEED
WHO CAN CALL BACK THE WANDERER TO HIS HOME.
IN THE HOME IS THE TRUE UNION, IN THE HOME IS ENJOYMENT OF LIFE: WHY SHOULD I FORSAKE MY HOME AND WANDER IN THE FOREST?
IF BRAHMA HELPS ME TO REALIZE TRUTH,</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Please Wake Up
31 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU TELL US THE PATHS ARE OF WILL AND SURRENDER. THE PATH OF WILL IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME, BUT THEN SURRENDER ALSO DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PERFECT. NOW, WHAT TO DO? BELOVED MASTER, I AM TOTALLY CONFUSED. KINDLY SHOW ME MY PATH.
THE FIRST THING: if you are really totally confused, out of that confusion will come clarity.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
So Far, So Good
22 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question;
The question is from Veereshwar.… Question 1
MANY PEOPLE IN THE WEST ARE ENGAGED IN THE CREATION OF A SCIENCE OR TECHNOLOGY OF ENLIGHTENMENT. THE NEED IS CERTAINLY THERE, BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THE POSSIBILITY? IS IT IRRESPONSIBLE TO ENGAGE IN ITS CREATION WITHOUT HAVING REACHED THE STATE OF ENLIGHTENMENT?</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
And Home Is Not Far Away
23 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
1. 79 tirath men to sab pani hai THERE IS NOTHING BUT WATER AT THE HOLY BATHING PLACES;
AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE USELESS, FOR I HAVE BATHED IN THEM.
THE IMAGES ARE ALL LIFELESS, THEY CANNOT SPEAK; I KNOW, FOR I HAVE CRIED ALOUD TO THEM.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Religion Is Individual Flowering
24 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY DO YOU REFER TO GOD AS ‘HE’? THE IS-NESS, THE LIFE ENERGY, THE TOTALITY, THE UNKNOWABLE... WELL, WOULDN’T IT BE CLEARER TO CALL GOD ‘IT’? WHAT BUGS ME ABOUT THE ‘HE’ IS THAT ‘HE’ IMPLIES A PERSONALITY, A WILL, A JUDGMENTAL AUTHORITY, AND MY ABILITY TO LOVE IS CRIPPLED ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT OBSTACLE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
I Sing The Glory Of Forms
25 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I.98. Sadho, sahajai kaya sodho
O SADHU! PURIFY YOUR BODY IN THE SIMPLE WAY. AS THE SEED IS WITHIN THE BANYAN TREE,
AND WITHIN THE SEED ARE THE FLOWERS, THE FRUITS, AND THE SHADE;
SO THE GERM IS WITHIN THE BODY,
AND WITHIN THAT GERM IS THE BODY AGAIN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Inner Trinity
26 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE STEINER SCHOOL OF ANTHROPOSOPHY TEACHES ONE TO HAVE A STRONG WILL. THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL EASTERN THOUGHT. WHAT IS THIS WILL? HOW DOES THIS WILL RELATE TO THE EGO?
THE EAST AND THE WEST, up to now, have worked as polar opposites – the west through the will, the east through surrender; the west through the ego, the east through absolute egolessness.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
A Harmony Of Love And Renunciation
27 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 107. calat mansa acal kinhi
I HAVE STILLED MY RESTLESS MIND, AND MY HEART IS RADIANT:
FOR IN THATNESS I HAVE SEEN BEYOND THATNESS, IN COMPANY I HAVE SEEN THE COMRADE HIMSELF. LIVING IN BONDAGE, I HAVE SET MYSELF FREE:
I HAVE BROKEN AWAY FROM THE CLUTCH OF ALL NARROWNESS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
God Still Hopes
28 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IS THERE LIFE AFTER DEATH?
THIS IS A WRONG QUESTION, basically meaningless. One should never jump ahead of oneself: there is every possibility that you will fall on your face. One should ask the basic question, one should begin at the beginning. My suggestion is: ask a more basic question.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Heaven Is All The Way To Heaven
29 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 126. murali bajat akhand sadaya
THE FLUTE OF THE INFINITE IS PLAYED WITHOUT CEASING, AND ITS SOUND IS LOVE:
WHEN LOVE RENOUNCES ALL LIMITS, IT REACHES TRUTH.
HOW WIDELY THE FRAGRANCE SPREADS!
IT HAS NO END, NOTHING STANDS IN ITS WAY. THE FORM OF THIS MELODY IS BRIGHT</description>

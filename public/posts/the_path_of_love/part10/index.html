THE PATH OF WILL IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME, BUT THEN SURRENDER ALSO DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PERFECT. NOW, WHAT TO DO? BELOVED MASTER, I AM TOTALLY CONFUSED. KINDLY SHOW ME MY PATH.\nTHE FIRST THING: if you are really totally confused, out of that confusion will come clarity. But you are not totally confused. Once confusion is total, it becomes the path. Then there is no need for any other path. We seek paths out of confusion, because we are confused... but not totally confused, and we think that we can figure things out. Total confusion means now you are totally helpless, now there is no way to go, now you don’t know anything about the goal, about yourself, about the Way. You know nothing. You are in a state of blank. If confusion is total, mind becomes blank. But you are never totally confused – partially, certainly; totally, never.\nTotal confusion is one of the ways to reach God. It means all your knowledge has proved meaningless; and when I say all, I mean all. Not that you say, “I know a little bit. This much is right. This much is true.” Total confusion means you are in a tremendous dark night of the soul. There is no light available, and there even seems to be no possibility. You are hopeless. There is no hope. The future has disappeared, the past has proved meaningless. The anguish has come to the utter peak. From that very peak, mind disappears – because mind can continue only if you are partially confused. Mind cannot exist in a total confusion. In fact, mind cannot exist in anything which is total.\n152\nTotal love – mind disappears. Total will – mind disappears. Total surrender – mind disappears. Totality is against mind; they never exist together. Total confusion – mind disappears.\nTry to understand this: that confusion can remain only if it is not total. Mind can remain only if you are not totally in anything. Be total in anything whatsoever, and mind cannot cling to you even for a single moment. But you have used the word ‘totally’ just to emphasize; you don’t know the meaning of it.\nA totally confused person cannot even ask this question. How will he ask? How will he articulate a question? A question arises out of knowledge. A totally confused person will come to me, will look at me with empty eyes, with mad eyes; he cannot formulate a question. The questioner means the mind; the questioner means you are still clinging to certain knowledge. You are still hoping that a path can be found, that somebody can show you the path. You still think yourself capable – that you will be able to find some way to get out of it. Your desperation is not UTTER. Your anguish is not perfect.\nIf you cannot think that will is your path, and you cannot think that surrender is your path, then I will say: confusion seems to be natural to you – let that be your path. But be confused totally. Don’t be halfheartedly in it. Be so totally confused that nothing of knowledge remains in you – no certainty, no security, no scripture, no religion, no belief. And I say it to you because I myself worked on the way of confusion.\nOf course, when the total confusion comes closer to you, you will become more and more mad. You will not know what is what. Then courage will be needed: tremendous courage is needed. Sufis call it a technique: “the technique of confusion”. Confusion uproots everything that you know, leads you into emptiness, a darkness. When all knowledge is dropped, how can confusion remain? Just listen to it.\nYou come to me, you believe in God, and I say there is no God; then there is confusion – not because I have said there is no God, but because you believe that there is God. Now there are two conflicting things in you: “There is God” a part of you says, another part has become convinced with me that there is no God. Hence, confusion. Confusion means conflict. Confusion means you have two sorts of knowledge which are going diametrically opposite, which are pulling you apart.\nFor the future the technique of confusion is going to become more and more important. It was never so important in the past, because a Hindu was born a Hindu and he never bothered about Christians and Mohammedans and Parsis and Jainas. From the very beginning he knew that he was right, and everybody else was wrong. A Mohammedan was a Mohammedan, and he knew the truth is in the Koran and everything else is just nonsense. The Christian was a Christian, and he knew the way went through Christ and there is no other way; all other ways go to hell.\nIt was absolute certainty, based in ignorance; and I am not in support of it. But there was no confusion. There was certainty and everybody was happy with his certainty. Certainty is very dangerous – nobody has achieved truth through certainty. But people were more comfortable, it was more convenient. Mediocre, stupid minds felt very good; they know. The very idea that we know, and that we are in the right, and everybody else is in the wrong, is a great protection. It leads you nowhere, because unless one moves through confusion, clarity never comes.\nClarity is not certainty. Certainty is not clarity. Certainty is a blind belief. The world has lived in certainty, but now that is no more possible. That comfort is no more available. The world has become smaller and smaller and smaller; it is a global village now. The Hindu has to know about the Christian; there is no way to avoid it. The Christian has to know about the Hindu. People can read, people can listen to the radio, can see the TV. People have become more capable of knowledge, and knowledge has exploded from everywhere. Now all this knowledge is creating confusion: “Who is right?”\nMohammedans, Christians, Jews, believe in only one life. There was no confusion before; that was THE TRUTH. Now it is very difficult. Even for an idiotic Christian, it is very difficult to continue to believe in one life – because millions of Hindus, millions of Buddhists, Jainas, Sikhs; half the world is not a small matter. Half the world says there is rebirth, reincarnation. Now it is impossible not to listen to this other half, and they also have their reasonings. Confusion arises.\nConfusion means: now you have become available to all sorts of knowledge. And when you come toe, certainly! – then you will be more and more confused! One day I speak on the Mohammedans, another day I speak on the Jews, another day on Buddhists, Hindus, Jainas, and I continue. I am making all secret sources of knowledge available to you. It is natural; you will become confused. But don’t be in a hurry.\nConfusion is being used here as a technique, and confusion is going to become the most important technique in the coming world. Because now there is no way to move back into your tunnels and become a Hindu and blind to everything else, and become a Jew, blind to everything else; there is no way now. It is impossible for a Christian to deny Buddha, and when Buddha comes in, of course your belief in Jesus starts wavering. Even Buddhists have now to trust that Christ is also somewhere near – he may not be exactly at the center, but somewhere near. He may not be a Buddha, but is at least a bodhisattva; a Buddha potentially, very close. But then there are troubles: then the whole of Jesus – his attitude, his approach, his philosophy, his way of life – is so contradictory to the Buddha’s. Buddha sits silently under his tree, unconcerned about the world. Jesus is very much concerned, very much involved with the world; it is not just an accident that the Jews had to kill him. And it is not just an accident that Buddha was not killed by Hindus. He was not doing anything, he was just sitting under his bodhi tree, meditating. But Jesus was meddling with the social affairs: the politics, organization, society, church, religion. He was going to destroy the whole structure; he was a revolutionary. He had to be killed.\nNow there is Jesus, there is Buddha, there is Krishna. Krishna is another dimension: Buddha is sitting under his tree, Krishna is playing on his flute. You cannot imagine Buddha playing on a flute. Jesus is hanging on the cross, and Krishna is dancing with so many girlfriends. Such diverse dimensions have become available together; now you are confused.\nBut to me, confusion is more valuable than certainty. Certainty is mediocre, certainty is stupid. Certainty simply means that you don’t know. Only a person who is very ignorant can be certain.\nOnce it happened: Somebody was talking to Voltaire and he mentioned a name, the name of a very famous theologian, philosopher, and the man who was talking about this theologian said to Voltaire that he knew everything. Voltaire looked surprised and said, “Is he so stupid to know everything?”\nA wise man hesitates. A wise man cannot be so certain. A wise man knows the multiplicity of life. A wise man knows the multidimensional existence. A wise man knows that all that we know is nothing in comparison to that which remains to be known. The unknown is always more than the known. The known is just like a grain of sand; Buddha has said so. “Whatsoever I know,” he says, “Is just like a grain of sand, and whatsoever I don’t know is the whole sand of the earth, of all the Ganges,” of all the rivers, of all the seas.\nCertainty is not something valuable. It is comfortable, true; so is stupidity comfortable. An idiot seems to be the most blessed man. Why? – he has no confusion, he has really no mind to be confused. He has such a tiny flicker of intelligence that he cannot afford confusion. The greater the intelligence, the greater you can afford confusion. Hence I say this age is the age of confusion, because this age is the age of intelligence.\nThe old certainty is gone and the old foolishness too – and good! And I hope it is gone for good. Confusion has entered; this is the first step towards clarity. If you really are courageous, you will question everything that you know, and you will question ABSOLUTELY. And you should not be very soft about it. You should question everything that you know, and through questioning, all that you know is eliminated. And don’t be in a hurry to be certain, otherwise you will not be able to question. Your questioning will become dishonest. If your questioning is honest, then it has to go to the very core of your being.\nA seeker of truth becomes a fire, a thirst, a great hunger. He puts his whole life at stake. Of course, he has to take the risk of being confused; he will be confused. But if you persist, and you don’t cling to something just for clarity, just for certainty, just to be comfortable; if you don’t cling to something, if your search is authentic, one day you will see – all has disappeared.\nFirst comes confusion; confusion cuts the roots of your knowledge. Once all knowledge has disappeared, confusion also disappears – because confusion cannot exist without knowledge. You believe in God and somebody says there is no God, and your belief was just a belief, and you drop the beliefYou say, “Okay, I will now believe only when I know, and I have not known yet. So good:\nthis man who says there is no God has helped me to get rid of a belief that was only a belief and not my own experience, borrowed. I drop it.”\nIf you drop the beliefI am not saying to start believing that there is no God, because then again\nyou will be confused some day. Then you can come to somebody else who is tremendously happy, prayerful: his very vibe says that there is more to life. And he says there is God, and God has happened to him – again you will be confused. Now you were clinging to the belief that there is no God, and here comes this man. No, don’t cling to any belief. Drop all belief. Remain in that vacuum of no belief, neither in God nor in no God. No belief – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, theistic, atheistic; no belief – then who can confuse you? How can you be confused? Somebody brings some news; you will say, “Thank you. I will ponder over it, I will meditate over it. I don’t believe anything, so there is no question of getting confused.”\nIf confusion is used totally, your beliefs will disappear, it will clear the whole ground. And in that state of no belief, confusion becomes impossible. When confusion becomes impossible there arises a clarity, and that clarity is not of belief, not of scripture, not of belonging to a church, not of comfort, not of convenience, not produced by anybody. It is your own transparency of awareness. And through that clarity is truth.\nYou say, “I am totally confused.” Sorry, I cannot agree with you. In fact, you are asking me to give you something so that you can drop your confusion and can become certain again. No, I am not your enemy. I will not give you any belief. I am ready to give myself, but I will not give you any belief. I am ready to partake with you my own experience, I am ready to share my being, but I will not give you any belief. I will not make you comfortable because this will be death. Your home has not yet arrived, and somebody makes you comfortable by the side of the road and gives you a tranquilizer, and you are dreaming, sleeping, and thinking this is your home and everything is beautiful – no, I am not going to do that to you. That’s what your priests and popes have been doing up to now.\nI am going to shake you and shock you out of your tranquility, out of your certainty. I am to create a stir in you. I will come like a cyclone. I am to destroy your mind utterly. Only if you are ready for that destruction will creativity be born to you.\nYou say, “You tell us the paths are of will and surrender. The path of will is certainly not for me.” How do you know? How have you become so certain that the path of will is not for you? Try first, be experimental. One learns through trial and error – and there is no other way. Don’t be A PRIORI: don’t say from the very beginning, “This is not for me, and I am certain,” otherwise you will again be confused. Some day you will find somebody who has attained through the path of will, and you will see the flowering and the fragrance of the person, and you will start feeling, “Maybe the path of will is for me too... this man has achieved.” Your greed will arise. You will be again confused.\nThis is the way you create the possibility for confusion. Don’t say, “The path of will is certainly not for me” – because you have not tried yet. Try it. If you try the path of will nothing is going to be wrong. If you succeed, good. If you don’t succeed, that too is good. Then you have known at least one thing: that this is not for you. That too is a great achievement: to know, “This door is not for me.” Otherwise sometimes one goes on knocking on a wrong door.\nOnce a man came to me and he said, “Beloved Master, one dream constantly recurs, and it has become nightmarish, and I have come to you to help me out of this problem”\nI said, “What is your dream?”\nHe said, “Since my childhood” – now he is almost fifty – “it comes again and again, almost once or twice a month. And it is such that I don’t see any way out of it. The dream is simple: I am standing at a door, a very beautifully carved wooden door – it must be of a palace – and I knock, and my whole being says to somehow enter into this palace – a great urge. But nobody answers. Then I start pushing the door, I do as much as I can. I start perspiring. The effort becomes hectic, and uncertainty arises in me that it is not going to open again, so again I have failed. some unconscious desire to enter, and the futility of it... and then I wake up, trembling, perspiring. My breathing is not natural – disturbed. And then I cannot sleep for at least two hours. I think about it: why this dream?”\nI asked the man, “Can you remember? Is there any sign on the door?”\nHe said, “Yes, there is a sign! But I never thought about it. How did you come to know there is a sign?”\n“And what does it say?”\nAnd the man closed his eyes and he started laughing. He said, “This is just incredible! The sign says: Pull. And I have been pushing!”\nSo I said, “Next time the dream comes, follow the sign.”\nAfter two, three months, he came and he said, “I am waiting and waiting and the dream is not coming.”\nI said, “It may not come, because the purpose is fulfilled. You have become alert, you have become aware of it.”\nTry the path of will; maybe it is for you, maybe it is not for you. I cannot say offhand that it is for you or that it is not for you – because if I say and you believe me, you will be creating a possibility of confusion some day. Don’t believe me. You try. What is wrong in it? Be a little more playful, it is a beautiful sport: try the path of will.\nWhy do you say, “Certainly it is not for me:? How can you be certain? This trick of becoming certain without knowing has to be dropped, completely dropped. Try. If you succeed, good. If you don’t succeed, then too you have succeeded, because then the remaining thing is the path of surrender. If you fail on the path of will, then more hopefully, with more energy, with more totality, you can move on the path of surrender. If you don’t try on the path of will, you may move on the path of surrender, but you will always remain suspicious as to whether this is your path or not.\nSo first thing: never decide without experimentation. Be scientific. Everything is a hypothesis; try it. It can be valid only by experience, it may prove invalid only by experience. There is no other way to decide. Let the decision come out of your existential experience. And then you say, “But surrender also does not seem to be perfect.” But how can anything be perfect if you are not perfect? The surrender is going to be your surrender, not mine. The surrender is going to be yours, not Meera’s or Mahavira’s. The surrender is going to be yours, not Krishna’s or Christ’s. The surrender, of course, is bound to be of the same quality as you are.\nThe path of will or the path of surrender are not like superhighways where anybody can walk and the way remains the same. No, the way changes with the walker. You bring your quality. For example, if you see a Picasso painting... you can use the same brush, and the same colors, and the same canvas, but are you hoping that a Picasso will be born? The painting will be yours. The brush and the canvas may be Picasso’s. You can even ask permission to paint in his studio, but then too the painting will be yours; it will not be a Picasso.\nExactly like that, when you move on any path, the path is not a collective possession. Each individual has to create his own path while walking on it.\nYour surrender is going to be your surrender. It will be as perfect as you are. Don’t expect more, otherwise, from the beginning, you are creating obstacles for your growth. And in fact, the path is perfect only when you have arrived, never before it. But then the path is not needed.\nSo everybody has to walk on an imperfect path, because everybody is imperfect. And why ask for perfection? Your demands are too much. You go to the chemist: you don’t ask for a perfect\nmedicine. You ask for the latest and the best, not for the perfect – because the perfect never exists. Tomorrow a better medicine may come and this medicine will be discarded. Every month medicines are being discarded, new ones are being invented; but no medicine is perfect, and cannot be. Perfection means now there is no possibility to grow. Perfection means death. Perfection means now everything is finished, the full point has come.\nLife is a process; it is not perfect. Nothing is perfect in life. Everything is imperfect. So the most you can ask is: “Which is the more perfect way” – that’s all; not THE perfect way, but the more perfect, comparatively. The path of will maybe is not so perfect for you as surrender, but if you are making an absolute demand that it be a hundred percent perfect, then from the very beginning you are too greedy. Move slowly. Your path is your path. The path will change you, and you will change the path – and this is going to be a dynamic process, a dialectical process. You will change the path by your change, and then the path will change you, and you are both going to enrich each other. When Meera walks on the path of surrender, of course it is going to be more perfect than when you walk. When Mahavira walks on the path of will, it is going to be more perfect than when you walk.\nAnd one thing more: we come to know only when Meera has arrived. Then the fragrance spreads. When Mahavira has reached, then the rumor spreads around the world that somebody has become enlightened. Then people rush. When they come to see, it is a perfect thing: Picasso has done his work, the painting is perfect. But you don’t know: Mahavira had moved just like you – wavering, in uncertainty, confusion, going astray, coming back, doing a thousand and one mistakes. But you don’t know THAT Mahavira – that Mahavira who was struggling in darkness, alone. Now Mahavira has arrived and has become a light; now everybody comes to see and pay his respects. But Mahavira had also moved the same way – with the same limitations. When we know Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Zarathustra, they have become perfect souls, SIDDHAS. Then we know. We had not known their seeking stages.\nRemember, you are not a siddha; otherwise what is the point in seeking? You have not yet arrived, you are arriving. Choose the best that is possible, don’t hanker for the perfect. Otherwise you may never move. If you are waiting for the perfect airplane to come and then you will go, you may never go – because they are being perfected every day. Don’t wait for the perfect train. Whatsoever is available, choose the best. Be choosy. Think, meditate about it, find out the pros and cons, but don’t wait for the perfect.\nAnd start. In the beginning, great things are not going to happen. But... those great things can happen only if you being. To begin with, anything is okay. You start. Move. Your feet will be faltering, your body may not be adjusted. Just like when a small child starts walking; how many times does he fall? How many times does he again try, waver, then by and by become strong of foot? That’s how one moves into the eternal, too.\nOne thing: this movement is not towards some outer goal. This movement is towards some inner goal which is, in essence, already there. So you ask me, “Now, what to do?” Only one thing do I say... and let me tell you one beautiful story. Listen to it very carefully. It is a story from Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most metaphysical writers of this age.\nEpisode of the Enemy\nSo many years on the run, expectant, and now the enemy stood at my door. From the window I saw him working his way up the hill. Laboring along the steep road, he leaned on a staff, a clumsy staff which in his hands was no more than an old man’s cane, not a weapon. Although I was waiting for it, his knock was so weak, I barely made it out. At the door I fumbled with the key to let the man in. I feared he was going to collapse all at once, but he took a few faltering steps and stumbled, utterly worn out, onto my bed.\nI bent over him so that he could hear me: “One believes that the years pass for one,” I said to him, “but they pass for everyone else too. Here we meet, at last, face to face, and what happened before has no meaning now.” While I spoke, he unbuttoned his overcoat. His right hand was in the pocket of his suit coat; something there was aimed at me, and I knew it was a revolver.\nThen he told me, in an unwavering voice, “To get myself into your house I fell back on your pity. Now I have you at my mercy, and I am unforgiving.” I tried to get out some words; I am not a strong man and only words could save me. I managed to utter, “It is true that a long time ago I ill-treated a certain boy, but you are no longer that boy, and I am no longer that callous brute. Besides, revenge is no less vain and ridiculous than forgiving.”\n“That’s just it,” he replied. “Because I am no longer that boy, I am about to kill you. This has nothing to do with revenge. This is an act of justice. Your arguments, Borges, are only strategems of your terror designed to keep me from my mission. There is nothing you can do now.”\n“There is one thing I can do,” I said. “What is that?” he asked.\n“Wake up,” I said.\nAnd I did.\nThe whole life that you are acquainted with is nothing but a dream – a nightmare, true. The enemy and the friend, both are parts of a dream; the surrender and the will, both are parts of the dream; theories, philosophies, dogmas, churches, are parts of the dream, the human dream. The only thing that has to be done is: please wake up. And nobody can make you awake... unless you decide. It is your decision. There is no need to hanker anymore for outer beliefs to cling to, because all beliefs are false. There is no need to seek a philosophy of life; life is enough. All philosophies are false, including my philosophy. When I say ALL, I mean all. Wake up! Please wake up! That’s all that can be said.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nI WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY HYPOCRITES HERE AMONGST YOUR SANNYASINS, AND THAT IS PREVENTING ME. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nMy answer is through a small anecdote.\n“Why don’t you attend church?” asked the village parson of the local innkeeper. “I don’t go,” he replied frankly, “because there are so many hypocrites there.”\n“Please don’t let that stop you,” said the parson. “There’s always room for one more.” The third question:\nQuestion 3\nI HAVE DONE VERY MANY GROUPS, AND HAD MANY PERTINENT GROWTH EXPERIENCES IN WHICH I HAVE REALLY FELT THAT I HAD CHANGED AND GAINED TREMENDOUS NEW INSIGHT. BUT I STILL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES, AND DESPITE EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE, STILL REPEAT THE PAST AS IF I HAVE NO CHOICE. WHAT TO DO? CAN CHANGE BE PERMANENT? OR IS THE WORK WE DO ON OURSELVES SIMPLY ILLUSION, SIGNIFYING NOTHING? CAN SANNYAS BE PERMANENT CHANGE?\nFirst: all efforts to improve yourself are bound to fail, because the one who is making the effort is the problem – the ego. The ego is constantly making efforts to improve: have more money, have a bigger house, have a bigger car, have a more beautiful woman, or a husband; have this, have that. That is ego. You understand it.\nBut then the ego plays another game too: it says, “Become more peaceful, become more loving, attain to meditation, become a SIDDHA, be like a Buddha.” This again is the same game in another direction. The same ego that was trying to decorate itself by outer things, now wants to try and decorate itself through inner things.\nSo the first thing: if YOU are trying to improve yourself, you are doomed to fail. Once you understand this – that the ego is the problem, and it is the ego’s greed that wants to improve and become this and that; the VERY idea of becoming is a projection of the ego – then comes revolution. And that revolution is nothing that you have to do anything about, that revolution comes through understanding the ways of the ego. Once you have understood that it is the same ego that was after money, after power, prestige, politics – the same ego is now playing inner games of meditation, enlightenment, and all that nonsense – once you recognize it is the same ego, in that very recognition, a laughter arises in you. You start feeling the ridiculousness of it.\nThere is no improvement. I am not saying there is no mutation, but there is no improvement. Mutation is there, UTTER change is there, but no improvement. Improvement means a modified form: you remain the same with a few more plus things added to you – a car, a big house, a woman. You remain the same; now a woman is attached to you, a car is attached to you... you remain the same. Now you have become a meditator – you remain the same; now you have become a sannyasin – but you remain the same; deep down you remain the same. And you go on accumulating things: qualities, characteristics, character, morality, virtue, knowledge. You go on, but deep down it is the same old trip. Nothing is new. This way, improvement is not possible.\nImprovement is not possible at all. When you understand this – this greed, this hankering to be somebody else, someone else more important, more significant, greater and greater; once you\nhave understood that this is all ego playing – in that moment of understanding, suddenly there is mutation, a jump, a quantum leap. You are no more the old, the new has entered.\nAnd remember, the new is not connected with the old at all. That’s why I don’t say it is an improvement. The new is so absolutely new, so utterly new, that it has nothing to do with the old. The old man is completely gone. It is a totally new being, discontinuous with the past. With this gap, it cannot be called improvement.\nSpirituality is not an achievement. It is not an ambitious trip.\nYou say, “I have done very many groups and had many pertinent growth experiences.” Those growth experiences were not pertinent. They were just games of the ego. You felt good. The ego patted you and said, “Good boy; doing so good. You are going to improve. One day it is certain you are going to become a Buddha or a Christ. You are on the way, and going so beautifully.” And you felt very good. Those experiences were not pertinent. Your ego used them. They became absolutely dangerous. Anything that the ego uses is immediately poisoned. You started feeling very happy: “So now it is happening!” You must have started waiting for SATORI, SAMADHI: “Now it is not very far away! Any moment.”\nYour ego reduced all those experiences to toys: you started playing with them. And you must have started expecting them more and more. You have become virtuous, religious; now these things will be happening more and more. Remember, whenever you start asking, “This thing has been beautiful; I was delighted in it, and I would like to have it again,” now you are trying to make a continuity.\nThe new can happen only when you are not. Now you will not leave yourself at all; you will always be sitting there. Even if you go through those same groups again, you will not be enriched, because you will be waiting: “Now this is going to happen.” And when you wait nothing happens, because in your waiting you are there. Things happen unexpectedly. Things happen when you are not even waiting for them. God is seen sometimes only when you are not looking for Him, because when you are looking you are tense. God happens in such mundane and trivial moments that you could not have expected. Whenever you are expecting, you are there; and God cannot be there because YOU are there. When you are not expecting – just swimming in a river, and the trees, and the birds, and the sunlight, and you are completely lost.and of course, nobody waits for God to happen in that\nmoment – suddenly He is there. You are doing nothing but playing with your cat, looking into the cat’s eyes – and of course, you are not waiting for something great to happen – and suddenly those eyes of the cat change, and there is depth, and there is God. And suddenly you are overwhelmed.\nGod is always sudden, unexpected. When you are doing your PUJA, and ringing your small bell, and doing things like that, God never happens – because you are so full of expectation. You are waiting and looking to the side: “Has He come or not?” A knock on the door, maybe just a postman, and you are so much excited: “Maybe God has come!” When you are waiting He never comes, because when you are waiting YOU are too much. He comes only when you are not.\n“I have done very many groups, and had many pertinent growth experiences in which I have really felt that I had changed and gained tremendous new insight.”\nI, I, I.you see?\n“But I still make the same mistakes, and despite everything I have done, still repeat the past as if I have no choice.”\nI, I, I.…\nYou will make the same mistakes because it is the same I. You cannot hope that anything else is going to happen.\nThe I is a mechanism; it goes on doing the same thing, it has become very efficient in doing it. It is like a computer: it creates habits, and then it goes on repeating the same habits. Now please, stop any idea of growth. This is not the way. Forget about growth, because growth is in the future. Growth is already a postponement: tomorrow it is going to happen. Forget all about tomorrow; tomorrow never comes. Be here now. This moment is the only moment there is. Enjoy this moment in total absorption. Whatsoever you are doing, do it totally, be lost in it. What it is, I am not saying. If you are lost in it, it becomes worship, it becomes prayer.\nCleaning the floor can become a prayer; just doing ordinary things in your kitchen can become a prayer; digging a hole in the garden can become a prayer. There is no need to go to any temple. Only those go to the temple who don’t know how to bring prayer to their lives. There is no need to go to a mosque or a GURUDWARA, because God is everywhere. Wherever you are totally absorbed, the door of the temple opens.\n“Can change be permanent? Or is the work we do on ourselves simply illusion signifying nothing?”\nThat which you do is illusory, because you are an illusion. Out of you, only illusions are born. You cannot give birth to truth. YOU are temporal; out of you the timeless cannot be born. You have to give way, you have to put yourself aside. Only you are standing in your own way, nobody else. God is available; just don’t stand in the way.\nAre you listening?\nDon’t stand in the way of God, that’s all. And then He is in the flower, and in the bird on the wing; then He is in the breeze passing through the trees. When you are not there to distort, you will find Him everywhere – because He is everything. It is a miracle how we go on missing Him. But you are asking for something permanent. The ego can never be permanent; it is a momentary thing. And out of the ego, whatsoever you gain will be lost.\nYou are asking: Cannot a wave be made permanent?\nThe wave cannot be made permanent. The only way is to freeze it so it becomes ice. But then it is not a wave, it is just a piece of ice. Then it is no more a wave because it cannot wave. The aliveness is gone, the dynamism is gone. You fall in love with a woman and you want to make the love permanent? Then you are in danger; you are trying to make a wave permanent. You go to the court, and the court puts a seal on your marriage. Now it is a legal thing: love has disappeared. Now it is a contract, and ugly.\nLove is the most beautiful thing in the world, and marriage, the most ugly, because law has entered into love. Why do you go to the court? Because you want to make love permanent: “Who knows?\nThis woman may fall in love with somebody else tomorrow” – now the court will protect. “Who knows? This man may escape” – now the court will protect: you can drag him to the court. He cannot easily escape. What are you doing when you are marrying a woman or a man? You are asking society to protect, asking the law, the policeman, to protect. What kind of love is this in which a policeman is needed to protect you? This will be a sort of prison. Call it whatsoever you would like to call it, but it will be a bondage. You will be prisoners of each other, and this is how we destroy everything.\nEgo is impermanent. If your love is out of the ego, it is impermanent. The mind is temporary, temporal. Mind, in fact, is time. Nothing can be permanent in the mind. If you want to look at the permanent – ‘permanent’ is not the right word, ‘eternal’ is the right word – then look deeper into the wave, and there is ocean. If you want to look to some eternal, look into love deeply and you will find God there. But you bring the policeman rather than searching for God.\nWhen love is happening, don’t hanker for permanency. Think and brood, meditate, contemplate... the eternal. Those moments are rare, love moments. Windows open easily, melting happens easily. You are dazed with something unknown. Don’t bother about marriage right now. Right now go into those moments, waves, and find the ocean – because wherever there is a wave, there is bound to be an ocean behind it. When the love-wave is there, the love-ocean must be behind it. That ocean of love is God.\nSo please don’t seek the permanent, otherwise you will always be frustrated. Because the one who is seeking permanence is impermanent himself. You have chosen a wrong medium: the mind, the ego. Look into your own being.\n“Can sannyas be a permanent change?” Again you go on using a very dirty word,‘permanent’. Sannyas is both the wave and the ocean; it depends on you. If you simply see the wave, it is impermanent. If you look deep into it and you can find the ocean, it is eternal. The eternal is not permanent, the eternal is beyond time.’Permanent’ means staying longer in time; but what does it matter whether you are a sannyasin for one day or one year or one thousands years – what does it matter? The impermanent is impermanent – one day, one year, one thousand years.\nSeek something which is beyond time. Then once it is there you know: it has always been there, and it will be always there. The eternal is your innermost nature, SWABHAVA. It is your innermost being.\nWhatsoever you are seeking, it should not be out of greed and out of ambition. It should not be a desire to repeat. Forget the past. As it disappears, let it disappear and don’t think of the morrow. As it has not come yet, why bother? When it comes, we will be here to look into it. And whatsoever has happened yesterday, don’t ask for it again today – because it may have happened yesterday because you were not waiting for it; today you are waiting for it.\nIt happens every day in meditation. Somebody comes to an inner space and is thrilled, and the desire to repeat arises. Then next day it is not there, then he feels very frustrated. Then next day he is even more deep into his depression, because it is not coming. And he comes to me and says, “It was better before. At least I had not known it. But now I know it, it is there, and now I am suffering. Why can’t I have it again and again?” You cannot have it again and again because it is the very nature of God to happen unexpectedly. He is a guest who comes without informing you.\nThe Hindu word for guest is ATITHI: it means one who comes without giving you any date beforehand. TITHI means date, ATITHI means one who comes without informing you at all.\nGod is a guest. When He comes, feel thankful. When He does not come, feel thankful. It must be in your favor that He is not needed today, that you need a gap, that you need a plateau... so things that have happened yesterday become settled.\nA highly irascible employer was much given to uttering tirades of abuse to his long-suffering staff. One young girl stood it for so long, but when her virtue was questioned, she had had enough, and walked tight-lipped straight out of the office.\nThe following morning, she marched into the tyrannical boss’s office and thrust a piece of paper under his nose. “This is from my family doctor,” she said firmly, “and it certifies that I am pure and untouched.”\nHe glanced at it and thrust it back at her. “This is no good,” he snarled. “It is dated yesterday.”\nYes, the yesterday is yesterday; gone is gone. Who knows? You may have changed. But all character is of yesterday, all virtue is of yesterday. When you call somebody a saint, what do you mean? You say, “His yesterdays were very saintly.” But they are dated yesterday. He may have committed a sin last night. You call somebody a sinner, but that is not right; those are all yesterdays. Yes, he may have committed sins, but last night he may have prayed, he may have meditated, and he may have had a glimpse. So don’t call anybody a saint, because a saint belongs to the past; and don’t call anybody a sinner, because a sinner is of the past – and life and being is always free of the past.\nBeing is of the present. And when you want something to be repeated, again you are simply desiring for the past to be repeated. What is the point? You have known it. Don’t you want to know something higher, something greater? Remain available. That is one of my fundamental teachings: Don’t desire, remain available. Wait on God and let Him do things.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nARE WE NOT HERE TO HELP AND SERVE OTHERS IN THE WORLD?\nMy answer is an anecdote.\nI have heard about a little boy whose mother was lecturing him about selfishness. “You know, darling,” she pointed out, “we are in this world to help others.”\nThe little boy considered this for several seconds, then he asked with a great deal of seriousness, “Well then, what are the others here for?”\nYou first please look at yourself. Don’t try to become a do-gooder. These are dangerous people. In the name of doing good, they simply try to interfere with other people’s lives.\nWho are you to help others? You have not even helped yourself yet. Physician, first heal thyself.\nIt happens many times around me: you listen to me, your mind becomes more and more informed, you start gathering knowledge, and then suddenly the desire arises to help others. What you really want is just to pour your rubbish into their heads. You want to initiate people now. You want to help people to become spiritual. Please, unless you have known what I am saying, don’t try to convey it to others, because it will be a distorted form. And lies are better than half-truths; at least somebody can come to know that this is a lie and will drop it. A half-truth is very dangerous. He will never be able to detect that it is a lie because that half-truth will prevent him, and he will never be able to drop it, and he will become cluttered with it.\nFor four years the little old lady had owned the parrot, and for four long years she had fruitlessly tried to get it to talk. She had tried everything: repeating little phrases endlessly, buying bells, mirrors, and the very best food. Now she was at last at her wits’ end. In desperation she turned to the parrot and screamed, “For God’s sake, why won’t you talk!”\nThe parrot regarded her with a beady eye. “To tell you the truth,” it said suddenly, “I have always felt that it was not a good thing to go around repeating things one hears.”\nAt least be as wise as that. The last question:\nQuestion 5\nHOW, JUST IN THE PRESENCE OF A MASTER, CAN THE INNER TRANSFORMATION HAPPEN? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?\nIt is like infection, spiritual infection, healthy infection. Just as illness can be caught, so can “wellness” also be caught. Just as illness has its own vibration, a certain wavelength, so has wellness a certain vibration, its own wavelength. When you are near a spiritual person, you start vibrating in a new way. His very presence plays on the guitar of your soul. His very presence starts creating a sweetness in you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"7963","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_love/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_love/>The Path of Love</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Please Wake Up</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7963 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_Love/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark9>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>10</span></p><p><br></p><p>Please Wake Up</p><p><br></p><p>31 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>YOU TELL US THE PATHS ARE OF WILL AND SURRENDER. THE PATH OF WILL IS
CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME, BUT THEN SURRENDER ALSO DOES NOT SEEM TO BE
PERFECT. NOW, WHAT TO DO? BELOVED MASTER, I AM TOTALLY CONFUSED. KINDLY
SHOW ME MY PATH.</p><p><br></p><p>THE FIRST THING: if you are really totally confused, out of that
confusion will come clarity. But you are not totally confused. Once
confusion is total, it becomes the path. Then there is no need for any
other path. We seek paths out of confusion, because we are confused...
but not totally confused, and we think that we can figure things out.
Total confusion means now you are totally helpless, now there is no way
to go, now you don’t know anything about the goal, about yourself, about
the Way. You know nothing. You are in a state of blank. If confusion is
total, mind becomes blank. But you are never totally confused –
partially, certainly; totally, never.</p><p><br></p><p>Total confusion is one of the ways to reach God. It means all your
knowledge has proved meaningless; and when I say all, I mean all. Not
that you say, “I know a little bit. This much is right. This much is
true.” Total confusion means you are in a tremendous dark night of the
soul. There is no light available, and there even seems to be no
possibility. You are hopeless. There is no hope. The future has
disappeared, the past has proved meaningless. The anguish has come to
the utter peak. From that very peak, mind disappears – because mind can
continue only if you are partially confused. Mind cannot exist in a
total confusion. In fact, mind cannot exist in anything which is
total.</p><p><br></p><p>152</p><p>Total love – mind disappears. Total will – mind disappears. Total
surrender – mind disappears. Totality is against mind; they never exist
together. Total confusion – mind disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand this: that confusion can remain only if it is not
total. Mind can remain only if you are not totally in anything. Be total
in anything whatsoever, and mind cannot cling to you even for a single
moment. But you have used the word ‘totally’ just to emphasize; you
don’t know the meaning of it.</p><p><br></p><p>A totally confused person cannot even ask this question. How will he
ask? How will he articulate a question? A question arises out of
knowledge. A totally confused person will come to me, will look at me
with empty eyes, with mad eyes; he cannot formulate a question. The
questioner means the mind; the questioner means you are still clinging
to certain knowledge. You are still hoping that a path can be found,
that somebody can show you the path. You still think yourself capable –
that you will be able to find some way to get out of it. Your
desperation is not UTTER. Your anguish is not perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>If you cannot think that will is your path, and you cannot think that
surrender is your path, then I will say: confusion seems to be natural
to you – let that be your path. But be confused totally. Don’t be
halfheartedly in it. Be so totally confused that nothing of knowledge
remains in you – no certainty, no security, no scripture, no religion,
no belief. And I say it to you because I myself worked on the way of
confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, when the total confusion comes closer to you, you will
become more and more mad. You will not know what is what. Then courage
will be needed: tremendous courage is needed. Sufis call it a technique:
“the technique of confusion”. Confusion uproots everything that you
know, leads you into emptiness, a darkness. When all knowledge is
dropped, how can confusion remain? Just listen to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You come to me, you believe in God, and I say there is no God; then
there is confusion – not because I have said there is no God, but
because you believe that there is God. Now there are two conflicting
things in you: “There is God” a part of you says, another part has
become convinced with me that there is no God. Hence, confusion.
Confusion means conflict. Confusion means you have two sorts of
knowledge which are going diametrically opposite, which are pulling you
apart.</p><p><br></p><p>For the future the technique of confusion is going to become more and
more important. It was never so important in the past, because a Hindu
was born a Hindu and he never bothered about Christians and Mohammedans
and Parsis and Jainas. From the very beginning he knew that he was
right, and everybody else was wrong. A Mohammedan was a Mohammedan, and
he knew the truth is in the Koran and everything else is just nonsense.
The Christian was a Christian, and he knew the way went through Christ
and there is no other way; all other ways go to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>It was absolute certainty, based in ignorance; and I am not in
support of it. But there was no confusion. There was certainty and
everybody was happy with his certainty. Certainty is very dangerous –
nobody has achieved truth through certainty. But people were more
comfortable, it was more convenient. Mediocre, stupid minds felt very
good; they know. The very idea that we know, and that we are in the
right, and everybody else is in the wrong, is a great protection. It
leads you nowhere, because unless one moves through confusion, clarity
never comes.</p><p>Clarity is not certainty. Certainty is not clarity. Certainty is a
blind belief. The world has lived in certainty, but now that is no more
possible. That comfort is no more available. The world has become
smaller and smaller and smaller; it is a global village now. The Hindu
has to know about the Christian; there is no way to avoid it. The
Christian has to know about the Hindu. People can read, people can
listen to the radio, can see the TV. People have become more capable of
knowledge, and knowledge has exploded from everywhere. Now all this
knowledge is creating confusion: “Who is right?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedans, Christians, Jews, believe in only one life. There was no
confusion before; that was THE TRUTH. Now it is very difficult. Even for
an idiotic Christian, it is very difficult to continue to believe in one
life – because millions of Hindus, millions of Buddhists, Jainas, Sikhs;
half the world is not a small matter. Half the world says there is
rebirth, reincarnation. Now it is impossible not to listen to this other
half, and they also have their reasonings. Confusion arises.</p><p><br></p><p>Confusion means: now you have become available to all sorts of
knowledge. And when you come toe, certainly! – then you will be more and
more confused! One day I speak on the Mohammedans, another day I speak
on the Jews, another day on Buddhists, Hindus, Jainas, and I continue. I
am making all secret sources of knowledge available to you. It is
natural; you will become confused. But don’t be in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>Confusion is being used here as a technique, and confusion is going
to become the most important technique in the coming world. Because now
there is no way to move back into your tunnels and become a Hindu and
blind to everything else, and become a Jew, blind to everything else;
there is no way now. It is impossible for a Christian to deny Buddha,
and when Buddha comes in, of course your belief in Jesus starts
wavering. Even Buddhists have now to trust that Christ is also somewhere
near – he may not be exactly at the center, but somewhere near. He may
not be a Buddha, but is at least a bodhisattva; a Buddha potentially,
very close. But then there are troubles: then the whole of Jesus – his
attitude, his approach, his philosophy, his way of life – is so
contradictory to the Buddha’s. Buddha sits silently under his tree,
unconcerned about the world. Jesus is very much concerned, very much
involved with the world; it is not just an accident that the Jews had to
kill him. And it is not just an accident that Buddha was not killed by
Hindus. He was not doing anything, he was just sitting under his bodhi
tree, meditating. But Jesus was meddling with the social affairs: the
politics, organization, society, church, religion. He was going to
destroy the whole structure; he was a revolutionary. He had to be
killed.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is Jesus, there is Buddha, there is Krishna. Krishna is
another dimension: Buddha is sitting under his tree, Krishna is playing
on his flute. You cannot imagine Buddha playing on a flute. Jesus is
hanging on the cross, and Krishna is dancing with so many girlfriends.
Such diverse dimensions have become available together; now you are
confused.</p><p><br></p><p>But to me, confusion is more valuable than certainty. Certainty is
mediocre, certainty is stupid. Certainty simply means that you don’t
know. Only a person who is very ignorant can be certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened: Somebody was talking to Voltaire and he mentioned a
name, the name of a very famous theologian, philosopher, and the man who
was talking about this theologian said to Voltaire that he knew
everything. Voltaire looked surprised and said, “Is he so stupid to know
everything?”</p><p>A wise man hesitates. A wise man cannot be so certain. A wise man
knows the multiplicity of life. A wise man knows the multidimensional
existence. A wise man knows that all that we know is nothing in
comparison to that which remains to be known. The unknown is always more
than the known. The known is just like a grain of sand; Buddha has said
so. “Whatsoever I know,” he says, “Is just like a grain of sand, and
whatsoever I don’t know is the whole sand of the earth, of all the
Ganges,” of all the rivers, of all the seas.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainty is not something valuable. It is comfortable, true; so is
stupidity comfortable. An idiot seems to be the most blessed man. Why? –
he has no confusion, he has really no mind to be confused. He has such a
tiny flicker of intelligence that he cannot afford confusion. The
greater the intelligence, the greater you can afford confusion. Hence I
say this age is the age of confusion, because this age is the age of
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>The old certainty is gone and the old foolishness too – and good! And
I hope it is gone for good. Confusion has entered; this is the first
step towards clarity. If you really are courageous, you will question
everything that you know, and you will question ABSOLUTELY. And you
should not be very soft about it. You should question everything that
you know, and through questioning, all that you know is eliminated. And
don’t be in a hurry to be certain, otherwise you will not be able to
question. Your questioning will become dishonest. If your questioning is
honest, then it has to go to the very core of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>A seeker of truth becomes a fire, a thirst, a great hunger. He puts
his whole life at stake. Of course, he has to take the risk of being
confused; he will be confused. But if you persist, and you don’t cling
to something just for clarity, just for certainty, just to be
comfortable; if you don’t cling to something, if your search is
authentic, one day you will see – all has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>First comes confusion; confusion cuts the roots of your knowledge.
Once all knowledge has disappeared, confusion also disappears – because
confusion cannot exist without knowledge. You believe in God and
somebody says there is no God, and your belief was just a belief, and
you drop the belief<span class=s4></span>You say, “Okay, I will now
believe only when I know, and I have not known yet. So good:</p><p>this man who says there is no God has helped me to get rid of a
belief that was only a belief and not my own experience, borrowed. I
drop it.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you drop the belief<span class=s4></span>I am not saying to
start believing that there is no God, because then again</p><p>you will be confused some day. Then you can come to somebody else who
is tremendously happy, prayerful: his very vibe says that there is more
to life. And he says there is God, and God has happened to him – again
you will be confused. Now you were clinging to the belief that there is
no God, and here comes this man. No, don’t cling to any belief. Drop all
belief. Remain in that vacuum of no belief, neither in God nor in no
God. No belief – Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, theistic, atheistic; no
belief – then who can confuse you? How can you be confused? Somebody
brings some news; you will say, “Thank you. I will ponder over it, I
will meditate over it. I don’t believe anything, so there is no question
of getting confused.”</p><p><br></p><p>If confusion is used totally, your beliefs will disappear, it will
clear the whole ground. And in that state of no belief, confusion
becomes impossible. When confusion becomes impossible there arises a
clarity, and that clarity is not of belief, not of scripture, not of
belonging to a church, not of comfort, not of convenience, not produced
by anybody. It is your own transparency of awareness. And through that
clarity is truth.</p><p>You say, “I am totally confused.” Sorry, I cannot agree with you. In
fact, you are asking me to give you something so that you can drop your
confusion and can become certain again. No, I am not your enemy. I will
not give you any belief. I am ready to give myself, but I will not give
you any belief. I am ready to partake with you my own experience, I am
ready to share my being, but I will not give you any belief. I will not
make you comfortable because this will be death. Your home has not yet
arrived, and somebody makes you comfortable by the side of the road and
gives you a tranquilizer, and you are dreaming, sleeping, and thinking
this is your home and everything is beautiful – no, I am not going to do
that to you. That’s what your priests and popes have been doing up to
now.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to shake you and shock you out of your tranquility, out of
your certainty. I am to create a stir in you. I will come like a
cyclone. I am to destroy your mind utterly. Only if you are ready for
that destruction will creativity be born to you.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “You tell us the paths are of will and surrender. The path
of will is certainly not for me.” How do you know? How have you become
so certain that the path of will is not for you? Try first, be
experimental. One learns through trial and error – and there is no other
way. Don’t be A PRIORI: don’t say from the very beginning, “This is not
for me, and I am certain,” otherwise you will again be confused. Some
day you will find somebody who has attained through the path of will,
and you will see the flowering and the fragrance of the person, and you
will start feeling, “Maybe the path of will is for me too... this man
has achieved.” Your greed will arise. You will be again confused.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the way you create the possibility for confusion. Don’t say,
“The path of will is certainly not for me” – because you have not tried
yet. Try it. If you try the path of will nothing is going to be wrong.
If you succeed, good. If you don’t succeed, that too is good. Then you
have known at least one thing: that this is not for you. That too is a
great achievement: to know, “This door is not for me.” Otherwise
sometimes one goes on knocking on a wrong door.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man came to me and he said, “Beloved Master, one dream
constantly recurs, and it has become nightmarish, and I have come to you
to help me out of this problem”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What is your dream?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Since my childhood” – now he is almost fifty – “it comes
again and again, almost once or twice a month. And it is such that I
don’t see any way out of it. The dream is simple: I am standing at a
door, a very beautifully carved wooden door – it must be of a palace –
and I knock, and my whole being says to somehow enter into this palace –
a great urge. But nobody answers. Then I start pushing the door, I do as
much as I can. I start perspiring. The effort becomes hectic, and
uncertainty arises in me that it is not going to open again, so again I
have failed. some unconscious desire to enter, and the futility of it...
and then I wake up, trembling, perspiring. My breathing is not natural –
disturbed. And then I cannot sleep for at least two hours. I think about
it: why this dream?”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the man, “Can you remember? Is there any sign on the
door?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, there is a sign! But I never thought about it. How did
you come to know there is a sign?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And what does it say?”</p><p>And the man closed his eyes and he started laughing. He said, “This
is just incredible! The sign says: Pull. And I have been pushing!”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “Next time the dream comes, follow the sign.”</p><p><br></p><p>After two, three months, he came and he said, “I am waiting and
waiting and the dream is not coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It may not come, because the purpose is fulfilled. You have
become alert, you have become aware of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Try the path of will; maybe it is for you, maybe it is not for you. I
cannot say offhand that it is for you or that it is not for you –
because if I say and you believe me, you will be creating a possibility
of confusion some day. Don’t believe me. You try. What is wrong in it?
Be a little more playful, it is a beautiful sport: try the path of
will.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you say, “Certainly it is not for me:? How can you be certain?
This trick of becoming certain without knowing has to be dropped,
completely dropped. Try. If you succeed, good. If you don’t succeed,
then too you have succeeded, because then the remaining thing is the
path of surrender. If you fail on the path of will, then more hopefully,
with more energy, with more totality, you can move on the path of
surrender. If you don’t try on the path of will, you may move on the
path of surrender, but you will always remain suspicious as to whether
this is your path or not.</p><p><br></p><p>So first thing: never decide without experimentation. Be scientific.
Everything is a hypothesis; try it. It can be valid only by experience,
it may prove invalid only by experience. There is no other way to
decide. Let the decision come out of your existential experience. And
then you say, “But surrender also does not seem to be perfect.” But how
can anything be perfect if you are not perfect? The surrender is going
to be your surrender, not mine. The surrender is going to be yours, not
Meera’s or Mahavira’s. The surrender is going to be yours, not Krishna’s
or Christ’s. The surrender, of course, is bound to be of the same
quality as you are.</p><p><br></p><p>The path of will or the path of surrender are not like superhighways
where anybody can walk and the way remains the same. No, the way changes
with the walker. You bring your quality. For example, if you see a
Picasso painting... you can use the same brush, and the same colors, and
the same canvas, but are you hoping that a Picasso will be born? The
painting will be yours. The brush and the canvas may be Picasso’s. You
can even ask permission to paint in his studio, but then too the
painting will be yours; it will not be a Picasso.</p><p><br></p><p>Exactly like that, when you move on any path, the path is not a
collective possession. Each individual has to create his own path while
walking on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Your surrender is going to be your surrender. It will be as perfect
as you are. Don’t expect more, otherwise, from the beginning, you are
creating obstacles for your growth. And in fact, the path is perfect
only when you have arrived, never before it. But then the path is not
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>So everybody has to walk on an imperfect path, because everybody is
imperfect. And why ask for perfection? Your demands are too much. You go
to the chemist: you don’t ask for a perfect</p><p>medicine. You ask for the latest and the best, not for the perfect –
because the perfect never exists. Tomorrow a better medicine may come
and this medicine will be discarded. Every month medicines are being
discarded, new ones are being invented; but no medicine is perfect, and
cannot be. Perfection means now there is no possibility to grow.
Perfection means death. Perfection means now everything is finished, the
full point has come.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a process; it is not perfect. Nothing is perfect in life.
Everything is imperfect. So the most you can ask is: “Which is the more
perfect way” – that’s all; not THE perfect way, but the more perfect,
comparatively. The path of will maybe is not so perfect for you as
surrender, but if you are making an absolute demand that it be a hundred
percent perfect, then from the very beginning you are too greedy. Move
slowly. Your path is your path. The path will change you, and you will
change the path – and this is going to be a dynamic process, a
dialectical process. You will change the path by your change, and then
the path will change you, and you are both going to enrich each other.
When Meera walks on the path of surrender, of course it is going to be
more perfect than when you walk. When Mahavira walks on the path of
will, it is going to be more perfect than when you walk.</p><p><br></p><p>And one thing more: we come to know only when Meera has arrived. Then
the fragrance spreads. When Mahavira has reached, then the rumor spreads
around the world that somebody has become enlightened. Then people rush.
When they come to see, it is a perfect thing: Picasso has done his work,
the painting is perfect. But you don’t know: Mahavira had moved just
like you – wavering, in uncertainty, confusion, going astray, coming
back, doing a thousand and one mistakes. But you don’t know THAT
Mahavira – that Mahavira who was struggling in darkness, alone. Now
Mahavira has arrived and has become a light; now everybody comes to see
and pay his respects. But Mahavira had also moved the same way – with
the same limitations. When we know Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna,
Zarathustra, they have become perfect souls, SIDDHAS. Then we know. We
had not known their seeking stages.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, you are not a siddha; otherwise what is the point in
seeking? You have not yet arrived, you are arriving. Choose the best
that is possible, don’t hanker for the perfect. Otherwise you may never
move. If you are waiting for the perfect airplane to come and then you
will go, you may never go – because they are being perfected every day.
Don’t wait for the perfect train. Whatsoever is available, choose the
best. Be choosy. Think, meditate about it, find out the pros and cons,
but don’t wait for the perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>And start. In the beginning, great things are not going to happen.
But... those great things can happen only if you being. To begin with,
anything is okay. You start. Move. Your feet will be faltering, your
body may not be adjusted. Just like when a small child starts walking;
how many times does he fall? How many times does he again try, waver,
then by and by become strong of foot? That’s how one moves into the
eternal, too.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing: this movement is not towards some outer goal. This
movement is towards some inner goal which is, in essence, already there.
So you ask me, “Now, what to do?” Only one thing do I say... and let me
tell you one beautiful story. Listen to it very carefully. It is a story
from Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most metaphysical writers of this
age.</p><p><br></p><p>Episode of the Enemy</p><p>So many years on the run, expectant, and now the enemy stood at my
door. From the window I saw him working his way up the hill. Laboring
along the steep road, he leaned on a staff, a clumsy staff which in his
hands was no more than an old man’s cane, not a weapon. Although I was
waiting for it, his knock was so weak, I barely made it out. At the door
I fumbled with the key to let the man in. I feared he was going to
collapse all at once, but he took a few faltering steps and stumbled,
utterly worn out, onto my bed.</p><p><br></p><p>I bent over him so that he could hear me: “One believes that the
years pass for one,” I said to him, “but they pass for everyone else
too. Here we meet, at last, face to face, and what happened before has
no meaning now.” While I spoke, he unbuttoned his overcoat. His right
hand was in the pocket of his suit coat; something there was aimed at
me, and I knew it was a revolver.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he told me, in an unwavering voice, “To get myself into your
house I fell back on your pity. Now I have you at my mercy, and I am
unforgiving.” I tried to get out some words; I am not a strong man and
only words could save me. I managed to utter, “It is true that a long
time ago I ill-treated a certain boy, but you are no longer that boy,
and I am no longer that callous brute. Besides, revenge is no less vain
and ridiculous than forgiving.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s just it,” he replied. “Because I am no longer that boy, I am
about to kill you. This has nothing to do with revenge. This is an act
of justice. Your arguments, Borges, are only strategems of your terror
designed to keep me from my mission. There is nothing you can do
now.”</p><p><br></p><p>“There is one thing I can do,” I said. “What is that?” he asked.</p><p>“Wake up,” I said.</p><p><br></p><p>And I did.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole life that you are acquainted with is nothing but a dream –
a nightmare, true. The enemy and the friend, both are parts of a dream;
the surrender and the will, both are parts of the dream; theories,
philosophies, dogmas, churches, are parts of the dream, the human dream.
The only thing that has to be done is: please wake up. And nobody can
make you awake... unless you decide. It is your decision. There is no
need to hanker anymore for outer beliefs to cling to, because all
beliefs are false. There is no need to seek a philosophy of life; life
is enough. All philosophies are false, including my philosophy. When I
say ALL, I mean all. Wake up! Please wake up! That’s all that can be
said.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>I WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY HYPOCRITES HERE
AMONGST YOUR SANNYASINS, AND THAT IS PREVENTING ME. WHAT SHOULD I
DO?</p><p><br></p><p>My answer is through a small anecdote.</p><p>“Why don’t you attend church?” asked the village parson of the local
innkeeper. “I don’t go,” he replied frankly, “because there are so many
hypocrites there.”</p><p>“Please don’t let that stop you,” said the parson. “There’s always
room for one more.” The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE DONE VERY MANY GROUPS, AND HAD MANY PERTINENT GROWTH
EXPERIENCES IN WHICH I HAVE REALLY FELT THAT I HAD CHANGED AND GAINED
TREMENDOUS NEW INSIGHT. BUT I STILL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES, AND DESPITE
EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE, STILL REPEAT THE PAST AS IF I HAVE NO CHOICE.
WHAT TO DO? CAN CHANGE BE PERMANENT? OR IS THE WORK WE DO ON OURSELVES
SIMPLY ILLUSION, SIGNIFYING NOTHING? CAN SANNYAS BE PERMANENT
CHANGE?</p><p><br></p><p>First: all efforts to improve yourself are bound to fail, because the
one who is making the effort is the problem – the ego. The ego is
constantly making efforts to improve: have more money, have a bigger
house, have a bigger car, have a more beautiful woman, or a husband;
have this, have that. That is ego. You understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>But then the ego plays another game too: it says, “Become more
peaceful, become more loving, attain to meditation, become a SIDDHA, be
like a Buddha.” This again is the same game in another direction. The
same ego that was trying to decorate itself by outer things, now wants
to try and decorate itself through inner things.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing: if YOU are trying to improve yourself, you are
doomed to fail. Once you understand this – that the ego is the problem,
and it is the ego’s greed that wants to improve and become this and
that; the VERY idea of becoming is a projection of the ego – then comes
revolution. And that revolution is nothing that you have to do anything
about, that revolution comes through understanding the ways of the ego.
Once you have understood that it is the same ego that was after money,
after power, prestige, politics – the same ego is now playing inner
games of meditation, enlightenment, and all that nonsense – once you
recognize it is the same ego, in that very recognition, a laughter
arises in you. You start feeling the ridiculousness of it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no improvement. I am not saying there is no mutation, but
there is no improvement. Mutation is there, UTTER change is there, but
no improvement. Improvement means a modified form: you remain the same
with a few more plus things added to you – a car, a big house, a woman.
You remain the same; now a woman is attached to you, a car is attached
to you... you remain the same. Now you have become a meditator – you
remain the same; now you have become a sannyasin – but you remain the
same; deep down you remain the same. And you go on accumulating things:
qualities, characteristics, character, morality, virtue, knowledge. You
go on, but deep down it is the same old trip. Nothing is new. This way,
improvement is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Improvement is not possible at all. When you understand this – this
greed, this hankering to be somebody else, someone else more important,
more significant, greater and greater; once you</p><p>have understood that this is all ego playing – in that moment of
understanding, suddenly there is mutation, a jump, a quantum leap. You
are no more the old, the new has entered.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, the new is not connected with the old at all. That’s
why I don’t say it is an improvement. The new is so absolutely new, so
utterly new, that it has nothing to do with the old. The old man is
completely gone. It is a totally new being, discontinuous with the past.
With this gap, it cannot be called improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality is not an achievement. It is not an ambitious trip.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I have done very many groups and had many pertinent growth
experiences.” Those growth experiences were not pertinent. They were
just games of the ego. You felt good. The ego patted you and said, “Good
boy; doing so good. You are going to improve. One day it is certain you
are going to become a Buddha or a Christ. You are on the way, and going
so beautifully.” And you felt very good. Those experiences were not
pertinent. Your ego used them. They became absolutely dangerous.
Anything that the ego uses is immediately poisoned. You started feeling
very happy: “So now it is happening!” You must have started waiting for
SATORI, SAMADHI: “Now it is not very far away! Any moment.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Your ego reduced all those experiences to toys: you started playing
with them. And you must have started expecting them more and more. You
have become virtuous, religious; now these things will be happening more
and more. Remember, whenever you start asking, “This thing has been
beautiful; I was delighted in it, and I would like to have it again,”
now you are trying to make a continuity.</p><p><br></p><p>The new can happen only when you are not. Now you will not leave
yourself at all; you will always be sitting there. Even if you go
through those same groups again, you will not be enriched, because you
will be waiting: “Now this is going to happen.” And when you wait
nothing happens, because in your waiting you are there. Things happen
unexpectedly. Things happen when you are not even waiting for them. God
is seen sometimes only when you are not looking for Him, because when
you are looking you are tense. God happens in such mundane and trivial
moments that you could not have expected. Whenever you are expecting,
you are there; and God cannot be there because YOU are there. When you
are not expecting – just swimming in a river, and the trees, and the
birds, and the sunlight, and you are completely lost.<span class=s4></span>and of course, nobody waits for God to happen in
that</p><p>moment – suddenly He is there. You are doing nothing but playing with
your cat, looking into the cat’s eyes – and of course, you are not
waiting for something great to happen – and suddenly those eyes of the
cat change, and there is depth, and there is God. And suddenly you are
overwhelmed.</p><p><br></p><p>God is always sudden, unexpected. When you are doing your PUJA, and
ringing your small bell, and doing things like that, God never happens –
because you are so full of expectation. You are waiting and looking to
the side: “Has He come or not?” A knock on the door, maybe just a
postman, and you are so much excited: “Maybe God has come!” When you are
waiting He never comes, because when you are waiting YOU are too much.
He comes only when you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have done very many groups, and had many pertinent growth
experiences in which I have really felt that I had changed and gained
tremendous new insight.”</p><p><br></p><p>I, I, I.<span class=s4></span>you see?</p><p>“But I still make the same mistakes, and despite everything I have
done, still repeat the past as if I have no choice.”</p><p><br></p><p>I, I, I.…</p><p><br></p><p>You will make the same mistakes because it is the same I. You cannot
hope that anything else is going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The I is a mechanism; it goes on doing the same thing, it has become
very efficient in doing it. It is like a computer: it creates habits,
and then it goes on repeating the same habits. Now please, stop any idea
of growth. This is not the way. Forget about growth, because growth is
in the future. Growth is already a postponement: tomorrow it is going to
happen. Forget all about tomorrow; tomorrow never comes. Be here now.
This moment is the only moment there is. Enjoy this moment in total
absorption. Whatsoever you are doing, do it totally, be lost in it. What
it is, I am not saying. If you are lost in it, it becomes worship, it
becomes prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Cleaning the floor can become a prayer; just doing ordinary things in
your kitchen can become a prayer; digging a hole in the garden can
become a prayer. There is no need to go to any temple. Only those go to
the temple who don’t know how to bring prayer to their lives. There is
no need to go to a mosque or a GURUDWARA, because God is everywhere.
Wherever you are totally absorbed, the door of the temple opens.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can change be permanent? Or is the work we do on ourselves simply
illusion signifying nothing?”</p><p><br></p><p>That which you do is illusory, because you are an illusion. Out of
you, only illusions are born. You cannot give birth to truth. YOU are
temporal; out of you the timeless cannot be born. You have to give way,
you have to put yourself aside. Only you are standing in your own way,
nobody else. God is available; just don’t stand in the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you listening?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t stand in the way of God, that’s all. And then He is in the
flower, and in the bird on the wing; then He is in the breeze passing
through the trees. When you are not there to distort, you will find Him
everywhere – because He is everything. It is a miracle how we go on
missing Him. But you are asking for something permanent. The ego can
never be permanent; it is a momentary thing. And out of the ego,
whatsoever you gain will be lost.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking: Cannot a wave be made permanent?</p><p><br></p><p>The wave cannot be made permanent. The only way is to freeze it so it
becomes ice. But then it is not a wave, it is just a piece of ice. Then
it is no more a wave because it cannot wave. The aliveness is gone, the
dynamism is gone. You fall in love with a woman and you want to make the
love permanent? Then you are in danger; you are trying to make a wave
permanent. You go to the court, and the court puts a seal on your
marriage. Now it is a legal thing: love has disappeared. Now it is a
contract, and ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the most beautiful thing in the world, and marriage, the most
ugly, because law has entered into love. Why do you go to the court?
Because you want to make love permanent: “Who knows?</p><p>This woman may fall in love with somebody else tomorrow” – now the
court will protect. “Who knows? This man may escape” – now the court
will protect: you can drag him to the court. He cannot easily escape.
What are you doing when you are marrying a woman or a man? You are
asking society to protect, asking the law, the policeman, to protect.
What kind of love is this in which a policeman is needed to protect you?
This will be a sort of prison. Call it whatsoever you would like to call
it, but it will be a bondage. You will be prisoners of each other, and
this is how we destroy everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is impermanent. If your love is out of the ego, it is
impermanent. The mind is temporary, temporal. Mind, in fact, is time.
Nothing can be permanent in the mind. If you want to look at the
permanent – ‘permanent’ is not the right word, ‘eternal’ is the right
word – then look deeper into the wave, and there is ocean. If you want
to look to some eternal, look into love deeply and you will find God
there. But you bring the policeman rather than searching for God.</p><p><br></p><p>When love is happening, don’t hanker for permanency. Think and brood,
meditate, contemplate... the eternal. Those moments are rare, love
moments. Windows open easily, melting happens easily. You are dazed with
something unknown. Don’t bother about marriage right now. Right now go
into those moments, waves, and find the ocean – because wherever there
is a wave, there is bound to be an ocean behind it. When the love-wave
is there, the love-ocean must be behind it. That ocean of love is
God.</p><p><br></p><p>So please don’t seek the permanent, otherwise you will always be
frustrated. Because the one who is seeking permanence is impermanent
himself. You have chosen a wrong medium: the mind, the ego. Look into
your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can sannyas be a permanent change?” Again you go on using a very
dirty word,‘permanent’. Sannyas is both the wave and the ocean; it
depends on you. If you simply see the wave, it is impermanent. If you
look deep into it and you can find the ocean, it is eternal. The eternal
is not permanent, the eternal is beyond time.’Permanent’ means staying
longer in time; but what does it matter whether you are a sannyasin for
one day or one year or one thousands years – what does it matter? The
impermanent is impermanent – one day, one year, one thousand years.</p><p><br></p><p>Seek something which is beyond time. Then once it is there you know:
it has always been there, and it will be always there. The eternal is
your innermost nature, SWABHAVA. It is your innermost being.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you are seeking, it should not be out of greed and out of
ambition. It should not be a desire to repeat. Forget the past. As it
disappears, let it disappear and don’t think of the morrow. As it has
not come yet, why bother? When it comes, we will be here to look into
it. And whatsoever has happened yesterday, don’t ask for it again today
– because it may have happened yesterday because you were not waiting
for it; today you are waiting for it.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens every day in meditation. Somebody comes to an inner space
and is thrilled, and the desire to repeat arises. Then next day it is
not there, then he feels very frustrated. Then next day he is even more
deep into his depression, because it is not coming. And he comes to me
and says, “It was better before. At least I had not known it. But now I
know it, it is there, and now I am suffering. Why can’t I have it again
and again?” You cannot have it again and again because it is the very
nature of God to happen unexpectedly. He is a guest who comes without
informing you.</p><p>The Hindu word for guest is ATITHI: it means one who comes without
giving you any date beforehand. TITHI means date, ATITHI means one who
comes without informing you at all.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a guest. When He comes, feel thankful. When He does not come,
feel thankful. It must be in your favor that He is not needed today,
that you need a gap, that you need a plateau... so things that have
happened yesterday become settled.</p><p><br></p><p>A highly irascible employer was much given to uttering tirades of
abuse to his long-suffering staff. One young girl stood it for so long,
but when her virtue was questioned, she had had enough, and walked
tight-lipped straight out of the office.</p><p><br></p><p>The following morning, she marched into the tyrannical boss’s office
and thrust a piece of paper under his nose. “This is from my family
doctor,” she said firmly, “and it certifies that I am pure and
untouched.”</p><p><br></p><p>He glanced at it and thrust it back at her. “This is no good,” he
snarled. “It is dated yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, the yesterday is yesterday; gone is gone. Who knows? You may
have changed. But all character is of yesterday, all virtue is of
yesterday. When you call somebody a saint, what do you mean? You say,
“His yesterdays were very saintly.” But they are dated yesterday. He may
have committed a sin last night. You call somebody a sinner, but that is
not right; those are all yesterdays. Yes, he may have committed sins,
but last night he may have prayed, he may have meditated, and he may
have had a glimpse. So don’t call anybody a saint, because a saint
belongs to the past; and don’t call anybody a sinner, because a sinner
is of the past – and life and being is always free of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>Being is of the present. And when you want something to be repeated,
again you are simply desiring for the past to be repeated. What is the
point? You have known it. Don’t you want to know something higher,
something greater? Remain available. That is one of my fundamental
teachings: Don’t desire, remain available. Wait on God and let Him do
things.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>ARE WE NOT HERE TO HELP AND SERVE OTHERS IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>My answer is an anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a little boy whose mother was lecturing him about
selfishness. “You know, darling,” she pointed out, “we are in this world
to help others.”</p><p><br></p><p>The little boy considered this for several seconds, then he asked
with a great deal of seriousness, “Well then, what are the others here
for?”</p><p><br></p><p>You first please look at yourself. Don’t try to become a do-gooder.
These are dangerous people. In the name of doing good, they simply try
to interfere with other people’s lives.</p><p>Who are you to help others? You have not even helped yourself yet.
Physician, first heal thyself.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens many times around me: you listen to me, your mind becomes
more and more informed, you start gathering knowledge, and then suddenly
the desire arises to help others. What you really want is just to pour
your rubbish into their heads. You want to initiate people now. You want
to help people to become spiritual. Please, unless you have known what I
am saying, don’t try to convey it to others, because it will be a
distorted form. And lies are better than half-truths; at least somebody
can come to know that this is a lie and will drop it. A half-truth is
very dangerous. He will never be able to detect that it is a lie because
that half-truth will prevent him, and he will never be able to drop it,
and he will become cluttered with it.</p><p><br></p><p>For four years the little old lady had owned the parrot, and for four
long years she had fruitlessly tried to get it to talk. She had tried
everything: repeating little phrases endlessly, buying bells, mirrors,
and the very best food. Now she was at last at her wits’ end. In
desperation she turned to the parrot and screamed, “For God’s sake, why
won’t you talk!”</p><p><br></p><p>The parrot regarded her with a beady eye. “To tell you the truth,” it
said suddenly, “I have always felt that it was not a good thing to go
around repeating things one hears.”</p><p><br></p><p>At least be as wise as that. The last question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>HOW, JUST IN THE PRESENCE OF A MASTER, CAN THE INNER TRANSFORMATION
HAPPEN? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is like infection, spiritual infection, healthy infection. Just as
illness can be caught, so can “wellness” also be caught. Just as illness
has its own vibration, a certain wavelength, so has wellness a certain
vibration, its own wavelength. When you are near a spiritual person, you
start vibrating in a new way. His very presence plays on the guitar of
your soul. His very presence starts creating a sweetness in you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_true_name_vol_2/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Patience is the Goldsmith</span>

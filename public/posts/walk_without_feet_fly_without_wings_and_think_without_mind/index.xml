Question 1
OSHO, WHAT EXACTLY, IN SIMPLE WORDS, ARE YOU TRYING TO TEACH? WHAT IS YOUR EXACT MESSAGE TO HUMANITY AT LARGE? – AGAIN IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND.

‌CHAPTER 10
You Can’t Win ’em All
10 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I’M NOT SKILLED IN ANY ART. POETRY SOMETIMES HAPPENS. DANCE HAPPENS THROUGH ME. I FEEL NOW THERE IS SUCH A THING AS THE ART OF LIVING, OF LIFE. HAVE YOU A COMMENT?
Amrita, that is the right way. Poetry cannot be done, it can only be allowed. Poetry is not a technique, you cannot learn it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
First Taste Your Own Being
2 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
DO YOU BELIEVE IN YOU? DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? WHO IS GOD?
NO, I DON’T BELIEVE IN ME... I CANNOT, BECAUSE I AM NOT. There is nobody I to be believed in, and nobody to believe in it either.
If you believe in yourself, you believe in an illu-sion.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Love is a Resurrection
3 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IS HERENOW?
DOES ‘THOUGHT’ FORM PART OF IT?
IF SO, THEN ALL-TIME AND ALL-THINGS ARE NOW. OR... IS HERENOW ONLY IN NO-MIND?
DIVYA, THOUGHT IS THE CAPACITY OF NOT BEING HERE – so thought cannot exist in the herenow, it cannot be part of it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
I Am Happening to You
4 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
LISTENING TO YOU IN THE DISCOURSE, IT IS THE PAUSES, THE GAPS, BETWEEN TWO SENTENCES, TWO WORDS, THAT ROLL IN MY EARS LIKE THUNDER, TEARING ME OPEN AND TEARING ME APART.
I AM BEING TAKEN TO A SPACE BEYOND TEARS OR LAUGHTER BY YOUR SILENCE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Playfulness is Heaven
5 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I LIVE IN THE LAND OF SERIOUSNESS, IMPRISONED IN ITS BORDERS. CAN YOU DRAW ME A ROAD-MAP TO YOUR LAND OF LEELA? HAVE I A DEFECTIVE GENE? I CANNOT FIND MY LAUGHTER OR LIGHT-HEARTEDNESS. I SEE IT AROUND ME, BUT DO NOT FEEL IT IN ME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Think Without Mind
6 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, YOU SAY WE CANNOT TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OURSELVES UNTIL WE ARE ‘AWAKENED’. THE WESTERN GROWTH MOVEMENT SAYS WE CANNOT BE AWAKENED UNTIL WE TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OURSELVES. IS THERE A CONFLICT?
PLEASE COMMENT.
ANAND SALAM, THERE IS NO CONFLICT AT ALL – it is just seeing the same phenomenon from two different angles.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Any Moment!
7 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU IMPLORE US CONSTANTLY TO GIVE UP MEMORY, TO LIVE IN THE HERENOW. BUT IN GIVING UP MEMORY I MUST ALSO GIVE UP MY GREATIVE IMAGINATION, FOR I AM A WRITER AND ALL THAT.I WRITE ABOUT HAS ITS ROOT.S IN WHAT I REMEMBER.
I WONDER – WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE LIKE WITHOUT ART AND THE CREATIVE IMAGINATION THAT MAKES ART POSSIBLE?</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
The Tender Trap
8 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IF TRUTH CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS, THEN WHY HAVE ALL THE BUDDHAS USED WORDS?
A parable:
THE GREAT MYSTIC, Rabia of Basra, was immensely beautiful. And a beauty not of this world. Once a rich young man from Iran comes to Basra. He asks people, “Is there anything that is out of the way, something special here?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
This Very Ancientmost New Commune
9 January 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHY CAN’T I KNOW GOD?
FOR YOU ARE IT! Knowledge is not possible. Knowledge pre-supposes division, split. The knower has to be separate from the known. That’s why God cannot be known. You can be God – you are – but you cannot know Him.</description>

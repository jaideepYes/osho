It is for reference purposes only.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Dolf) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dolf. Anand means bliss. Dolf means courageous spirit. Bliss is only for the courageous\nThe coward is destined to live in misery. He cannot get out of it\nNot that misery clings to him\nBut just the contrary: he clings to misery.\nThe coward is a clinger\nHe always clings to whatsoever it is He is afraid to let go anything\nEven though it is misery. His reasoning is that\nWhatsoever is known, will-known is good and whatsoever is unknown is fearful, makes him scared. He always chooses the known\nAnd rejects the unknown.\nMisery is known, bliss is unknown. Matter is known, god is unknown. Science is known, religion is unknown. It is only for the courageous spirit\nTo go beyond the known\nAnd to have a taste of the unknown.\n(To Uli) -- This is your name: Swami Svatmo Uli. Svatmo means of the self. Uli means a noble ruler. To rule others is ignoble\nTo rule others is violence\nThe rule others is inhuman because\nIt destroys the other, his freedom, his dignity\nBecause it reduces the other From a human being into a thing.\nUnless you reduce the other into a thing You are never in the possession of him. To be in total possession\nYou have to destroy his soul.\nThis is the ugliest act in life one can do Hence the real ruler never rules others.\nHe rules himself, he is a master of himself. His kingdom is not of this world\nHis kingdom is not of the outside His kingdom is of the inner.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Renate) -- Your name: Ma Renate. This is a Beautiful name. It exactly defines sannyas,\nRenate means born anew -- and that's what sannyas Is all about.\nIt is a process of rebirth\nOf becoming twice-born. The first birth only gives you\nA possibility, a potential, an opportunity. The second birth makes the potential actual Transforms the possible into the real.\nOnly the second birth\nMakes the first birth meaningful. Without the second\nThe fist is a lost opportunity.\nWith the second the opportunity is fulfilled You have risen to the occasion\nYou have accepted the challenge of life. The first birth ends into death\nThe second birth knows no death at all. It leads you into eternal life.\nIt is the real birth because\nIt is the beginning of real life.\n(To Adelheid) -- This is your name: Ma Abhinava. Abhinava means the new one.\nFrom this moment\nDisconnect yourself from the past.\nStart counting your life from this moment. After one year you will be only one year old. The life that has passed before\nWas just a dream phenomenon. Now you have to awaken\nYou have to become more alert\nMore watchful, more conscious -- that's the work A sannyasin has to do upon himself;\nIt is the most beautiful work. Incredible are the results of it The rewards are unbelievable. Once you have started moving Towards being more conscious\nYou become more loving, you become more blissful You become more divine!\nFor the first time you start feeling that life is a great gift, a benediction from god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd a great thankfulness arises in the heart.\nThat is true prayer.\n(To Thomas) -- This is your name: Swami Tathagato.\nTathagato is one of the names given to Gautam the Buddha. It means one who lives in the suchness of life, who accepts whatsoever is the case. who accepts everything totally.\nEven death is absolutely accepted because His trust in existence is infinite --\nIt knows no bounds, it is unconditional. It is the highest peak of meditation.\nTo accept all -- all the sweetness of life And all the bitterness of life\nWith equanimity, choicelessly With no like, no dislike --\nOnce this starts happening you become a rejoicing You become a serenity, you become utter silence; And a silence which is not dead\nA silence which sings, a silence which dances. A silence which is not empty.\nA silence which is over full. This is going to be your method: Learn to accept life as it comes.\nWhen something happens, accept it.\nWhen it disappears, accept it. When pleasure comes, accept it. When it evaporates, accept it.\nAnd the same with pain: remain non-judgmental, Just a silent witness to all.\nThis is the most profound secret\nOf all the buddhas, of all the awakened ones.\n(To Kathleen) -- This is your name: Ma Arihanto. Arihanto is also a name of Gautam the Buddha.\nArihanto means one who has conquered all his enemies. There are two kinds of enemies; the first category Consists of enemies who are outside you.\nBuddha conquers them.\nThe awakened person conquers them:\nBecause he drops his enmity\nBecause he no more thinks of them as enemies -- That is his victory.\nThey may still think him as the enemy but 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFor him there is no enemy at all in the world. He is friendly to everything.\nThat's why Jesus could say\nIn the last moments of his life 'Father, forgive these people\nBecause they know not what they are doing.' He is praying for those who are crucifying him. This is the meaning of Arihanto, first meaning: Conquering the outer enemies\nNot that they are conquered in the ordinary way Not in the way of Alexander the great\nBut in a totally different way They are no more enemies.\nThe enlightened person\nHas no enmity towards anybody. And there is a deeper meaning also The second category:\nHe has conquered all his inner enemies -- The ego, the greed, the anger, the jealousy, All those inner enemies.\nThey consist in fact of one\nAnd the name of that one enemy Which is hidden behind all these faces\nIs unconsciousness -- He has conquered it By becoming absolutely conscious.\nHe is full of light\nThere is no darkness any more. He is only consciousness There is no unconscious in him\nHence inside all the enemies have disappeared. From the outside he has dropped all enmity.\nHe is arihanto -- he has conquered all the enemies. The whole existence is his friend\nAnd he is a friend to the whole of existence. He is a lover hand he loves unconditionally.\n(To Sylvie) -- This is your name: Ma Vijayo. Vijayo Means the victorious one. There is only one victory worth achieving\nAnd that is of becoming conscious\nOf becoming more meditative, of becoming More silent, calm and quiet and collected.\nAll other victories are false, pseudo.\nThey don't have any meaning.\nMoney, power, prestige -- they are all playthings They are not for people\nWho are really intelligent 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThey are for the stupid ones: Stupid ones Also need few things to keep them occupies Otherwise they will create more nuisance.\nBut the really intelligent person soon becomes Disinterested into all that nonsense.\nHe starts moving inwards\nHe starts enquiring 'Who am I?'\nHe starts digging deep within his own being To find his center.\nAnd the day the center is found\nOne is victorious because one has overcome death. Once you know who you are there is no death -- That is true victory.\n(To Kirsten) -- This is your name: Ma Samudro. Samudro means the oceanic.\nOne should not think in terms of limits one should get rid of all ideas of limitations, that's the whole phenomenon of sannyas. Knowing that \"I am not the body,\" is the beginning of a great pilgrimage. Then knowing that \"I am not the mind either,\" is a further step; then finally knowing that \"I am not even my feeling,\" is the last step. In these three steps the journey is over because on the fourth step you discover your being. And that is vast, infinite as vast as the ocean, as vast as the sky. To experience it is to experience god.\nAnd to experience it is to exercise bliss, ecstasy. That is the only experience worth trying for; all else is just sheer wastage, wastage of a great opportunity in which one can find the real treasure. And one goes on collecting seashells and colored stones on the seabeach while the treasure is within you, the kingdom of god is within you.\nSo drop thinking in terms of limitations so that you find more and more that you are closer to the unlimited being, to the infinite being.\n(To Frederike) -- This is your name: Ma Arpano. Arpano means the surrendered one.\nAll that I ask is -- give your ego to me -- nothing else. And the ego is your misery, your problem, your anguish. Just give it to me and forget all about it. Once you can gather the courage to give the ego to the master, all the problems that have been following you; and you have never been able to solve any of them, simply evaporate because the very root is cut. That is the meaning of Arpano; let it also become your experience.\nSannyas is true only when you are ready to offer your ego to me. And I don't ask for anything else, I am asking only for the ugly in you, the pathological in you, the psychotic in you, the mad in you. The real master only demands your madness, and once you have given your madness, sanity arises of its own accord.\nIt is your self-nature, nobody can give it to you. Just the arbitrary has to be removed and the natural starts growing of its own accord. Only the rocks have to be removed and the stream of your consciousness starts flowing.\n(To Johan) -- Just look at me. Good.\n-- Osho, just now I have so many resistance.\n-- Mm?\n-- Just now I have so many resistances happening.\n-- They all will disappear -- everybody has them!\nNo need to worry about them. When you are ready to take sannyas, that means you have already overcome a great resistance, one of the greatest. The remaining one are small ones, they are not that big. And once you are a sannyasin, then I stat hitting you. Unless you are a sannyasins, I resist myself! I am very polite!... very loving, seductive! Once you are a sannyasin, then I come into my true colors! -- you don't be worried.\nThis is your name: Swami Anandmurti. Anand means Bliss; Murti means image of -- image of bliss.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's what we are potentially bound to be. But we go astray, we become something else. We become that which we are not\nWe become that which nature has not provided for Hence the misery\nBecause we become schizophrenic, we become double. One is our natural self\nWhich remains hidden behind the artificial self. The artificial self is the ego and the real self We have completely forgotten.\nWe have become so much identified With the artificial.\nOnce in a while we have glimpses of the real Because howsoever we forget it\nWe cannot destroy it -- the artificial is artificial And the real is real. The real is going to abide\nThe artificial is just a make-believe.\nWe are miserable because of the artificial self Otherwise we are pure bliss\nBut we are living double lives.\nA schizophrenic fell in love with a woman And asked the woman, 'Kiss me twice --\nI am schizophrenic!'\nBut that is the situation of everybody. And even if you go to the psychiatrists They are even in a far worse mess.\nOne schizophrenic went to a psychiatrist And he said, 'Help me! I am always thinking\nI am two persons.'\nThe psychoanalyst looked over the room And said, 'All four of you?'\nEverybody is split\nAnd the split is there for the simple reason that\nWe have become too much identified with the false And the false is the top layer,\nEasily available, just on the circumference. And the real is far deeper -- you have to dig it It needs effort, arduous effort, patient effort. And grat insistence, determination, resolution That 'I am bound to find it,'\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat 'I have to find it,'\nThat 'I cannot live without finding it.'\nUnless it becomes a question of life and death One never finds it.\nBut you have some in the right hands.\nNothing to be worried.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I go home about three days and then I will come back in November or December.\n-- Come back in November, December. And by that time I will be sharpening my sword and ...\n(inaudible) Come back!

name of Gautam the Buddha.</p><p>Arihanto means one who has conquered all his enemies. There are two
kinds of enemies; the first category Consists of enemies who are outside
you.</p><p>Buddha conquers them.</p><p>The awakened person conquers them:</p><p>Because he drops his enmity</p><p>Because he no more thinks of them as enemies -- That is his
victory.</p><p>They may still think him as the enemy but 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>For him there is no enemy at all in the world. He is friendly to
everything.</p><p>That's why Jesus could say</p><p>In the last moments of his life 'Father, forgive these people</p><p>Because they know not what they are doing.' He is praying for those
who are crucifying him. This is the meaning of Arihanto, first meaning:
Conquering the outer enemies</p><p>Not that they are conquered in the ordinary way Not in the way of
Alexander the great</p><p>But in a totally different way They are no more enemies.</p><p>The enlightened person</p><p>Has no enmity towards anybody. And there is a deeper meaning also The
second category:</p><p>He has conquered all his inner enemies -- The ego, the greed, the
anger, the jealousy, All those inner enemies.</p><p>They consist in fact of one</p><p>And the name of that one enemy Which is hidden behind all these
faces</p><p>Is unconsciousness -- He has conquered it By becoming absolutely
conscious.</p><p>He is full of light</p><p>There is no darkness any more. He is only consciousness There is no
unconscious in him</p><p>Hence inside all the enemies have disappeared. From the outside he
has dropped all enmity.</p><p>He is arihanto -- he has conquered all the enemies. The whole
existence is his friend</p><p>And he is a friend to the whole of existence. He is a lover hand he
loves unconditionally.</p><p>(To Sylvie) -- This is your name: Ma Vijayo. Vijayo Means the
victorious one. There is only one victory worth achieving</p><p>And that is of becoming conscious</p><p>Of becoming more meditative, of becoming More silent, calm and quiet
and collected.</p><p>All other victories are false, pseudo.</p><p>They don't have any meaning.</p><p>Money, power, prestige -- they are all playthings They are not for
people</p><p>Who are really intelligent 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

keep them occupies Otherwise they will create more nuisance.</p><p>But the really intelligent person soon becomes Disinterested into all
that nonsense.</p><p>He starts moving inwards</p><p>He starts enquiring 'Who am I?'</p><p>He starts digging deep within his own being To find his center.</p><p>And the day the center is found</p><p>One is victorious because one has overcome death. Once you know who
you are there is no death -- That is true victory.</p><p>(To Kirsten) -- This is your name: Ma Samudro. Samudro means the
oceanic.</p><p>One should not think in terms of limits one should get rid of all
ideas of limitations, that's the whole phenomenon of sannyas. Knowing
that "I am not the body," is the beginning of a great pilgrimage. Then
knowing that "I am not the mind either," is a further step; then finally
knowing that "I am not even my feeling," is the last step. In these
three steps the journey is over because on the fourth step you discover
your being. And that is vast, infinite as vast as the ocean, as vast as
the sky. To experience it is to experience god.</p><p>And to experience it is to exercise bliss, ecstasy. That is the only
experience worth trying for; all else is just sheer wastage, wastage of
a great opportunity in which one can find the real treasure. And one
goes on collecting seashells and colored stones on the seabeach while
the treasure is within you, the kingdom of god is within you.</p><p>So drop thinking in terms of limitations so that you find more and
more that you are closer to the unlimited being, to the infinite
being.</p><p>(To Frederike) -- This is your name: Ma Arpano. Arpano means the
surrendered one.</p><p>All that I ask is -- give your ego to me -- nothing else. And the ego
is your misery, your problem, your anguish. Just give it to me and
forget all about it. Once you can gather the courage to give the ego to
the master, all the problems that have been following you; and you have
never been able to solve any of them, simply evaporate because the very
root is cut. That is the meaning of Arpano; let it also become your
experience.</p><p>Sannyas is true only when you are ready to offer your ego to me. And
I don't ask for anything else, I am asking only for the ugly in you, the
pathological in you, the psychotic in you, the mad in you. The real
master only demands your madness, and once you have given your madness,
sanity arises of its own accord.</p><p>It is your self-nature, nobody can give it to you. Just the arbitrary
has to be removed and the natural starts growing of its own accord. Only
the rocks have to be removed and the stream of your consciousness starts
flowing.</p><p>(To Johan) -- Just look at me. Good.</p><p>-- Osho, just now I have so many resistance.</p><p>-- Mm?</p><p>-- Just now I have so many resistances happening.</p><p>-- They all will disappear -- everybody has them!</p><p>No need to worry about them. When you are ready to take sannyas, that
means you have already overcome a great resistance, one of the greatest.
The remaining one are small ones, they are not that big. And once you
are a sannyasin, then I stat hitting you. Unless you are a sannyasins, I
resist myself! I am very polite!... very loving, seductive! Once you are
a sannyasin, then I come into my true colors! -- you don't be
worried.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anandmurti. Anand means Bliss; Murti means
image of -- image of bliss.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

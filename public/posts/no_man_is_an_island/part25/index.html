It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Moni) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Moni. Anand means bliss. Moni means aloneness.\nBliss is possible in two ways:\nEither it can happen in a relationship, in love, Or it can happen in total aloneness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe bliss that happens in love Is bound to be momentary;\nIt will come and it will go\nBecause it will depend on each other It creates a subtle kind of bondage.\nAnd any bliss that depends On something on the outside Is always unreliable:\nOne day it may be there, next day it may be gone. One cannot make it permanent\nAlthough people try their best.\nTheir very effort makes it even more impossible Because whatsoever they do\nDestroys it sooner\nThan it would have happened on its own. People become clingers\nAnd the more you cling to the other, The other becomes afraid\nThe other wants to escape because\nThere is a tremendous inner need to be free. The desire for freedom\nIs higher than any other desire Is deeper than any other desire.\nSo one can even sacrifice love But one cannot sacrifice freedom; It is not in the nature of things, Nothing can be done about it.\nHence the real bliss can happen Only in your aloneness.\nAloneness is an art, the whole art of meditation. To be utterly centered into one's own being Without any desire for the other\nNo hankering for the other,\nTo be in such a deep rest with oneself That nothing else is needed,\nOne is enough unto oneself -- that is aloneness. It brings the eternal bliss.\nOnce you have it\nYou can enjoy your love also because then You need not depend on the bliss\nThat comes through love -- you already have it. Then love has a totally different dimension\nA different flavor, a different quality to it. It is sharing, it does not create bondage.\nHence meditation is first and love is second. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThose who try love first\nAre bound to fail, are doomed to fail;\nThey will go deeper and deeper into misery. All lovers end into misery\nAnd it is nothing to do with them. It is just the nature of things.\nYou cannot change the nature of things. But if first you are rooted in your being And then you move into relationship\nIt is a totally different phenomenon: Now you can share, you can love And you can enjoy this love too.\nEven though if it is momentary, You can dance, you can sing And when it is gone, it is gone -- You don't look back.\nYou are capable of creating another love So there is no need to cling.\nYou don't carry any grudge You don't have any complaint; You are thankful to the lover You are thankful to the love That is no more there because It has enriched you,\nIt has given you some glimpses of life It has made you more mature.\nBut it is possible only if you have\nA certain grounding in your being, otherwise If love is all that you have\nAnd no meditative grounding\nThen you will suffer, then each love affair Will become a nightmare -- sooner or later. And one hopes that it will be later\nBut it is never later, it is sooner! You have a very beautiful name.… Learn the art of how to be alone And blissfully alone --\nThat's what sannyas is all about.… And then everything is possible.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Herman.\nDhyan means meditation. Herman means a man of diligence.\nMeditation needs total effort. One cannot achieve meditation halfheartedly. You have to go into it without holding anything back, and you have to go into it without any hurry. You have to go into it with immense patience. And much effort will be needed because we have gathered such a mind in so many lives that it surrounds our being like many layers of rocks. All those rocks have to be broken, chipped away. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhard work, but it pays tremendously.\nSo those who think that meditation will happen just by sitting for ten minutes, fifteen minutes in the morning, fifteen minutes in the evening... and you will know what transcendental meditation is - are simply fools. All that you can learn from those fifteen minutes is a certain technique of falling asleep. Nothing is wrong with falling asleep. If you enjoy it, it is perfectly good, but don't mistake it for meditation.\nAll kinds of chanting, all kinds of mantras are nothing but lullabies; they create a deep, auto-hypnotic state. Repeating a certain word constantly - you fall into a certain state of trance which is not meditation.\nMeditation means awareness. Meditation is not a trance. It is not auto-hypnosis; it is just the opposite of it.\nIt means silence, but fully alert. It means a state of no-mind. There is no chanting, no chanter. The whole mind has been dropped. It is possible, but it has happened to just a few people in the whole history of humanity. Only to very few\npeople, because very few people were diligent enough, very few people were ready to pay for it.\nIt needs a total commitment, it is a life-long work. So one has to be very patient, and one has to learn not to bother about the results; otherwise every day thinking about the result, that, \"It has not happened yet..., it has not happened yet...,\" is an unnecessary disturbance and a distraction.\nKrishna says to his disciple Arjuna: \"Don't think of the result - just do it! Don't bother about the result.\nThe result will take its own course, it will come in its own time. Trust existence and go on doing your work, and whenever the time is ripe and you are ready, the gift arrives and the transformation happens.\"\nAnd you are transformed into another world, a new being is born; you are no more part of time - you become part of eternity!\n(To Tim) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyana. Anand means bliss. Dhyana means meditation.\nOne can start meditation in a wrong way. And if the first step is wrong\nThen every thing will go wrong.\nOne can start meditation in a state of misery Out of despair -- that is the wrong step.\nThen you are simply trying\nTo avoid and escape from the misery. Meditation is only\nA beautiful name for that escape. It is not true meditation.\nTrue meditation begins in a state of bliss. So the first thing to learn is\nTo be cheerful, to be rejoicing Into small things of life!\nThe people, the trees, the sun, the moon The stars, the flowers, the butterflies, mm? Small things of life ...\nJust a walk on the beach\nJust the chirping of the birds in the morning Just he taste of the salty air on the beach --\nOne should learn to enjoy all these small things One should become more and more sensitive, Alert of all that surrounds you.\nAnd one should rejoice\nOne should not be sad and serious. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nReligions ordinarily make people serious and sad. I teach you just the opposite: Rejoice\nDon't be sad and serious -- Those are pathological states.\nAnd if you are in a pathological state Whatsoever you do will go wrong.\nYou are in a wrong state, you are in a confusion: Out of confusion anything done\nWill create more confusion. So the first thing is\nTo get in tune with existence. Don't bother about god\nAnd afterlife and the soul; Don't be bothered by\nGreat metaphysics and esoteric truths.\nDon't be concerned at all about all that rubbish. Just enjoy moment to moment\nThat which is available::\nA distant call of the cuckoo -- Let it sink deep in you.\nJust a cup of tea -- the flavor of it, The taste of it -- enjoy it!\nAnd by enjoying these small things\nYou create a right state of mind and from there You can take the jump into meditation.\nThat state has to be used as a jumping board. And when meditation starts --\nNot as an escape but as an enquiry for deeper joys Because you have tasted something of the joyous In the ordinary way ...\nNow you would like to lean\nSome extraordinary ways to enjoy life.\nYou would like to know some other perspectives From where you can look to life\nAnd see its beauty.\nYou would like to become more and more enriched. Meditation gives you\nThe deepest vision of the reality. The ordinary simply disappears\nAnd everything becomes extraordinary. But first you have to enjoy the ordinary. If you don't enjoy the ordinary\nThen there is nothing else.\nThe extraordinary is hidden in the ordinary\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe sacred is hidden in the profane.\nAnd this is where religions have gone wrong: Their sacred is against the ordinary,\nMy sacred is in the ordinary\nHence religions have condemned people Who say life is eating, drinking, merrying -- Religions have condemned these people\nAs materialists -- I don't condemn them. I say that is the right approach\nThat is a good beginning:\nIf you can enjoy eating, drinking, merrying, Then sooner or later\nYou are going to become intrigued\nSooner or later the enquiry is bound to arise In an intelligent person's heart:\nIs this more or there is more to it?\nThen, when that question has arisen in you,\nThat there must be more -- because you start Having some glimpses of the more,\nAnd now you start moving towards that more To discover it, to experience it --\nThen meditation is very natural And you will never go wrong.\nThe first step is the most important step In fact the fist step\nIs almost half the journey.\nSo while you are here to learn to enjoy everything And drop all kinds of sadness and seriousness.\nDance, sing, celebrate and slowly slowly Meditate to find out because\nThere is certainly more but for that more You need a deeper intelligence Meditation is nothing but\nIt gives depth to your intelligence It gives you clarity, that's all\nIt cleanses your mirror\nAnd you start reflecting life more clearly.\n(To Christopher) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Bhagwat.\nAnand means bliss. Bhagwat means divine. Bliss is divine, hence a sannyasin has to learn All possible ways of being blissful.\nDon't miss a single opportunity.\nEach moment one has to live so deeply That one drinks the whole juice of it, Nothing is left behind.\nSqueeze the whole juice 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOut of each moment of your life Whatsoever you are doing.\nIt is not question of what you are doing.\nYou may be cleaning the floor, singing a song Shopping wood, carrying water from the well Playing cards with a friend, gossiping Whatsoever, enjoy it to the uttermost! ...\nAs if this is the last moment.\nWho knows? -- the next moment may not come.\nLive each moment as if this is the last moment So that you can put your total energy into it.\nAnd then slowly slowly\nLife starts becoming wider, intenser, deeper, It starts gaining new dimensions\nIt starts having new richnesses Which it has never known before.\nAnd when you have fulfilled your whole potential You know what god is.\nGod is not something there, outside you, God is the realization\nThe actualization of your total potential When you have come to a flowering You have experienced god.\nTo flower is to be religious. God is not somebody\nIt is not something separate from you; It is your own inner fulfillment\nJust a name for that fulfillment. And it cannot happen\nJust by going into a monastery\nOr just by repeating old, rotten cliches Or just by doing formal prayers --\nIt can't happen that way.\nOne has to live life, one has to be One's own being, one's own self Not a carbon copy.\nIt can't happen to a Christian Or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. It can happen only to a person Who has become an individual\nWho has no clinging to any ideology\nWho is utterly free form all ideological prisons Who is absolutely free, his soul in unburdened. In that unburdening\nYou will know the taste of sannyas. When you are utterly unburdened 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou are capable of flying\nYou lose all weight, you become weightless. And in that weightlessness\nEverything that you come across is divine. But begin from being blissful, cheerful -- That is the first lesson,\nThat is the fist lesson of being divine. Misery is very undivine.\nAnd your so-called saints look so miserable That I cannot even call them saints.\nThey need electric shocks so that\nThey can be brought out of their coma; They have gone dead!\nBut they think they are practicing spirituality. They are only practicing slow suicide.\nSo I teach a totally new kind of religion Which has never been taught\nThe way I am teaching it. So you have to be very alert\nBecause it is very easy to misunderstand me. As if I am just teaching the old truths\nIn a new language -- that is one misunderstanding.\nThe other misunderstanding is As if I am teaching something\nWhich is not religious at all because\nIt does not correspond to your idea of religion; Both are misunderstandings.\nWhat I m teaching is pure religion But it has never been taught\nThe way I am teaching it because\nIt could not have been taught the way\nIt can be taught now -- Man has become of age! Mm, Jesus was talking to very immature people. He had to speak the language of immature people. Two thousand years is a long time\nAnd it is really a pity to see people Still clinging to those childish parables.\nFive thousand years have passed since Krishna And it is really sad to see\nPeople still repeating Krishna Thinking that that's what religion is. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThese people are not contemporaries at all; They should have been born\nFive thousand years back. They can't understand me,\nOnly one who is contemporary can understand me. That's why only very young people\nCan have a communion with me. It is not an accident\nThat thousands of young people\nAre gathering around me.\nAnd of course, the more intelligent they are The more they are capable of\nMaking a contact with me, immediately.\n(To Biek) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Gyana. Anand means bliss. Gyana means wisdom.\nThe only criterion of wisdom is bliss. If your wisdom is not radiating bliss\nThen it is mere knowledge, not wisdom.\nAnd knowledge is just the opposite of wisdom.\nIt is far worse than ignorance. Ignorance is better\nBecause the ignorance is unpretentious. The ignorant person is unteachable Because he already knows!\nHe is egoistic, he is full of scriptures\nAnd all kinds of jargon -- it is all gibberish! But he is full of it and he thinks,\n'This is knowledge,' so he clings to it. And he is utterly ignorant but Because of this so-called knowledge He is not even aware of his ignorance.\nThe ignorant person is at least innocent. The ignorant person is at least available; He will say, 'I don't know, so\nI am ready to enquire, to go into any discovery.' The knowledgeable person\nIs the most difficult person. But there is a criterion to judge\nBecause sometimes knowledge looks like wisdom: You can repeat Buddha's words\nAnd those words came from a wise man 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo those words have all the appearance of wisdom; You can repeat them like a parrot.\nAnd you can befool others\nAnd you can befool yourself also That you have become wise.\nBut the criterion is:\nIs it making you blissful or not? Is it helping you to dance, so sing To love, to laugh or not?\nIf it is not making you blissful Then it is all bullshit!\nDrop it as soon as possible and take a good bath! Cleanse yourself of it because\nThere are people who even worship bullshit -- They call it, they call it holy cow dung!\nPeople are so stupid, they can worship anything.\nIn India, cow dung is worshipped and India Is the most religious country in the world -- That's what they say ...\nAnd they worship cow dung and they drink ... The urine of the cow because it is holy!\nNow these people can't be blissful -- they stink! And one can fall into the trap of these people Because they have a long tradition behind them. So beware of it!\nWhile you are in India be very alert -- It is really dangerous to be here!\nOne can easily become religious. And my whole effort here is\nNot to allow anybody to become religious In that sense.\nI teach a rebellious kind of religion A religion that is intelligent\nA religion that is rooted in awareness A religion that teaches blissfulness,. I don't teach any superstition --\nIt is all scientific whatsoever I teach.\nYou can experiment\nYou are not expected to believe in it\nYou are only seduced to experiment with it.\nAnd if your experience shows you that it is so Then of course, it is for you to decide\nWhether to go further, deeper into it or not. Wisdom is an experience, knowledge is borrowed, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo always remember that.\nAnd the criterion is blissfulness.\nGo on checking. Whenever you feel That you are becoming wise, check it: Are you blissful or not?\nAnd immediately you will know that\nIf it is knowledge, you are not blissful at all. If it is wisdom, you will be full of bliss.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #26\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3163","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3163 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

halfheartedly. You have to go into it without holding anything back, and
you have to go into it without any hurry. You have to go into it with
immense patience. And much effort will be needed because we have
gathered such a mind in so many lives that it surrounds our being like
many layers of rocks. All those rocks have to be broken, chipped away.

ten minutes, fifteen minutes in the morning, fifteen minutes in the
evening... and you will know what transcendental meditation is - are
simply fools. All that you can learn from those fifteen minutes is a
certain technique of falling asleep. Nothing is wrong with falling
asleep. If you enjoy it, it is perfectly good, but don't mistake it for
meditation.</p><p>All kinds of chanting, all kinds of mantras are nothing but
lullabies; they create a deep, auto-hypnotic state. Repeating a certain
word constantly - you fall into a certain state of trance which is not
meditation.</p><p>Meditation means awareness. Meditation is not a trance. It is not
auto-hypnosis; it is just the opposite of it.</p><p>It means silence, but fully alert. It means a state of no-mind. There
is no chanting, no chanter. The whole mind has been dropped. It is
possible, but it has happened to just a few people in the whole history
of humanity. Only to very few</p><p>people, because very few people were diligent enough, very few people
were ready to pay for it.</p><p>It needs a total commitment, it is a life-long work. So one has to be
very patient, and one has to learn not to bother about the results;
otherwise every day thinking about the result, that, "It has not
happened yet..., it has not happened yet...," is an unnecessary
disturbance and a distraction.</p><p>Krishna says to his disciple Arjuna: "Don't think of the result -
just do it! Don't bother about the result.</p><p>The result will take its own course, it will come in its own time.
Trust existence and go on doing your work, and whenever the time is ripe
and you are ready, the gift arrives and the transformation happens."</p><p>And you are transformed into another world, a new being is born; you
are no more part of time - you become part of eternity!</p><p>(To Tim) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyana. Anand means bliss.
Dhyana means meditation.</p><p>One can start meditation in a wrong way. And if the first step is
wrong</p><p>Then every thing will go wrong.</p><p>One can start meditation in a state of misery Out of despair -- that
is the wrong step.</p><p>Then you are simply trying</p><p>To avoid and escape from the misery. Meditation is only</p><p>A beautiful name for that escape. It is not true meditation.</p><p>True meditation begins in a state of bliss. So the first thing to
learn is</p><p>To be cheerful, to be rejoicing Into small things of life!</p><p>The people, the trees, the sun, the moon The stars, the flowers, the
butterflies, mm? Small things of life ...</p><p>Just a walk on the beach</p><p>Just the chirping of the birds in the morning Just he taste of the
salty air on the beach --</p><p>One should learn to enjoy all these small things One should become
more and more sensitive, Alert of all that surrounds you.</p><p>And one should rejoice</p><p>One should not be sad and serious. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

the opposite: Rejoice</p><p>Don't be sad and serious -- Those are pathological states.</p><p>And if you are in a pathological state Whatsoever you do will go
wrong.</p><p>You are in a wrong state, you are in a confusion: Out of confusion
anything done</p><p>Will create more confusion. So the first thing is</p><p>To get in tune with existence. Don't bother about god</p><p>And afterlife and the soul; Don't be bothered by</p><p>Great metaphysics and esoteric truths.</p><p>Don't be concerned at all about all that rubbish. Just enjoy moment
to moment</p><p>That which is available::</p><p>A distant call of the cuckoo -- Let it sink deep in you.</p><p>Just a cup of tea -- the flavor of it, The taste of it -- enjoy
it!</p><p>And by enjoying these small things</p><p>You create a right state of mind and from there You can take the jump
into meditation.</p><p>That state has to be used as a jumping board. And when meditation
starts --</p><p>Not as an escape but as an enquiry for deeper joys Because you have
tasted something of the joyous In the ordinary way ...</p><p>Now you would like to lean</p><p>Some extraordinary ways to enjoy life.</p><p>You would like to know some other perspectives From where you can
look to life</p><p>And see its beauty.</p><p>You would like to become more and more enriched. Meditation gives
you</p><p>The deepest vision of the reality. The ordinary simply disappears</p><p>And everything becomes extraordinary. But first you have to enjoy the
ordinary.

<em>against</em> the ordinary,</p><p>My sacred <em>is in</em> the ordinary</p><p>Hence religions have condemned people Who say life is eating,
drinking, merrying -- Religions have condemned these people</p><p>As materialists -- I don't condemn them. I say that is the right
approach</p><p>That is a good beginning:</p><p>If you can enjoy eating, drinking, merrying, Then sooner or later</p><p>You are going to become intrigued</p><p>Sooner or later the enquiry is bound to arise In an intelligent
person's heart:</p><p>Is this more or there is more to it?</p><p>Then, when that question has arisen in you,</p><p>That there must be more -- because you start Having some glimpses of
the more,</p><p>And now you start moving towards that more To discover it, to
experience it --</p><p>Then meditation <em>is</em> very natural And you will never go
wrong.</p><p>The first step is the most important step In fact the fist step</p><p>Is almost half the journey.</p><p>So while you are here to learn to enjoy everything And drop all kinds
of sadness and seriousness.</p><p>Dance, sing, celebrate and slowly slowly Meditate to find out
because</p><p>There is certainly more but for that more You need a deeper

all</p><p>It cleanses your mirror</p><p>And you start reflecting life more clearly.</p><p>(To Christopher) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Bhagwat.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Bhagwat means divine. Bliss is divine, hence a

dimensions</p><p>It starts having new richnesses Which it has never known before.</p><p>And when you have fulfilled your whole potential You know what god
is.</p><p>God is not something there, outside you, God is the realization</p><p>The actualization of your total potential When you have come to a

fulfillment</p><p>Just a name for that fulfillment. And it cannot happen</p><p>Just by going into a monastery</p><p>Or just by repeating old, rotten cliches Or just by doing formal
prayers --</p><p>It can't happen that way.</p><p>One has to live life, one has to be One's own being, one's own self
Not a carbon copy.</p><p>It can't happen to a Christian Or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. It can

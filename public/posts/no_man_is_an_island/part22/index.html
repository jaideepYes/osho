It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Sanjay) -- Your name: Swami Sanjay Bharti. Sanjay means victory and not just victory but right victory.\nThat word right, 'sam' is of immense importance. All the great words are composed of it. Sambodhi, which means enlightenment comes from the same root 'sam'. Samadhi, which means ultimate achievement, self-realization, comes from the same root 'sam'.\nGautam Buddha was immensely in love with the word 'sam'; whatsoever he will say he will always use the word 'sam'. The eightfold path that he preached, all the eight links start with sam: Samyaksmrati, right remembrance, Samyakahar, right food -- whatsoever he will say he will always emphasize that it should be right because the problem is with man's unconsciousness. With this everything can go wrong. Even beautiful things can go wrong, they have gone wrong. You give them gold and the moment their unconsciousness touches it, it turns into dust; they have to be constantly reminded how to use it rightly, how not to destroy it.\nAnd one of the greatest problems of life is that light is not destroyed by darkness. Light has no danger from darkness. What can darkness do to light?\nLight is in danger from a false light. The flower has no danger from the leaves and the thorns. The flower has danger from pseudo flowers; the paper flowers, the plastic flowers. And they are cheap and they are easily available. Religion is not in any danger from irreligiousness. Religion is always in danger from pseudo religion. Hence just to say religion is not enough, it has to be preceded by right -- right religion so that you remember always, so that you can always check and be absolute certain before you start moving into anything, whether it is false or right, whether it is pseudo or real.\nThe pseudo victory is through violence and the right victory is through love. The pseudo victory is enforced on the other. The right victory is never enforced on the other; on the contrary there is no effort to enforce anything at all. Not in the least, not even in any indirect, subtle way. There is no desire to impose anything. But when you love deeply, victory comes on its own accord.\nLove is victorious and it brings right victory because it does not destroy the other. On the contrary, it enhances the other. It makes the other more valuable, it makes the other's freedom more solid, more crystallized.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation gives you an insight into rightness. Then you can apply that rightness to all dimensions of life. Then whatsoever you do, remember, it should not be false and pseudo, it should not be a pretension; it should be authentic and true. And once you start living a life of truth, there is great joy! Joy follows truth like a shadow. Now start meditating. Good.\n(To Koya) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Vandan. Prem means love. Vandan means prayer.\nThe only prayer worth calling prayer is love; All other prayers are only so-called prayers.\nThey are pseudo, they are just poor substitutes: Because people cannot love, they pray.\nOf course their prayer gives them A certain consolation.\nMan is so cunning in deceiving others\nThat ultimately he starts deceiving himself. He cannot love human beings\nSo he starts loving humanity. Now that is a strategy:\nThe mind is befooling you.\nWhere you are going to find humanity? Whenever you will find\nYou will always find a concrete human being. Humanity is only an abstract concept\nJust an idea -- you cannot love an idea But it is easy to love an idea\nBecause it creates no trouble\nYou are not expected to sacrifice anything, You can remain the same and you can brag That you are a great lover of humanity.\nPeople who cannot love existence\nStart loving god.\nNow existence is here now\nAnd god is just in your mind, just a concept. It does not exist but it is easy to love god.\nIt is difficult to love a tree: Even a tree\nWill create trouble for you if you love the tree Because it has its own moods.\nAnd if you love a tree\nYou are risking many things because One day the tree can die --\nThat is the greatest risk And you will be left alone And you will feel empty. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPeople are afraid of love.\nIt is easy to love god. God never dies, Because god never is in the first place. It is impossible\nFor something that does not exist to die. Friedrich Nietzsche declared\nIn the beginning of this century That god is dead.\nAnd I say he was utterly wrong\nBecause god can be dead only if he was alive! He has never been alive in the first place.\nNietzsche must have been\nA far more religious man that I am. At least he believed\nThat god has lived up to now.. And he gave a long life to god,\nSince the very beginning, almost an eternity. He does not allow any future to him\nBut he allows the past. But I say to you\nThat god neither has a past nor future. Godliness is true\nBut god is only a philosophical concept. Hence Buddha\nWho was the most enlightened man in the world Never talked of god.\nHe certainly talked about godliness\nBut to love godliness, you will have to love All the manifestations: The river, the mountain The stars, the people, the animals...\nAnd I call this love prayer.\nThe people who pray in the churches In the temples, in the mosques\nAre simply deceiving themselves and nobody else. They are simply wasting their time.\nIt has no more value that playing cards; Playing cards is a mundane way\nOf wasting your time\nAnd going to a church on the Sunday Is a religious way of wasting your time.\nBut a real religious man lives his prayer. It is a question of living, breathing.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBreathe prayer, live prayer\nLove this beautiful existence, And it is through this love You will become aware\nOf the immense presence of godliness everywhere. And I repeat again: not of god but of godliness.\n(To Tomoko) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Prartho. Anand means bliss. Prartho means prayer.\nTo be blissful is to be prayerful.\nTo live blissfully, is a dancing way, Enjoying each moment of life\nIs the way of sannyas.\nI am not against the world, not against life.\nI am in tremendous love with the world and life And I teach my sannyasins\nTo be great lovers of life.\nDance with the wind, dance when it is raining Dance with the trees\nAnd you will be surprised that Religion is not in the scriptures, It is spread all over existence From the dance of a peacock\nOr a cuckoo calling from a faraway distance Or somebody playing on a flute.\nReligion is not something dead And scriptures are all dead.\nReligion is very much alive And you have to be alive To make contact with it.\nIf you live in misery, you live in death, If you live in bliss\nYou become more and more alive. When your bliss reaches to a peak\nTo an orgasmic peak, then you contact existence. And that contact gives you the proof\nThat live is not only matter but something more. And that something more is indefinable.\nYou can call it XYZ, enlightenment, tao, Truth, godliness, but these\nAre just words to indicate to something Which cannot be contained in any word. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe only way to know it is through bliss. So here, learn to be blissful.\nThis is not a place to be sad and serious. This is a place to be playful\nThis is a place to take life as fun And death too as fun!\n(To Michael) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Gitam. Prem means love; gitam means a song -- a love song.\nThat's all one needs to become And life is fulfilled!\nIf one is not able to become a song Life remains empty, meaningless. And people try\nTo become everything except a song.\nThey want to become rich, powerful, famous But in becoming rich\nIn becoming politically powerful\nIn becoming famous they lose all qualities That can make their life joyous;\nThey lose all cheerfulness, they become serious They have to become serious because\nThe things that they are trying to achieve Are competitive, they are all ego trips, And ego is a very serious thing.\nEgo never takes anything as fun.\nFun seems to be dangerous for the ego. Ego is never playful, it is very serious. Hence egoists tend to become saints Because that seems to be the easiest way To become powerful, respected, famous -- And without losing your seriousness at all:\nIn fact, you can become more and more serious As you become a bigger saint.\nBut you become more and more dead too... Have you ever seen a dead man laughing? Dead men are very serious, bound to be!\nThey can't laugh. That will be out of place. And they follow all the manners\nThat dead people should follow.\nThere is a famous story about a Sufi mystic\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWho was a great philosopher also. He was always worried that,\n'How I will know when I die that I am dead?' Philosophers are always worried\nAbout such stupid things.\nHis wife told him, 'This is all nonsense, I don't think this is philosophy because When you are dead, you will know.' But the man said, 'How?\nHow I will be certain that I am really dead?' The wife said, 'You will know because\nYou will become cold. So don't bother me! You will know perfectly well.\nYou will become cold.'\nSo he said, 'Okay. If this is an indication Then the problem is solved.'\nOne day he was in the forest and lost the way\nAnd it was a cold night\nAnd he started shivering and becoming very cold And he was on his donkey. He told to the donkey, 'Listen -- it seems I am dying.\nThat's what my wife has said\nAnd she has never said anything wrong.\nShe is always right, always I prove to be wrong, So she must be right. So ...\nAnd she had told me that You will know perfectly well\nAnd now I am knowing it perfectly well That everything is becoming cold\nSo goodbye friend! You served me many days And I have to leave you in this jungle\nAnd I don't know what will happen to you, But god will take care of you!'\nSo he lies down underneath a tree Because he thought,\n'That's how dead people are expected to behave.' He has always seen them lying down!\nYou don't see dead people\nRiding on their donkeys or sitting or standing. He remembered -- he has seen many dead people So this is the way how one should behave.\nSo he told to the donkey that,\n'You can stand or whatsoever you want you can do But I have to lie down -- I am dead!'\nAnd of course when he laid himself Down under a tree, he became more cold 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo it was absolutely certain that death has come. At that very moment\nTwo wolves came and attacked the donkey. Now he is seeing.\nHe became very puzzled -- what to do? In such a situation\nWhat a dead man is expected to do?\nThat is the problem: 'Now the wife is not here I cannot ask anybody else.\nMy donkey is being attacked and I am dead!' So at the most he said to the wolves,\n'Listen -- you can do whatsoever you can do But this is not good: having in such a way With a dead man's donkey! Had I been alive I would have taught you a lesson!\nBut now it is too late,\nI cannot do anything else.'\nAnd he said to the donkey, 'Forgive me ,sir. Don't have any expectations from me Because I am dead!'\nDead people have their own manners, etiquette. And one thing is absolutely certain:\nNobody has ever seen a dead man laughing. That seems to be\nAn absolute commandment for dead people: Don't laugh. Laughter is not allowed.\nBut the people who stop laughter\nWhile they are alive, start becoming dead. Rejoice! Rejoice as much as you can,\nBecome more and more alive as much as you can.\nTo me, to be religious means To be overflowing with life So abundantly overflowing\nThat you can share your life with others That you can make a few dead people alive. That should be the way of a sannyasin:\nHe should become himself alive And he should make others alive.\nHe should trigger the process of being alive Into others -- and there are many who are dead There are many who are cold\nWho has lost all warmth, who has lost all love Who has lost all laughter.\n(To Bruno) -- Hello, Bruno! Come here. So finally you have come!\nYes. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's good -- I was waiting for you. Good. This is your name: Swami Veet\nNiten. Veet means going beyond. Niten means morality.\nMorality is not religion. Of course, religious people are moral but the vice versa is not true: moral people are not religious; moral people are simply pretending to be religious. They are wearing a mask, a face. The mask may be beautiful, the face may be beautiful, but it is a veil: it hides your reality. It gives you a beautiful appearance but you lose all track of your authentic being.\nThe moral person lives according to the social dictates. He is not a free man. He lives according to the ten commandments: Do this, don't do that. His whole life is being ruled by others: the powerful, the orthodox, the priest, the politicians, the people who are dominating the establishment. But he is moral only on the surface, his morality is not even skin-deep. If you scratch him a little deeper, immediately his immorality comes up. His unconscious is full of all kinds of scorpions and snakes and all kinds of wild animals. And he is afraid of them, he has repressed them. He is sitting on top of them as if on top of a volcano. And he is very fearful, trembling constantly because the volcano can erupt any moment. His life is a life of misery and he has to live a double kind of life. On the front door he is one person, on the back door, he is a totally different person.\nMy sannyasin has to live a single life, integrated, true to the very core. Whatsoever he is, he is. He has no need of any masks, no desire to hide behind anything. He simply allows himself -- he exposes himself to the world as he is, in his total nudity, without any fear. He stands before god utterly naked. And that is the only way to encounter god, that is the only way to encounter existence. And then a totally different kind of morality arises, which is not imposed from the outside but arises from within one's own heart. It has the touch of your own heartbeats, it has the flavor of your own experience and being. It arises out of your own meditation. It is not your conscience, it is your consciousness. Now you do whatsoever you see is right. You don't do what others say is right; because others are simply repeating cliches handed over to them by others.\nAnd so on, and so forth, for centuries the same cliches have been handed over by people from one generation to another generation. These cliches are like hereditary diseases. And people go on suffering from them.\nTo be a sannyasin means to be free from the past, free from traditions, free from orthodoxies. To be on one's own and to live in freedom, to risk whatsoever the freedom requires. And then slowly slowly your own conscience starts\nfunctioning because you give an opportunity for it to function; it starts responding to challenges that you have to encounter every day in life. Because you don't have any readymade answers --\nyou have to search within. Your intelligence has to function and as your intelligence functions, you grow.\nA religious person becomes moral but his morality is his own. He is the source of it, he is his own authority, he does not believe in any other authority.\nMy function here is not to be an authority to you, but to help you to become your own authority.\nNow you have come forever? That's good. Start working. Good!\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #23\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2950","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2950 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

start meditating. Good.</p><p>(To Koya) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Vandan. Prem means love.
Vandan means prayer.</p><p>The only prayer worth calling prayer is love; All other prayers are
only so-called prayers.</p><p>They are pseudo, they are just poor substitutes: Because people
cannot love, they pray.</p><p>Of course their prayer gives them A certain consolation.</p><p>Man is so cunning in deceiving others</p><p>That ultimately he starts deceiving himself. He cannot love human
beings</p><p>So he starts loving humanity. Now that is a strategy:</p><p>The mind is befooling you.</p><p>Where you are going to find humanity? Whenever you will find</p><p>You will always find a concrete human being. Humanity is only an
abstract concept</p><p>Just an idea -- you cannot love an idea But it is easy to love an
idea</p><p>Because it creates no trouble</p><p>You are not expected to sacrifice anything, You can remain the same
and you can brag That you are a great lover of humanity.</p><p>People who cannot love existence</p><p>Start loving god.</p><p>Now existence is here now</p><p>And god is just in your mind, just a concept. It does not exist but
it is easy to love god.</p><p>It is difficult to love a tree: Even a tree</p><p>Will create trouble for you if you love the tree Because it has its
own moods.</p><p>And if you love a tree</p><p>You are risking many things because One day the tree can die --</p><p>That is the greatest risk And you will be left alone And you will
feel empty. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

first place. It is impossible</p><p>For something that does not exist to die. Friedrich Nietzsche
declared</p><p>In the beginning of this century That god is dead.</p><p>And I say he was utterly wrong</p><p>Because god can be dead only if he was alive! He has never been alive
in the first place.</p><p>Nietzsche must have been</p><p>A far more religious man that I am. At least he believed</p><p>That god has lived up to now.. And he gave a long life to god,</p><p>Since the very beginning, almost an eternity. He does not allow any
future to him</p><p>But he allows the past. But I say to you</p><p>That god neither has a past nor future. Godliness is true</p><p>But god is only a philosophical concept. Hence Buddha</p><p>Who was the <em>most</em> enlightened man in the world Never talked
of god.</p><p>He certainly talked about godliness</p><p>But to love godliness, you will have to love All the manifestations:
The river, the mountain The stars, the people, the animals...</p><p>And I call this love prayer.</p><p>The people who pray in the churches In the temples, in the
mosques</p><p>Are simply deceiving themselves and nobody else. They are simply
wasting their time.</p><p>It has no more value that playing cards; Playing cards is a mundane
way</p><p>Of wasting your time</p><p>And going to a church on the Sunday Is a religious way of wasting
your time.</p><p>But a real religious man lives his prayer. It is a question of
living, breathing.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

become aware</p><p>Of the <em>immense</em> presence of godliness everywhere. And I
repeat again: not of god but of godliness.</p><p>(To Tomoko) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Prartho. Anand means
bliss. Prartho means prayer.</p><p>To be blissful is to be prayerful.</p><p>To live blissfully, is a dancing way, Enjoying each moment of
life</p><p>Is the way of sannyas.</p><p>I am not against the world, not against life.</p><p>I am in tremendous love with the world and life And I teach my
sannyasins</p><p>To be great lovers of life.</p><p>Dance with the wind, dance when it is raining Dance with the
trees</p><p>And you will be surprised that Religion is not in the scriptures, It
is spread all over existence From the dance of a peacock</p><p>Or a cuckoo calling from a faraway distance Or somebody playing on a
flute.</p><p>Religion is not something dead And scriptures are all dead.</p><p>Religion is very much alive And you have to be alive To make contact
with it.</p><p>If you live in misery, you live in death, If you live in bliss</p><p>You become more and more alive. When your bliss reaches to a peak</p><p>To an orgasmic peak, then you contact existence. And that contact
gives you the proof</p><p>That live is not only matter but something more. And that something
more is indefinable.</p><p>You can call it XYZ, enlightenment, tao, Truth, godliness, but
these</p><p>Are just words to indicate to something Which cannot be contained in
any word. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

serious because</p><p>The things that they are trying to achieve Are competitive, they are
all ego trips, And ego is a very serious thing.</p><p>Ego never takes anything as fun.</p><p>Fun seems to be dangerous for the ego. Ego is never playful, it is
very serious. Hence egoists tend to become saints Because that seems to
be the easiest way To become powerful, respected, famous -- And without

man laughing? Dead men are very serious, bound to be!</p><p>They can't laugh. That will be out of place. And they follow all the

worried</p><p>About such stupid things.</p><p>His wife told him, 'This is all nonsense, I don't think this is
philosophy because When you are dead, you will know.' But the man said,
'How?</p><p>How I will be certain that I am really dead?' The wife said, 'You
will know because</p><p>You will become cold. So don't bother me! You will know perfectly
well.</p><p>You will become cold.'</p><p>So he said, 'Okay. If this is an indication Then the problem is
solved.'</p><p>One day he was in the forest and lost the way</p><p>And it was a cold night</p><p>And he started shivering and becoming very cold And he was on his
donkey. He told to the donkey, 'Listen -- it seems I am dying.</p><p>That's what my wife has said</p><p>And she has never said anything wrong.</p><p>She is always right, always I prove to be wrong, So she must be
right. So ...</p><p>And she had told me that You will know perfectly well</p><p>And now I am knowing it perfectly well That everything is becoming
cold</p><p>So goodbye friend! You served me many days And I have to leave you in
this jungle</p><p>And I don't know what will happen to you, But god will take care of
you!'</p><p>So he lies down underneath a tree Because he thought,</p><p>'That's how dead people are expected to behave.' He has always seen
them lying down!</p><p>You don't see dead people</p><p>Riding on their donkeys or sitting or standing. He remembered -- he
has seen many dead people So this is the way how one should behave.</p><p>So he told to the donkey that,</p><p>'You can stand or whatsoever you want you can do But I have to lie
down -- I am dead!'</p><p>And of course when he laid himself Down under a tree, he became more
cold 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

moment</p><p>Two wolves came and attacked the donkey. Now he is seeing.</p><p>He became very puzzled -- what to do? In such a situation</p><p>What a dead man is expected to do?</p><p>That is the problem: 'Now the wife is not here I cannot ask anybody
else.</p><p>My donkey is being attacked and I am dead!' So at the most he said to
the wolves,</p><p>'Listen -- you can do whatsoever you can do But this is not good:
having in such a way With a dead man's donkey! Had I been alive I would
have taught you a lesson!</p><p>But now it is too late,</p><p>I cannot do anything else.'</p><p>And he said to the donkey, 'Forgive me ,sir. Don't have any
expectations from me Because I am dead!'</p><p>Dead people have their own manners, etiquette. And one thing is
absolutely certain:</p><p>Nobody has ever seen a dead man laughing. That seems to be</p><p>An absolute commandment for dead people: Don't laugh. Laughter is not
allowed.</p><p>But the people who stop laughter</p><p>While they are alive, start becoming dead. Rejoice! Rejoice as much
as you can,</p><p>Become more and more alive as much as you can.</p><p>To me, to be religious means To be overflowing with life So
abundantly overflowing</p><p>That you can share your life with others That you can make a few dead
people alive. That should be the way of a sannyasin:</p><p>He should become himself alive And he should make others alive.</p><p>He should trigger the process of being alive Into others -- and there
are many who are dead There are many who are cold</p><p>Who has lost all warmth, who has lost all love Who has lost all
laughter.</p><p>(To Bruno) -- Hello, Bruno! Come here. So finally you have come!</p><p>Yes. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

Veet</p><p>Niten. Veet means going beyond. Niten means morality.</p><p>Morality is not religion. Of course, religious people are moral but
the vice versa is not true: moral people are not religious; moral people
are simply pretending to be religious. They are wearing a mask, a face.
The mask may be beautiful, the face may be beautiful, but it is a veil:
it hides your reality. It gives you a beautiful appearance but you lose
all track of your authentic being.</p><p>The moral person lives according to the social dictates. He is not a
free man. He lives according to the ten commandments: Do this, don't do
that. His whole life is being ruled by others: the powerful, the
orthodox, the priest, the politicians, the people who are dominating the
establishment. But he is moral only on the surface, his morality is not
even skin-deep. If you scratch him a little deeper, immediately his
immorality comes up. His unconscious is full of all kinds of scorpions
and snakes and all kinds of wild animals. And he is afraid of them, he
has repressed them. He is sitting on top of them as if on top of a
volcano. And he is very fearful, trembling constantly because the
volcano can erupt any moment. His life is a life of misery and he has to
live a double kind of life. On the front door he is one person, on the
back door, he is a totally different person.</p><p>My sannyasin has to live a single life, integrated, true to the very
core. Whatsoever he is, he is. He has no need of any masks, no desire to
hide behind anything. He simply allows himself -- he exposes himself to
the world as he is, in his total nudity, without any fear. He stands
before god utterly naked. And that is the only way to encounter god,
that is the only way to encounter existence. And then a totally
different kind of morality arises, which is not imposed from the outside
but arises from within one's own heart. It has the touch of your own
heartbeats, it has the flavor of your own experience and being. It
arises out of your own meditation. It is not your conscience, it is your
consciousness. Now you do whatsoever you see is right. You don't do what
others say is right; because others are simply repeating cliches handed
over to them by others.</p><p>And so on, and so forth, for centuries the same cliches have been
handed over by people from one generation to another generation. These
cliches are like hereditary diseases. And people go on suffering from
them.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means to be free from the past, free from
traditions, free from orthodoxies. To be on one's own and to live in
freedom, to risk whatsoever the freedom requires. And then slowly slowly
your own conscience starts</p><p>functioning because you give an opportunity for it to function; it
starts responding to challenges that you have to encounter every day in
life. Because you don't have any readymade answers --</p><p>you have to search within. Your intelligence has to function and as
your intelligence functions, you grow.</p><p>A religious person becomes moral but his morality is his own. He is
the source of it, he is his own authority, he does not believe in any
other authority.</p><p>My function here is not to be an authority to you, but to help you to
become your own authority.</p><p>Now you have come forever? That's good. Start working. Good!</p><h3 style=padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #23</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Franco. Anand means bliss. Franco means freedom.\nBliss is freedom and vice versa is also true: freedom is bliss. In fact they are inseparable -- two sides of the same coin. If you are blissful you are bound to be free, if you are free you cannot be other than blissful.\nFreedom and misery can't exist together, neither can bliss and bondage exist together. Attain to one and the other follows. And one can enter from any door, both the doors are the same, they lead to the same shrine.\nBuddha enters from the door of freedom, so does Mahavira -- hence their\nultimate truth is freedom; not god, not bliss, not love, but moksha. Moksha exactly means what Franco means: absolute freedom, infinite freedom with no conditions attached to it. But people have entered from the door of bliss too.\nJesus enters from the door of bliss. Hence he says again and again to his disciples, \"Rejoice, rejoice! I say again and again to you, rejoice!\"\nThe Upanishadic mystics in India entered from the door of bliss. Hence their ultimate god, the ultimate idea of god is satchidanand: truth, consciousness, bliss. Bliss is the ultimate. Even truth is lower, even consciousness is lower. That is their trinity: truth, consciousness, bliss -- but bliss is the very pinnacle.\nThe door that you enter through becomes your experience of the ultimate and, of course, your expression of the ultimate too. Hence there are so many expressions, different expressions, but they are all aspects of the same phenomenon of the same reality. Once this is understood then the message of Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra is only verbally different, conceptually different -- not in reality. Their words are different because they have entered from different doors. Their language is different but not the content. Their containers are different but not the content. It is the same message, the same truth, the same freedom, the same bliss.\nThe real seeker of truth cannot be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Buddhist for the simple reason that there are not two truths. You cannot make a cult out of truth, you cannot make a creed out of truth. All dogmas are anti-truth and all churches are anti-truth. The real seeker becomes free of all creeds, churches, theologies. He drops that whole rubbish, he simply moves into his own innermost being -- in silence, prayerfully, singing and dancing. And the goal is not far away, it is very close-by. We are carrying it within our own selves.\n(To Lorenzo) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Lorenzo.\nDhyan means meditation. Lorenzo symbolizes two things; One is victory, another is immortality -- and both are attained through victory.\nMeditation does not mean concentration -- remember. Millions of people\nLive under the wrong impression\nThat meditation means concentration. And if one starts\nWith a wrong concept from the very beginning Then the whole journey goes wrong.\nThe first step is the most important step It is almost half the journey.\nIf the first step is right\nThe second follows it automatically. And the first step is\nTo understand precisely and exactly What meditation is all about.\nIt is not concentration. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nConcentration is something of the mind And meditation is going beyond the mind. Concentration is needed in scientific work; You have to focus your mind\nOn one thing exclusively.\nYou cannot include many things otherwise Those many things will become distractions. You have to exclude everything out\nYou have to bracket everything out\nYou have to focus as closely as possible On one point.\nThey define science as Knowing about less and less. If that is true\nThen ultimate science will be defined as Knowing everything about nothing.\nMeditation means\nNot excluding anything out of your vision Not bracketing out anything\nBut including everything. It is inclusive It is not afraid of distraction.\nThe whistle of the railway train, a dog barking The horn of a car, the traffic noise\nThe birds , the people, the children playing Somebody shouting, somebody singing -- Everything is included in it;\nYou are simply a witness of it all\nNot concentrating on anything in particular Just a diffused awareness\nJust being watchful, whatsoever is happening. All doors and all windows are open\nAnd you are available to everything.\nIn concentration distraction is bound to happen But in meditation\nThere is no possibility of distraction Because meditation is vast enough To include destructions also.\nThat's the beauty of meditation:\nYou cannot disturb a meditator -- impossible. That is impossible\nFrom the very definition of meditation. If he is disturbed, that simply means He was concentrating, not meditating;\nHe has not yet understood what meditation is. If you concentrate then naturally, anything else 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTrying to get your attention is a destruction; You cannot think of two things simultaneously So when you think of the other\nYou miss the first,\nFor the moment you are no more there. But meditation is not thinking at all\nHence everything is included, simultaneously, And existence is simultaneous, remember; Thinking is linear.\nIf somebody asks you, 'What happened today In darshan, when you were taking initiation? How many people were there?'\nThe description will be linear, A B C D, that way\nBut they are all present here, simultaneously. In description\nThey will not be present simultaneously.\nA will be followed by B\nB will be followed by C\nC will be followed by D;\nThinking is linear, one-dimensional, And reality is multi-dimensional, Reality is simultaneous\nIt is all happening, all together.\nA meditator allows this simultaneousness And becomes simply watchful, serene, silent Alert, but not focussing at all.\nJust the other day I was reading a joke.\nTwo girls from a village came to a big town. The first thing they wanted to\nWas to be photographed\nSo they went to the photographer -- That was their first experience of life\nOf being photographed. The photographer Threw his black cloth over his head Looked inside his camera...\nOne girl asked the other, 'What is he doing?' The other said, 'He is going to focus?'\nSo the first said, 'Both of us?'\nFirst he should photograph and then\nHe can do whatsoever he wants... But not right now!\nMeditation is not focussing.\nIt is just awareness, just watchfulness\nAnd out of it these both things are possible: You will become victorious over yourself 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd you will come to know that you are immortal. Not that you have to believe in immortality --\nNo belief is needed; it becomes your experience. As you go deeper into awareness\nYou become aware of both the things:\nA deep inner victory, a sense of victoriousness That you have conquered the inner world That you have come home, that there is Nothing more beautiful than this\nNothing higher than this\nNothing more precious that this --\nWhat Jesus calls the kingdom of god, You have conquered it.\nKnowing it is conquering it\nAnd at the same moment suddenly you become aware That you were never born and you will never die.\nYou belong to eternity, not to time. Meditation takes you beyond the mind -- Time belongs to mind.\nOnce you are beyond mind, time disappears, You become part of eternity.\n-- How long you will be here?\n-- I don't know.\n-- Be here as long as possible.\n-- I didn't get what Lorenzo means -- I was too much in...\n-- What Lorenzo means?\n-- Victory...\n-- Huh?\n-- Victory.\n-- Ah, victory!!\n-- And immortality...\n-- And?\n-- Immortality.\n-- Oh, okay!\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #30\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1393","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part29/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1393 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part29.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Oliver means a peaceful heart.\nIt is easy to be blissful without being peaceful It is also easy to be peaceful\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWithout being blissful.\nThe problem and the challenge is To be both together.\nAnd unless one is both together One remains half, incomplete. When both are together, Merging, melting into each other That it is absolutely impossible\nEven to demarcate which is which, Then only a person is total,\nThen only one is whole\nAnd to be whole is to be holy. Because it was easy to be peaceful\nMany religions chose it, just to be peaceful Hence the escapist tendency for centuries Has prevailed in religions:\nEscape from the world because\nIf you are in the world the peace is disturbed There are thousand and one\nCauses for disturbance; it is better\nTo go to the mountains, to the monasteries Disappear behind the walls of a monastery Avoid all provocations, temptations\nAnd remain peaceful.\nSlowly slowly it becomes a habit But that peace it cold,\nIt is almost like death.\nHence if you go to an old monastery\nYou will find people like corpses, utterly cold; Peaceful, but no joy, no dance, no song.\nIt is the peace of the cemetery\nIt is a kind a suicide: Escape is suicide. Life is in the world and real peace\nHas to happen in the world, not outside it. Few schools of mystics\nHave chosen the other part, to be blissful. For example, Sufis: they live in the world In fact it is very difficult\nTo find out who is a Sufi because\nThey live in the world in the ordinary way. The only thing that can create suspicion in you That something is special about them\nIt their blissfulness; they are always\nIn a kind of ecstasy, a certain excitement 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSomething is happening inside them. But because it is not peaceful\nThat excitement creates a state of fever\nIt becomes to hot, they become almost mad. Hence only in Sufis\nThere is a certain state of mystics called The mad ones, the mastas.\nIt can't happen in a Catholic monastery\nIt can't happen in the life of a Jaina monk It can't happen to a Buddhist,\nIt can happen only to a Sufi:\nHe can go mad because he becomes to excited And there is nothing to hold him back.\nThe excitement reaches to such an extreme That it is maddening!\nHe is very alive, but it is not a state of health Something is berserk about it\nSomething is crazy about it.\nHe looks drugged, stoned.\nMy effort here is to bring a synthesis:\nOne should be blissful and peaceful together. Then the peace will prevent any kind of madness And the bliss will prevent any kind of death.\nThe peace will keep you cool\nAnd the bliss will keep you warm.\nAnd when you are cool and warm together There is tremendous beauty\nYour life is silent\nYet there is a song in that silence.\nTo me that is the ultimate goal of sannyas.\n(To Eldine) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Amrita. Anand means bliss. Amrita means nectar.\nThe experience of bliss\nIs the experience of immortality;\nThey are not two things, they are not separate. They are not separable.\nOnce you have tasted bliss\nYou have also tasted the deathless in you. Bliss is possible only\nWhen you reach to the very center of your being And that center is beyond death, beyond birth.\nIt does not exist in time\nIt does not exist in space either, It is beyond both.\nIt is non-temporal, non spatial\nIt is eternity itself; in other words:\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is godliness, it is divineness.\nMan's whole neurosis consists of fear. Fear of death\nIs the root cause of all other fears, Other fears are just branches.\nBut if you go to the root of any fear You will find death somewhere Hidden behind.\nHence the mystery, the anxiety, the anguish. Even though one has money, power, prestige\nEverything -- but something is missing: one knows All these things will go down the drain\nOne knows 'I am myself going down the drain Every day, every moment.\nOne knows that this life is unreliable; Tomorrow I may not be at all.'\nHence there is a shadow of death Continuously following you\nAnd there is no way to escape from it; Wherever you go it is with you.\nThere is only one way to get rid of it And that is to go within\nNowhere else but within.\nThat is the way of meditation: going inwards Tasting your own subjectivity\nGoing slowly slowly out of the mind In a state of no-mind\nWhere you are only conscious\nAnd these is nothing to be conscious about; No object remains, only pure subjectivity Just a mirror reflecting nothing.\nIn that very moment, bliss explodes!\nIt is just like atomic explosion: you become Full of light and full of joy and full of life And life that knows no beginning and no end And light that once known remains forever. Hence I say, to know bliss is the same\nAs to know immortality. That's why everybody\nIs seeking and searching for bliss.\nIt is really the search for immortality. All the religions are nothing but Groping for something deathless Because unless the deathless is found Man remains in misery.\nThere is no other way, there is no other remedy. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn these five thousand years men have found everything that he thought may be helpful\nBut nothing seems to help.\nNow science has provided everything: Better health, longer life\nBetter roads, better houses, better technology Gadgets, everything -- but man remains\nIn the same anguish as he was in the jungles No difference at all; in fact today\nMan is more miserable than he was ever before For the simple reason that before there was hope. Now even that hope is gone.\nNow we know, even science cannot help. Just three hundred years before\nPeople were very excited:\nDarwin and others were very excited Because they were thinking,\n'Now, we are just very close to find the secret.' Even in the beginning of this century Scientists were so full of hope and optimism That the goal is very close by,\nJust be the corner -- we have already arrived, Now every misery will end.\nAnd we have found many secrets of ;matter And man is in a far more mess\nThan he was ever before. Now it is for the first time That man can turn inwards But very few individuals:\nA Jesus, a Buddha, a Zarathustra\nBecause it needed great intelligence to see That all that is outside is futile.\nBut now even those\nWho are not that much intelligent They can see the point, that all is futile. You can have the biggest house\nYou can have a palace\nYou can have all the money and still, You don't have anything:\nDeath is there, continuously following you. It will snatch away everything\nIt will crush you any moment.\nYou are not protected, you are not secure. You can have the insurance policy but\nThat makes no sense.\nNothing is secure, nothing is safe Hence there is a trembling inside. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is only through meditation\nThat this trembling disappears because One come to know something\nThat nothing can destroy, no fire can burn it. That is your innermost being\nThat is you, you reality -- Call it the soul, the self, god.\nTo know it is to know bliss, is to know peace To know it to enter\nInto a world of celebration.\nThe same energies that were becoming anxieties Start turning into dance.\n(To Joe) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyanam. Anand means bliss. Dhyanam means meditation.\nBliss is the goal of life, Knowingly, unknowingly Consciously, unconsciously We are all searching for bliss.\nNot only human, beings: animals, birds Trees, even rocks --\nThe whole existence is a search for bliss. But only man is conscious enough\nTo penetrate into that ultimate mystery. But not all man either\nBecause very few people are really conscious. The majority lives like a robots.\nMeditation is a process of transforming Your mechanicalness into consciousness.\nChanging your robotlike existence into awareness. Meditation can be defined\nAs a scientific method of de-automatisation Otherwise we have all become automatic.\nWe function like machines: Push a button here Push a button there and things go.\nSometimes you run out of gas\nSometimes buttons get mixed up Sometimes wires are loose\nThen we call a man is mad;\nThen we have to send him to the workshop -- We call it the hospital or the mental asylum, We have to give him electric shocks.\nThat is just to shake him with the hope that Maybe just shaking him may put his wires right. It is hooping for the best\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd expecting the worse because\nIt is just accidental; Sometimes it happens: A good shock may put your things right Sometimes it may not work.\nIt is all depending on one approach: The whole modern psychology\nNinety per cent of it is rooted in the idea That man is also a machine.\nEven Darwin will be shocked. At least he used to think that\nMan has come out of the monkeys. Even he will be shocked\nBecause Skinner and Pavlov don't think That man is that great;\nHe is just another kind of machine, So are the monkey!\nMeditation is the only way\nTo give you an experience, a glimpse that You are not a machine\nThat you are something more, far more. And the moment the first glimpse happens The first window opens\nThe first fresh breeze comes in, Your life becomes blissful.\nYou feel for the first time to be really born. That's the whole function of sannyas: a rebirth.\n(To Ulrike) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Karuna. Anand means bliss. Karuna means compassion.\nThere are two kinds of compassion possible. One is concerned with the misery of the other person: you feel compassionate because the other is miserable; it is\nother-oriented. The other kind of compassion is: you feel compassionate because you are full of bliss; it has no reference with the other. It is self-oriented.\nThe first kind of compassion is called service. That's what Christian missionaries go on doing. In fact it is ugly. Although it serves a certain purpose but deep down it is based on an ugly idea: you are exploiting the other person's misery. In fact, if nobody is miserable in the world, one wonders: what Christian missionaries will do then? They will be at a loss! They will be really in great misery because there will be nothing to do, no way to reach to paradise, the whole ladder is taken away.\nIn the East we have developed the second kind of compassion which is authentic compassion. It has nothing to do with the other's misery; it has something to do with your bliss. You are so full of bliss that you want to share it. It does not matter whether the other is miserable or not, it has no relationship with others'\nmisery. You are not exploiting the other's misery for your own spiritual ends. You are not using the other as a means; it is not service, it is sharing.\nAnd my effort here is to help you get rid of the idea of service and to shift your whole consciousness towards sharing: share your joy, your love, your bliss, but don't feel that you are serving the other, because that creates a subtle ego. You start feeling holier-than-thou, you start feeling you are doing a great service to humanity, that you are attaining some virtue, that your heaven is becoming guaranteed -- and that is all nonsense! The very ego is going to prevent you, the very ego will drown you!\nThe man of real compassion is not a man of service. He is a man, certainly of great sharing, but he has no idea that he is doing something good for you. He does not even expect any thankfulness from you. On the contrary, he feels thankful to you that you accepted his joy, that you accepted his love, that you are generous enough to allow him to share his compassion.\nThis second kind of compassion is true spirituality, but it has no idea of being spiritual at all. And that is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe meaning of your name; let it become the meaning of your life too: be a blissful compassion.\n(To Dorothea) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Chandrika Anand means bliss. Chandrika means moonlight.\nBliss is not like the sun\nIt is more like the moonlight; It is cool and soothing.\nThe sun is hot, the sun is fire\nThe moon is not fire, the moon is a miracle; It receives the sun rays\nAnd transforms them into coolness.\nThe moon represents the whole process of alchemy. We are born with the sun energy --\nThat is our sexuality\nIt is sun energy, it is fire\nAnd unless it passes through meditation It remains fire.\nMeditation functions like the moon: Once the sun energy passes Through the meditative process\nSlowly slowly its whole nature is transformed:\nIt becomes cool, soothing, it becomes a beauty. You cannot stare at the sun directly --\nIt will burn your eyes.\nBut you can stare at the moon -- It will cure your eyes\nIt will give you more insight. It is not an accident\nThat many enlightened people\nBecame enlightened on the full-moon night. On the full-moon night\nIt is not only the ocean that is affected;\nDeep down something in man's consciousness Is also affected.\nIf you cannot contain it, you can go mad. That's why many people go mad\nOn the full-moon night\nHence in all the languages of the world Words like 'lunatic' exist.\nLunatic means struck by the moon. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe madman is called lunatic -- Not sunstruck but moonstruck. He was not able to contain\nHe was not meditative enough He missed the point, otherwise\nHe may have moved into a new dimension.\nThe breakdown may have proved a breakthrough; He may have become enlightened\nBu he became simply mad\nBecause the meditative bridge was missing. Many more people commit suicide\nOn the full-moon night, remember Than on any other night: The moon\nHas immense impact on human consciousness but It can be destructive if there is no meditation.\nBut if meditation is there,\nIf you know how to be silent\nIf you know how to absorb its energy If you know how to be in tune with it\nIf you know how to be without thoughts, Then madness becomes enlightenment Then suicide becomes sannyas.\nCertainly you die but\nYou are immediately reborn on a far higher plane. My sannyas is simple in a way.\nMy whole emphasis is on meditation. Because it is the only science\nTo transform your sun energies into moon energies To transform your heart energy into cool energies To transform the lower into the higher\nTo transform the base metal into gold.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #19\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2713","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2713 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

branches.</p><p>But if you go to the root of any fear You will find death somewhere
Hidden behind.</p><p>Hence the mystery, the anxiety, the anguish. Even though one has
money, power, prestige</p><p>Everything -- but something is missing: one knows All these things
will go down the drain</p><p>One knows 'I am myself going down the drain Every day, every
moment.</p><p>One knows that this life is unreliable; Tomorrow I may not be at

you.</p><p>There is only one way to get rid of it And that is to go within</p><p>Nowhere else but within.</p><p>That is the way of meditation: going inwards Tasting your own
subjectivity</p><p>Going slowly slowly out of the mind In a state of no-mind</p><p>Where you are only conscious</p><p>And these is nothing to be conscious about; No object remains, only
pure subjectivity Just a mirror reflecting nothing.</p><p>In that very moment, bliss explodes!</p><p>It is just like atomic explosion: you become Full of light and full
of joy and full of life And life that knows no beginning and no end And
light that once known remains forever. Hence I say, to know bliss is the
same</p><p>As to know immortality. That's why everybody</p><p>Is seeking and searching for bliss.</p><p>It is really the search for immortality. All the religions are
nothing but Groping for something deathless Because unless the deathless

your things right Sometimes it may not work.</p><p>It is all depending on one approach: The whole modern psychology</p><p>Ninety per cent of it is rooted in the idea That man is also a
machine.</p><p>Even Darwin will be shocked. At least he used to think that</p><p>Man has come out of the monkeys. Even he will be shocked</p><p>Because Skinner and Pavlov don't think That man is that great;</p><p>He is just another kind of machine, So are the monkey!</p><p>Meditation is the only way</p><p>To give you an experience, a glimpse that You are not a machine</p><p>That you are something more, <em>far</em> more. And the moment the
first glimpse happens The first window opens</p><p>The first fresh breeze comes in, Your life becomes blissful.</p><p>You feel for the first time to be really born. That's the whole
function of sannyas: a rebirth.</p><p>(To Ulrike) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Karuna. Anand means bliss.
Karuna means compassion.</p><p>There are two kinds of compassion possible. One is concerned with the
misery of the other person: you feel compassionate because the other is
miserable; it is</p><p>other-oriented. The other kind of compassion is: you feel
compassionate because you are full of bliss; it has no reference with
the other. It is self-oriented.</p><p>The first kind of compassion is called service. That's what Christian
missionaries go on doing. In fact it is ugly. Although it serves a
certain purpose but deep down it is based on an ugly idea: you are
exploiting the other person's misery. In fact, if nobody is miserable in
the world, one wonders: what Christian missionaries will do then? They
will be at a loss! They will be really in great misery because there
will be nothing to do, no way to reach to paradise, the whole ladder is
taken away.</p><p>In the East we have developed the second kind of compassion which is
authentic compassion. It has nothing to do with the other's misery; it
has something to do with your bliss. You are so full of bliss that you
want to share it. It does not matter whether the other is miserable or
not, it has no relationship with others'</p><p>misery. You are not exploiting the other's misery for your own
spiritual ends. You are not using the other as a means; it is not
service, it is sharing.</p><p>And my effort here is to help you get rid of the idea of service and
to shift your whole consciousness towards sharing: share your joy, your
love, your bliss, but don't feel that you are serving the other, because
that creates a subtle ego. You start feeling holier-than-thou, you start
feeling you are doing a great service to humanity, that you are
attaining some virtue, that your heaven is becoming guaranteed -- and
that is all nonsense! The very ego is going to prevent you, the very ego
will drown you!</p><p>The man of real compassion is not a man of service. He is a man,
certainly of great sharing, but he has no idea that he is doing
something good for you. He does not even expect any thankfulness from
you. On the contrary, he feels thankful to you that you accepted his
joy, that you accepted his love, that you are generous enough to allow
him to share his compassion.</p><p>This second kind of compassion is true spirituality, but it has no
idea of being spiritual at all. And that is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

be a blissful compassion.</p><p>(To Dorothea) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Chandrika Anand means
bliss. Chandrika means moonlight.</p><p>Bliss is not like the sun</p><p>It is more like the moonlight; It is cool and soothing.</p><p>The sun is hot, the sun is fire</p><p>The moon is not fire, the moon is a miracle; It receives the sun
rays</p><p>And transforms them into coolness.</p><p>The moon represents the whole process of alchemy. We are born with
the sun energy --</p><p>That is our sexuality</p><p>It is sun energy, it is fire</p><p>And unless it passes through meditation It remains fire.</p><p>Meditation functions like the moon: Once the sun energy passes
Through the meditative process</p><p>Slowly slowly its whole nature is transformed:</p><p>It becomes cool, soothing, it becomes a beauty. You cannot stare at
the sun directly --</p><p>It will burn your eyes.</p><p>But you can stare at the moon -- It will cure your eyes</p><p>It will give you more insight. It is not an accident</p><p>That many enlightened people</p><p>Became enlightened on the full-moon night. On the full-moon night</p><p>It is not only the ocean that is affected;</p><p>Deep down something in man's consciousness Is also affected.</p><p>If you cannot contain it, you can go mad. That's why many people go
mad</p><p>On the full-moon night</p><p>Hence in all the languages of the world Words like 'lunatic'
exist.</p><p>Lunatic means struck by the moon. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-7>Osho's books on

not able to contain</p><p>He was not meditative enough He missed the point, otherwise</p><p>He may have moved into a new dimension.</p><p>The breakdown may have proved a breakthrough; He may have become
enlightened</p><p>Bu he became simply mad</p><p>Because the meditative bridge was missing. Many more people commit
suicide</p><p>On the full-moon night, remember Than on any other night: The
moon</p><p>Has immense impact on human consciousness but It can be destructive
if there is no meditation.</p><p>But if meditation is there,</p><p>If you know how to be silent</p><p>If you know how to absorb its energy If you know how to be in tune
with it</p><p>If you know how to be without thoughts, Then madness becomes
enlightenment Then suicide becomes sannyas.</p><p>Certainly you die but</p><p>You are immediately reborn on a far higher plane. My sannyas is
simple in a way.</p><p>My whole emphasis is on meditation. Because it is the only
science</p><p>To transform your sun energies into moon energies To transform your
heart energy into cool energies To transform the lower into the
higher</p><p>To transform the base metal into gold.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #19</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

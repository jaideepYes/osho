It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Klaus) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Klaus. Prem means love. Klaus means a victorious heart.\nThe whole structure of the society\nIs against the heart; it trains the head\nIt disciplines the head, it educates the head. It neglects and ignores the heart\nFor the simple reason\nBecause the heart is a dangerous phenomenon. The head is a machine.\nMachines are never rebellious, they cannot be. They simply follow the orders.\nMachines are good in that way -- they are obedient Hence the state, the church, the parents\nEverybody is interested in the head. It is convenient for all.\nThe heart creates inconvenience\nFor the status quo, for the established order Of things, for the vested interest.\nHead functions through logic 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt can be convinced for certain purposes It can be argued, persuaded, conditioned.\nIt can be made Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan It can be made Communist, Fascist, Socialist.\nAnything can be done with the head. And whatsoever you feed the head It goes on repeating it.\nIt can't bring a single thing new It is never original.\nThe heart lives through love And love cannot be conditioned. It is essentially rebellion.\nOne never knows where love will lead you. It is unpredictable, it is spontaneous\nIt never repeats the old\nIt always responds to the present moment. The heart lives in the present\nThe head lives in the past, hence the head\nIs always traditional, conventional and the heart Is always revolutionary, rebellious.\nBut you can be victorious only though the heart Through love, not though logic.\nYour victory means\nThe defeat of all the structures That have been imposed upon you. Their victory means your defeat Hence there is a subtle struggle\nBetween the individual and the collective.\nAnd a sannyasin has to be aware of that struggle Because to be a sannyasin means you are moving\nTowards being your own self, whatsoever the cost. Sannyas means\nNow you are not going to be ruled by the mass By the crowd, by the objective mind.\nSannyas means\nThat now you will live into your own light According to your own vision; your are ready Even to commit mistakes, even to go astray But you will not lose your independence.\nAnd the miracle is that\nWhen you rebel against the crowd psychology And you become more and more independent Suddenly you start feeling that\nYou are becoming one with the whole With the universal.\nSo these are the three things:\nThe collective, the mass, the crowd, The tradition, the church, the state, The individual and the universal.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe individual is a passage, is a bridge From the collective to the universal.\nIt frees you first from the collective\nAnd once you are free from the collective There is no need for you to be an individual. You can dissolve into the whole.\nThat is the miracle of individuality: It frees you first from the collective\nAnd then, it dies in its own accord because Its needs are fulfilled, it is no more needed. It is medicinal, it kills the disease\nThen you drop the medicine.\nYour true victory means god's victory Your true victory means god has won Over the collective, over the dead.\nBut you will have to pass through A process of individuation.\nIt looks paradoxical:\nThe sannyasin first has to become an individual --\nThat's what all the growth groups are meant here. They are to help you\nTo become more authentic individuals, to free you From all the social nonsense, rubbish.\nOnce you are freed from the social rubbish And you start feeling yourself alive\nAs an individual, then the second work Has to be done by meditative process:\nThey dissolve your individuality. First become free from the society And then become free from the self.\nAnd to be in the no-self, in the no-mind Is to be in god -- that is our victory.\nThen there is no misery, no anguish Then all is joy and bliss and peace And it is eternal, it is forever.\n(To Iris) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Iris.\nAnand means bliss; Iris means rainbow -- a bliss rainbow. Bliss is never one-dimensional\nIt is multi-dimensional.\nIt is not like a solo guitarist\nIt is an orchestra.\nThe solo player has its own beauty But it is one-dimensional.\nThe solo flute player 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nCertainly has its own place but it is not so rich. When it becomes part of a big orchestra\nThen there is great richness. The rainbow represents\nAll the seven planes of being All the seven possibilities.\nMan consists of seven planes.\nThe lowest is sex and the highest is samadhi. And between those two\nThere are five other centers.\nFrom sex one has to move upwards towards samadhi Towards the ultimate flowering of your inner lotus. It is the same energy\nThe energy is not different but\nIt manifests differently on different planes. When the same energy comes to the heart That is the fourth center, it becomes love.\nWhen the same energy moves to the fifth center That is the throat, it becomes prayer.\nWhen the same energy moves to the sixth center That is between the two eyebrows, the third eye It becomes clarity, vision, one is a seer --\nOne can see everything as it is. All mist disappears.\nAnd when the same energy moves To the highest plane, the seventh\nThat is the pinnacle -- the inner lotus opens up One is ready to move into god.\nNow there is no need to return back No need to be again in the body\nNo need to be born\nThe lesson of life has been learned One has ripened, one has matured, One has become grown up.\nBut millions of people\nLive at the lowest center -- sex. Hence the work of a sannyasin Begins at the sex center Because there is the energy.\nHence I don't condemn sex because it is energy Just we have to move it upwards.\nAnd it can be moved upwards only If you have a deep respect for it\nIf you have affection for it If you are friendly with it.\nAll the religions of the world 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHave been teaching just the opposite: They teach antagonism with sex energy\nAnd once you become antagonistic to sex energy You lose all track of spiritual growth because You lose contact with your own energy source.\nYou become uprooted from your own sources. That's why your saints look so dead and dull, So stupid and unintelligent:\nThey don't have the flavour and the fragrance Of one who has arrived.\nThey stink of guilt, they are guilty people, They are feeling far more guilt\nThan anybody else in the world. They are burdened with guilt because\nWhatsoever they have been condemning is there; Just be condemning your sex energy\nYou cannot get rid of it. The only way to get rid of it\nIs to transform it to a higher plane So that it disappears from the lower. The work of a sannyasin\nBegins with the sex energy and it ends With samadhi, with superconsciousness. This is the rainbow, these seven centers, This is the bridge, this is the ladder\nThat joins the earth with the heaven\nThis shore with the other shore -- the bridge. And as you move higher\nYou become more and more blissful.\nIn fact bliss is the only criterion to know: Whether you are moving higher or not.\nAs you move higher you feel more bliss More peace, more silence, more tranquillity More centeredness, simply joyous\nFor no reason at all.\nSlowly slowly joy becomes your very climate. You even start forgetting that you are joyous. You are so joyous\nAnd the contrary has stopped happening, You start forgetting about it.\nIt is just like breathing:\nOne never remembers it, Unless something goes wrong.\nIf your breathing is not as it should be Then you remember it.\nIf it is going perfectly normal and healthy There is no question of remembering it.\nAs you go higher you start forgetting -- Bliss, peace, silence, they become so natural\nThat you remember them only when you see others; When you see others in deep misery\nThen suddenly, the recognition comes to you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat you are no more in misery. When you see other sad faces Then suddenly you recognize That your heart is always dancing\nContinuously dancing, that you are\nIn a constant jubilation, in a celebration.\n(To Brigitte) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Vandano. Anand means bliss. Vandano means prayer.\nBliss is the only prayer I know of.\nAll other prayers are just pseudo prayers.\nA prayer need not be sad -- it has to be lived.\nIf one really feels god, one should be blissful Because god is -- that's enough to\nbe blissful.\nIf one feels surrounded by god Overwhelmed by god\nOne will radiate joy, one will radiate gratitude. There will be a constant thankfulness --\nThat is prayer!\nThere is no need to go to the church\nOr to the temple or to the mosque to say prayers. Prayers cannot be said.\nWhat you say in the name of prayers Are just stupid things.\nYou are trying to bribe god\nYou are praising god, as if you can buttress him. All the prayers have been made\nIn the same way as people used to Worship the kings and the emperors: They will go and praise the kings They will exaggerate in their praises\nAnd of course, the kings' ego will be puffed up And these people will be rewarded.\nIt happened once: A Sufi mystic was sent to India\nBy the king of Iran\nAs a messenger to the Indian king.\nThe other members of his court were very jealous Because they were not chosen and\nThis strange man, a Sufi mystic has been chosen. So they were trying to find out\nSome way of other to condemn this man. They had put spies and the spies followed him\nAnd they were sending reports what is happening And they found many things\nParticularly one thing that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe Sufi mystic had said to the Indian emperor That, 'You are the full moon; our king is just\nThe moon of the second day, when you can hardly see. From third day it becomes more visible\nFourth day it is more clear\nSo our king is second day's moon\nAnd you are the perfect moon.' The detectives were very happy,\nThey immediately sent a message that\n'This man is praising the Indian king like this And humiliating our king.'\nSo when the mystic went back He was immediately arrested\nBrought to the court and the king asked,\n'How you dared? -- you called the Indian emperor The full moon and me, just the second day moon?!' The mystic started laughing and he said,\n'You did not understand.\nThe Indian king was a fool because After the full-moon there is only death. He is just on the verge of death -- That's what I was saying.\nAnd after the second day moon there is growth. You are a growing person, your empire is growing. That's what my meaning was.'\nThe king was very happy, the Sufi was rewarded. The Sufi got rewards from both the kings.\nMust have been a clever man; He managed to befool both!\nOur prayers have been also made in the same way: We are trying to befool god; that,\n'You are great,' that\n'You are father of the whole,' that 'You are compassionate,' that 'You will forgive our sins.'\nWe do two things in our prayers:\nWe condemn ourselves and we praise god. That is the way, the way of buttressing the egos But god is not an ego\nHence all these prayers are stupid They are feudalistic\nThey have nothing to do with religion. They simply remind us that\nWe have created the idea of god as great king. And god is not a person even\nWhat to say about that he is a a great king. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGod is a godliness, a quality. So when I say prayer\nI mean, you have to live\nBlissfully and peacefully and joyfully\nThat is prayer! Your life should be a prayer! You should show by your very existence That god exists, that you are happy\nThat you feel blessed. Become a prayer. Don't pray -- become a prayer!\nNever pray -- be a prayer!\n(To Hedy) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Darshano.\nDhyan means meditation. Darshano means the capacity to see. Meditation creates clarity\nIt creates the capacity to see To see that which is\nWithout any interference from the mind. Ordinarily the mind is continuously interfering. It goes on interpreting\nEverything that comes into you.\nIt goes on imposing its old prejudices. It never allows anything\nTo reach to you directly.\nIt distorts, colours, changes Bits here, bits there\nDrops few things, adds few things\nAnd the whole process it so automatic that\nYou are not even aware what your mind is doing. The scientists say the mind allows\nOnly two per cent reality to penetrate in. Ninety-eight per cent is prevented.\nSo we don't know what our mind allows us to know. Hence a Christian knows a different way\nAnd the Hindi in a totally different way And the reality is the same.\nThe scientist knows in one way\nThe poet in another -- the reality is the same! But their minds are different, so different That if you listen to the poet and the scientist You will think as if\nThey are talking about two different realities.\nIt is only through meditation 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat one drops the whole mind With all its prejudices, ideologies. To stop the mind from interfering Is what meditation is all about\nSo you can see directly.\nAnd the moment you are able to see directly Immediately you are freed, you are liberated Because truth liberates.\nTo know truth is to be transformed.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2508","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2508 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

part of a big orchestra</p><p>Then there is great richness. The rainbow represents</p><p>All the seven planes of being All the seven possibilities.</p><p>Man consists of seven planes.</p><p>The lowest is sex and the highest is samadhi. And between those
two</p><p>There are five other centers.</p><p>From sex one has to move upwards towards samadhi Towards the ultimate
flowering of your inner lotus. It is the same energy</p><p>The energy is not different but</p><p>It manifests differently on different planes. When the same energy
comes to the heart That is the fourth center, it becomes love.</p><p>When the same energy moves to the fifth center That is the throat, it
becomes prayer.</p><p>When the same energy moves to the sixth center That is between the
two eyebrows, the third eye It becomes clarity, vision, one is a seer
--</p><p>One can see everything as it is. All mist disappears.</p><p>And when the same energy moves To the highest plane, the seventh</p><p>That is the pinnacle -- the inner lotus opens up One is ready to move
into god.</p><p>Now there is no need to return back No need to be again in the
body</p><p>No need to be born</p><p>The lesson of life has been learned One has ripened, one has matured,
One has become grown up.</p><p>But millions of people</p><p>Live at the lowest center -- sex. Hence the work of a sannyasin
Begins at the sex center Because there is the energy.</p><p>Hence I don't condemn sex because it is energy Just we have to move
it upwards.</p><p>And it can be moved upwards only If you have a deep respect for
it</p><p>If you have affection for it If you are friendly with it.</p><p>All the religions of the world 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

energy</p><p>And once you become antagonistic to sex energy You lose all track of
spiritual growth because You lose contact with your own energy
source.</p><p>You become uprooted from your own sources. That's why your saints
look so dead and dull, So stupid and unintelligent:</p><p>They don't have the flavour and the fragrance Of one who has
arrived.</p><p>They stink of guilt, they are guilty people, They are feeling far
more guilt</p><p>Than anybody else in the world. They are burdened with guilt
because</p><p>Whatsoever they have been condemning is there; Just be condemning
your sex energy</p><p>You cannot get rid of it. The only way to get rid of it</p><p>Is to transform it to a higher plane So that it disappears from the
lower. The work of a sannyasin</p><p>Begins with the sex energy and it ends With samadhi, with
superconsciousness. This is the rainbow, these seven centers, This is
the bridge, this is the ladder</p><p>That joins the earth with the heaven</p><p>This shore with the other shore -- the bridge. And as you move
higher</p><p>You become more and more blissful.</p><p>In fact bliss is the only criterion to know: Whether you are moving
higher or not.</p><p>As you move higher you feel more bliss More peace, more silence, more
tranquillity More centeredness, simply joyous</p><p>For no reason at all.</p><p>Slowly slowly joy becomes your very climate. You even start
forgetting that you are joyous. You are so joyous</p><p>And the contrary has stopped happening, You start forgetting about
it.</p><p>It is just like breathing:</p><p>One never remembers it, Unless something goes wrong.</p><p>If your breathing is not as it should be Then you remember it.</p><p>If it is going perfectly normal and healthy There is no question of
remembering it.</p><p>As you go higher you start forgetting -- Bliss, peace, silence, they

said.</p><p>What you say in the name of prayers Are just stupid things.</p><p>You are trying to bribe god</p><p>You are praising god, as if you can buttress him. All the prayers
have been made</p><p>In the same way as people used to Worship the kings and the emperors:

praises</p><p>And of course, the kings' ego will be puffed up And these people will
be rewarded.</p><p>It happened once: A Sufi mystic was sent to India</p><p>By the king of Iran</p><p>As a messenger to the Indian king.</p><p>The other members of his court were very jealous Because they were
not chosen and</p><p>This strange man, a Sufi mystic has been chosen. So they were trying

full moon; our king is just</p><p>The moon of the second day, when you can hardly see. From third day
it becomes more visible</p><p>Fourth day it is more clear</p><p>So our king is second day's moon</p><p>And you are the perfect moon.' The detectives were very happy,</p><p>They immediately sent a message that</p><p>'This man is praising the Indian king like this And humiliating our
king.'</p><p>So when the mystic went back He was immediately arrested</p><p>Brought to the court and the king asked,</p><p>'How you dared? -- you called the Indian emperor The full moon and
me, just the second day moon?!' The mystic started laughing and he
said,</p><p>'You did not understand.</p><p>The Indian king was a fool because After the full-moon there is only
death. He is just on the verge of death -- That's what I was saying.</p><p>And after the second day moon there is growth. You are a growing
person, your empire is growing. That's what my meaning was.'</p><p>The king was very happy, the Sufi was rewarded. The Sufi got rewards
from both the kings.</p><p>Must have been a clever man; He managed to befool both!</p><p>Our prayers have been also made in the same way: We are trying to
befool god; that,</p><p>'You are great,' that</p><p>'You are father of the whole,' that 'You are compassionate,' that
'You will forgive our sins.'</p><p>We do two things in our prayers:</p><p>We condemn ourselves and we praise god. That is the way, the way of
buttressing the egos But god is not an ego</p><p>Hence all these prayers are stupid They are feudalistic</p><p>They have nothing to do with religion. They simply remind us that</p><p>We have created the idea of god as great king. And god is not a

the mind allows</p><p>Only two per cent reality to penetrate in. Ninety-eight per cent is

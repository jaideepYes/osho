It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Juliane) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Juliane. Dhyan means meditation. Juliane means youthful.\nYouthfulness has nothing to do with age Youthfulness is a transcendence of time. Whenever you are not in time, you are youthful Whenever you are in time, you are old.\nEven a one-day-old child is old enough --\nHe is no more youthful, he has aged, He has died already twenty-four hours. One day is less in his life\nSomething has slipped by\nHe has lost already something Utterly unaware of it. And that's what\nMillions of people go on doing their whole life In fact a person becomes aware that he was alive\nOnly when he dies; when death knocks on the door The shock of it makes him alert for the first time\n'What have I missed? I have lost my life And now nothing can be done about it.' The only use of life is to transcend time. Life is an opportunity\nIn time, to transcend time; A ladder has to be created. Time moves horizontally, Just like an alphabet, a b c, Linear, in one line.\nTranscendence is vertical,\nIt is like a ladder, not linear --\nYou go higher or deeper\nWhich ultimately means the same. If you go higher, you go deeper\nIf you go deeper, you go higher\nBut you start moving in a totally new dimension. You are no more moving horizontally\nYou are moving vertically.\nThat movement happens through meditation Mediation is the ladder I am talking about. It takes you beyond time and suddenly Great youthfulness explodes in you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe touch of eternity is youthfulness.\nThen you know that you belong to the eternal. The experience of the eternal\nIs the experience of god. And these are\nThe only two possibilities available for man: Either he moves in time,\nThen he moves horizontally, linear -- That is the way of the mind,\nTime is the way of the mind. Or, one moves vertically -- That is the way of no-mind,\nTimelessness it the way of no-mind. And meditation is nothing but an art\nOf how to take a jump from mind to no-mind. From horizontal to the vertical.\nIt is the greatest quantum leap possible It is the most radical phenomenon;\nJust a glimpse of it and you are full of god\nJust a glimpse of it and you are not more the same. And you will never be the same again.\nYou will live in the same world But you will live out of it.\nYou will be in the world\nBut the world will not be in you. That's what sannyas is all about:\nBeing in the world yet not of it.\n(To Margarita) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Sangitamo.\nDhyan means meditation. Sangitamo means music. Meditation is music, the ultimate music:\nMusic without sound, music of silence. It is far richer, far more deeper\nThan any music that we can create through sound Because sound is after all, a disturbance.\nEach vibration is a disturbance.\nWe can make the disturbance lovable But still it is a disturbance.\nSilence means no disturbance, nothing stirs But there is great music, there is great harmony In that wordless, soundless state.\nMeditation leads into that state of silence And unless a man knows that silence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHe is not aware\nOf what he is carrying in his heart\nHe remains unaware of his own kingdom\nOf his own richness, of his own treasures.\nHe remains a beggar while he can be an emperor\nAny moment -- just a turning in. Silence is alchemical:\nOnce you have penetrated the barrier of sound Once you have passed the barrier of sound And reached to the very core of your being\nYou have reached to the very center of existence. Those who have heard it\nThey have called it by many names. One of the names is god.\nZen people call it the sound of one hand clapping. It is an absurdity:\nOne hand cannot make any sound But Zen people enjoy absurdities\nThey express themselves in paradoxes. In fact the ultimate truth\nCan only be expressed through paradoxes. It is so vast that\nIt has to contain all contradictions in it It can't leave anything outside of it.\nThe outer music is only a remembrance An effort to remind you, of the inner.\nHence I use outside music for all meditations: It can trigger a process inside you\nIt can create a situation. It is a device.\nIf you know how to listen to the outer music Just listening it, listening it, listening it, Suddenly the outer disappears and\nYou are transported into the inner. If the outer music is really beautiful It provokes something in you.\nCarl Gustav Jung has the right term for it. He calls it synchronicity. That's true Because it is not like cause and effect, There is no certainty about it.\nThe outer music may be beautiful,\nIt may be Beethoven, it may be Mozart But is does not work like a cause;\nIt may not create the effect at all and sometimes Even the wind passing through the trees 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOr just dry leaves creating noise in the wind\nMay be enough -- something may synchronize in you. Something may suddenly start happening.\nIt happened one, a Zen disciple\nWorked for twenty years with the master\nAnd nothing happened. And he had a great master One of the greatest, Rinzai was his master.\nRinzai is one of the very few great masters Very few people who can be counted on fingers But nothing happened because\nIt is not a question of cause and effect Even Rinzai is there\nAnd whatsoever he could do, he did,\nBut everything failed, nothing synchronized. The disciple became a great scholar Listening to the master for twenty years,\nHis beautiful discourses, his tremendously Significant commentaries on Buddhist sutras\nBut that was all.\nNothing else was happening in him.\nHe became knowledgeable but not wise.\nAnd one day, he was passing through the market And just by chance he heard a shopkeeper,\nA meat-seller, talking to his customer. The customer was asking,\n'Is this the best meat that you have got?' And the shopkeeper said,\n'Everything I have got here is the best!' Now this has nothing to do with Zen Nothing to do with meditation\nBut the disciple suddenly became enlightened: 'Everything I have got here is the best!'\nHe came running to the master\nAnd even before he had said anything\nThe master hit him in great joy and he said, 'You have got it -- no need to say anything! Keep quiet! How did it happen?'\nHe said, 'It is very strange\nThat it should happen in a marketplace\nAnd at a meat-seller's shop; in fact\nI should not be passing through that market. Buddhist monks are not allowed\nTo pass though a market where meat is sold. But I was not aware that it is a meat-market So I was passing from there\nAnd the shopkeeper said, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\"Everything that is sold here is the best.\"' And Rinzai said, 'You fool!\nThat's what I have been telling you For twenty years:\nEverything that is being sold here is the best!' But one needs right time...\nThis is synchronicity: The outer music\nCan sometimes give you a glimpse of the inner. But once you have caught the inner thread Then there is no need for the outside help:\nYou go on following it, then you are on the way. Sannyas is a journey\nTowards the innermost core of your being The ultimate silence, the soundless silence The wordless silence -- and the harmony of it!\n(To Peter) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Pritamo. Dhyan means meditation. Pritamo means beloved.\nA man without meditation remains an outsider:\nHe exists but not as part of existence He exists but exists as a stranger\nHe exists in deep alienation. There seems to be no bridge Between him and the whole.\nHe seems to be uprooted\nJust like a tree which is uprooted And has lost contact with the soil: It is bound to die\nIt goes on shrinking every moment. What we call life\nIt more or less dying than living.\nIn fact, people take seventy years to die That's all. That is the normal time\nPeople take in dying.\nFew people are speedy -- they do it quick. Few people are lazy -- they do it\nWith a lazy pace: ninety-hundred,\nEven sometimes hundred-ten, hundred-twenty. But it is only a question\nOf how long you take to die; it is not life. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLife begins only with meditation Because meditation creates\nThe bridge between you and the whole It gives you roots in the whole.\nBut without meditation you are like an island. With meditation you become\nPart of the continent, the infinite continent. (line missing)\nAnd remember: No man is an island But ego tries to live like an island.\nThe ego is very much afraid\nOf being lost into something bigger than itself, It keeps aloof, from everything\nThat is bigger than itself. Hence it is afraid of love\nBecause love is bigger than ego; It is afraid of losing its identity.\nMeditation is far bigger than even love And ego is very much afraid.\nWhatsoever is bigger than the ego The ego tries to avoid.\nIt is always interested in doing small things Smaller than itself. It can control them.\nIt needs not be afraid of them But then one lives in misery Because joy happens only\nWhen you become connected with something Bigger than yourself.\nThe leaf is green because it is part of a branch The branch is green because it is part of a tree The tree is green because it is part of the earth\nThe earth is alive because it is part of the sun And the sun is alive\nBecause of some other greater sun. The whole is interconnected.\nIt is only the foolishness of man The stupidity of man\nThat he tries to live isolatedly\nTries to live in a sort of encapsulated way but Then he is suffering, then he feels suffocated Then he is constantly in misery\nBut he clings to misery\nBecause misery goes perfectly well with the ego Bliss is dangerous for the ego.\nMisery feeds the ego,\nThey are partners in the same business. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd meditation will give you a taste of bliss A taste of something bigger than you\nA taste of infinity, a taste of the oceanic. And that immediately transforms you You become beloved of the existence, Otherwise you exist like an enemy.\nAnd to exist as an enemy is an ugly way to exist. Exist like a lover: Love the whole existence\nSo that the whole existence can love you.\n(To Michael) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Samarpano. Dhyan means meditation. Samarpano means surrender.\nMeditation is a way of surrendering your ego. Meditation is surrender,\nThe very essence of surrender. Ordinarily we are clinging to our ego: In every possible way we try to prove it.\nMeditation means we drop the whole trip We drop the whole number.\nWe are no more interested in proving the ego Because we can see the falsity of it\nAnd the whole absurdity.\nSeeing it, one allows it to drop, seeing The futility and the misery that it brings\nOne surrenders it and immediately A transformation takes place.\nWhenever you are emptied of the ego Something from the beyond rushes in, Immediately fills your inner vacuum.\nThat rush of energy from the beyond is god. Meditation makes the way\nFor the rush of the beyond. But we are so full of ourselves That we go on missing.\nWe have to empty ourselves totally And it has to be a total effort\nNot half-hearted, not lukewarm\nBecause even if a part of the ego remains in\nThat is enough to keep the beyond away from you. The ego has to be dropped in toto\nThe emptiness has to be utterly utterly empty And then there is no barrier;\nThen the guest comes in\nThe emptiness becomes the host for god And there is no other way to know god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nKnowledgeable people never know god In fact, they cannot know god.\nSinners can know, but not knowledgeable people. Hence I love the biblical story\nThat the original sin was\nEating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. It is really of great insight\nBut Christians have completely missed it, It had fallen into wrong hands.\nIf it had been in the hands of Zen masters They would have made\nSomething beautiful out of it. That is the original sin because\nKnowledge fills oneself, feeds the ego. One has to be innocent, one has to function From the state of not-knowing,\nOne has to feel that 'I know nothing'\nThen only one can feel the wonder and the awe. And to stand in awe and wonder\nIs to face god, is to encounter god Is to be ready for god!\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2353","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2353 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

listening it, listening it, Suddenly the outer disappears and</p><p>You are transported into the inner. If the outer music is

synchronicity. That's true Because it is not like cause and effect,

Rinzai was his master.</p><p>Rinzai is one of the very few great masters Very few people who can

heard a shopkeeper,</p><p>A meat-seller, talking to his customer. The customer was asking,</p><p>'Is this the best meat that you have got?' And the shopkeeper
said,</p><p>'Everything I have got here is the best!' Now this has nothing to do
with Zen Nothing to do with meditation</p><p>But the disciple suddenly became enlightened: 'Everything I have got
here is the best!'</p><p>He came running to the master</p><p>And even before he had said anything</p><p>The master hit him in great joy and he said, 'You have got it -- no
need to say anything! Keep quiet! How did it happen?'</p><p>He said, 'It is very strange</p><p>That it should happen in a marketplace</p><p>And at a meat-seller's shop; in fact</p><p>I should not be passing through that market. Buddhist monks are not

normal time</p><p>People take in dying.</p><p>Few people are speedy -- they do it quick. Few people are lazy --
they do it</p><p>With a lazy pace: ninety-hundred,</p><p>Even sometimes hundred-ten, hundred-twenty. But it is only a

meditation. Samarpano means surrender.</p><p>Meditation is a way of surrendering your ego. Meditation <em>is</em>
surrender,</p><p>The very essence of surrender. Ordinarily we are clinging to our ego:
In every possible way we try to prove it.</p><p>Meditation means we drop the whole trip We drop the whole number.</p><p>We are no more interested in proving the ego Because we can see the
falsity of it</p><p>And the whole absurdity.</p><p>Seeing it, one allows it to drop, seeing The futility and the misery
that it brings</p><p>One surrenders it and immediately A transformation takes place.</p><p>Whenever you are emptied of the ego Something from the beyond rushes
in, Immediately fills your inner vacuum.</p><p>That rush of energy from the beyond is god. Meditation makes the
way</p><p>For the rush of the beyond. But we are so full of ourselves That we
go on missing.</p><p>We have to empty ourselves totally And it has to be a total
effort</p><p>Not half-hearted, not lukewarm</p><p>Because even if a part of the ego remains in</p><p>That is enough to keep the beyond away from you. The ego has to be
dropped in toto</p><p>The emptiness has to be utterly utterly empty And then there is no

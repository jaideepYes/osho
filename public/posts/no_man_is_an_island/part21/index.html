Anand means bliss. Nika has two meanings. Both Are beautiful and both are interdependent. The First meaning is born on Sunday and the second Meaning is belonging to god.\nGod created the world in six days.\nThe seventh day was his day -- he rested.\nThe seventh day belonged to him\nHence it is called a holy day, it is divine.\nAnd rest has something about it which is divine:\nRelaxation is divine.\nThe hold of, the whole art of meditation is nothing but The art of creating a deep inner rest\nA relaxed state of being.\nSix days you are involved in the world Thousand and one things have to be done. Seventh day you relax into yourself\nYou rest into yourself;\nIt rejuvenates, it again resurrects you. That's why I say both are related: Born on Sunday and belonging to god. Rest is the way to belong to god\nAnd if one knows the art of restfulness One can act and yet be in rest.\nThe Jewish god\nAnd the Christian and the Mohammedan god Which are by-products of the Jewish god\nIs not so clear about it as the Eastern god is.\nThe Eastern concept of god is not that Sometimes he works and sometimes he rests. The eastern concept of god is:\nHis work is his rest.\nThat is a far higher dimension, Then every day is a holy day Then there is no division,\nYour action and your meditation Are not two separate things.\nYour creativity and your relaxation Are two aspects of the same coin.\nAnd that's how my sannyasins have to be. There is no need to find\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nA separate corner in your life for meditation. Meditation should spread all over your life\nEach moment should have the color of meditation. Even while working\nYou should be at rest, you should remain centered. You should not get disturbed, distracted.\nHence in the East there is no idea of a holy day. Before Christians came to the East\nThere was no question of a holiday because The Eastern god continuously is creative.\nA Sannyasin has to learn the art\nOf being active and inactive at the same time. It is a very paradoxical phenomenon\nBut once you know the knack of it It is the most beautiful thing\nThat can happen to a man. Then you can be in the world And yet be free of it\nThen you can be anywhere, even in hell And still you will be in heaven.\nThen one does not care where one is; Wherever one is\nOne carries one's paradise within oneself.\n(To Lieve) -- This is your name: Ma Asti Lieve. Asti means existence. Lieve means a dear one.\nExistence loves all.\nExistence is not indifferent to us\nBut is appears indifferent for the simple reason Because we are indifferent.\nExistence only reflects.\nIt is a mirror: It echoes us back. If we shout at it, it shouts at us.\nIf we sing to it, the song is returned. Whatsoever we do to it\nIs returned in a thousandfold way\nBecause it is returned from all the directions From all the dimensions\nFrom all the planed of existence.\nIt appears indifferent because we are not loving. Once you start loving all that is --\nThe river, the mountain, the stars, The people, the animals,\nOnce you start getting involved into life With deep love, with great intensity 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWith a fire in your heart, Once you become warmed up\nThe whole existence becomes warm towards you. It always pays in the same coin.\nIt looks meaningless\nBecause we don't create meaning. It looks as if it is very dull and drab Because we are dull and drab.\nTo a Buddha it does not appear like that. Buddha has said,\n'The moment I became enlightened\nThe whole existence became enlightened.' And I can vouch for him. I am a witness: What he says is absolutely true.\nThat's my experience too:\nWhatsoever you are, existence is that for you. Now all over the world\nThinkers are very much worried That existence has no meaning\nAnd the only thing they should be worried is That man has lost the capacity to create meaning. Existence seems to be indifferent\nAnd the only thing is\nThat we have become indifferent and cold. Meditation will teach you two things: Meditation\nAs far as you inner world is concerned, And love\nAs far as the whole existence is concerned. Meditation has to be your center, Awareness, a silent watchfulness\nAnd love has to be your circumference, A warmth, for no reason at all -- Because it is so beautiful to be warm\nIt is so delightful to be warm. At the center be meditative\nAt the circumference be loving\nAnd you will see the whole existence change. It is the same existence;\nIn fact you are changing\nBut immediately, as you change\nThe whole existence changes with you.\n(To Rita) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Gito.\nAnand means bliss; gito means a song -- a song of bliss. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy definition of a sannyasin is a song of bliss. The old definition of sannyas was escapist.\nThe old saints used to be very sad Serious, with long faces.\nAnd naturally they had to be sad Because they were torturing themselves They were practicing masochism\nIn the name of asceticism.\nIn the name of religion they were really Practicing neurotics.\nAnd their neurosis was of their own creation Hence they were incurable because\nIf a neurosis happens to you as a disease\nYou can be cured, but if you practise it And you think it is something holy And something sacred\nThen it is impossible to cure you.\nAnd they were respected and worshipped for it So why they should think of being cured of it? Their egos were fulfilled by it,\nBut they were no saints. The whole idea was stupid\nThe whole idea was wrong, basically wrong Wrong from the very beginning,\nAnd that idea has persisted up to now. That's why my sannyasins\nHave to be condemned all over the world. Christians will condemn them\nHindus will condemn them Mohammedans will condemn them -- Everybody is going to condemn them\nBecause they all have a certain idea of how A sannyasin, a monk, a saint should be.\nAnd what they call a saint, I call a masochist And what I call a sannyasin, they\nthink that\nMy sannyasins are materialists, indulgent. Our values are different\nOur perceptions are different. Life has to be rejoiced\nLife has to be lived in its totality.\nIt is not indulgence and if it is indulgence\nThen god is very indulgent -- what can you do? He has created this life\nAnd he does not seem to be an ascetic Otherwise why those flowers\nAnd rainbows and butterflies -- for what? 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJust think an ascetic god\nWill create so may flowers, so many colors So many trees, so may stars?\nDarkness would have been perfectly sacred. In fact, an ascetic god\nWould not have created any kind of beauty; He would have made everybody\nSo ugly and disgusting that\nNobody would have ever thought of love. But he makes people beautiful\nHe makes people lovely. God is not an ascetic --\nThat much is absolutely certain. God is a lover, a creator, a poet A singer, a dancer.\nGod is not a neurotic person\nAnd he is not perfectionist at all, otherwise He would have created the perfect world.\nIn the very beginning.\nThere would have been no evolution at all He would have created everybody a saint. Everybody would have been a born-saint There would have been so need\nOf any religion, of any growth,\nBut god creates opportunities to grow. He is not a perfectionist either:\nHe loves growth, he loves enquiry\nHe loves people discovering themselves. He is tremendously interested\nIn people growing on their own accord.\nHe accepts it that sometimes they will go astray; Otherwise they cannot grow.\nAnd he accepts that they will commit mistakes; Without committing mistakes\nNobody can ever learn.\nGod is not a saint -- that much is certain. If there is any god\nHe is going to be something like my sannyasin: Utterly in love with existence and life Otherwise he would not have created.\nAnd you have to learn a new kind of religiousness. A religiousness that can sing, dance, celebrate.\n(To Connie) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Sarjana. Dhyan means meditation. Sarjana means creativity.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is inevitable creative, It cannot be otherwise.\nFirst it creates you and then\nIt creates thousand and one things around you. And it goes on creating\nIt goes on finding new ways to be creative New methods to be creative; it never tires It is never bored with creativity.\nIt is always thrilled with new projects It is always full of new dreams Which have to be materialized.\nBut the old idea of meditation Was very uncreative, hence I say\nIt was not meditation, it was a kind of suicide. Real meditation cannot be uncreative.\nCreativity is the criterion\nWhether the meditation is true or false. If it releases creative energy in you Whatsoever you are doing,\nIf you start enjoying it more\nIf you start getting\nMore and more involved into life, if you start Squeezing each moment its total juice\nIf you start living moment to moment With such utter abandon\nAs if there is no other moment left, This is the last moment\nSo you have to live it totally Otherwise you will never live again -- Then your meditation\nIs moving in the right direction.\nIf it makes you uncreative, escapist\nIf it creates the idea of renunciation in you -- Renounce life and run away from life Become a dropout and go to the mountains, That means it is not meditation -- Something else masquerading as meditation. It is just a slow kind of suicide\nAnd the old idea of religion Has been very suicidal\nThat's why you will be surprised:\nIn the East very few people commit suicide In the West more people commit suicide.\nAnd the Eastern so-called mahatmas and saints Brag about it. They say, 'Look!\nOur people are so religious They don't commit suicide,\nAnd Western people are so materialist, that's why 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThey are going mad and they are committing suicide.' But their argument is utterly false.\nMy own observation is totally different: In the East you need not commit suicide\nYou can become religious -- that is an alternative. You can go to the Himalayas: There are\nFive hundred thousand Hindu monks in India. If these people were in the West,\nThey would have committed suicide Because there is no alternative.\nAnd this is easier than committing suicide. Committing suicide needs a little courage It needs really guts; it is not for cowards.\nCowards go on lingering,\nThey take their time, they die slowly But religion provides them\nA slow kind of suicide, a gradual kind of suicide. Escape form the world -- that is a suicide.\nLive in a cave in the Himalayas -- That is almost living in your grave! What is the difference\nBetween a grave and a cave?\nThe only difference is that you are breathing But why bother about breathing?\nWhy so much trouble?\nJust lie down in the grave and be finished. That seems to be far easier\nFar more comfortable and convenient, For you and for others too.\nBecause if you live in a cave then Somebody else has to carry food to the cave,\nSome fool is bound to serve you ... And it is unnecessary.\nThe reason why people\nDon't commit suicide in the East is Because here is a religious alternative; In the West the religious alternative\nIs no more available; in the past it was there. Christians monasteries were there\nAnd people were not committing suicide Now Christianity has lost its relevance but In the East the grip of religion is still great. My religion is not suicidal.\nIt is life-affirmative\nIt is tremendous love for life It is rejoicing in life.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo meditate\nAnd release all your potential of creativity.\nThat's my message.

of sannyas was escapist.</p><p>The old saints used to be very sad Serious, with long faces.</p><p>And naturally they had to be sad Because they were torturing
themselves They were practicing masochism</p><p>In the name of asceticism.</p><p>In the name of religion they were really Practicing neurotics.</p><p>And their neurosis was of their own creation Hence they were
incurable because</p><p>If a neurosis happens to you as a disease</p><p>You can be cured, but if you practise it And you think it is
something holy And something sacred</p><p>Then it is impossible to cure you.</p><p>And they were respected and worshipped for it So why they should
think of being cured of it? Their egos were fulfilled by it,</p><p>But they were no saints. The whole idea was stupid</p><p>The whole idea was wrong, basically wrong Wrong from the very
beginning,</p><p>And that idea has persisted up to now. That's why my sannyasins</p><p>Have to be condemned all over the world. Christians will condemn
them</p><p>Hindus will condemn them Mohammedans will condemn them -- Everybody
is going to condemn them</p><p>Because they all have a certain idea of how A sannyasin, a monk, a
saint should be.</p><p>And what <em>they</em> call a saint, I call a masochist And what I
call a sannyasin, they</p><p>think that</p><p>My sannyasins are materialists, indulgent. Our values are
different</p><p>Our perceptions are different. Life has to be rejoiced</p><p>Life has to be lived in its totality.</p><p>It is not indulgence and if it is indulgence</p><p>Then god is very indulgent -- what can you do? He has created this
life</p><p>And he does not seem to be an ascetic Otherwise why those flowers</p><p>And rainbows and butterflies -- for what? 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Just think an ascetic god</p><p>Will create so may flowers, so many colors So many trees, so may
stars?</p><p>Darkness would have been perfectly sacred. In fact, an ascetic
god</p><p>Would not have created <em>any</em> kind of beauty; He would have
made everybody</p><p>So ugly and disgusting that</p><p>Nobody would have ever thought of love. But he makes people
beautiful</p><p>He makes people lovely. God is not an ascetic --</p><p>That much is absolutely certain. God is a lover, a creator, a poet A
singer, a dancer.</p><p>God is not a neurotic person</p><p>And he is not perfectionist at all, otherwise He would have created
the perfect world.</p><p>In the very beginning.</p><p>There would have been no evolution at all He would have created
everybody a saint. Everybody would have been a born-saint There would
have been so need</p><p>Of any religion, of any growth,</p><p>But god creates opportunities to grow. He is not a perfectionist
either:</p><p>He loves growth, he loves enquiry</p><p>He loves people discovering themselves. He is tremendously
interested</p><p>In people growing on their own accord.</p><p>He accepts it that sometimes they will go astray; Otherwise they
cannot grow.</p><p>And he accepts that they will commit mistakes; Without committing
mistakes</p><p>Nobody can ever learn.</p><p>God is not a saint -- that much is certain. If there is any god</p><p>He is going to be something like my sannyasin: Utterly in love with
existence and life Otherwise he would not have created.</p><p>And you have to learn a new kind of religiousness. A religiousness
that can sing, dance, celebrate.</p><p>(To Connie) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Sarjana. Dhyan means
meditation. Sarjana means creativity.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Meditation is inevitable creative, It cannot be otherwise.</p><p>First it creates you and then</p><p>It creates thousand and one things around you. And it goes on
creating</p><p>It goes on finding new ways to be creative New methods to be
creative; it never tires It is never bored with creativity.</p><p>It is always thrilled with new projects It is always full of new
dreams Which have to be materialized.</p><p>But the old idea of meditation Was very uncreative, hence I say</p><p>It was not meditation, it was a kind of suicide. Real meditation
cannot be uncreative.</p><p>Creativity is the criterion</p><p>Whether the meditation is true or false. If it releases creative
energy in you Whatsoever you are doing,</p><p>If you start enjoying it more</p><p>If you start getting</p><p>More and more involved into life, if you start Squeezing each moment
its total juice</p><p>If you start living moment to moment With such utter abandon</p><p>As if there is no other moment left, This is the last moment</p><p>So you have to live it totally Otherwise you will never live again --
Then your meditation</p><p>Is moving in the right direction.</p><p>If it makes you uncreative, escapist</p><p>If it creates the idea of renunciation in you -- Renounce life and
run away from life Become a dropout and go to the mountains, That means
it is not meditation -- Something else masquerading as meditation. It is
just a slow kind of suicide</p><p>And the old idea of religion Has been very suicidal</p><p>That's why you will be surprised:</p><p>In the East very few people commit suicide In the West more people
commit suicide.</p><p>And the Eastern so-called mahatmas and saints Brag about it. They
say, 'Look!</p><p>Our people are so religious They don't commit suicide,</p><p>And Western people are so materialist, that's why 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>They are going mad and they are committing suicide.' But their
argument is utterly false.</p><p>My own observation is totally different: In the East you need not
commit suicide</p><p>You can become religious -- that is an alternative. You can go to the
Himalayas: There are</p><p>Five hundred thousand Hindu monks in India. If these people were in
the West,</p><p>They would have committed suicide Because there is no
alternative.</p><p>And this is easier than committing suicide. Committing suicide needs
a little courage It needs really guts; it is not for cowards.</p><p>Cowards go on lingering,</p><p>They take their time, they die slowly But religion provides them</p><p>A slow kind of suicide, a gradual kind of suicide. Escape form the
world -- that is a suicide.</p><p>Live in a cave in the Himalayas -- That is almost living in your
grave! What is the difference</p><p>Between a grave and a cave?</p><p>The only difference is that you are breathing But why bother about
breathing?</p><p>Why so much trouble?</p><p>Just lie down in the grave and be finished. That seems to be far
easier</p><p>Far more comfortable and convenient, For you and for others too.</p><p>Because if you live in a cave then Somebody else has to carry food to
the cave,</p><p>Some fool is bound to serve you ... And it is unnecessary.</p><p>The reason why people</p><p>Don't commit suicide in the East is Because here is a religious
alternative; In the West the religious alternative</p><p>Is no more available; in the past it was there. Christians
monasteries were there</p><p>And people were not committing suicide Now Christianity has lost its
relevance but In the East the grip of religion is still great. My
religion is not suicidal.</p><p>It is life-affirmative</p><p>It is tremendous love for life It is rejoicing in life.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-7>Osho's books on

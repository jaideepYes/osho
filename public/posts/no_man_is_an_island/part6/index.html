It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Grazia) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Grazia. Deva means divine. Grazia means grace.\nBeauty is human, grace is divine.\nBeauty is earthly, it is of the body, of the form Grace is of the spirit, of the formless\nIt is unearthly;; it can appear on the earth but is does not belong to the earth.\nIt happens only when one is ready To receive god into one's heart --\nTo a Jesus, to a Buddha, to a Lao Tzu. Once you become empty of yourself\nGod rushes in, fills you, starts overflowing Because we are too small and he is so vast. That overflowing divineness\nIs felt as grace by others. Something starts radiating 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFrom the person whose heart is full of god. Only those who are utterly blind\nMay not be able to see it, but if they have even Just a little bit of intelligence\nThey will be able to feel it.\nAnd grace is not something that can be proved Because it is immaterial, immeasurable.\nScience can have no approach, it is not an object. Hence if somebody wants to deny\nIt is very easy to deny; to say that Jesus is mad Not god-possessed, but simply insane\nIs very easy; it can be proved.\nBut to prove that he is god-possessed\nit almost impossible, because even god cannot be proved. Cannot be proved -- How a man of god can be proved?\nJesus can only be felt\nAnd that's the function of being a disciple: Allowing yourself to feel the grace\nOf the one who has tasted it.\nSeeing through the eyes a the master\nFeeling through his hands -- that is the only way To have an indirect proof that god exists.\nOnce you have fallen in love with the grace of a master Your life changes radically\nbut one has to be available and\nOne has to be courageous to die to the past So that the new can be born in you.\n(To Christiano) -- Your name: Swami Christiano. It is a beautiful name but for centuries has been\nMisinterpreted. It has been given a wrong meaning. Almost in all the languages\nSomething parallel to Christiano exists\nAnd everywhere with the wrong meaning. The meaning given in the dictionaries is:\nA follower of Christ -- which is absolutely wrong. A lover of Christ, not a follower of Christ --\nThat is the true meaning.\nA follower is very ordinary thing. There is a grat distance\nBetween the follower and the followed. In politics it is okay\nThere are followers and the leaders. In religion\nThere are not leaders and no followers;\nThere are the awakened ones and their lovers. People who have fallen in love with them.\nFollowing is very ordinary\nFollowing means you are convinced logically 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat what Christ is saying is right,\nbut this is only an intellectual conviction. A lover means you are convinced\nNot intellectually, not through the head But through the heart.\nYou have felt the poetry of Jesus\nYou have experienced his tremendous quality That he brings to the world of the beyond.\nYou have tasted\nSomething of the farther shore in him\nYou have imbibed his spirit: it is not a question Of intellectual conviction at all.\nBecause one who is intellectually convinced Can be unconvinced very easily.\nIf you have few arguments Which prove that Christ is right\nthen those arguments can be criticized. Those arguments can be destroyed.\nLogic is a double-edged sword --\nIt is very easy to destroy any argument And once your arguments are destroyed Your doubts will arise.\nA follower can become a doubter any moment. Just a small logic is enough to create doubt.\nFor example, those who were followers of Jesus Were waiting that he will do some miracle When he was crucified -- it was obvious\nVery obvious to the followers:\nIf he can raise the dead If he can cure the blind\nWhy he cannot do a miracle When his own life is concerned? They were there waiting\nThat some great miracle is going to happen -- It did not happen, all their arguments collapsed.\nThey became convinced\nthey were following a charlatan:\nJesus died and ordinary man.\nThey went home -- happy in a way\nThat a burden has fallen from their heads They are free from this man.\nNo need to waste any more time with this man. When the body of Jesus\nWas brought down from the cross 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAll those followers were not there.\nThree women were there to bring his body down. This is not just coincidence because\nThose three women were not followers -- They were lovers.\nIt was not a question of being convinced.\nIt was a question of love! -- love needs no proofs. In fact they felt more love for this man because He was so humble, so simple, so ordinary\nSuch a non-egoist -- he died like an ordinary man. These are not followers, these are livers.\nHence my meaning of your name is A lover of Christ.\nAnd then one more thing has to be understood: A follower of Christ\nCannot be a follower of Buddha -- obviously\nBecause both the philosophies Are different, totally different. A follower of Christ\nCannot be a follower of Lao Tzu -- it is impossible To make any syntheses out of these two\nUnique persons.\nBut a lover of Christ can be a lover of Buddha Can be a lover of Zarathustra\nCan be a lover of Lao Tzu.\nLove is vast enough to contain contradictions Love is vast enough to contain inconsistencies. Mind is a very small phenomenon.\nSo be a lover of Christ\nThen there is no problem -- you can also love me! But if you are a followers of Christ\nIf you are a Christian, then there is difficulty Then you cannot be a sannyasin.\nSo change the meaning, at least in your heart Drop the idea of being a follower.\nYou are not a follower of either, just a lover. To be a lover is beautiful\nTo be a follower is ugly\nTo be a follower is political To be a lover is religious.\n(To Fritz) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Fritz. Anand means bliss; Fritz means peace - a blissful peace.\nPeace alone is not enough, neither bliss alone is enough. Bliss alone can become feverish, it can lose its cool. It can become too hot, unbearably hot. That has happened to many people. Those who have tried to reach bliss without ever making any preparation for peace; a great difficulty arises later on. When bliss 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nstarts happening, they fall in a kind of swoon, they fall unconscious. This used to happen even to a man like Ramakrishna; and the simple reason was that he had never prepared himself for peace. He had prepared only for bliss. He worked hard in prayer, but he never meditated. His whole effort was towards prayer. It is through prayer that he attained to bliss, but the bliss was so much, that he would fall unconscious for hours, even for days - once for thirteen days continuously. He was in an unconscious state, like a coma. The physiologists would say, \"It is a coma.\" The doctors were absolutely certain it was a coma. It was not a coma at all; it was simply too much, and the body was not ready and the mind was not ready. It was as if a big voltage was going through a wire which was not meant for so big a voltage. It will go berserk. He had to learn the art of peace very late in his life.\nBliss alone is dangerous. It is excitement, ecstasy, but too hot; it is sun energy. Peace alone is also dangerous. There have been people who have tried for peace. They become so peaceful that they are almost cold, dead. The Jaina monks have done it for centuries in India. Their whole effort is for peace. Bliss they avoid - they think, the very desire for bliss is something lower; the desire for peace is\nhigher. They become peaceful, very peaceful; in fact so peaceful that they are like a corpse. Their peace is the peace of a cemetery, not the peace of a garden where flowers are blooming and birds are singing and butterflies are flying - not a peace that is alive and dancing.\nMy effort here is to avoid these extremes and to create a higher synthesis of both, a synchronicity between these two. One should be peaceful. And one should grow simultaneously; both the qualities in one's being. So peace will help you to contain more and more bliss, and bliss will help you to remain warm, alive, dancing, singing, celebrating.\nThis is going to be your work: attain to a blissful peace or a peaceful bliss. (To Regina) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Daya.\nAnand means bliss. Daya means compassion. Compassion without bliss is a cultivated quality. It is a duty: We are taught\nFrom our very childhood to be compassionate -- To the poor, to the suffering\nTo the ill, to the starving.\nThis is a morally that is taught It is a kind of conditioning.\nIf you don't feel compassionate towards a beggar Your own conscience starts pricking you.\nIn fact you are always in a double-bind: If you give something to the beggar You know, this is not right\nThis is helping people to beg. This is not solving their problem. If you don't give anything\nThen your conscience says\nYou are not being compassionate. You are not being human.\nSo whatever you do, you are in trouble. If you give him something you feel bed\nThat he has exploited ;you; if you don't give A bad taste in the mouth, a bitterness is felt You start being angry at yourself\nYou start condemning yourself That you are a miser or something.\nI don't teach this kind of compassion. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nCompassion to me arises out of bliss It is not a duty, it is bliss radiating.\nIt has nothing to do with the person\nTo who you are being compassionate.\nIt has something to do with your inner being. You are overflowing with love\nThat you want to share.\nIt is coincidental that the other is in need. Even if the other is not in need\nStill you will be compassionate. He may not need your money\nBut you can hold his hand and sit by his side. You can hug him -- who is not in need of a hug? Who will not appreciate\nJust a small gesture of love?\nHe may not be in need of money but\nYou can give him a rose flower -- Who is so rich That he does not need a rose flower?\nSo it is not a question\nWhether the other needs or not.\nThe basic, the most fundamental thing is Whether you have more energy than you need So that you can share it.\nBliss releases tremendous energy\nInexhaustible energy -- you can go on sharing. In fact the more you share, the more you have it.\n(To Klaus-Peter) -- This is your name: Swami Sahajanand. Sahajanand means spontaneous bliss.\nBliss cannot be achieved through effort. Through effort we can remove the barriers that prevent bliss from happening, but we cannot achieve bliss through efforts. That is a very significant point to be always remembered: Bliss is our self-nature; hence it cannot be achieved. It is already the case, but we are missing it because there are a few barriers which are preventing it from flowing. Those barriers have to be removed.\nAll spiritual work consists in removing the barriers, in removing the rocks. Once the rocks are removed, the river of bliss starts flowing. It is waiting there, just knocking on your doors: Open the doors! It is like the sun has risen but you are sitting in you room in darkness. You cannot make the sun rise - that is beyond you. But you can open your doors or you can keep you doors shut; that is within you power. If you can keep you doors shut you will remain in darkness. If you open the doors and the windows, suddenly the sun comes dancing in!\nSo is the case with bliss. It is something spontaneous - not a by-product of effort.\nBut effort is needed for something else - to open the door, to open the windows. And maybe we have not opened the doors and windows for many lives. We have even forgotten where they are. So we have to search for them. And it is not going to be easy to open them, because they have not been opened for so long.\nMaybe there are locks on them, we have lost the keys. Or even if the keys are available, the locks have gathered so much rust that those keys don't work - so there is much work to be done, but it is all negative work.\nAs far as bliss is concerned, it is our self-nature. No positive work is needed to achieve it, only a few negative approaches. This is one of the most ancient dilemmas faced by all the mystics: how to approach bliss - via positiva or via negativa ? Those who have tried via positiva live only in imagination. They have never reached to the true bliss. They only imagine, they hallucinate, they dream. The people who have 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nachieved have found it through via negativa. Bliss cannot be achieved through positive thinking. Remember it, because positive thinking has become too influential, particularly in the West. It is very childish. Bliss is achieved through negative thinking. In fact the very idea is unheard of. Nobody has written a single book called \"Negative Thinking\" and there are hundreds of books written on positive thinking. They are all rubbish!\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2472","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2472 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

coincidence because</p><p>Those three women were not followers -- They were lovers.</p><p>It was not a question of being convinced.</p><p>It was a question of love! -- love needs no proofs. In fact they felt
more love for this man because He was so humble, so simple, so
ordinary</p><p>Such a non-egoist -- he died like an ordinary man. These are not
followers, these are livers.</p><p>Hence my meaning of your name is A lover of Christ.</p><p>And then one more thing has to be understood: A follower of
Christ</p><p>Cannot be a follower of Buddha -- obviously</p><p>Because both the philosophies Are different, totally different. A
follower of Christ</p><p>Cannot be a follower of Lao Tzu -- it is impossible To make any
syntheses out of these two</p><p>Unique persons.</p><p>But a lover of Christ can be a lover of Buddha Can be a lover of
Zarathustra</p><p>Can be a lover of Lao Tzu.</p><p>Love is vast enough to contain contradictions Love is vast enough to
contain inconsistencies. <em>Mind</em> is a very small phenomenon.</p><p>So be a lover of Christ</p><p>Then there is no problem -- you can also love me! But if you are a
followers of Christ</p><p>If you are a Christian, then there is difficulty Then you cannot be a
sannyasin.</p><p>So change the meaning, at least in your heart Drop the idea of being
a follower.</p><p>You are not a follower of either, just a lover. To be a lover is
beautiful</p><p>To be a follower is ugly</p><p>To be a follower is political To be a lover is religious.</p><p>(To Fritz) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Fritz. Anand means
bliss; Fritz means peace - a blissful peace.</p><p>Peace alone is not enough, neither bliss alone is enough. Bliss alone
can become feverish, it can lose its cool. It can become too hot,
unbearably hot. That has happened to many people. Those who have tried
to reach bliss without ever making any preparation for peace; a great
difficulty arises later on. When bliss 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

unconscious. This used to happen even to a man like Ramakrishna; and the
simple reason was that he had never prepared himself for peace. He had
prepared only for bliss. He worked hard in prayer, but he never
meditated. His whole effort was towards prayer. It is through prayer
that he attained to bliss, but the bliss was so much, that he would fall
unconscious for hours, even for days - once for thirteen days
continuously. He was in an unconscious state, like a coma. The
physiologists would say, "It is a coma." The doctors were absolutely
certain it was a coma. It was not a coma at all; it was simply too much,
and the body was not ready and the mind was not ready. It was as if a
big voltage was going through a wire which was not meant for so big a
voltage. It will go berserk. He had to learn the art of peace very late
in his life.</p><p>Bliss alone is dangerous. It is excitement, ecstasy, but too hot; it
is sun energy. Peace alone is also dangerous. There have been people who
have tried for peace. They become so peaceful that they are almost cold,
dead. The Jaina monks have done it for centuries in India. Their whole
effort is for peace. Bliss they avoid - they think, the very desire for
bliss is something lower; the desire for peace is</p><p>higher. They become peaceful, very peaceful; in fact so peaceful that
they are like a corpse. Their peace is the peace of a cemetery, not the
peace of a garden where flowers are blooming and birds are singing and
butterflies are flying - not a peace that is alive and dancing.</p><p>My effort here is to avoid these extremes and to create a higher
synthesis of both, a synchronicity between these two. One should be
peaceful. And one should grow simultaneously; both the qualities in
one's being. So peace will help you to contain more and more bliss, and
bliss will help you to remain warm, alive, dancing, singing,
celebrating.</p><p>This is going to be your work: attain to a blissful peace or a
peaceful bliss. (To Regina) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Daya.</p><p>Anand means bliss. Daya means compassion. Compassion without bliss is
a cultivated quality. It is a duty: We are taught</p><p>From our very childhood to be compassionate -- To the poor, to the
suffering</p><p>To the ill, to the starving.</p><p>This is a morally that is taught It is a kind of conditioning.</p><p>If you don't feel compassionate towards a beggar Your own conscience
starts pricking you.</p><p>In fact you are always in a double-bind: If you give something to the
beggar You know, this is not right</p><p>This is helping people to beg. This is not solving their problem. If
you don't give anything</p><p>Then your conscience says</p><p>You are not being compassionate. You are not being human.</p><p>So whatever you do, you are in trouble. If you give him something you
feel bed</p><p>That he has exploited ;you; if you don't give A bad taste in the
mouth, a bitterness is felt You start being angry at yourself</p><p>You start condemning yourself That you are a miser or something.</p><p>I don't teach this kind of compassion. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

radiating.</p><p>It has nothing to do with the person</p><p>To who you are being compassionate.</p><p>It has something to do with your inner being. You are overflowing
with love</p><p>That you want to share.</p><p>It is coincidental that the other is in need. Even if the other is
not in need</p><p>Still you will be compassionate. He may not need your money</p><p>But you can hold his hand and sit by his side. You can hug him -- who
is not in need of a hug? Who will not appreciate</p><p>Just a small gesture of love?</p><p>He may not be in need of money but</p><p>You can give him a rose flower -- Who is so rich That he does not
need a rose flower?</p><p>So it is not a question</p><p>Whether the other needs or not.</p><p>The basic, the most fundamental thing is Whether you have more energy
than you need So that you can share it.</p><p>Bliss releases tremendous energy</p><p>Inexhaustible energy -- you can go on sharing. In fact the more you
share, the more you have it.</p><p>(To Klaus-Peter) -- This is your name: Swami Sahajanand. Sahajanand
means spontaneous bliss.</p><p>Bliss cannot be achieved through effort. Through effort we can remove
the barriers that prevent bliss from happening, but we cannot achieve
bliss through efforts. That is a very significant point to be always
remembered: Bliss is our self-nature; hence it cannot be achieved. It is
already the case, but we are missing it because there are a few barriers
which are preventing it from flowing. Those barriers have to be
removed.</p><p>All spiritual work consists in removing the barriers, in removing the
rocks. Once the rocks are removed, the river of bliss starts flowing. It
is waiting there, just knocking on your doors: Open the doors! It is
like the sun has risen but you are sitting in you room in darkness. You
cannot make the sun rise - that is beyond you. But you can open your
doors or you can keep you doors shut; that is within you power. If you
can keep you doors shut you will remain in darkness. If you open the
doors and the windows, suddenly the sun comes dancing in!</p><p>So is the case with bliss. It is something spontaneous - not a
by-product of effort.</p><p>But effort is needed for something else - to open the door, to open
the windows. And maybe we have not opened the doors and windows for many
lives. We have even forgotten where they are. So we have to search for
them. And it is not going to be easy to open them, because they have not
been opened for so long.</p><p>Maybe there are locks on them, we have lost the keys. Or even if the
keys are available, the locks have gathered so much rust that those keys
don't work - so there is much work to be done, but it is all negative
work.</p><p>As far as bliss is concerned, it is our self-nature. No positive work
is needed to achieve it, only a few negative approaches. This is one of
the most ancient dilemmas faced by all the mystics: how to approach
bliss - via positiva or via negativa ? Those who have tried via positiva
live only in imagination. They have never reached to the true bliss.
They only imagine, they hallucinate, they dream. The people who have

through positive thinking. Remember it, because positive thinking has
become too influential, particularly in the West. It is very childish.
Bliss is achieved through negative thinking. In fact the very idea is
unheard of. Nobody has written a single book called "Negative Thinking"
and there are hundreds of books written on positive thinking. They are
all rubbish!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

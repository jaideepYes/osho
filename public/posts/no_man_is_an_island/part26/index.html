Whenever you fail, remember it.\nWhenever you succeed, remember it: Failure belongs to you\nSuccess does not belong to you. Failure is a shadow of the ego and\nTrue victory is the disappearance of the ego. Whenever there is no ego\nGod starts flowing through you,\nThen all is golden, then even dust is divine. Then whatsoever you touch\nIs transformed into gold. Then life has a magic 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThen your life becomes a miracle; But the secret is simple\nSecrets are always simple.\nIf we can understand this simple secret that Frustration, failure\nIs because we are keeping ourselves Separate from god;\nWe cannot succeed against the whole. We can be victorious with the whole. But never against the whole.\nBut to be with the whole\nYou need to sacrifice one thing And that is the ego.\nAnd sannyas can be condensed into a single word: 'Surrender' -- surrender of the ego,\nThen all victory is available,\nThen there is no frustration, no failure possible. Then for the first time you start tasting\nThe glory of life, the eternal majesty of life, And all the mysteries\nOpen up their doors for you.\nDon't be an ego -- and then nothing is impossible. Be an ego and everything is impossible.\n(To Ilse) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Ilse.\nDhyan means meditation. Ilse means one who worships god. Meditation is the only way to worship god,\nAnd I repeat emphatically that\nIt is the only way; all else is pseudo. What goes on in the name of religion Is simply false\nBut the false has an appeal because it is cheap\nYou have nothing to do -- it is formal: You become A Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan...\nAnd to be a Christian what is needed?\nJust you have to go every Sunday to the church, It is a Sunday-religion.\nIt does not affect your life, It does not change you:\nDeep down you remain the same.\nDeep down, the Hindu, the Mohammedan The Christian, the Jew, are all the same:\nBoiling with the same anger, violence Rage, greed, lust but\nTheir surfaces are painted in different ways 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut it is only a painted face.\nReal, authentic transformation happens only When you start going deep into your own being -- That's what meditation is.\nOne need not go to the church\nOr to the temple or to the mosque\nBut one certainly needs to go within oneself.\nThere is the real temple\nWhere god resides, where god is still alive. In the temples, in the churches\nHe has been dead long -- only corpses are there But people go on worshipping the corpses:\nIt is easier, convenient,\nIt does not require any transformation in you. Meditation means a death and a resurrection. (Can't get this part) crucifixion.\nIt means dying as an ego\nAnd being born as an egoless entity. That is the only true way to worship god\nBecause that is the only way to know god.\n(To Lalou) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Lalou. Anand means bliss. Lalou means god's gracious gift;\nThat is half part of the meanings. And the other half Means victorious spirit -- it is made of two words.\nSo your full name will mean: Bliss is a victorious spirit Given as a gift from god to you.\nBliss is not an achievement, it is a gift. One can prepare oneself to receive it\nBut one cannot prepare oneself to achieve it.\nAnd remember the difference Between achievement and receiving:\nAchievement is masculine, receiving is feminine. A sannyasin has to be feminine,\nHe is not a soldier.\nHe has to be open to existence, vulnerable. The whole art of sannyas is\nTo be more and more receptive To all that surrounds you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe soldier is aggressive\nThe soldier is just the opposite pole of sannyas. The soldier is ambitious; he fights, struggles.\nThe sannyasin waits, prays, loves, hopes But simply waits -- his patience is infinite. And when the receptivity is total\nWhen there is no trace of aggression left in you The gift arrives on its own accord,\nIt descends form the above and transforms you!\n(To Andre) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Sandesh. Anand means bliss. Sandesh means message.\nMy sannyas is a message of bliss. It is not the old idea of monkhood. The traditional idea\nOf all the religions about the monk Was that of anti-life.\nMy sannyas is life-affirmative; it loves life, It rejoices in life, it celebrates life,\nBecause to me life and god are synonymous; They are two names of the same phenomenon. And in fact, life is far more beautiful\nThan the word 'god' because the word 'god' Has been used by the priests\nIn such ugly ways down the centuries -- They have contaminated it\nThey have destroyed its beauty They have corrupted it.\nLife -- they have never used the word That because they have been anti-life.\nSo fortunately that word has remained Unpolluted, uncontaminated by the priests Unpoisoned by the priests. And life is god! And the beauty is that if you believe in life You need not be a Hindu\nOr a Mohammedan or a Christian. If you rejoice life\nThere is no need of any ideology.\nYou need not even be a believer of god, a theist You can even be an atheist\nAnd still rejoice in life.\nBuddha was an atheist; he never believed in god And I think he did perfectly well\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat he never believed in god\nBecause he came to see that how the word 'god' Has been exploited by the priests;\nHe simply dropped the word, he never used it.\nMy whole vision is that\nOf a dancing, singing, loving, laughing humanity. I would like to fill the whole earth\nWith laughter, with music, With poetry, with paintings,\nWith creativity, with more sensitivity.\nAnd the more a person is sensitive, creative The more he is close to the creator, obviously. So rejoice in life -- remember\nThat is my message to you!\n(To Bernhard) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Sadhu. Anand means bliss. Sadhu means one who is very simple. An embodiment of simplicity.\nBe blissful and be simple.\nA complex person is bound to be cunning Because he has so many personalities.\nHe is a crowd -- how he can be simple? And he has to manage\nThe whole madhouse within himself -- He cannot be simple, and of course, He cannot be blissful either because\nThose so many faces, so many personalities, Those so many small selves\nAre constantly at each other's neck. There is constant war inside, People are living in a civil war Fighting within themselves --\nOne hand fighting with another hand One leg fighting with another leg One part fighting with another part.\nHence the mess in which humanity lives, Hence the misery.\nBliss and simplicity\nAre like two sides of the same coin. Bliss means you are one\nThere is no crowd, you don't have many faces, You have simply your original face.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou don't pretend to be anything else\nYou are simply whatsoever you are. You live in total acceptance of it\nIn the very suchness of it.\nYou have no desire to be somebody else. Complexity arises\nWith the desire of being somebody else. Complexity arises with the ideas:\nYou are this and you would like to be that You are A and you would like to be B;\nNow you will be in trouble -- you can never be B. You are A and you are going to remain A.\nNow there are only two possible ways of being A: One is, being in constant conflict with it\nAnd suffering, miserable;\nAnother is, in total acceptance of it. Bliss is the by-product\nOf that deep acceptance of whatever you are. That is simplicity.\nA simple person is one\nWho has no hankering to be anybody else Who simply rejoices whatsoever he is.\nHe never compares himself with anybody. He knows everybody is different\nHence there is no point in comparison. He never puts himself above others\nOr below others.\nHe knows, 'I am myself, they are themselves.' There is no question\nOf inferiority or superiority;\nNobody is inferior and nobody in superior. Then great simplicity arises in you\nAnd with that simplicity Comes the fragrance of bliss!\n(To Alfons) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyano. Anand means bliss. Dhyano means meditation.\nBeing blissful is being meditative And vice versa:\nBeing meditative is being blissful. One can start from anywhere:\nEither by being blissful\nOne can enter into meditation\nOr by being meditative one can enter into bliss.\nTwo doors 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLeading to the same temple, to the same shrine. My suggestion for you is:\nEnter from the door of bliss\nAnd let meditation happen through it. My experience and observation is that Younger people can easily enter\nFrom the door of bliss and reach meditation. Older people can easily enter\nThrough the door of meditation\nAnd reach blissfulness -- it depends on the age. Before thirty-five it is easier to be cheerful\nFar more easier! In fact it is very difficult To be sad and serious.\nAs you grow in age, as life becomes More and more a burden on you,\nIt starts destroying many things in you:\nIt destroys your qualities to wonder, It destroys your qualities to laugh,\nIt destroys your qualities to enjoy small things of life. As you grow older\nYou become so knowledgeable, so egoistic That you lose all innocence.\nAnd with your innocence gone Bliss becomes impossible, Cheerfulness becomes impossible.\nOlder people have to make an effort to laugh; Children are giggling constantly --\nFor no reason at all, or any excuse will do. You start being cheerful -- dance, sing...\nAnd this place is a place\nOf dancers and singers and musicians... This place is not a serious place.\nDon't at all think\nThat you have entered in a monastery --\nIt is not a monastery, it is just its opposite:\nIt may be a carnival but it is not a monastery! And I love carnivals more than monasteries.\nMonasteries are for dead people\nAnd one can be serious when one is dead;\nIn your grave you can remain serious forever. A disciple of Confucius asked him,\n'Master, how to be serious?'\nAnd Confucius scolded him; he said, 'You can be serious when you are dead, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn your grave.'\nIt does not seem to be accidental\nThat graveness also means seriousness. Nobody has ever seen a dead person laughing And nobody\nWho has become incapable of laughing is alive. Confucius said,\n'You can be serious when you are dead\nBut right now there is no need to be serious. Birds are not serious, trees are not serious\nStars are not serious, so why should you be?' And I perfectly agree with him.\nSo be here in a very non-serious way. Enjoy the fun of it.\nHow long you will be here?\n-- Half a year.\n-- That's good! We will destroy your seriousness. You have something serious inside you --\nmaybe carrying something from your past lives...\nBut we will destroy it! Just, this seriousness can't be from this life -- that much is certain. It must be a hangover! Good. Do many groups!\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #27\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2079","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2079 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the priests;</p><p>He simply dropped the word, he never used it.</p><p>My whole vision is that</p><p>Of a dancing, singing, loving, laughing humanity. I would like to
fill the whole earth</p><p>With laughter, with music, With poetry, with paintings,</p><p>With creativity, with more sensitivity.</p><p>And the more a person is sensitive, creative The more he is close to
the creator, obviously. So rejoice in life -- remember</p><p>That is my message to you!</p><p>(To Bernhard) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Sadhu. Anand means
bliss. Sadhu means one who is very simple. An embodiment of
simplicity.</p><p>Be blissful and be simple.</p><p>A complex person is bound to be cunning Because he has so many
personalities.</p><p>He is a crowd -- how he can be simple? And he has to manage</p><p>The whole madhouse within himself -- He cannot be simple, and of
course, He cannot be blissful either because</p><p>Those so many faces, so many personalities, Those so many small
selves</p><p>Are constantly at each other's neck. There is constant war inside,
People are living in a civil war Fighting within themselves --</p><p>One hand fighting with another hand One leg fighting with another leg
One part fighting with another part.</p><p>Hence the mess in which humanity lives, Hence the misery.</p><p>Bliss and simplicity</p><p>Are like two sides of the same coin. Bliss means you are one</p><p>There is no crowd, you don't have many faces, You have simply your
original face.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

it</p><p>In the very suchness of it.</p><p>You have no desire to be somebody else. Complexity arises</p><p>With the desire of being somebody else. Complexity arises with the
ideas:</p><p>You are this and you would like to be that You are A and you would
like to be B;</p><p>Now you will be in trouble -- you can never be B. You are A and you
are going to remain A.</p><p>Now there are only two possible ways of being A: One is, being in
constant conflict with it</p><p>And suffering, miserable;</p><p>Another is, in total acceptance of it. Bliss is the by-product</p><p>Of that deep acceptance of whatever you are. That is simplicity.</p><p>A simple person is one</p><p>Who has no hankering to be anybody else Who simply rejoices
whatsoever he is.</p><p>He never compares himself with anybody. He knows everybody is
different</p><p>Hence there is no point in comparison. He never puts himself above
others</p><p>Or below others.</p><p>He knows, 'I am myself, they are themselves.' There is no
question</p><p>Of inferiority or superiority;</p><p>Nobody is inferior and nobody in superior. Then great simplicity
arises in you</p><p>And with that simplicity Comes the fragrance of bliss!</p><p>(To Alfons) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dhyano. Anand means
bliss. Dhyano means meditation.</p><p>Being blissful is being meditative And vice versa:</p><p>Being meditative is being blissful.

is:</p><p>Enter from the door of bliss</p><p>And let meditation happen through it. My experience and observation
is that Younger people can easily enter</p><p>From the door of bliss and reach meditation. Older people can easily
enter</p><p>Through the door of meditation</p><p>And reach blissfulness -- it depends on the age. Before thirty-five
it is easier to be cheerful</p><p>Far more easier! In fact it is very difficult To be sad and
serious.</p><p>As you grow in age, as life becomes More and more a burden on
you,</p><p>It starts destroying many things in you:</p><p>It destroys your qualities to wonder, It destroys your qualities to
laugh,</p><p>It destroys your qualities to enjoy small things of life. As you grow
older</p><p>You become so knowledgeable, so egoistic That you lose all
innocence.</p><p>And with your innocence gone Bliss becomes impossible, Cheerfulness
becomes impossible.</p><p>Older people have to make an effort to laugh; Children are giggling
constantly --</p><p>For no reason at all, or any excuse will do. You start being cheerful
-- dance, sing...</p><p>And this place is a place</p><p>Of dancers and singers and musicians... This place is not a serious
place.</p><p>Don't at all think</p><p>That you have entered in a monastery --</p><p>It is not a monastery, it is just its opposite:</p><p>It may be a carnival but it is not a monastery! And I love carnivals
more than monasteries.</p><p>Monasteries are for dead people</p><p>And one can be serious when one is dead;</p><p>In your grave you can remain serious forever. A disciple of Confucius
asked him,</p><p>'Master, how to be serious?'</p><p>And Confucius scolded him; he said, 'You can be serious when you are
dead, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

person laughing And nobody</p><p>Who has become incapable of laughing is alive. Confucius said,</p><p>'You can be serious when you are dead</p><p>But right now there is no need to be serious. Birds are not serious,
trees are not serious</p><p>Stars are not serious, so why should you be?' And I perfectly agree
with him.</p><p>So be here in a very non-serious way. Enjoy the fun of it.</p><p>How long you will be here?</p><p>-- Half a year.</p><p>-- That's good! We will destroy your seriousness. You have something
serious inside you --</p><p>maybe carrying something from your past lives...</p><p>But we will destroy it! Just, this seriousness can't be from this
life -- that much is certain. It must be a hangover! Good. Do many
groups!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #27</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

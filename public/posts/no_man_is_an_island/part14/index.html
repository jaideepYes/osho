Remember only one thing because\nI have reduced sannyas to its bare minimum -- And that is meditation.\nEverything else is peripheral. Everything else can be dropped But meditation cannot be dropped.\nThat is the only essential thing Which no religion can dare to drop.\nThere are religions which believe in god There are religions which don't believe in god; Even the concept of god\nIs not very essential for a religion.\nThere are religions who believe in many lives And there are religions\nWho believe only in one life; Even that is not essential.\nThose are all hypothetical things. But there in so religion possible Which can drop meditation Which can be non-meditative.\nAll the religions meet on one point only And that is meditation.\nWhether they call it prayer or meditation It doesn't matter.\nThose are different names for the same state, A state of inner silence.\nAnd the miracle is:\nOrdinarily your inner world\nIs full of thoughts, desires, dreams; When all these have been dropped\nThrough being aware of the whole process of mind; Nobody can drop them by any act,\nThey drop on their own accord If you are simply watching them With no effort to drop them.\nJust by watching a distance is created. Slowly slowly\nThe watcher becomes different from the watched And the moment the distance is absolute clear 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe watcher disappears, it becomes disconnected. It becomes uprooted from your being.\nThis moment it the moment of radical change: Here thoughts, desires, the whole mind disappears And suddenly a new being explodes in you.\nThat being can only be called love. The word that comes closest is 'love'. A man who has no mind to cling to Becomes full of love.\nMeditation helps\nTo get rid of the mind, on the one hand, And on the other hand\nIt helps you to become receptive For the energy called love;\nIt descends from the beyond.\nIt is alight, eternal light and delight too. And the moment one knows what love is One has tasted eternity, on has tasted god! Jesus is perfectly right when he says,\nGod is love. He is talking about\nThis innermost experience of meditation.\nSo my sannyas has no other peripheral hypothesis. Nothing has to be believed in\nNo rituals to be performed But a constant watchfulness. And whenever you have time\nThen sit silently, just looking at your own mind. Let your mind be the screen on which\nPictures move and you are just a witness --\nDon't forget the witness, go on remembering that 'I am only a witness.'\nThis simple process\nCan do the greatest miracle on the earth because It brings buddhahood, it brings enlightenment\nIt brings awakening.\n(To Yves) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Yves.\nAnand means bliss, blissfulness. Yves means a beloved disciple. Bliss is possible only if you become a disciple.\nThe process of becoming a disciple Is the process of renouncing the ego. Ego is the cause of all misery.\nOnce ego is surrendered there is nothing To prevent you from becoming blissful. The master-disciple relationship 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIs only a device, a strategy\nTo help the disciple to drop the ego. It is very difficult\nTo drop it by yourself, all alone. It is possible, it is not impossible. Once in a while it has happened But those are exceptions\nAnd exceptions only prove the rule.\nThe rule is that you will need a certain device To support you, to help you because\nTo drop the ego means\nTo become so vulnerable, so insecure, so open That one becomes frightened, one again closes up One again clings to the ego because\nYou don't know anything else except the ego. Dropping the ego is like death.\nIt is possible only\nIn a deep love affair with a master\nThat slowly slowly you can gather courage. As you trust in the master grows\nIt becomes possible for you to risk.\nAnd the moment you are ready to risk the ego Bliss starts flowing from every nook\nAnd corner of existence towards you. It is the rock of ego\nThat prevents bliss from reaching to you\nTo be a disciple is the whole science of religion Because through being a disciple\nThe ultimate bliss opens its mysteries to you. In fact, except your ego\nThere is no other problem in the world.\nAll other problems are by-products of the ego. You have a beautiful name\nNow this name has to be made a reality. Sannyas is a first step towards that realization.\n(To Nasser) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Nasser. Dhyan means meditation. Nasser means victorious.\nIt is one of the qualities of god Described in Koran.\nKoran describes ninety-nine qualities of god. One of them is nasser, the victorious.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe can't be victorious.\nIf we allow god to pass through us Then the victory is ours,\nWe can't be victorious on our own.\nOn our own we are going to be defeated On our own there is no hope.\nWe are so tiny, like dewdrops, Dewdrop on a leaf of grass --\nThat's how Mahavira used to describe man's life. A little breeze and the dewdrop is gone\nOr the sun rises and the dewdrop evaporates. We are very small:\nUnless we drop ourselves in the ocean of god Unless we become oceanic, we can't be victorious. We can't be victorious as ourselves\nWe can be victorious only through god. And that's what meditation is:\nIt is allowing god to pass through you\nNot preventing him. Removing all the barriers, Barriers of thoughts, desires\nMemories, imagination; removing all the barriers So you can simply become a pure passage\nAnd god can flow though you.\nThen your life will have the taste of victory Of tremendous joy, of bliss, of benediction.\n(To Peter) -- This is your name: Swami Nirmal. Nirmal means pure.\nMan's consciousness is eternally pure\nBut it becomes covered with many layers of dust; Like a mirror.\nAlthough the mirror remains pure The dust cannot destroy the mirror But the dust can destroy one thing: It can hide the quality of the mirror The quality of reflecting reality.\nThe mirror remains the same\nNo change in the mirror happens Through the layer of dust\nBut is no more functioning\nIt becomes non-functional; it cannot reflect. The sun rises but not for it\nThe night becomes full of stars but not for it The rose opens but not for it\nThe lake reflects the moon but not for it. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is there but a layer of dust\nIs preventing its qualities to function.\nThat's our situation: Our consciousness is pure But our mind is a layer of dust and nothing else. Sannyas means becoming aware of this fact And putting the mind aside.\nUse it when it is needed; it has its utility It is a good machine, it is a biocomputer\nIt has all the memories, all the information -- So whenever you need it, use it.\nBut there is no need to allow it\nTo cover you for twenty-four hours Day in, day out, year in, year out.\nIt should be put aside when it is not being used And the consciousness should be allowed\nTo reflect reality -- then god is everywhere. Once your consciousness reflects that which is You know. God need no proof.\nOnly god is and nothing else is Every form is a manifestation of god.\nAnd to know it, is to rejoice because that means There is no death, no misery, no darkness.\nOne has arrived home!\n(To Paolo) -- This is your name: Swami Nirdosh. Nirdosh means innocent, innocent like a child.\nMan has to become a child again Only then he is really aware\nOf the beauty of existence Of the wonder of existence.\nThat very awe is the beginning of religion. But it happens\nAnd it is bound to happen, it cannot be avoided,\nIt is almost a necessary evil that\nEvery child will have to lose his innocence Because he will have to be educated\nHe will have to be taught certain languages, Science, geography, mathematics\nCertain essential subjects.\nHe will have to be an expert in a certain branch, A doctor, an engineer, a scientist.\nLife's requirements are such:\nHe cannot be left alone.\nAnd all this education takes away his innocence; He becomes knowledgeable\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHe becomes full of information And he forgets the joy of wonder Because now he thinks he knows So what is the point of wonder?\nHe forgets the immense dimension of awe.\nNothing surprises him --\nThat is a kind of spiritual death.\nHe becomes very useful for the world\nHe become clever, cunning, he becomes powerful Because he has a certain utility in the world.\nHe becomes a commodity in the marketplace, He is purchasable, sellable.\nThe greater his knowledge, the more is his price, But something of great value is lost --\nThat has to be regained. Sannyas is nothing but\nAn effort to regain the paradise lost.\nIt is a conscious effort to put aside knowledge So that you can again look like a child: Innocent, with the same eyes of wonder.\nThe day it happens you are transformed Your life starts having a dance\nYour heart starts singing again,\nA forgotten language is remembered Again everything is full of surprise. The whole existence is full of wonder\nEverything is mysterious, miraculous. This whole mystery and miracle\nIs condensed in a single name, god. God is not a person\nBut this whole experience of mystery\nThis unending pilgrimage from one peak of wonder To another higher peak of wonder\nFrom one awe into another awe, This is what god is all about.\nJesus says, 'Unless you are reborn again You will not enter into my kingdom of god.' That's exactly what he means:\nBe innocent like a child. That is going to be\nThe work for you to do upon yourself.\n(To Doris) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Sindhu.\nAnand means bliss; Sindhu means ocean -- an ocean of bliss. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOur body is small, out mind is small\nBut our being is vast -- as vast as the ocean; In fact, vaster than any ocean because\nEven the greatest ocean has its limits But our being has no limits, it is infinite. It has three qualities.\nThe first quality is truth.\nWhen you experience your being\nFor the first time you taste something of truth. Before that\nYou had known only theories about truth.\nIt was like a man who has known much about food But has no experience of eating anything at all.\nIt is like a man\nWho understands everything about water And is thirsty: He knows the formula, H2O\nBut that formula is not going to quench his thirst. He understands intellectually what water is,\nOf what it is constituted But he has never seen water He has never drank water\nHe has never tasted the coolness, the contentment That comes when your thirst is quenched.\nTruth we have not known\nWe have only heard many theories about it. Those are all hypotheses.\nWhen you enter your being Beyond the body, beyond the mind The first taste is of truth\nAnd the second taste is of consciousness. Otherwise consciousness is only a word. People are fast asleep,\nThey don't know what consciousness is. They are not conscious at all,\nThey are like robots, functioning like machines. And the ultimate, the third thing\nIs bliss, anand -- that is the peak. As you go deeper into yourself First you encounter truth\nThen you encounter consciousness\nAnd at the very core of it, you encounter bliss. The way to this bliss is\nTo this oceanic bliss is\nBecoming unidentified with the body-mind complex. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOne has to remember constantly that\n'I am not the body,' that 'I am not the mind,' That 'I am the watcher, the witness.' Slowly slowly it becomes so natural\nThat you need not remember it,\nIt is simply there, an undercurrent; Even in your sleep you know that,\n'I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am the witness.'\nEven in your dreaming you know 'I am the witness of the dreams.'\nWhen this witness has deepened so greatly You are on the verge of a breakthrough.\nThen any moment all boundaries disappear And suddenly you are unbounded, infinite.\nThat's the goal of sannyas\nThat's the goal of all religion as such: To become infinite.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #15\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2269","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2269 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the dewdrop is gone</p><p>Or the sun rises and the dewdrop evaporates. We are very small:</p><p>Unless we drop ourselves in the ocean of god Unless we become
oceanic, we can't be victorious. We can't be victorious <em>as</em>
ourselves</p><p>We can be victorious only through god. And that's what meditation
is:</p><p>It is allowing god to pass through you</p><p>Not preventing him. Removing all the barriers, Barriers of thoughts,
desires</p><p>Memories, imagination; removing <em>all</em> the barriers So you can
simply become a pure passage</p><p>And god can flow though you.</p><p>Then your life will have the taste of victory Of tremendous joy, of
bliss, of benediction.</p><p>(To Peter) -- This is your name: Swami Nirmal. Nirmal means pure.</p><p>Man's consciousness is eternally pure</p><p>But it becomes covered with many layers of dust; Like a mirror.</p><p>Although the mirror remains pure The dust cannot destroy the mirror

layer of dust and nothing else. Sannyas means becoming aware of this
fact And putting the mind aside.</p><p>Use it when it is needed; it has its utility It is a good machine, it
is a biocomputer</p><p>It has all the memories, all the information -- So whenever you need
it, use it.</p><p>But there is no need to allow it</p><p>To cover you for twenty-four hours Day in, day out, year in, year
out.</p><p>It should be put aside when it is not being used And the
consciousness should be allowed</p><p>To reflect reality -- then god is everywhere. Once your consciousness
reflects that which is You know. God need no proof.</p><p>Only god is and nothing else is Every form is a manifestation of
god.</p><p>And to know it, is to rejoice because that means There is no death,
no misery, no darkness.</p><p>One has arrived home!</p><p>(To Paolo) -- This is your name: Swami Nirdosh. Nirdosh means
innocent, innocent like a child.</p><p>Man has to become a child again Only then he is really aware</p><p>Of the beauty of existence Of the wonder of existence.</p><p>That very awe is the beginning of religion. But it happens</p><p>And it is bound to happen, it cannot be avoided,</p><p>It is almost a necessary evil that</p><p>Every child will have to lose his innocence Because he will have to
be educated</p><p>He will have to be taught certain languages, Science, geography,
mathematics</p><p>Certain essential subjects.</p><p>He will have to be an expert in a certain branch, A doctor, an
engineer, a scientist.</p><p>Life's requirements are such:</p><p>He cannot be left alone.</p><p>And all this education takes away his innocence; He becomes

Because now he thinks he knows So what is the point of wonder?</p><p>He forgets the immense dimension of awe.</p><p>Nothing surprises him --</p><p>That is a kind of spiritual death.</p><p>He becomes <em>very</em> useful for the world</p><p>He become clever, cunning, he becomes powerful Because he has a
certain utility in the world.</p><p>He becomes a commodity in the marketplace, He is purchasable,
sellable.</p><p>The greater his knowledge, the more is his price, But something of
great value is lost --</p><p>That has to be regained. Sannyas is nothing but</p><p>An effort to regain the paradise lost.</p><p>It is a conscious effort to put aside knowledge So that you can again
look like a child: Innocent, with the same eyes of wonder.</p><p>The day it happens you are transformed Your life starts having a
dance</p><p>Your heart starts singing again,</p><p>A forgotten language is remembered Again everything is full of
surprise. The whole existence is full of wonder</p><p>Everything is mysterious, miraculous. This whole mystery and
miracle</p><p>Is condensed in a single name, god. God is not a person</p><p>But this whole experience of mystery</p><p>This unending pilgrimage from one peak of wonder To another higher
peak of wonder</p><p>From one awe into another awe, This is what god is all about.</p><p>Jesus says, 'Unless you are reborn again You will not enter into my
kingdom of god.' That's exactly what he means:</p><p>Be innocent like a child. That is going to be</p><p>The work for you to do upon yourself.</p><p>(To Doris) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Sindhu.</p><p>Anand means bliss; Sindhu means ocean -- an ocean of bliss.

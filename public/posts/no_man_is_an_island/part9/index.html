It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Usha) -- Your name: Ma Anand Usha.\nRemember only one thing because I want my sannyasins to be concerned only with the very essential.\nThe non-essentials have destroyed the whole beauty of religion. And once the non-essentials start becoming important the essential is lost. And there are a thousand and one non-essential things in life. All the religions have become a great chaos, for the simple reason that the essential is lost sight of. The essential is meditation, everything else is non-essential. All beliefs are non-essential. Whether one believes in god or does not believe, it matters not at all, because those who have believed - they have reached, and those who have not believed - they have also reached. Buddha never believed in god, yet he became enlightened. Jesus believed in god, yet he became enlightened, hence the belief in god is a non-essential thing; it is only a question of like and dislike. But neither Buddha nor Jesus nor Mahavira nor Patanjali can avoid meditation.\nAnybody who avoids meditation misses the goal. Then he can go on believing in a thousand things but nothing is going to help - the naked truth is that all beliefs are decorations. The essential thing is that one should become silent, utterly\nsilent; thoughtless, alert, aware. And one should start moving inwards, when one reaches one's center then all is revealed; there is no need to believe beforehand. In fact to believe beforehand is a disturbance. Then you are prejudiced and any mind that is prejudiced cannot go very far.\nOne needs an absolutely unprejudiced approach with no conclusions, no knowledge, no belief and you will attain to the ultimate very easily. If one gets entangled into beliefs and what is right and what is wrong and what to do and what not to do, then it becomes impossible.\nIn Buddhist scriptures there are thirty-three thousand rules for a monk. Even to remember them is impossible. There is no question of following - how can one remember thirty-three thousand rules? And one's whole life will be wasted in remembering those rules. And if you have to follow thirty-three thousand rules you will become a robot, you will lose all spontaneity, you will not be able to move a single inch!\nYour whole life will be cramped, paralyzed you will live in a prison. And Buddha was teaching freedom, ultimate freedom, and the outcome is thirty-three thousand rules. The moment he died scholars started collecting all the rules. How they collected thirty-three thousand rules that too is a miracle, a feat!\nThe way they followed was that of Buddha who was talking to millions of people in his long life, forty-two years he was a master, an enlightened master. He became enlightened when he was forty and remained alive up to the age of eighty-two. So for forty-two years he was teaching and he was telling different people different things - their needs were different. They collected everything, whatsoever he has 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsaid. It is as if you go on collecting all the prescriptions of a doctor which have been given to different patients for different illnesses - of course you will be able to collect thirty-three thousand prescriptions and then if you deliver those prescriptions to one single person, you will kill him immediately. Just the load of the prescriptions will be enough. He will not be able even to reach to the\nchemist! And he will be in such a contradiction, he will not know what is happening. He will be in a mess - if he follows this rule then some other rules are broken. If he follows that rule then some other rule is broken. You will drive him crazy! Or if he is a sensible, intelligent person he will become a hypocrite: he will pretend that he follows the rules and he will live his own private life utterly ignoring all those rules.\nSo there is no rule in my sannyas, no ritual; I don't prescribe anything. My whole insistence is for a single medicine and that medicine is meditation. Both the words meditation and medicine come from the same root. Medicine cures the body, meditation cures the soul.\nSo from today you keep only one thing in your mind. And whenever you have time - and there is no need to make a fixed time, that creates difficulties. One day you may have some work, you may have somewhere to go and then it becomes a trouble: if you don't follow the routine you feel guilt; if you follow the routine your ordinary life is disturbed. There is no need to make it so that you have to do every day in the morning, six to seven - there is no need to make any particular time. Any time will do. And there is no need even to think that you have to do it only once or twice. As many times as you get the opportunity just close your eyes and disappear within. Slowly slowly the knack starts happening. Slowly slowly something opens up. And that opening leads you beyond the body, beyond the mind, to the farther shore.\nGood, Usha! Good.\n(To Martha) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Dhyana. Anand means bliss. Dhyana means meditation.\nBliss is a flowering of meditation. Meditation is like a rose bush And bliss is like roses.\nWithout meditation\nThere are no flowers in life and no fragrance,\nOne lives utterly empty, meaningless.\nOne's whole life remains just like a driftwood; Accidental, with no sense of direction.\nOne does not know why one is doing this or that Why one is alive at all -- for what?\nOne has no answers and because to know That 'I have no answers,'\nOne never raises the questions Because those questions hurt,\nThey make you aware of your ignorance.\nOne avoids the questions so that one can remain Unaware that one's life is absolutely pointless One keeps oneself occupied\nInto thousand and one small things, tiny goals: Achieve money, power, prestige\nDo this, do that -- very short-sighted goals.\nAnd you can achieve money and you can have power But nothing happens out of it\nBecause you remain the same.\nThen have no money, then have more power And there is no end to it.\nIt is chasing shadows. It is such a stupid act But everybody goes into it because one finds 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nEverybody else going into it And people are imitators.\nI don't know\nWhether Charles Darwin is right or not But when I look at people's imitativeness Then I start thinking maybe he is right, that Man has come from the monkeys.\nMaybe biologically it is not true\nBut psychologically it seems to be very true.\nAll men are monkeys:\nJust to see somebody purchasing a new car And you have to purchase a new car Somebody has a new house\nYou have to have a new house. This is how you go on and on:\nYou go on following others And others are following you. It is such a foolish game\nAnd we are moving in circles.\nAnd one can waste one's life very easily Because it is so short; but it is strange.\nIf you ask people, 'Why are you playing cards? Why are you playing poker?\nWhy you are so deeply engaged into chess?' They say, 'To kill time.'\nAs if they have more time than they need.\nAs if time is so useless that you have to kill it. Time is the most precious thing!\nOnce gone it is gone forever. And we don't have much time; Life is really very short.\nIt flies so fast that between birth and death There is not much gap\nAnd people are killing time not knowing at all That in fact it is just the other way round: Time is killing you.\nIn Hindu language\nWe have the same word for both time and death Song word 'kal' means both, time and death Because time brings death, time is killing you Time is death.\nThe moment a child is born he starts dying. If he has been there just for five minutes That means he has died a little bit.\nOut of his seventy years life\nFive minutes are gone, he is less alive Than he was just five minutes before. And it is slipping out of our fingers.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSomething has to be done\nAnd something has to be done very determinedly With great determination and commitment\nOnly then meditation is possible. It needs a focussed, intense effort.\nYou have to put all your energies into it. People start meditation\nThousands of people start meditation\nBut only out of curiosity hence nothing happens. One or two days or three days they will meditate And they will say, 'Nothing is happening.' Meditation is not like going into a movie\nOr watching TV -- that just you sit and you watch And something starts happening,\nYou have nothing to do. You have to transform\nYour whole structure of mind.\nYou have to dismantle the whole edifice\nYou have to find out where your reality is hiding You have to uncover it, discover it.\nIt needs a persistent and patient effort. But if one works it pays tremendously. It is worth -- even if you have to put Your whole life energy into it to attain it\nIt is worth because it is far more valuable Than your whole life.\nA single moment of meditation\nIs more valuable than your whole life Because in that single moment\nYou attain to eternal life\nWhich knows no birth, no death And that is the flowering\nThat is where one becomes blissful. Without knowing it one remains in misery Because if one is going to die\nHow can one be blissful? How can one avoid death?\nIts shadow falls continuously. In everything you are doing There is the shadow of death\nAnd it is deepening every moment.\nEven when you are in love with somebody Even making love, death is present.\nSometimes it is more present\nIn those moments when you are silent When you are enjoying it is more present Because in those moments\nYou are a little more alert, you can feel it. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt almost always happens to intelligent people That while making love they become sad And if not while making\nThen afterwards they become sad. And they become very much puzzled Because it was a beautiful experience And why they have become sad?\nThat beautiful experience\nHas made them a little alert and now they know Death will take everything away.\nAll these beautiful moments Are not going to save them\nAnd all these beautiful moments\nAre fleeting moments, they are not going to abide Sooner of later all will be gone.\nA miserable person\nWho has never know a single glimpse of joy Will not be so aware of death\nBecause he lives in misery,\nHe himself lives in such darkness That death cannot make its shadow.\nWhen you are in darkness, you don't make a shadow When you come into light\nImmediately the shadow disappears. That's why when ever you are happy\nFeeling good, healthy, suddenly a shadow appears And that shadow is of death\nAnd that makes one sad. One cannot be really happy Unless one comes to know\nThat one's innermost core is beyond death. To know that is the only bliss\nAnd that's the goal of sannyas. Meditation is the way to attain it. Bliss is the goal.\n(To Michael) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Amoha. Anand means bliss. Amoha means non-attachment.\nMisery comes out of attachment. We become attached to things To people, to places.\nWe are addicted with attachment\nWe cling to anything and clinging brings misery Because life goes on changing\nIt is in an constant movement, it is never static 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nEven for two consecutive moments.\nSo to cling to such a life is to create misery Because it can't remain as you want it: Whether you cling or not, it is going to change. Except change, everything changes.\nIn life only change is a non-changing phenomenon. So the man of understanding\nNever clings to anything. Seeing that everything changes These is no point in clinging.\nIt is foolish, it is unintelligent And you create your own misery\nAnd then you condemn the whole world. The world is not responsible\nNobody is responsible for your misery Except your own unawareness Unawareness of this absolutely certain fact That life is a constant change\nSeeing it one stops clinging\nThen whatsoever comes, one watches. One remains a witness\nOne enjoys it while it is there.\nWhen the beautiful sunset is there, enjoy it But don't cling to it -- it is not a photograph Soon it will disappear, it is disappearing While you are watching, it is disappearing. Soon the night will fall, but why be worried Because the night has its own beauty.\nThe stars will appear.\nBut the clinger is such a fool that\nHe will try to cling with the beautiful sunset\nHe would like that it remains static forever. It is good that what he asks does not happen\nOtherwise we would have been bored by things. Life never listens to our stupid demands\nIt goes on its own way Undistracted by millions of fools\nCalling to stop: shouting, crying, weeping. Life never listens to anybody because\nThose fools don't know what they are asking for They will cry for the sunset\nBecause it is no more there and in that crying They will miss the new appearing stars.\nBy the time they get free of that misery and They start looking at the beautiful starry night. Again the same foolishness is there:\nThey start clinging to it, but it is fleeting, Soon it will be gone.\nOtherwise the sunrise will not happen They will again cry.\nTheir eyes are always red And because of their tears\nThey cannot see what is the real.\nThen they will miss the beauty of the sunrise And so on, so forth, it goes on.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe fool goes on missing everything The wise man enjoys everything.\nHe enjoys the day, he enjoys the night\nHe enjoys the summer, he enjoys the winter. He enjoys life, he enjoys death.\nHe is a non-clinger; in con-clinging is bliss. That's the way of sannyas:\nNon-attachment, non-clinging. Learn the art of being non-attached\nAnd you have learned the greatest secret of life.\n(To Sanatano) -- Laxmi, Sanatano wants his name to be explained?\n-- Yes, he wants.\n-- Sanatano? Call Sanatano first -- just call him.\n-- (Mukta calls;) Sanatano.\n-- Come here, Sanatano! So you have come finally! Good! How long you will be here?\n-- One life.\n-- Mm?\n-- One life.\n-- Be a little longer! (laughter) Be a little less miserly -- just one life you say? Forever! -- And a little longer! That is the meaning of your name.\nSanatano means the eternal\nThat which has no beginning and no end Which has always been and will always be. That is our reality, that's our truth.\nAnd to live it\nIs the only bliss, the only benediction. And it is not far away; it is so close That's why we go on missing it.\nIt is like a fish missing the ocean Because it is in the ocean.\nWe are in the eternal, inseparably in it. The eternal is in us\nIn fact, there is no division at all: Each moment We are merging and melting in the whole.\nTo know it and life immediately becomes\nA dance, a song -- and that is true revolution! You have been a revolutionary\nBut that was not true revolution.\nNow you have come in the most dangerous hands! This is true revolution.\nIt does not change the outer structure\nIt is not concerned with outer structures, It changes the very consciousness of man. And if the consciousness changes\nThen the outer structures Will change themselves. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo good that you have come here -- I was waiting for you!\nCome close you call one more. Come close.

rule is broken. You will drive him crazy! Or if he is a sensible,
intelligent person he will become a hypocrite: he will pretend that he
follows the rules and he will live his own private life utterly ignoring
all those rules.</p><p>So there is no rule in my sannyas, no ritual; I don't prescribe
anything. My whole insistence is for a single medicine and that medicine
is meditation. Both the words meditation and medicine come from the same
root. Medicine cures the body, meditation cures the soul.</p><p>So from today you keep only one thing in your mind. And whenever you
have time - and there is no need to make a fixed time, that creates
difficulties. One day you may have some work, you may have somewhere to
go and then it becomes a trouble: if you don't follow the routine you
feel guilt; if you follow the routine your ordinary life is disturbed.
There is no need to make it so that you have to do every day in the
morning, six to seven - there is no need to make any particular time.
Any time will do. And there is no need even to think that you have to do
it only once or twice. As many times as you get the opportunity just
close your eyes and disappear within. Slowly slowly the knack starts
happening. Slowly slowly something opens up. And that opening leads you
beyond the body, beyond the mind, to the farther shore.</p><p>Good, Usha! Good.</p><p>(To Martha) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Dhyana. Anand means bliss.
Dhyana means meditation.</p><p>Bliss is a flowering of meditation. Meditation is like a rose bush
And bliss is like roses.</p><p>Without meditation</p><p>There are no flowers in life and no fragrance,</p><p>One lives utterly empty, meaningless.</p><p>One's whole life remains just like a driftwood; Accidental, with no
sense of direction.</p><p>One does not know why one is doing this or that Why one is alive at
all -- for what?</p><p>One has no answers and because to know That 'I have no answers,'</p><p>One never raises the questions Because those questions hurt,</p><p>They make you aware of your ignorance.</p><p>One avoids the questions so that one can remain Unaware that one's
life is absolutely pointless One keeps oneself occupied</p><p>Into thousand and one small things, tiny goals: Achieve money, power,
prestige</p><p>Do this, do that -- very short-sighted goals.</p><p>And you can achieve money and you can have power But nothing happens
out of it</p><p>Because you remain the same.</p><p>Then have no money, then have more power And there is no end to

determination and commitment</p><p>Only then meditation is possible. It needs a focussed, intense

meditation</p><p>Thousands of people start meditation</p><p>But only out of curiosity hence nothing happens. One or two days or
three days they will meditate And they will say, 'Nothing is happening.'
Meditation is not like going into a movie</p><p>Or watching TV -- that just you sit and you watch And something

remain as you want it: Whether you cling or not, it is going to change.

understanding</p><p>Never clings to anything. Seeing that everything changes These is no
point in clinging.</p><p>It is foolish, it is unintelligent And you create your own misery</p><p>And then you condemn the whole world. The world is not
responsible</p><p>Nobody is responsible for your misery Except your own unawareness

change</p><p>Seeing it one stops clinging</p><p>Then whatsoever comes, one watches. One remains a witness</p><p>One enjoys it while it is there.</p><p>When the beautiful sunset is there, enjoy it But don't cling to it --
it is not a photograph Soon it will disappear, it is disappearing While
you are watching, it is disappearing. Soon the night will fall, but why
be worried Because the night has its own beauty.</p><p>The stars will appear.</p><p>But the clinger is such a fool that</p><p>He will try to cling with the beautiful sunset</p><p>He would like that it remains static forever. It is good that what he
asks does not happen</p><p>Otherwise we would have been bored by things. Life never listens to
our stupid demands</p><p>It goes on its own way Undistracted by millions of fools</p><p>Calling to stop: shouting, crying, weeping. Life never listens to
anybody because</p><p>Those fools don't know what they are asking for They will cry for the
sunset</p><p>Because it is no more there and in that crying They will miss the new
appearing stars.</p><p>By the time they get free of that misery and They start looking at
the beautiful starry night. Again the same foolishness is there:</p><p>They start clinging to it, but it is fleeting, Soon it will be
gone.</p><p>Otherwise the sunrise will not happen They will again cry.</p><p>Their eyes are always red And because of their tears</p><p>They cannot see what is the real.</p><p>Then they will miss the beauty of the sunrise And so on, so forth, it

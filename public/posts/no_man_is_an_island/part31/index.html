Action leads you into the world\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nRest leads you inwards.\nIn total rest you sink within yourself You can't go anywhere else;\nTo go anywhere you will need action. Hence meditation basically is total rest Total relaxation -- not of the body\nBut of the mind too, then it is total.\nWe can act physically, we can act mentally The body can be at rest but the mind\nCan go on through thousand and one activities: Desiring, imagining, remembering,\nThe past, the future.\nThere is a constant traffic of dreams. Total rest means\nThe body is at rest, the mind is at rest, as if The body and the mind both have disappeared, All activity has ceased\nThen you cannot go anywhere except To your own center\nYou will naturally sink into your own center You will disappear from the circumference And you will appear at the center\nAnd the center of your being Is the door to the divine.\nThe circumference is the bridge with the world And the center is the bridge with god.\nAnd the only problem for a real seeker of truth Is how to shift your energy\nFrom the circumference to the center -- That's the whole art of religion\nOr you can call it the science of religion; It is the same (inaudible)\nThat's what I teach you here. I am not against action;\nAction is good if it arises out of rest. Words are beautiful if they come Out of silence.\nThen they have some fragrance of truth in them, Then they have meaning, otherwise\nThey are just empty shells. Action is also meaningful\nWhen it comes out of a deep rest.\nThen you bring something of god into the world; You become a passage, you become a vehicle, And that's what sannyas is all about\nBecoming vehicles for god. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Ellen) -- This is our name: Ma Dhyan Ellen. Dhyan means meditation. Ellen means light. It also Means the bright one.\nMeditation brings you\nA tremendous explosion of light. It is just like atomic explosion;\nIt is not of atomic, it is of consciousness. It is not material, it is not outer\nIt is inner. But meditation is the key.\nAnd once your inner consciousness explodes Your life radiates bliss, radiates intelligence Radiates creativity, love, compassion.\nThousand and one flowers bloom suddenly. Before that person lives\nA life of utter emptiness\nA life which has no meaning, no significance\nA life which is impotent, which creates nothing which cannot be creative.\nMeditation makes you aware\nOf your great potential; makes you aware Of the kingdom of god what is within you. Sannyas and meditation are synonymous. Sannyas is only a declaration\nThat from now onwards\nYour life will be devoted to meditation That everything else will secondary That everything else will be used\nAs a means to meditation -- Even love will be secondary\nEven love will be used as a means for meditation. Unless meditation becomes your only one goal\nIt is impossible to attain it. It needs your total energy\nOne cannot go halfheartedly on the path. It is not for people\nWho are wavering, ambiguous, uncertain.\nIt is only for those who know what commitment is\nWho are courageous enough To commit themselves totally\nWhose surrender is not pseudo, of the mind. Whose surrender is that of love and the heart. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThen meditation is a very simple process But you have to make it\nThe centering fact of your life.\nIt can not be just one of the things Amongst many things.\nIt cannot be just one of the items\nOn the big shopping list of your life. It has to be the only one target\nAnd you have to go like an arrow, unwavering, Persistently towards it, patiently\nWith your total energy. Whatsoever you can put into it You have to put into it.\nThe moment you are hundred per cent devoted A sudden flash of light\nAnd your life is transformed:\nYou are no more the old one,\nThe old one is gone and the new is born. And then only one knows what life is\nThen only one tastes the immortality of life The tremendous joy of it,\nThe moment to moment ecstasy of it all.\n(To Masafumi) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Virago. Anand means bliss. Virago means non-attachment.\nFor centuries it has been told That non-attachment brings bliss. My teaching is just the opposite; I say bliss brings non-attachment.\nThe old teaching made non-attachment The basic phenomenon of a religious life, Hence it taught escapism, renunciation,\nDropping out of life -- but it was all repressive. You can escape from the world\nBut where will you escape from yourself?\nAnd the world\nIs not the problem in the first place. You are the problem.\nOne can renounce money But by renouncing money\nThe greed does not disappear.\nEven a beggar is as much greedy as an emperor. So whether you have money\nOr you don't have money, does not matter. In fact a beggar will be more greedy 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBecause we hanker for that which we don't have. You can renounce your wife\nYour children, your family\nBut what are you going to do with your sexuality? Just by renouncing your wife\nYou cannot drop your sexuality -- It will go with you\nAnd you will be continuously repressing it.\nIt will not create a healthy being in you, It will create pathology. Hence my teaching is: first become blissful...\nAnd bliss comes through meditation\nIt has nothing to do with non-attachment. Non-attachment is not a condition\nFor being blissful.\nBecome blissful and then many things Will disappear from you life\nOn their own accord because It is misery that creates greed;\nIf you are blissful you will be non-greedy And non-greed will come naturally,\nAs a by-product.\nIf you are blissful sex will become Automatically less and less significant Because you will know\nSomething higher, something deeper Than sex can ever give to you.\nSex can give only moments of joy\nBut meditation can make that joy something\nLike a constant undercurrent in your life.\nSex can give you a momentary orgasmic experience But meditation can give you an orgasmic being -- You are twenty-four hours in ecstasy, drunk.\nThen slowly slowly as a consequence Sex disappears.\nAnd when it disappears on its own accord There is beauty because\nThere is no presentation at all. Hence my approach is totally new,\nIt is diametrically opposite to the old approach. Bliss is a precondition for non-attachment\nNot vice versa.\nBecome blissful through meditation\nAnd then all that is meaningless will drop And all that is meaningful will (can't get it) You need not bother about that.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy sannyasins have to live life, have to live life in its totality I don't teach escapism. Escapism is cowardly.\nIt is not the way of the courageous And it is not the way of the sane.\n(To Grant) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Svarupo. Anand means bliss. Svarupo means self-nature.\nBliss is not something that comes from the outside. It grows within you, it is your self-nature. You are born with it. Of course it is only a potential, but it is within you and it can be actualized.\nSannyas is a process of self-actualization. It simply means to make you that which you are potentially capable of becoming. Nothing has to be imposed upon you from the outside; hence I don't give you any discipline. I simply share my insight with you, then it is up to you to create your discipline. That has to be your own choice.\nThe old idea of sannyas was that a certain fixed routine, a certain static discipline has to be given, and one has to follow it mechanically. Of course, they used to call it \"religiously,\" but it simply means mechanically. Religiously means, you are not allowed any freedom; you have to do it and you are not to ask why, because that is showing intelligence. You are supposed -- according to the old traditions all over the world -- to be obedient not intelligent. And remember, the intelligent person cannot be obedient in the ordinary sense, and the obedient person cannot be intelligent in the ordinary sense. The intelligent person can be obedient only to his intelligence.\nSo the real master helps you to become intelligent, and then you follow according to your light, you move according to your light. And each individual is so unique that no fixed pattern can be given. All fixed patterns are crippling, paralyzing, and there is no need in fact.\nI give you freedom, I help you to be intelligent, alert, aware, silent and to discover your potential and then go accordingly.\nYou have to be yourself. You are not to be Jesus, you are not to be Buddha, you\nare not to be me. You have to be just yourself, you are not to be an imitator.\nThomas a Kempis has written one of the most famous Christian treatises, The Imitation of Christ. The very title is ugly. As far as imitation is concerned it can create only pseudo people, hypocrites. About that, Friedrich Nietzsche is far more right than Kempis. Nietzsche says that the only Christian died on the cross two thousand years ago. He says the only Christian -- and he is right. Nobody else can be a Jesus. Nobody else was before him, nobody else will be again. And that is beautiful, that each individual has such uniqueness; nobody else has to be imitated by you.\nThat is the meaning of self-nature. Bliss is your nature, intelligence is your nature. Meditation is only a way to discover it, to uncover it. Once you have found it you become free from all imposed patterns --\nChristian, Hindu, Mohammedan. You become free from all ideologies. You start living moment to moment, responding to the challenges of life according to your light. And then there is no repentance, no guilt. Then whatsoever you do is right. Not that you are following a certain pattern which says, \"This is right and this is wrong.\" You are not following those ten commandments, you are simply following your own consciousness, your own awareness.\nSo I give you the eleventh commandment, the only one commandment really, your consciousness: Be a light unto yourself.\n(To Ralf) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Parivartan Anand means bliss. Parivartan means constant change.\nMisery arises because we don't allow change to happen. We cling, we want things to be static. If you love a woman you want her tomorrow too, the same way as she is yours today. That's how misery arises.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNobody can be certain about the next moment -- what to say about tomorrow?\nA man of awareness knows that life is constantly changing. Life is change. There is only one thing permanent, and that is change. Everything else except change, changes. To accept this nature of life, to accept this changing existence with all its seasons and moods, this constant flow which never stops for a single moment, is to be blissful. Then nobody can disturb your bliss. It is your hankering for permanency that creates troubles for you. You want to live in a life with no change, and that is not possible -- you are asking the impossible.\nThe child will become young, the young man will become old, the one who was alive yesterday will be dead today. If you accept all this change, this suchness of things, and you allow it to happen joyously --\nknowing that's how life is -- then nobody can distract you from your bliss. Nobody can disturb your bliss.\nThen you move each moment with the flow of life.\nOtherwise, people are always lagging behind. Life is always running ahead and they are far, far behind.\nThey are simply dragging themselves. And they are so far behind that they are bound to be miserable --\nbecause they will be almost dead, and by the time they reach to where life is right now, life has moved again. It is like a river: it is not stagnant, it is dynamic.\nA sannyasin has to see it clearly that everything changes, nothing remains the same, even for two consecutive moments. Then the whole desire for keeping things as they are forever drops. And in that dropping you are free. Suddenly, a great freedom is felt. Then you are no longer disturbed by anything, nothing can disturb you.\nThings disturb you because you were hoping for something else and it is not happening that way. Things frustrate you because you were expecting something else and it has not happened the way that you were expecting, it is happening in some other way. It is not fulfilling your desire; it is going on its own. It is not listening to you.\nIn almost all the languages of the world such proverbs exist: \"Man proposes and God disposes.\" That is sheer nonsense. The moment you propose something you yourself are getting into trouble. Nobody is there to dispose it! But your very proposition creates trouble, because life is unpredictable; one never knows what is going to happen. And it is beautiful that one never knows what is going to happen. That's the excitement and the ecstasy of life, that it is a constant surprise. If it was predictable it would be mechanical. It is not predictable, there are always surprises in store. And the more alert you are the more surprises there are; hence people avoid being aware -- they become insensitive to protect themselves against this change.\nScientists say we allow only two per cent of life to enter into us; ninety-eight per cent we keep outside.\nWe exclude it so that we can go on living in our dreams, in our hopes, in our expectations. But how long can you live in a dream? It is going to be shattered sooner or later, and it is good that it is shattered sooner.\nA man of awareness becomes courageous enough to accept the changing phenomena. In that very acceptance is bliss; then all is good, then you are never frustrated because in the first place you never asked anything. Jesus says, \"Ask and it shall be given to you.\" He must be talking to very immature people; people were immature in those days. I say to you, \"Ask and it shall never be given to you. Ask and you are asking for trouble. Don't ask and it shall be given to you.\"\nGreat blessings come to people who don't ask, because then everything is a blessing. If some stranger on the street gives you a rose flower -- a stranger you have never known before, you have never even been introduced... he simply smiles and gives a rose flower to you and walks on, not even waiting for a thank you\n-- how much joy that simple rose flower brings to you! But you will not be surprised if your wife gives you a rose flower -- you will not, because you were expecting. If your friend gives you a rose flower you will not be surprised, you will not feel thankful; you will say, \"So what?\" It is the expectation that destroys your gratitude. But with a stranger, because you were not expecting, a simple rose flower becomes such a beautiful gift.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe moment you drop all your expectations, the whole of life becomes a gift of God.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"2767","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2767 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark60>‌</span>Chapter title:

It has to be the only one

it,</p><p>The moment to moment ecstasy of it all.</p><p>(To Masafumi) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Virago. Anand means
bliss. Virago means non-attachment.</p><p>For centuries it has been told That non-attachment brings bliss. My
teaching is just the opposite; I say bliss brings non-attachment.</p><p>The old teaching made non-attachment The basic phenomenon of a
religious life, Hence it taught escapism, renunciation,</p><p>Dropping out of life -- but it was all repressive. You can escape

wife</p><p>Your children, your family</p><p>But what are you going to do with your sexuality? Just by renouncing
your wife</p><p>You cannot drop your sexuality -- It will go with you</p><p>And you will be continuously repressing it.</p><p>It will not create a healthy being in you, It will create pathology.
Hence my teaching is: first become blissful...</p><p>And bliss comes through meditation</p><p>It has nothing to do with non-attachment. Non-attachment is not a
condition</p><p>For being blissful.</p><p>Become blissful and then many things Will disappear from you life</p><p>On their own accord because It is misery that creates greed;</p><p>If you are blissful you will be non-greedy And non-greed will come
naturally,</p><p>As a by-product.</p><p>If you are blissful sex will become Automatically less and less
significant Because you will know</p><p>Something higher, something deeper Than sex can ever give to you.</p><p>Sex can give only moments of joy</p><p>But meditation can make that joy something</p><p>Like a constant undercurrent in your life.</p><p>Sex can give you a momentary orgasmic experience But meditation can
give you an orgasmic being -- You are twenty-four hours in ecstasy,
drunk.</p><p>Then slowly slowly as a consequence Sex disappears.</p><p>And when it disappears on its own accord There is beauty because</p><p>There is no presentation at all. Hence my approach is totally
new,</p><p>It is diametrically opposite to the old approach. Bliss is a
precondition for non-attachment</p><p>Not vice versa.</p><p>Become blissful through meditation</p><p>And then all that is meaningless will drop And all that is meaningful
will (can't get it) You need not bother about that.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

don't teach escapism. Escapism is cowardly.</p><p>It is not the way of the courageous And it is not the way of the
sane.</p><p>(To Grant) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Svarupo. Anand means
bliss. Svarupo means self-nature.</p><p>Bliss is not something that comes from the outside. It grows within
you, it is your self-nature. You are born with it. Of course it is only
a potential, but it is within you and it can be actualized.</p><p>Sannyas is a process of self-actualization. It simply means to make
you that which you are potentially capable of becoming. Nothing has to
be imposed upon you from the outside; hence I don't give you any
discipline. I simply share my insight with you, then it is up to you to
create your discipline. That has to be your own choice.</p><p>The old idea of sannyas was that a certain fixed routine, a certain
static discipline has to be given, and one has to follow it
mechanically. Of course, they used to call it "religiously," but it
simply means mechanically. Religiously means, you are not allowed any
freedom; you have to do it and you are not to ask why, because that is
showing intelligence. You are supposed -- according to the old
traditions all over the world -- to be obedient not intelligent. And
remember, the intelligent person cannot be obedient in the ordinary
sense, and the obedient person cannot be intelligent in the ordinary
sense. The intelligent person can be obedient only to his
intelligence.</p><p>So the real master helps you to become intelligent, and then you
follow according to your light, you move according to your light. And
each individual is so unique that no fixed pattern can be given. All
fixed patterns are crippling, paralyzing, and there is no need in
fact.</p><p>I give you freedom, I help you to be intelligent, alert, aware,
silent and to discover your potential and then go accordingly.</p><p>You have to be yourself. You are not to be Jesus, you are not to be
Buddha, you</p><p>are not to be me. You have to be just yourself, you are not to be an
imitator.</p><p>Thomas a Kempis has written one of the most famous Christian
treatises, The Imitation of Christ. The very title is ugly. As far as
imitation is concerned it can create only pseudo people, hypocrites.
About that, Friedrich Nietzsche is far more right than Kempis. Nietzsche
says that the only Christian died on the cross two thousand years ago.
He says the only Christian -- and he is right. Nobody else can be a
Jesus. Nobody else was before him, nobody else will be again. And that
is beautiful, that each individual has such uniqueness; nobody else has
to be imitated by you.</p><p>That is the meaning of self-nature. Bliss is your nature,
intelligence is your nature. Meditation is only a way to discover it, to
uncover it. Once you have found it you become free from all imposed
patterns --</p><p>Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan. You become free from all ideologies.
You start living moment to moment, responding to the challenges of life
according to your light. And then there is no repentance, no guilt. Then
whatsoever you do is right. Not that you are following a certain pattern
which says, "This is right and this is wrong." You are not following
those ten commandments, you are simply following your own consciousness,
your own awareness.</p><p>So I give you the eleventh commandment, the only one commandment
really, your consciousness: Be a light unto yourself.</p><p>(To Ralf) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Parivartan Anand means
bliss. Parivartan means constant change.</p><p>Misery arises because we don't allow change to happen. We cling, we
want things to be static. If you love a woman you want her tomorrow too,
the same way as she is yours today. That's how misery arises.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Nobody can be certain about the next moment -- what to say about
tomorrow?</p><p>A man of awareness knows that life is constantly changing. Life is
change. There is only one thing permanent, and that is change.
Everything else except change, changes. To accept this nature of life,
to accept this changing existence with all its seasons and moods, this
constant flow which never stops for a single moment, is to be blissful.
Then nobody can disturb your bliss. It is your hankering for permanency
that creates troubles for you. You want to live in a life with no
change, and that is not possible -- you are asking the impossible.</p><p>The child will become young, the young man will become old, the one
who was alive yesterday will be dead today. If you accept all this
change, this suchness of things, and you allow it to happen joyously
--</p><p>knowing that's how life is -- then nobody can distract you from your
bliss. Nobody can disturb your bliss.</p><p>Then you move each moment with the flow of life.</p><p>Otherwise, people are always lagging behind. Life is always running
ahead and they are far, far behind.</p><p>They are simply dragging themselves. And they are so far behind that
they are bound to be miserable --</p><p>because they will be almost dead, and by the time they reach to where
life is right now, life has moved again. It is like a river: it is not
stagnant, it is dynamic.</p><p>A sannyasin has to see it clearly that everything changes, nothing
remains the same, even for two consecutive moments. Then the whole
desire for keeping things as they are forever drops. And in that
dropping you are free. Suddenly, a great freedom is felt. Then you are
no longer disturbed by anything, nothing can disturb you.</p><p>Things disturb you because you were hoping for something else and it
is not happening that way. Things frustrate you because you were
expecting something else and it has not happened the way that you were
expecting, it is happening in some other way. It is not fulfilling your
desire; it is going on its own. It is not listening to you.</p><p>In almost all the languages of the world such proverbs exist: "Man
proposes and God disposes." That is sheer nonsense. The moment you
propose something you yourself are getting into trouble. Nobody is there
to dispose it! But your very proposition creates trouble, because life
is unpredictable; one never knows what is going to happen. And it is
beautiful that one never knows what is going to happen. That's the
excitement and the ecstasy of life, that it is a constant surprise. If
it was predictable it would be mechanical. It is not predictable, there
are always surprises in store. And the more alert you are the more
surprises there are; hence people avoid being aware -- they become
insensitive to protect themselves against this change.</p><p>Scientists say we allow only two per cent of life to enter into us;
ninety-eight per cent we keep outside.</p><p>We exclude it so that we can go on living in our dreams, in our
hopes, in our expectations. But how long can you live in a dream? It is
going to be shattered sooner or later, and it is good that it is
shattered sooner.</p><p>A man of awareness becomes courageous enough to accept the changing
phenomena. In that very acceptance is bliss; then all is good, then you
are never frustrated because in the first place you never asked
anything. Jesus says, "Ask and it shall be given to you." He must be
talking to very immature people; people were immature in those days. I
say to you, "Ask and it shall never be given to you. Ask and you are
asking for trouble. Don't ask and it shall be given to you."</p><p>Great blessings come to people who don't ask, because then everything
is a blessing. If some stranger on the street gives you a rose flower --
a stranger you have never known before, you have never even been
introduced... he simply smiles and gives a rose flower to you and walks
on, not even waiting for a thank you</p><p>-- how much joy that simple rose flower brings to you! But you will
not be surprised if your wife gives you a rose flower -- you will not,
because you were expecting. If your friend gives you a rose flower you
will not be surprised, you will not feel thankful; you will say, "So
what?" It is the expectation that destroys your gratitude. But with a
stranger, because you were not expecting, a simple rose flower becomes
such a beautiful gift.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

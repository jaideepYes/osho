Folkert means strong spirit.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is not for the weaklings; It is not for the cowards\nIt is not for those who are full of fear, Because it is the ultimate adventure. It is going into the uncharted --\nNo maps exist, no guidelines either.\nThe master can only create a thirst in you, A tremendous thirst for truth\nBut he cannot give you a programme He cannot give you a discipline.\nHe can give you an insight, a longing, a love But then you have to go all alone\nBecause it is an inner journey --\nNobody can accompany you. That's why Many people become interested in meditation\nBut very few people ever do ANYthing about it. Their interest remains\nOnly an intellectual curiosity,\nIt never becomes an experiment. Or even if sometimes people try\nThey try with half-hearted efforts, lukewarm And meditation needs your total commitment. Unless you are boiling at hundred degrees You will not evaporate.\nAnd meditation is a kind of evaporation into god: You disappear and only god remains.\nRemember: the meditator never meets god. If the meditator is, god is not\nIf god is, the meditator is no more, Hence a really strong spirit\nA really brave man is needed --\nA man who is ready to die in the search Because it is only out of that death That a new life is born.\nIt is only through crucifixion That resurrection happens.\nMeditation is like a cross:\nYou have to carry it on your shoulders.\n(To Johannes) -- Your name is one of the most beautiful names, hence I will not change it in any way; it's perfect as it is: Swami Johannes. Johannes means the beloved disciple.\nOne can be a disciple only if one drops all knowledge. Disciplehood means that you accept the fact that you know nothing. It begins in a state of not-knowing. If you know then you cannot be a disciple. Then your knowledge will be a constant disturbance and whatsoever you know is nothing but rubbish; it is all borrowed -\n- from traditions, from conventions, from the society, from the scriptures -- it is all conditioning and a disciple needs as a first step to be totally unconditioned. He has to drop his whole mind, he has to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbehead himself. Unless that much readiness is there one can only be a student, not a disciple, and that is the difference between these two words. The difference is immense.\nA student is only intellectually interested, he wants to know more. The disciple is not intellectually interested, he's existentially interested; he is not after accumulating more information and knowledge. He wants to be more; not to know more, but to be more. Knowledge is something of the mind and being is a totally different phenomenon. One can know all the scriptures of the world and yet may remain ignorant --\nthat's how scholars are: they are just donkeys carrying a big burden of scriptures. That burden has not transformed them, that burden has really hindered, hampered their progress. It is like with rocks hanging around your neck. You are trying to swim: You are creating unnecessary hurdles for yourself.\nSocrates is right when he says, 'I know only one thing, that I know nothing.' That is the state of a disciple and in that state great things happen: Ego disappears, it can't exist -- How it can exist? There is no claim left. One becomes utterly empty and in that emptiness god comes to you; you become a host, he becomes a guest.\nTo be a true disciple\nIs one of the greatest experiences of life,\nThe greatest experience.\nThere is nothing greater than that But it requires courage;\nCourage to be egoless, courage To discriminate exactly\nWhat you know and what you don't know. And if you really look into yourself\nYou will be surprised:\nYou know only about trivia\nYou know nothing about anything essential. God, soul, love bliss, truth, freedom --\nYou know nothing about them\nAnd those are the essential things of life. Become a beloved disciple.\nAnd when I say become a beloved disciple I don't mean be my disciple.\nMy sannyasins are my friends...\nYou have to be a disciple of existence You have to be a disciple to the sun To the moon, to the stars, to the trees\nTo all this beautiful existence that surrounds you You have to be a disciple to god himself.\nThe true master only helps you To discover your hidden secrets. And this is the key: Function Out of a state of not-knowing And you will become wise; Function out of knowledge\nAnd you will remain stupid.\nAll scholars are stupid, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nUniversities are full of them.\nUniversities are factories to create stupidity. My work is just the opposite: Here we try To bring your intelligence back to you Which has been crushed , destroyed Covered, in thousands of ways.\n(To Stella) -- This is your name: Ma Prem Stella. Prem means love. Stella means a shining star.\nLove is the most shining star In the inner sky of your being.\nThe outer stars are nothing compared to it. Once it happened\nA Sufi mystic woman, Rabiya el Adawiya Was sitting in her room\nMeditating with closed eyes.\nA friend, another mystic, Hasan\nWas staying with her.\nHe went out -- it was a beautiful morning... The sunrise was so beautiful, so colorful The birds were singing\nAnd the flowers were opening And the air was fragrant.\nHe called to Rabiya,\n'Rabiya, what are you doing there Sitting in your room with closed eyes?\nCome out -- god has created a beautiful morning! Come and see his beautiful creation.'\nRabiya laughed and said,\n'Hasan, I know. When you are saying You must be true\nBut I am seeing inside god himself! So rather calling me outside\nWhy don't you come in?!' Hasan felt ashamed.\nHe came in, fell in the feet of Rabiya and said, 'Forgive me. I have never known the inner.\nI have wasted my whole life seeing the outer.'\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe outer is beautiful\nBut nothing compared to the inner. And in the inner world\nLove is the most shining star, the sun! It is the very soul of your inner world The very source -- go in and find it!\nAnd when you have found it Share it, celebrate it!\nThat's my whole message\nIn a single word, love is my message Because love it god!\n(To Franz) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Prasad. Deva means divine. Prasad means a gift.\nLife is a gift from god. We have not earned it,\nIn fact we don't deserve it even.\nBut we are so ungrateful creatures that\nNot even a simple thank you arises in us. We are not grateful that we are alive\nWe are not grateful that we have given This opportunity to grow, to see,\nTo love, to laugh, to enjoy\nThe music of existence, the beauty of the world. We are not at all grateful; on the contrary\nWe are continuously complaining. If you listen to peoples' prayer You will be surprised:\nAll their prayers are not out of thankfulness, They are asking for something more\nThey are saying, 'This is not enough,'\nAnd in fact, it is never going to be enough Because the poor person is asking\nThe rich person is asking, the beggar is asking The emperor is asking -- everybody is asking! Once it happened, a great mystic, Farid\nWas asked by the villagers that,\n'Akbar -- one of the greatest emperors of India Respects you so much... Why don't you say to him\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAt least he can open a school for the village! If you say he will do it immediately.'\nFarid said, 'Okay, so I will go. I have never gone to him,\nHe has always been coming to me But when I have to ask something It is better I should go.'\nSo he went, it was early morning...\nHe entered the palace, everybody knew him, Respectfully they took him\nInto the king's chambers.\nHe entered, the king was praying So he stood behind and listened What he was saying.\nThe greatest emperor of India,\nThe man who ruled over the biggest empire ever Was praying for more; he was asking god,\n'Give me more money, more power, more prestige More land, more victory.'\nFarid turned back.\nAs Akbar finished his prayers he turned back And saw Farid going out of the room.\nHe said, 'How you came and why you are leaving?' He said, 'I have come to ask something from you But I saw that you yourself are a beggar.\nSo what is the point of asking a beggar? I don't want to reduce your riches.\nI have come to ask for a small school\nTo be opened in the village, but no more -- I won't ask. And moreover,\nIf you are asking god, we can ask him directly; Why have a mediator?'\nAkbar tried, persuaded him in every possible way. He said, 'No, I won't allow you\nTo open the school in my village. I was mistaken, I used to think\nYou are an emperor -- you are not!' But this is the situation:\nEverybody is asking for more.\nThat simple means 'Whatsoever you have given Is not enough -- I deserve more,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou have not been fair to me!' I call this irreligiousness, Hence to me all the prayers That go on in the temples\nAnd the mosques and the churches are irreligious. The true prayer is only of thankfulness,\nJust a simple thank you is enough.\nLearn how to say thank you to existence: For all that it has already done to us, for us And it's continuously doing\nAnd you will come closer and closer to god. The only bridge towards god is deep gratitude.\n(To David) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Dhyan. Prem means love. Dhyan means meditation.\nLet love be your meditation, love more and more And love for no reason at all.\nLove for the sheer joy of loving. Love people, love animals, Love trees, rocks, rivers --\nIt is not the question what is\nYour object of love -- any object will do. The real question is\nThat you are continuously loving That you are showering your love. This is the miracle of love\nThat the more you give, the more you get. It is a very different kind of economics.\nThe ordinary economics is:\nIf you give you will have less. The ordinary economics Teaches you to be a miser, hoard Snatch, take away from people; Give less and get more.\nThat's the whole art of business But there is a higher economics --\nCall it religion, spirituality\nOr whatsoever you like, in which The law is completely reversed:\nGive and you will have more, don't give And you will even lose that which you have. And what I am saying\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIs not a question of believing -- experiment And you will be surprised:\nIf you go on giving your love\nYou will find more and more love arising in you Which was never there before.\nYou will see so many new sources opening up, New dimensions becoming alive that\nYou are in for a surprise, for a big surprise! And then; you know the secret\nThat we are connected\nWith the farther away ocean of god's love.\nIf we give it\nThat ocean goes on filling us Again and again and again.\nIf we don't give, whatsoever we have Becomes poisoned, becomes stale, dead. Love alive is the greatest joy\nAnd love dead, is the greatest burden.\n(To Carlos) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Divyo. Anand means bliss. Divyo means divine.\nBliss is the most divine quality And misery the most undivine.\nBut for thousands of years sadness has been Praised by the so-called religious people.\nIf you look at their saints\nThe look so serious, so sad, so sombre They have such long faces\nThat sometimes I wonder:\nGod may have escaped and hidden somewhere (?) with himself(?) Just because of these saints.\nAnd one thing is certain:\nThese saints cannot be allowed in paradise;\nThey will make a hell out of it. For centuries religion has lived With a totally wrong attitude And approach towards life.\nThe approach has been negative. I affirm life, I am life-affirmative. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's my conflict with the tradition:\nThe tradition is life-negative, all traditions: Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist,\nAll traditions are life-negative\nThey deny life, they teach you to renounce life. I reach you how to live it totally\nHow to love it, because to me God can be found in only one way And that is through life\nNot by escaping from it.\nCelebrate life and then you will be blissful.\nIf you escape from life\nYou will be sad and you will be miserable. The so-called religions have done two things: One, few fools have tried to practice them And they have turned into zombies,\nThey are corpses.\nThey walk and they breathe, of course But their whole life is mechanical.\nAnd the remaining majority Although it has not become so sad But its bliss has been poisoned.\nWhenever you are feeling happy Something inside you says,\n'You are doing something wrong.' This is the impact,\nThe poisoning impact of thousand of years Of life-negative teachings.\nOne feels a certain unease when one is blissful -- This is strange.\nIf you are miserable everything is okay, You never feel guilty.\nI have never come across a person Who feels guilty because of misery.\nBut if you are feeling happy you feel guilty. I happens every day, almost every day:\nPeople go on writing to me letters that\n'Since we have come here we are feeling so happy But a certain guilt is there -- why is this guilt?' You are feeling guilty\nBecause you have been told Not to be happy, not to rejoice\nNot to love, not to laugh, not to live! Death has been worshipped\nAnd life has been condemned. My approach is totally opposite:\nWorship life because life is god. There is no other god except life. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Herman) -- This is your name: Swami Satyam Anubhav.\nSatyam means truth. Anubhav means experience. Truth is not a concept\nYou cannot think about it.\nIt is an experience: you have to live it. It is not through philosophy\nThat you will come to know what truth is; It is only through religion\nThat you will come to encounter truth. You can read about it\nYou can ponder about it, you can think about it But remember:\nThinking about truth is not knowing truth Thinking about god is not knowing god Thinking about love is not knowing love. To know love you have to fall in love You have to experience it --\nThere is no other way except the existential. And to experience truth\nYou need a radical change of your vision: You have to get down from your head And enter in your heart,\nYou have to exist as the heart not as the head Because the head can only think. It can think beautiful thoughts\nBut beautiful thoughts are just\nMere thoughts, empty and impotent. It is through the heart\nThat you feel, that you experience. My work here consists\nIn shifting your energy From the head to the heart.\nAnd all kinds of devices and methods Are being used here. And there will be Great resistance in the beginning because\nThe head has been so powerful for so long; It has been the ruler, the supreme ruler.\nIt can't lose its grip so easily. And the heart has been repressed But the heart is your real center,\nThe head is only your circumference.\nThe head is good as a machine -- it is a computer. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nUse it when needed but don't be possessed by it. Be a master of your mind\nNever be a slave of your mind. Let the heart be the master And the mind, the slave.\nAnd that's what sannyas is all about. That's my definition of sannyas.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #28\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2918","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2918 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

state of not-knowing. If you know then you cannot be a disciple. Then
your knowledge will be a constant disturbance and whatsoever you know is
nothing but rubbish; it is all borrowed -</p><p>- from traditions, from conventions, from the society, from the
scriptures -- it is all conditioning and a disciple needs as a first
step to be totally unconditioned. He has to drop his whole mind, he has

student, not a disciple, and that is the difference between these two
words. The difference is immense.</p><p>A student is only intellectually interested, he wants to know more.
The disciple is not intellectually interested, he's existentially
interested; he is not after accumulating more information and knowledge.
He wants to <em>be</em> more; not to know more, but to be more.
Knowledge is something of the mind and being is a totally different
phenomenon. One can know all the scriptures of the world and yet may
remain ignorant --</p><p>that's how scholars are: they are just donkeys carrying a big burden
of scriptures. That burden has not transformed them, that burden has
really hindered, hampered their progress. It is like with rocks hanging
around your neck. You are trying to swim: You are creating unnecessary
hurdles for yourself.</p><p>Socrates is right when he says, 'I know only one thing, that I know
nothing.' That is the state of a disciple and in that state great things
happen: Ego disappears, it can't exist -- How it can exist? There is no
claim left. One becomes utterly empty and in that emptiness god comes to
you; you become a host, he becomes a guest.</p><p>To be a true disciple</p><p>Is one of the greatest experiences of life,</p><p>The <span class=p>greatest experience.</span></p><p>There is nothing greater than that But it requires courage;</p><p>Courage to be egoless, courage To discriminate exactly</p><p>What you know and what you don't know. And if you really look into
yourself</p><p>You will be surprised:</p><p>You know only about trivia</p><p>You know nothing about anything essential. God, soul, love bliss,
truth, freedom --</p><p>You know nothing about them</p><p>And those are the essential things of life. Become a beloved
disciple.</p><p>And when I say become a beloved disciple I don't mean be <em>my</em>
disciple.</p><p>My sannyasins are my friends...</p><p>You have to be a disciple of existence You have to be a disciple to
the sun To the moon, to the stars, to the trees</p><p>To all this beautiful existence that surrounds you You have to be a
disciple to god himself.</p><p>The true master only helps you To discover your hidden secrets. And
this is the key: Function Out of a state of not-knowing And you will
become wise; Function out of knowledge</p><p>And you will remain stupid.</p><p>All scholars are stupid, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

are alive</p><p>We are not grateful that we have given This opportunity to grow, to
see,</p><p>To love, to laugh, to enjoy</p><p>The music of existence, the beauty of the world. We are not at all
grateful; on the contrary</p><p>We are continuously complaining. If you listen to peoples' prayer You
will be surprised:</p><p>All their prayers are not out of thankfulness, They are asking for
something more</p><p>They are saying, 'This is not enough,'</p><p>And in fact, it is never going to be enough Because the poor person
is asking</p><p>The rich person is asking, the beggar is asking The emperor is asking

is better I should go.'</p><p>So he went, it was early morning...</p><p>He entered the palace, everybody knew him, Respectfully they took
him</p><p>Into the king's chambers.</p><p>He entered, the king was praying So he stood behind and listened What
he was saying.</p><p>The greatest emperor of India,</p><p>The man who ruled over the biggest empire ever Was praying for more;
he was asking god,</p><p>'Give me more money, more power, more prestige More land, more
victory.'</p><p>Farid turned back.</p><p>As Akbar finished his prayers he turned back And saw Farid going out
of the room.</p><p>He said, 'How you came and why you are leaving?' He said, 'I have
come to ask something from you But I saw that you yourself are a
beggar.</p><p>So what is the point of asking a beggar? I don't want to reduce your
riches.</p><p>I have come to ask for a small school</p><p>To be opened in the village, but no more -- I won't ask. And
moreover,</p><p>If you are asking god, we can ask him directly; Why have a
mediator?'</p><p>Akbar tried, persuaded him in every possible way. He said, 'No, I
won't allow you</p><p>To open the school in my village. I was mistaken, I used to think</p><p>You are an emperor -- you are not!' But this is the situation:</p><p>Everybody is asking for more.</p><p>That simple means 'Whatsoever you have given Is not enough -- I

me all the prayers That go on in the temples</p><p>And the mosques and the churches are irreligious. The true prayer is
only of thankfulness,</p><p>Just a simple thank you is enough.</p><p>Learn how to say thank you to existence: For all that it has already
done to us, for us And it's continuously doing</p><p>And you will come closer and closer to god. The only bridge towards
god is deep gratitude.</p><p>(To David) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Dhyan. Prem means love.
Dhyan means meditation.</p><p>Let love be your meditation, love more and more And love for no
reason at all.</p><p>Love for the sheer joy of loving. Love people, love animals, Love
trees, rocks, rivers --</p><p>It is not the question <em>what</em> is</p><p>Your object of love -- any object will do. The real question is</p><p>That you are continuously loving That you are showering your love.
This is the miracle of love</p><p>That the more you give, the more you get. It is a very different kind
of economics.</p><p>The ordinary economics is:</p><p>If you give you will have less. The ordinary economics Teaches you to
be a miser, hoard Snatch, take away from people; Give less and get

Christian, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist,</p><p>All traditions are life-negative</p><p>They deny life, they teach you to renounce life. I reach you how to

mechanical.</p><p>And the remaining majority Although it has not become so sad But its

almost every day:</p><p>People go on writing to me letters that</p><p>'Since we have come here we are feeling so happy But a certain guilt
is there -- why is this guilt?' You are feeling guilty</p><p>Because you have been told Not to be happy, not to rejoice</p><p>Not to love, not to laugh, not to live!

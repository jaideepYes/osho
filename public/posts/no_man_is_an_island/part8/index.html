Only two things have to be remembered.\nOne is meditation and the other is love. If these two things are fulfilled\nNothing else is needed, no other religion. This is the whole of religion:\nMeditation for yourself and love for others\nMeditation to go in and love to go out.\nIt is the same door; these are not two things. It is like a door: When you enter\nOn the door it is written 'entrance' And when you come out\nOn the same door is written 'exit'. When you go in the door is meditation When you come out it is the same door But now it is called love.\nAnd both have to be simultaneously grown Otherwise one becomes lopsided.\nThat has happened for centuries: The people\nWho have tried to meditate have become unloving They become closed to the world\nThey become self-centered.\nTheir spirituality becomes very selfish. It seems they are not at all interested\nIn anybody, only interested in themselves. It is a kind of morbidity, it is ill\nIt is not healthy, they are no more flowing. Their life has become static, undynamic, dead.\nSlowly slowly they become very cold Because without love you lose warmth.\nThat's what happens to Jaina monks: They are Absolutely concerned only with themselves, The world is not a concern.\nThat is one of the basic causes Of this country's fall because\nAll the so-called spiritual people become\nSo much selfish that nobody cared what is happening To the whole country, to the people.\nEverybody was concerned only for his own salvation And let all else go to hell.\nThat is none of our business\nThat's not really a spiritual attitude It is very unspiritual.\nOr if people are very loving They forget meditation.\nThen they become superficial\nThey become indulgent; then eat, drink, be merry Then that becomes their whole life.\nThey are good, nice people, good company\nBut they have no depth, they are very shallow 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd their life remains just mundane Nothing sacred.\nAnd the world has lived\nIn these two extremes, divided:\nOne we call the worldly\nAnd the other we call the other-worldly. My sannyasin has to become a bridge He is neither worldly nor other-worldly He is both and neither, he is a bridge He is a constant flow\nAnd he is capable of moving in and out easily. Whenever he wants to go in, he goes in\nAnd forgets the whole world,\nBut whatsoever he attains within his being -- The joy, the blessings, the peace, the silence, He is not a miser, he does not hoard it.\nHe starts sharing it, he immediately comes out Because he is very loving.\nLove keeps him warm, meditation keeps him deep And this is the ultimate balance.\nTo attain it is the goal of my sannyas. Remember these two things;\nThis is the whole of religion.\n(To Dirk) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Dirk. Prem means love. Dirk means full of justice.\nOnly love can be just, because only love can understand. Without love there is no understanding and without understanding how there can be any justice? One cannot be just; but for thousands of years this has been told to people that if you want to be just, you have to be indifferent; you have to be utterly detached, unloving. You have to be just an onlooker.\nThat's perfectly right as far as science is concerned because you are observing objects -- there is no question of loving objects. If you are observing water and hydrogen and oxygen, it's perfectly okay. Nobody can ask you to be in deep love with oxygen you can remain detached; in fact you will be detached unless you are mad. Mad people fall in love with strange things!\nOne madman was saying to the other that: \"This psychiatrist seems to be very strange. He's talking all nonsense. When I went to him he told me that; 'You are in love with your umbrella' -- that is utter nonsense!\nWhat do you think?\" He said, \"Certainly -- that is absolutely absurd.\" And the man said, \"Yes, that's what I think! It is absolutely absurd. We care for each other, we are tender about each other -- that's one thing but love is another thing! I am not in love with my umbrella!\"\nSo it is okay with the scientific observation but as you move higher, higher than the objective world, you cannot remain detached; if you are detached you will\nmiss the whole point. That's why science cannot know anything about love and cannot know anything about man's inner being and cannot know anything about god. It is impossible because the scientific approach itself inhibits it, prohibits it. The very approach is such, the requirement is such, the methodology is such that these things are debarred. Science cannot understand beauty and science is absolutely incapable of understanding what music is. Science can understand what sound is but science is absolutely incapable of understanding what music is. Science can understand linguistics but cannot understand poetry. Science can understand language, grammar -- everything, but what is poetry? That simply is missed. For that one needs a loving approach. If you want to understand the truth you have to be very loving. If you really want to understand the whole of life in all its dimensions, you have to approach with great love and care; you have to be very tender, soft.\nAnd then a new phenomenon arises in you: your life becomes full of justice you cannot be unjust then; you cannot be unfair then; it is impossible. A loving person cannot be unfair.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo love as deeply as possible but remember that love should not become an attachment, otherwise you become prejudiced. Love should not become demanding otherwise you start imposing your ideas. Love should not be possessive otherwise it becomes violent. If love can be non-possessive, non- demanding, unconditional then your whole life has a tremendous beauty; you radiate something of godliness and that radiation is what justice is: Only god is just and when you start radiating god, you are just, never before it.\n(To Paul) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Svabhavo. Anand means bliss. Svabhavo means self-nature.\nBliss is our self-nature. It has not to be found somewhere else. It has to be discovered within yourself. It is already a gift by god. You are carrying it with yourself. It has been all along with you from the very beginning; still you are\nmiserable. For the simple reason that you never search within. You search where it is not and you never search where it is. That's how one goes on missing bliss and one goes on stumbling more and more into misery.\nSannyas means a radical change; a change in the very direction of your life energies. It is a turning in, it is a pilgrimage to one's own center. Sannyas is nothing but the very essence of meditation.\nOnce you have known yourself, you have known all. And once you have known yourself you are the possessor of an eternal kingdom, of an inexhaustible treasure.\n(To Robyn) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyanprem. Dhyanprem means lover of meditation.\nThat is the greatest love That can happen to a person.\nAll other loves are small things.\nThe greatest love is the love for meditation. Meditation means the search for oneself.\nWe have completely forgotten who we are We have forgotten the very language How to commune with ourselves.\nWhatsoever we know about ourselves Is all false, arbitrary.\nYou are given a name and you think that\nThis is you -- but nobody is born with a name. The name gives you an identity.\nYou are given a religion --\nYour parents impose a certain religion on you They impose a certain nationality on you And these things become your identities:\nOne is a Hindu, an Indian\nWith a certain name, with a certain caste And these become definitions but\nThese are all arbitrary, absolutely artificial. You are born without them\nBut we remain befooling ourselves. This is not acquaintance with oneself And this is our whole misery 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat life goes on slipping out of our fingers And we go on remaining\nAs ignorant of ourselves as ever. In fact the more time passes\nThe more ignorant we become.\nThe children\nAre a little more aware of themselves.\nIt is not an exceptional thing to find children Calling their own name in a third person.\nAn little boy can say, 'Mommy, Johnny is hungry.' He is not still identified with Johnny,\nHe does not say, 'I am hungry.' He says, 'Johnny is hungry.'\nHis understanding is far more deeper;\nHe still keeps himself aloof from Johnny. Johnny is as far aware as anybody else.\nHe is just a watcher:\nHe has come to know that Johnny is hungry But he is not saying, 'I am hungry.'\nSoon he will forget, the distance will dissolve: He will become one with Johnny.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you have to do two things. One, the first essential step is:\nTo become aware of all false identities because To know the false as the false\nIs the beginning of the journey towards the real.\nOnce you become aware\nThat all these things are false --\nBeing Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan Indian, German, Chinese --\nThese are all just arbitrary, accidental, They have nothing to do with you.\nYour consciousness remains Absolutely untouched by them,\nThen the question arises, 'Who am I?' You are not your education\nAnd you are not your money And you are not your post -- Your are nothing of these things\nThen, 'Who am I' -- then the question becomes More and more poignant.\nThen it takes an insistence\nThen it becomes a constant undercurrent in you That 'Life is running out\nAnd I have not yet even known myself, What am I doing here?\nAt least one thing should be done\nThat I should become aware who I am.' Once this deep longing arises in you to know Then knowing is not difficult.\nAs it becomes intense\nYou start moving towards meditation. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation simply means Becoming silent, utterly silent Getting unidentified with the mind\nRemaining absolutely still and trying to see What is this consciousness that I am.\nIt takes a little time for the mind to quiet To calm down; it has been noisy for lives It has become a habit, but it disappears. And the day it disappears, suddenly\nAll is light, all is joy, all is benediction! You have arrived home,\nYou have penetrated your own being.\nThat is the meaning of your name.\n(To Sally) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Avinash. Anand means bliss. Avinash means eternal.\nBliss is eternal. Happiness is momentary -- It comes like a breeze and goes.\nWhen it comes, it feels good But when it goes it leaves you In a far more miserable state\nThan you were before, obviously Because now you have tasted something And now you know the taste of happiness And the misery hurts more.\nPeople who attain few glimpses of happiness Are far more miserable\nThan the people who have never had any glimpses Hence the very strange phenomenon that\nPoor people don't look so miserable. It is very illogical\nThey should be more miserable But they don't look so miserable As rich people look miserable.\nThey live in misery, in other's eyes. If a Westerner comes to India\nHe can see the whole misery of the land. Everybody's living in misery but\nPeople who are living are not even aware of it. Even the beggar on the street\nDoes not think that he is miserable He accepts it just as matter of course. That's how life is:\nHe has known it this way from the very beginning. His father was a beggar\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHis father's father was a beggar;\nThis is his karma and he is utterly contented. He has no desire to be anything else.\nHe may have money in the bank, he may have Every opportunity to change his business\nBut he is no more interested\nHe is perfectly happy, things are going well. He has never tasted anything else\nSo he lives into whatsoever condition he is In a state of a dull kind of satisfaction.\nBut the people who have tasted some joy\nSome happiness, some glimpses -- they feel misery. Now America\nIs the most miserable country in the world For the simple reason because\nIt has more glimpses available.\nI am all for richness, for the simple reason Because once you are aware of misery\nOnce you see the momentariness of happiness, A desire arises to seek and search the eternal. Otherwise\nThere is no desire to search for the eternal. If you have tasted for a single moment Something of joy, you are bound to look; How you can make it an eternal state of life? How you can be in it permanently, forever? And that is possible.\nThe whole art of meditation is\nTo bring eternal peace, silence, joy to you. And the miracle is:\nIt (can't read, words missing) from anywhere else. It wells up within you.\nMeditation simply removes All the barriers in its path. It removes all the rocks\nAnd the stream starts flowing. And once you have known that\nIt is nothing to do with anything on the outside You have a great independence, great freedom, You don't depend on anybody.\nYou can be absolutely joyous in your aloneness. Your aloneness becomes luminous.\nIt is no more lonely, it is full of joy It is a dancing aloneness\nIt is a singing aloneness, it has great beauty And great poetry and great music.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #9\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2470","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2470 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

umbrella!"</p><p>So it is okay with the scientific observation but as you move higher,
higher than the objective world, you cannot remain detached; if you are
detached you will</p><p>miss the whole point. That's why science cannot know anything about
love and cannot know anything about man's inner being and cannot know
anything about god. It is impossible because the scientific approach
itself inhibits it, prohibits it. The very approach is such, the
requirement is such, the methodology is such that these things are
debarred. Science cannot understand beauty and science is absolutely
incapable of understanding what music is. Science can understand what
sound is but science is absolutely incapable of understanding what music
is. Science can understand linguistics but cannot understand poetry.
Science can understand language, grammar -- everything, but what is
poetry? That simply is missed. For that one needs a loving approach. If
you want to understand the truth you have to be very loving. If you
really want to understand the whole of life in all its dimensions, you
have to approach with great love and care; you have to be very tender,
soft.</p><p>And then a new phenomenon arises in you: your life becomes full of
justice you cannot be unjust then; you cannot be unfair then; it is
impossible. A loving person cannot be unfair.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

become an attachment, otherwise you become prejudiced. Love should not
become demanding otherwise you start imposing your ideas. Love should
not be possessive otherwise it becomes violent. If love can be
non-possessive, non- demanding, unconditional then your whole life has a
tremendous beauty; you radiate something of godliness and that radiation
is what justice is: Only god is just and when you start radiating god,
you are just, never before it.</p><p>(To Paul) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Svabhavo. Anand means
bliss. Svabhavo means self-nature.</p><p>Bliss is our self-nature. It has not to be found somewhere else. It
has to be discovered within yourself. It is already a gift by god. You
are carrying it with yourself. It has been all along with you from the
very beginning; still you are</p><p>miserable. For the simple reason that you never search within. You
search where it is not and you never search where it is. That's how one
goes on missing bliss and one goes on stumbling more and more into
misery.</p><p>Sannyas means a radical change; a change in the very direction of
your life energies. It is a turning in, it is a pilgrimage to one's own
center. Sannyas is nothing but the very essence of meditation.</p><p>Once you have known yourself, you have known all. And once you have
known yourself you are the possessor of an eternal kingdom, of an
inexhaustible treasure.</p><p>(To Robyn) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyanprem. Dhyanprem means lover
of meditation.</p><p>That is the greatest love That can happen to a person.</p><p>All other loves are small things.</p><p>The greatest love is the love for meditation. Meditation means the
search for oneself.</p><p>We have completely forgotten who we are We have forgotten the very
language How to commune with ourselves.</p><p>Whatsoever we know about ourselves Is all false, arbitrary.</p><p>You are given a name and you think that</p><p>This is you -- but nobody is born with a name. The name gives you an
identity.</p><p>You are given a religion --</p><p>Your parents impose a certain religion on you They impose a certain
nationality on you And these things become your identities:</p><p>One is a Hindu, an Indian</p><p>With a certain name, with a certain caste And these become
definitions but</p><p>These are all arbitrary, absolutely artificial. You are born without
them</p><p>But we remain befooling ourselves. This is not acquaintance with
oneself And this is our whole misery 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

remaining</p><p>As ignorant of ourselves as ever. In fact the more time passes</p><p>The more ignorant we become.</p><p>The children</p><p>Are a little more aware of themselves.</p><p>It is not an exceptional thing to find children Calling their own
name in a third person.</p><p>An little boy can say, 'Mommy, Johnny is hungry.' He is not still
identified with Johnny,</p><p>He does not say, 'I am hungry.' He says, 'Johnny is hungry.'</p><p>His understanding is far more deeper;</p><p>He still keeps himself aloof from Johnny. Johnny is as far aware as
anybody else.</p><p>He is just a watcher:</p><p>He has come to know that Johnny is hungry But he is not saying, 'I am
hungry.'</p><p>Soon he will forget, the distance will dissolve: He will become one
with Johnny.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you have to do two things. One, the first
essential step is:</p><p>To become aware of all false identities because To know the false as
the false</p><p>Is the beginning of the journey towards the real.</p><p>Once you become aware</p><p>That all these things are false --</p><p>Being Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan Indian, German, Chinese --</p><p>These are all just arbitrary, accidental, They have nothing to do
with you.</p><p>Your consciousness remains Absolutely untouched by them,</p><p>Then the question arises, 'Who am I?' You are not your education</p><p>And you are not your money And you are not your post -- Your are
nothing of these things</p><p>Then, 'Who am I' -- then the question becomes More and more
poignant.</p><p>Then it takes an insistence</p><p>Then it becomes a constant undercurrent in you That 'Life is running
out</p><p>And I have not yet even known myself, What am I doing here?</p><p>At least one thing should be done</p><p>That I should become aware who I am.' Once this deep longing arises
in you to know Then knowing is not difficult.</p><p>As it becomes intense</p><p>You start moving towards meditation. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

unidentified with the mind</p><p>Remaining absolutely still and trying to see What is this
consciousness that I am.</p><p>It takes a little time for the mind to quiet To calm down; it has
been noisy for lives It has become a habit, but it disappears. And the
day it disappears, suddenly</p><p>All is light, all is joy, all is benediction! You have arrived
home,</p><p>You have penetrated your own being.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name.</p><p>(To Sally) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Avinash. Anand means bliss.
Avinash means eternal.</p><p>Bliss is eternal. Happiness is momentary -- It comes like a breeze
and goes.</p><p>When it comes, it feels good But when it goes it leaves you In a far
more miserable state</p><p>Than you were before, obviously Because now you have tasted something
And now you know the taste of happiness And the misery hurts more.</p><p>People who attain few glimpses of happiness Are far more
miserable</p><p>Than the people who have never had any glimpses Hence the very
strange phenomenon that</p><p>Poor people don't look so miserable. It is very illogical</p><p>They should be more miserable But they don't look so miserable As
rich people look miserable.</p><p>They live in misery, in other's eyes. If a Westerner comes to
India</p><p>He can see the whole misery of the land. Everybody's living in misery
but</p><p>People who are living are not even aware of it. Even the beggar on
the street</p><p>Does not think that he is miserable He accepts it just as matter of
course. That's how life is:</p><p>He has known it this way from the very beginning. His father was a
beggar</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

anything else.</p><p>He may have money in the bank, he may have Every opportunity to
change his business</p><p>But he is no more interested</p><p>He is perfectly happy, things are going well. He has never tasted
anything else</p><p>So he lives into whatsoever condition he is In a state of a dull kind
of satisfaction.</p><p>But the people who have tasted some joy</p><p>Some happiness, some glimpses -- they feel misery. Now America</p><p>Is the most miserable country in the world For the simple reason
because</p><p>It has more glimpses available.</p><p>I am all for richness, for the simple reason Because once you are
aware of misery</p><p>Once you see the momentariness of happiness, A desire arises to seek
and search the eternal. Otherwise</p><p>There is no desire to search for the eternal. If you have tasted for
a single moment Something of joy, you are bound to look; How you can
make it an eternal state of life? How you can be in it permanently,
forever? And that is possible.</p><p>The whole art of meditation is</p><p>To bring eternal peace, silence, joy to you. And the miracle is:</p><p>It (can't read, words missing) from anywhere else. It wells up within
you.</p><p>Meditation simply removes All the barriers in its path. It removes
all the rocks</p><p>And the stream starts flowing. And once you have known that</p><p>It is nothing to do with anything on the outside You have a great
independence, great freedom, You don't depend on anybody.</p><p>You can be absolutely joyous in your aloneness. Your aloneness
becomes luminous.</p><p>It is no more lonely, it is full of joy It is a dancing aloneness</p><p>It is a singing aloneness, it has great beauty And great poetry and

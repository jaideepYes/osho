It is for reference purposes only.]\nThis is your name: Ma Veet Silke.\nVeet means going beyond. Silke means blind.\nMan is blind, not because he has no eyes but only because his eyes are covered with much dust. That dust has to be removed and with the dust blindness disappears. Man is like a mirror and it is but natural to collect dust. All that is needed is a constant cleaning of the mirror. That's what meditation is all about, the art of cleaning your inner mirror of consciousness.\nMeditation has to become just like eating, drinking, taking your bath, sleeping: a natural part of your life, of your ordinary life - nothing special, nothing spiritual, nothing to brag about. Then only slowly slowly blindness disappears; one becomes able to see.\nPeople ask, \"Where is god?\" They should simply ask, \"Where are our eyes?\" God is everywhere, it is unquestionably everywhere, only god is, but we are blind.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe are like a blind man asking, \"Where is light?\" No argument can convince him, no proof can be given to him. All that he needs is a physician who can cure his eyes.\nThe master is not a teacher, the master is not a philosopher, the master is a physician. And to be a disciple simply means to be under a master's treatment. It means to be a patient; literally too because it needs great patience. But one can go beyond blindness because it is nothing to do with our nature, it is something imposed from the outside. It can be dropped. And the moment it is dropped your life has a tremendous glory to it. It becomes a dance of gratitude.\nExperiencing god is the only bliss in existence. Everything else is just momentary. Only the experience of god is eternal; is something that, once attained, is forever.\n(To Dieter) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Dieter. Dhyan means meditation. Dieter means full of justice.\nMeditation is the only possibility of someone becoming full of justice. Because the basic requirement of meditation is dropping of all prejudices. When all prejudices are dropped you cannot be unjust, you cannot be unfair. It becomes impossible. With thousand and one prejudices inside you howsoever hard you try, you cannot be just. Your prejudice will interfere.\nJust today I received a letter from an Irish mother to her daughter who is a sannyasin here. The mother says, I am reading the books you have sent of Osho -\n- everything is beautiful. Just I have to ask one question: \"Is he a catholic?\nIf he is a catholic, then everything is okay. If he is not, then everything is wrong.\"\nThis is how a prejudiced mind functions. The same books will be right. The same person will be right, only he has to be a Catholic. The same book will be\nwrong if he is not a Catholic. She writes, 'If he is a catholic, be there if he is not a Catholic, then come back home. Don't waste your time.'\nAnd this is not that the mother does not love. She is completely unaware of her prejudice. The prejudice has gone so deep that it is impossible for her to conceive that anybody who is not a Catholic can also be right -- that is impossible. If he is right, he has to be Catholic. To be Catholic and to be right has become synonymous -- that's how prejudices function.\nIn fact in a better world every magistrate should have to go through a long process of meditation, otherwise he should not be allowed to be a magistrate because he cannot be just. A Hindu magistrate cannot be just, a Mohammedan magistrate cannot be just -- their ideas are there. He may try his hard but who is going to interpret the law? The mind will interpret the law and the mind is full of opinions already, so those opinions will colour your interpretations. Only a meditator can be just. Unless every law college also becomes a temple of meditation there is no possibility of any justice in the world. It has not existed up to now. We have been only lipped (lived) with the idea but the idea has not become a reality yet.\nDrop all prejudices, drop the whole mind because it is nothing but prejudices. Why carry the junk? --\nBe clean. And ;out of all that cleanliness you will be able to see things as they are: Your life will be full of justice, full of love, full of compassion. And those will be natural consequences of your meditation -- you are not to practice them. Anything practised is always ugly.\n(To Klaus) This is your name: Swami Navino. Navino means the absolutely new.\nOrdinarily we are taught that all that is old is gold and that is sheer nonsense. Just the opposite is true because truth is always new, always fresh, always young. It is as fresh as dewdrops on the grass and leaves early in the morning, as fresh as the lotus petals just opening in the pond; as fresh as the eyes of a child.\nTruth is never old because truth is never part of time. Truth is eternal, hence it is always now. Truth knows only one time and that is now and only one space and that is here. It knows no past, no future and that's how a sannyasin should be:\nabsolutely new. Never gather the past, every day die to the past, every day cleanse yourself of the past, get rid of it, don't collect it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPeople are great collectors and they go on collecting junk and they give beautiful names to junk. And if you want to collect anything you can always find some rationalization: you can call it something, it is antique - the first car in which God drove Adam out of heaven.\nIt is written in the Bible - I don't know how he drove! Must have used some Ford car! And somebody must have it - it is the greatest vintage car. You may have to carry it on your heads, that's another matter, but the more ancient it is the more valuable it becomes. Avoid these rationalizations, and every day slip out of the old. In the night when you go to sleep say goodbye to the day that is no more; be finished with it, close the chapter. Really make it closed, never open it again. It is finished! And tomorrow morning begin afresh, as if you are born anew. And you will suddenly see your life starts to have new qualities which you had never suspected were hidden in you. Your potential will start becoming actual, and every day will bring new surprises, and every day will become a tremendous mystery.\nIt is the old that does not allow the mystery to be experienced. Remain fresh, young, new and it is not very far - that one day suddenly you will stumble upon god because god is always new. When you are also new, meeting is possible because you are both in the same space.\nThat's my whole effort here: to help my sannyasins to be in the same space in which god exists. There is no need to believe in god, just exist in the same space, in the same eternity and you are bound to meet him.\nThere is no way of not meeting him.\n(To Erwin) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Pravino.\nDhyan means meditation; Pravino means skill -- skill is meditation.\nMeditation is an art, in fact the greatest art there is. Painting is a great art, poetry is a great art, but meditation is the greatest because painting creates something outside, music too, poetry too, but meditation creates something inside. Painting will create only a painting -- the painter will remain the same. And music will create music, but the musician will remain the same, the same old miserable person. Poetry may great but if you meet the pet you may start suspecting whether he is really the man who has written such great poetry?\nIt is advisable, if you love somebody's poetry avoid the poet!\nIf you love somebody's painting avoid the painter, otherwise you will be in a confusion because the poet will fall very short of his poetry. He is an ordinary human being. Sometime even far below than ordinary human beings: He has only moments of flight, moments of glimpses and then he falls back, and of course he falls back with a revenge. So he goes deeper then the ordinary human beings. So you will find him in all kinds of stupid things -- gambling, drinking. You will find him in the whore houses... And he has written such beautiful poetry that if you just know the poetry you will think he is a realized soul, a godman, a man of god.\nMeditation really is the greatest art because it creates your subjectivity, it paints your inner being, it creates the poetry of your being, it creates the music of your heart, it transforms you!\nBy becoming a sannyasins your are taking a great decision, a decision to transform yourself. A commitment that, 'Now I will pour all my energies into one direction.' And once you start pouring all your energies into one direction even the impossible becomes possible. And it is your birthright; it is not impossible.\n(To Hans) -- Your name: Swami Gyandip. Gyandip means a lamp of wisdom.\nMan is born with intrinsic capacity of being wise. It is not something to be learned. It is already there.\nMaybe it needs a little polishing here and there but that's all, otherwise it is there. It is not like knowledge; knowledge is not there. You have to learn it, ;you have to learn it from others. You need teachers for knowledge. For wisdom you need a\nmaster.\nA master is not a teacher -- the difference is great. The teacher teaches you, helps you to learn more and more, informs you. The master helps you to unlearn. He UNteaches you, he helps you to unburden, to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndrop all rubbish called knowledge. His function is just the opposite.\nOrdinarily people think a teacher and a master are the same thing. They will even call Buddha a great teacher. They are not same things, their function is totally opposite. The teacher heaps you to become aware that there is much within you which is not your own: Drop it, disconnect yourself from it, get disidentified from it so that your inner being can have more space for itself to grow. You are hampered, cripples by knowledge, so much burdened that your self-nature cannot assert. All that is needed is a little space for you to grow and then the light burns bright within you and in that light, whatsoever you so is right. In that light you cannot do anything wrong. That light is the only certainty for a true virtue, for a true morality, for a true character.\n(To Lis) -- This is your name: Ma Bhagvatta. Bhagvatta means godliness.\nThere is no god as a person. The idea of god as a person is a childish idea. Good to help children to understand. It is like the illustrated books which we prepare for children: Colour pictures are more because they are more interested in colour and pictures and through those colored pictures we can help them to learn language -- For example if we want to teach them what a potato is we have to give them a beautiful picture of a potato -- they will be immediately interested in the picture of the potato. And then we can tell them\n'This is potato.' Then they become aware of the word 'potato'. They learn the word through the picture.\nPrimitive people live in a pictorial world. That's why the very ancient languages are pictorial -- Chinese is a pictorial language. There is no alphabet, no A, B, C,\nD -- just pictures. Hence it is very difficult. To be really a scholar in Chinese one needs at least a dozen years great effort, arduous effort because you must know at least one hundred thousand pictures. Only then you can claim some knowledge.\nAlphabets have helped other languages tremendously. They are grown up languages. In dreams we all regress back to pictorial language. We again become primitive because dreams come from the unconscious and the unconscious is still primitive, except for those few who have become enlightened. They don't have any unconscious, hence then can't dream.\nOne thing that one misses when one becomes enlightened is: dreaming. Even if you want to dream, you cannot dream because the whole being becomes conscious. There is no unconscious left, so there is no question of any pictorial languages. And the more primitive people dream in colour. The more sophisticated people dream in black and white.\nGod is just a picture of primitive people. The very idea of god as a person is\nprimitive, anthropocentric\n-- we have imagined god in our own image; that is not true, but certainly existence is full of something very mysterious. I call that mysteriousness bhagvatta, godliness -- not god, but godliness. A fragrance surrounds the whole existence not like a person, not like a flower but like a fragrance. You cannot catch hold of it but it is still there. You can only smell it, you can be overwhelmed by it, you have to be very sensitive. It is not a question of worshipping god because there is nobody to be worshipped. It is a question of becoming more and more sensitive, so sensitive and vulnerable, so open that all the mysteries that surround you can penetrate you. Then suddenly one becomes aware that existence is not what it appears. It is far more, tremendously far more. It is simply far out! It is unbelievably, incredibly beautiful. We cannot imagine its beauty, its bliss, its benediction.\nI am giving you one of the most beautiful names possible. Try to live up to it.\nNo Man is an Island 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Chapter #2\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2471","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2471 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

can always find some rationalization: you can call it something, it is
antique - the first car in which God drove Adam out of heaven.</p><p>It is written in the Bible - I don't know how he drove! Must have
used some Ford car! And somebody must have it - it is the greatest
vintage car. You may have to carry it on your heads, that's another
matter, but the more ancient it is the more valuable it becomes. Avoid
these rationalizations, and every day slip out of the old. In the night
when you go to sleep say goodbye to the day that is no more; be finished
with it, close the chapter. Really make it closed, never open it again.
It is finished! And tomorrow morning begin afresh, as if you are born
anew. And you will suddenly see your life starts to have new qualities
which you had never suspected were hidden in you. Your potential will
start becoming actual, and every day will bring new surprises, and every
day will become a tremendous mystery.</p><p>It is the old that does not allow the mystery to be experienced.
Remain fresh, young, new and it is not very far - that one day suddenly
you will stumble upon god because god is always new. When you are also
new, meeting is possible because you are both in the same space.</p><p>That's my whole effort here: to help my sannyasins to be in the same
space in which god exists. There is no need to believe in god, just
exist in the same space, in the same eternity and you are bound to meet
him.</p><p>There is no way of not meeting him.</p><p>(To Erwin) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Pravino.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation; Pravino means skill -- skill is
meditation.</p><p>Meditation is an art, in fact the greatest art there is. Painting is
a great art, poetry is a great art, but meditation is the greatest
because painting creates something outside, music too, poetry too, but
meditation creates something inside. Painting will create only a
painting -- the painter will remain the same. And music will create
music, but the musician will remain the same, the same old miserable
person. Poetry may great but if you meet the pet you may start
suspecting whether he is really the man who has written such great
poetry?</p><p>It is advisable, if you love somebody's poetry avoid the poet!</p><p>If you love somebody's painting avoid the painter, otherwise you will
be in a confusion because the poet will fall very short of his poetry.
He is an ordinary human being. Sometime even far below than ordinary
human beings: He has only moments of flight, moments of glimpses and
then he falls back, and of course he falls back with a revenge. So he
goes deeper then the ordinary human beings. So you will find him in all
kinds of stupid things -- gambling, drinking. You will find him in the
whore houses... And he has written such beautiful poetry that if you
just know the poetry you will think he is a realized soul, a godman, a
man of god.</p><p>Meditation <em>really</em> is the greatest art because it creates
your subjectivity, it paints your inner being, it creates the poetry of
your being, it creates the music of your heart, it transforms you!</p><p>By becoming a sannyasins your are taking a great decision, a decision
to transform yourself. A commitment that, 'Now I will pour all my
energies into one direction.' And once you start pouring all your
energies into <em>one</em> direction even the impossible becomes
possible. And it is your birthright; it is not impossible.</p><p>(To Hans) -- Your name: Swami Gyandip. Gyandip means a lamp of
wisdom.</p><p>Man is born with intrinsic capacity of being wise. It is not
something to be learned. It is already there.</p><p>Maybe it needs a little polishing here and there but that's all,
otherwise it is there. It is not like knowledge; knowledge is not there.
You have to learn it, ;you have to learn it from others. You need
teachers for knowledge. For wisdom you need a</p><p>master.</p><p>A master is not a teacher -- the difference is great. The teacher
teaches you, helps you to learn more and more, informs you. The master
helps you to unlearn. He UNteaches you, he helps you to unburden, to

opposite.</p><p>Ordinarily people think a teacher and a master are the same thing.
They will even call Buddha a great teacher. They are not same things,
their function is totally opposite. The teacher heaps you to become
aware that there is much within you which is not your own: Drop it,
disconnect yourself from it, get disidentified from it so that your
inner being can have more space for itself to grow. You are hampered,
cripples by knowledge, so much burdened that your self-nature cannot
assert. All that is needed is a little space for you to grow and then
the light burns bright within you and in that light, whatsoever you so
is right. In that light you cannot do anything wrong. That light is the
only certainty for a true virtue, for a true morality, for a true
character.</p><p>(To Lis) -- This is your name: Ma Bhagvatta. Bhagvatta means
godliness.</p><p>There is no god as a person. The idea of god as a person is a
childish idea. Good to help children to understand. It is like the
illustrated books which we prepare for children: Colour pictures are
more because they are more interested in colour and pictures and through
those colored pictures we can help them to learn language -- For example
if we want to teach them what a potato is we have to give them a
beautiful picture of a potato -- they will be immediately interested in
the picture of the potato. And then we can tell them</p><p>'This is potato.' Then they become aware of the word 'potato'. They
learn the word through the picture.</p><p>Primitive people live in a pictorial world. That's why the
<em>very</em> ancient languages are pictorial -- Chinese is a pictorial
language. There is no alphabet, no A, B, C,</p><p>D -- just pictures. Hence it is very difficult. To be <em>really</em>
a scholar in Chinese one needs at least a dozen years great effort,
arduous effort because you must know at least one hundred thousand
pictures. Only then you can claim some knowledge.</p><p>Alphabets have helped other languages tremendously. They are grown up
languages. In dreams we all regress back to pictorial language. We again
become primitive because dreams come from the unconscious and the
unconscious is still primitive, except for those few who have become
enlightened. They don't have any unconscious, hence then can't
dream.</p><p>One thing that one misses when one becomes enlightened is: dreaming.
Even if you want to dream, you cannot dream because the whole being
becomes conscious. There is no unconscious left, so there is no question
of any pictorial languages. And the more primitive people dream in
colour. The more sophisticated people dream in black and white.</p><p>God is just a picture of primitive people. The very idea of god as a
person <em>is</em></p><p>primitive, anthropocentric</p><p>-- we have imagined god in our own image; that is not true, but
certainly existence is full of something very mysterious. I call that
mysteriousness bhagvatta, godliness -- not god, but godliness. A
fragrance surrounds the whole existence not like a person, not like a
flower but like a fragrance. You cannot catch hold of it but it is still
there. You can only smell it, you can be overwhelmed by it, you have to
be very sensitive. It is not a question of worshipping god because there
is nobody to be worshipped. It is a question of becoming more and more
sensitive, so sensitive and vulnerable, so open that all the mysteries
that surround you can penetrate you. Then suddenly one becomes aware
that existence is not what it appears. It is far more, tremendously far
more. It is simply far out! It is unbelievably, incredibly beautiful. We
cannot imagine its beauty, its bliss, its benediction.</p><p>I am giving you one of the most beautiful names possible. Try to live
up to it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

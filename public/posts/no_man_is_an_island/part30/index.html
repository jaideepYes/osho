Thomas is the seeker of truth.\nThe enquiry into truth\nIs the most blissful activity of life\nBecause it is only through realizing the truth That one becomes capable\nOf dropping all the miseries.\nMiseries are shadows of lies.\nWe live in lies, hence we are miserable. Nobody wants to be miserable\nBut nobody wants to drop his lies. And people don't see\nThe relationship between the two; There is a cause and effect relationship. For example the greatest lie of your life Everybody's life, is the ego\nAnd it poisons your whole life. Nobody wants to be miserable\nYet everybody wants to protect his ego. Unless one sees this contradiction\nOne will never be able to get rid of miseries. You want to get rid of the effect\nBut you go on nursing the cause You go on watering the tree And you are against the fruits!\nThe fruits are bitter\nBut you don't see the relationship That if you stop watering the tree\nThe fruits will disappear on their own accord. Just as lies are causes of misery\nTruth is the cause of bliss. Once you know what truth is,\nYour whole life becomes blissful.\nEach moment a moment of rejoicing, a moment of celebration. (To Rudi) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Rudi.\nPrem means love. Rudi means the loyal one. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is one of the greatest qualities of life,\nLoyalty -- but it is disappearing from the world, For the simple reason that love is dying; Without love there can be no loyalty.\nLoyalty is the fragrance of love. Yes, a certain kind of loyalty\nCan be enforced upon you even without love But then it is pseudo, then it is ugly\nThen it is violent -- that's the difference\nBetween a soldier and a sannyasin. The soldier is also loyal\nBut his loyalty is only enforced; He is manipulated to be loyal He is conditioned to be loyal.\nIn thousand and one ways\nA crust of loyalty is created around him His own soul is crushed, he loses his soul. A soldier has no soul of his own,\nHe lives like a robot. His whole training is\nOf destroying the man and creating the machine. A sannyasin is just the opposite pole.\nThe whole process of sannyas is Destroying your mechanicalness And reviving your humanity Reviving your consciousness.\nIt is a process of de-automatisation.\nThe soldier is loyal because he has to be loyal. He is as loyal as a machine:\nYou push the button and the lights are on, You push the button and the lights are off;\nThey are loyal, they never disobey, They are perfectly obedient.\nA sannyasin is also, lives in loyalty But his loyalty is so totally different That in fact, the same word\nShould not be used for both -- It can create confusion\nBut we don't have another word. He is loyal because he loves\nHe is loyal because he understands\nHe is loyal because he is surrendered -- 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNot forced to surrender;\nOn his own accord, out of his own freedom. When loyalty comes out of love\nIt is as beautiful as a rose flower. When loyalty comes\nThrough a certain kind of cultivation\nThen it is like a plastic flower:\nMay look like a rose but it is not a rose And it has no fragrance at all.\nLoyalty is dying in the world\nBecause love is dying: love has to be revived. It is only through spreading love\nThat we can make human beings again Loyal to each other.\nThen loyalty is not for small things; The country, the state, the church -- These are ugly institutions\nThese are hangovers from the past\nThese are dead things -- they should be burned! We should get rid of all of them.\nThey are torturing humanity. They are like mountainous burden\nOn the small heart of man. They are destructive. Their weight is destructive.\nMan should be freed\nFrom all these small, mundane loyalties. Man should have only one loyalty\nAnd that is towards existence; Less than that is not good More than that is not possible Because existence contains all! Existence means god\nBut I am not using the word 'god' deliberately Because it is being used by the churches\nAnd by the politicians and by the priests And in their mouths\nEven the beautiful word 'god' stinks.\nFor few years we should drop the word completely We should forget about it;\nExistence, nature, life -- These should be our gods\nAnd we should be loyal to life itself. We will find finally that life is god And that finding is possible only Through love and through loyalty.\n(To Brigitte) This is your name: Ma Dhyan Brigitte. Dhyan means meditation and Brigitte is a Celtic goddess, goddess of wisdom and songs. That's very rare because ordinarily in the past, wisdom has never been connected with songs.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe saints look so sad -- how can they sing? They can cry, they can weep; they cannot laugh, they cannot dance, they cannot sing. But this name, Brigitte, is beautiful; that's my idea of wisdom.\nWisdom should be a dancing phenomenon, a singing phenomenon; it should not be sad and serious. If it is sad and serious, it is not wisdom at all, it is mere knowledge. And this kind of wisdom which can sing and dance, can arise only through meditation; it cannot come through studying the scriptures. Then you accumulate knowledge, and all knowledge is false because truth cannot be borrowed, you have to discover it yourself. It is yours only when you have discovered it.\nThe truth of Jesus cannot be yours, the truth of Buddha cannot be yours. You can repeat those beautiful words but they will be empty words on your tongue; they won't have any meaning because you will not be able to experience their innermost core. They will be just words without any content, empty containers.\nThat's how scholars are made: They know all the beautiful words but their life is the life of unconsciousness. They are as stupid as anybody else, in fact more so; they are not intelligent people, they cannot be. Their mind is so full of jargon, there is no escape left for intelligence to grow. Their mind only grows weeds. You cannot grow roses when there are so many weeds. Wisdom is a rose: you need to get rid of all knowledge.\nMeditation does two things: First, it gets rid of all knowledge -- that's its negative function. And secondly, it helps you to enter into your own being, into your inner truth -- that's its positive function. Both things fulfilled, one becomes wise. And that wisdom certainly knows how to sing, knows how to love, knows how to rejoice!\n(To Candida) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Candida. Anand means bliss. Candida means white.\nThe white represents innocence, purity\nA childlike spirit. And bliss is possible only When you are a child again.\nWhen you are innocent.\nThe knowledgeable person can never be blissful. He knows too much\nWithout knowing anything at all But because he thinks he knows He loses all capacity to wonder,\nHe loses something of immense value: He cannot feel awe, nothing surprises him He becomes absolutely incapable\nOf feeling the mysterious. Just because he thinks\nThat he knows, he knows everything, And all in fact that he knows is Nothing but mere words\nBut those words clamor in his mind And befool him and deceive him.\nIn his knowledgeability he cannot see\nThe flowers, the stars, the beauty of existence\nThe benediction that life goes on showering on us.\nHe cannot feel any gratitude.\nHe loses all contact with his own heart. He remains hung up in the head.\nThat can be presented by the color black.\nIt seems very significant that in universities Particularly in their convocations\nThe vice chancellors, the chancellors, the deans 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAll use black robes.\nThey may not be aware of the fact that\nThat black color really represents their state: It represents their stupid knowledge Their so-called knowledge\nThey have lost their innocence.\nAnd when you graduate from a university You have also to wear black robes.\nThe university is declaring now,\n'You are also no more capable of wondering; You have become knowledgeable\nYou have become part of a dead society. You are included in the dead people -- Now you are no more alive.'\nMy function here is to make you alive again. It is really a process of resurrection.\nSannyas is resurrection.\nAll blackness has to be dropped from your being You have to become white again, pure white -- That is the color of innocence,\nA state of not knowing, Then suddenly\nYour eyes are again full of joy, full of wonder Full of curiosity, enquiry, quest.\nAgain small things of life start surprising you Again you start collecting seashells\nOn the sea beach, like a child, playfully Again you start running after butterflies. Again you start dreaming like a child -- The poet is back again\nThe scholar is gone, the philosopher is gone. The heart is a poet, the head is a philosopher And all that is significant\nHappens through the heart\nNever through the head. Remember it!\nBeing a sannyasin means becoming a child again Dropping the whole burden\nDropping your head completely, beheading yourself. Then life is sheer joy, an unending\nAn eternal journey from bliss to bliss\n(To Girgel) -- This is your name: Swami Pragyan Anubhavo. Pragyan means wisdom. Anubhavo means experience.\nWisdom comes through experience\nNot through thinking, not through studying. Wisdom is not cerebral, not mental\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNot of the mind at all. It is existential. You can know everything about love\nBy reading all the books that have been written And thousands of books\nHave been written about love, but still\nYou will not know love by knowing all those books. You may be able to write\nA great dissertation on love -- Any university will feel fortunate To confer a D.Lit. on you, a Ph.D Or something like that...\nBut you will not know love!\nYou may become a scholar on love\nYou may be able to give long discourses on love But as far as love is concerned\nYou don't know any taste of it It has not happened to you.\nIt is like a blind man talking about light: Yes, a blind man can talk about light\nHe can study about light. He can study Everything that has been written about light He can memorize everything\nHe may become a great expert on light But one thing is certain\nThat he does not know exactly what light is. And a man who has eyes may not be able\nTo say a single word about light But he knows what light is.\nHe has experienced it\nAnd that experience is valuable. Even a great scholarship\nIs of no value compared to a small experience Because only experience gives you authenticity. Truth experienced liberates\nAnd truth unexperienced is only a theorization It is only a hypothesis.\nIt creates a kind of bondage It does not bring freedom.\nThat is one of the most important things To understand for a sannyasins that\nTruth is an experience, wisdom is existential. Hence my emphasis here is\nTo help you to experience.\nI want to cure your eyes, I don't want you To become knowledgeable about light -- That is absolutely irrelevant.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBuddha used to say that, 'I am a physician,' And I perfectly agree with him:\nA real master is always a physician.\nHe treats your eyes, he helps your eyes to see He helps your heart to function.\nHe makes you aware of many things which are there But you are not sensitive to them.\nAnd slowly slowly\nYour windows and doors open up To the wind, to the rain, to the sun And life becomes available to you And you become available to life. When this communion happens Life is a great blessing.\nAll misery disappears on its own accord And one starts feeling grateful to god -- Prayer arises.\nPrayer is gratitude.\n(To Marianne) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Surya.\nSurya means meditation. Surya means the sun, the source of all light. Meditation is the inner sun\nThe source of inner light. We live as extroverts:\nWe are acquainted with the outer light\nBut we are not acquainted with our inner light. Our inner light remains in complete darkness And that is the root cause\nOf all our misery, of all our anguish.\nWe have to become aware of our inner light. There is an eternal flame inside you.\nOnce seen you start living\nThrough a totally different perspective. Then there is no need\nTo follow anybody else commandments: Then you have your own light\nAnd you live according to your own light. Then there is no question\nOf anybody else to decide for you What is right and what is wrong;\nYou know instantly, each moment What is right and what is wrong. It is never a question of deciding, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are no alternatives for a wise man. For a man who has seen his inner light There are no alternatives;\nHe simply knows what is right\nAnd he cannot go against the right -- impossible. You cannot do the wrong\nIf you know yourself that it is wrong. People go on doing the wrong because\nIt is somebody else knowing that it is wrong. People go on going against the right because It is somebody else -- Moses, Christ, Buddha Saying that this is wrong\nBut it is not their experience. In fact, deep down they think,\n'Buddha is right,\nChrist may have been a great man But he can't be right.'\nTheir darkness goes on showing them A totally different path\nAnd they go on falling in it Hence their life becomes split:\nOn the one hand they agree\nWith Christ and Buddha; on the other hand They go on against their teachings.\nThey become split and they become hypocrites. My whole effort here is\nNot to create hypocrites any more. The world is full of them: Christians,\nHindus, Mohammedans, Jainas, Buddhists -- They are all hypocrites\nFor the simple reason That they are trying to live\nAccording to somebody else experience. And because it is not their own experience How can they live according to it?\nSo they are always wavering:\nOne moment they decide this Another moment they decide that; They are in a constant inner conflict\nAnd whatsoever they do, they will feel miserable. If they do what they think is right\nThey will feel miserable because\nThey are going against all the prophets, If they follow the prophets\nThey will feel miserable because\nThey are not following their own nature. So whatsoever they do brings misery -- This is inevitable. The only way out is To search for your own light first.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJesus says, 'See ye first the kingdom of god Then all else shall be added unto you.'\nThis is an old way of saying the same thing.\nIf I am to say it I will say:\nSeek ye first your inner light\nThen all else shall be added unto you. It means the same. I am using\nA far more modern phraseology, that's all. Jesus was, of course,\nUsing the language of his day -- 'The kingdom of god'.\nIt simply means your inner light. By becoming a sannyasin means\nYou are becoming committed to an inner search You are going for a great journey;,\nThe greatest adventure of life.\nMove with your totality, not halfheartedly Not in a lukewarm way.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #31\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2823","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2823 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

reviving your humanity Reviving your consciousness.</p><p>It is a process of de-automatisation.</p><p>The soldier is loyal because he has to be loyal. He is as loyal as a
machine:</p><p>You push the button and the lights are on, You push the button and
the lights are off;</p><p>They are loyal, they never disobey, They are perfectly obedient.</p><p>A sannyasin is also, lives in loyalty But his loyalty is so totally
different That in fact, the same word</p><p>Should not be used for both -- It can create confusion</p><p>But we don't have another word. He is loyal because he loves</p><p>He is loyal because he understands</p><p>He is loyal because he is surrendered -- 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

love</p><p>It is as beautiful as a rose flower. When loyalty comes</p><p>Through a certain kind of cultivation</p><p>Then it is like a plastic flower:</p><p>May look like a rose but it is not a rose And it has no fragrance at
all.</p><p>Loyalty is dying in the world</p><p>Because love is dying: love has to be revived. It is only through
spreading love</p><p>That we can make human beings again Loyal to each other.</p><p>Then loyalty is not for small things; The country, the state, the
church -- These are ugly institutions</p><p>These are hangovers from the past</p><p>These are dead things -- they should be burned! We should get rid of
all of them.</p><p>They are torturing humanity. They are like mountainous burden</p><p>On the small heart of man. They are destructive. Their weight is
destructive.</p><p>Man should be freed</p><p>From all these small, mundane loyalties. Man should have only one
loyalty</p><p>And that is towards existence; Less than that is not good More than
that is not possible Because existence contains all! Existence means
god</p><p>But I am not using the word 'god' deliberately Because it is being
used by the churches</p><p>And by the politicians and by the priests And in their mouths</p><p>Even the beautiful word 'god' stinks.</p><p>For few years we should drop the word completely We should forget
about it;</p><p>Existence, nature, life -- These should be our gods</p><p>And we should be loyal to life itself. We will find finally that life
<em>is</em> god And that finding is possible only Through love and
through loyalty.</p><p>(To Brigitte) This is your name: Ma Dhyan Brigitte. Dhyan means
meditation and Brigitte is a Celtic goddess, goddess of wisdom and
songs. That's very rare because ordinarily in the past, wisdom has never
been connected with songs.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The saints look so sad -- how can they sing? They can cry, they can
weep; they cannot laugh, they cannot dance, they cannot sing. But this
name, Brigitte, is beautiful; that's my idea of wisdom.</p><p>Wisdom should be a dancing phenomenon, a singing phenomenon; it
should not be sad and serious. If it is sad and serious, it is not
wisdom at all, it is mere knowledge. And this kind of wisdom which can
sing and dance, can arise only through meditation; it cannot come
through studying the scriptures. Then you accumulate knowledge, and all
knowledge is false because truth cannot be borrowed, you have to
discover it yourself. It is yours only when you have discovered it.</p><p>The truth of Jesus cannot be yours, the truth of Buddha cannot be
yours. You can repeat those beautiful words but they will be empty words
on your tongue; they won't have any meaning because you will not be able
to experience their innermost core. They will be just words without any
content, empty containers.</p><p>That's how scholars are made: They know all the beautiful words but
their life is the life of unconsciousness. They are as stupid as anybody
else, in fact more so; they are not intelligent people, they cannot be.
Their mind is so full of jargon, there is no escape left for
intelligence to grow. Their mind only grows weeds. You cannot grow roses
when there are so many weeds. Wisdom is a rose: you need to get rid of
all knowledge.</p><p>Meditation does two things: First, it gets rid of all knowledge --
that's its negative function. And secondly, it helps you to enter into
your own being, into your inner truth -- that's its positive function.
Both things fulfilled, one becomes wise. And that wisdom certainly knows
how to sing, knows how to love, knows how to rejoice!</p><p>(To Candida) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Candida. Anand means
bliss. Candida means white.</p><p>The white represents innocence, purity</p><p>A childlike spirit. And bliss is possible only When you are a child
again.</p><p>When you are innocent.</p><p>The knowledgeable person can never be blissful. He knows too much</p><p>Without knowing anything at all But because he thinks he knows He
loses all capacity to wonder,</p><p>He loses something of immense value: He cannot feel awe, nothing
surprises him He becomes absolutely incapable</p><p>Of feeling the mysterious. Just because he thinks</p><p>That he knows, he knows everything, And all in fact that he knows is
Nothing but mere words</p><p>But those words clamor in his mind And befool him and deceive
him.</p><p>In his knowledgeability he cannot see</p><p>The flowers, the stars, the beauty of existence</p><p>The benediction that life goes on showering on us.</p><p>He cannot feel any gratitude.</p><p>He loses all contact with his own heart. He remains hung up in the
head.</p><p>That can be presented by the color black.</p><p>It seems very significant that in universities Particularly in their

represents their stupid knowledge Their so-called knowledge</p><p>They have lost their innocence.</p><p>And when you graduate from a university You have also to wear black
robes.</p><p>The university is declaring now,</p><p>'You are also no more capable of wondering; You have become
knowledgeable</p><p>You have become part of a dead society. You are included in the dead
people -- Now you are no more alive.'</p><p>My function here is to make you alive again. It is really a process
of resurrection.</p><p>Sannyas <em>is</em> resurrection.</p><p>All blackness has to be dropped from your being You have to become
white again, pure white -- That is the color of innocence,</p><p>A state of not knowing, Then suddenly</p><p>Your eyes are again full of joy, full of wonder Full of curiosity,
enquiry, quest.</p><p>Again small things of life start surprising you Again you start
collecting seashells</p><p>On the sea beach, like a child, playfully Again you start running
after butterflies. Again you start dreaming like a child -- The poet is
back again</p><p>The scholar is gone, the philosopher is gone. The heart is a poet,
the head is a philosopher And all that is significant</p><p>Happens through the heart</p><p>Never through the head. Remember it!</p><p>Being a sannyasin means becoming a child again Dropping the whole
burden</p><p>Dropping your head completely, beheading yourself. Then life is sheer
joy, an unending</p><p>An eternal journey from bliss to bliss</p><p>(To Girgel) -- This is your name: Swami Pragyan Anubhavo. Pragyan
means wisdom. Anubhavo means experience.</p><p>Wisdom comes through experience</p><p>Not through thinking, not through studying. Wisdom is not cerebral,
not mental</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

about love</p><p>By reading all the books that have been written And thousands of
books</p><p>Have been written about love, but still</p><p>You will not know love by knowing all those books. You may be able to
write</p><p>A great dissertation on love -- Any university will feel fortunate To
confer a D.Lit. on you, a Ph.D Or something like that...</p><p>But you will not know love!</p><p>You may become a scholar on love</p><p>You may be able to give long discourses on love But as far as love is
concerned</p><p>You don't know any taste of it It has not happened to you.</p><p>It is like a blind man talking about light: Yes, a blind man can talk
about light</p><p>He can study about light. He can study Everything that has been
written about light He can memorize everything</p><p>He may become a great expert on light But one thing is certain</p><p>That he does not know exactly what light is. And a man who has eyes
may not be able</p><p>To say a single word about light But he knows what light is.</p><p>He has experienced it</p><p>And that experience is valuable. Even a great scholarship</p><p>Is of no value compared to a small experience Because only experience
gives you authenticity. Truth experienced liberates</p><p>And truth unexperienced is only a theorization It is only a
hypothesis.</p><p>It creates a kind of bondage It does not bring freedom.</p><p>That is one of the most important things To understand for a
sannyasins that</p><p>Truth is an experience, wisdom is existential. Hence my emphasis here
is</p><p>To help you to experience.</p><p>I want to cure your eyes, I don't want you To become knowledgeable
about light -- That is absolutely irrelevant.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

with him:</p><p>A real master is always a physician.</p><p>He treats your eyes, he helps your eyes to see He helps your heart to
function.</p><p>He makes you aware of many things which <em>are</em> there But you
are not sensitive to them.</p><p>And slowly slowly</p><p>Your windows and doors open up To the wind, to the rain, to the sun
And life becomes available to you And you become available to life. When
this communion happens Life is a great blessing.</p><p>All misery disappears on its own accord And one starts feeling
grateful to god -- Prayer arises.</p><p>Prayer is gratitude.</p><p>(To Marianne) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Surya.</p><p>Surya means meditation. Surya means the sun, the source of all light.
Meditation is the inner sun</p><p>The source of inner light. We live as extroverts:</p><p>We are acquainted with the outer light</p><p>But we are not acquainted with our inner light. Our inner light
remains in complete darkness And that is the root cause</p><p>Of all our misery, of all our anguish.</p><p>We have to become aware of our inner light. There is an eternal flame
inside you.</p><p>Once seen you start living</p><p>Through a totally different perspective. Then there is no need</p><p>To follow anybody else commandments: Then you have your own light</p><p>And you live according to your own light. Then there is no

inner light There are no alternatives;</p><p>He simply knows what is right</p><p>And he cannot go against the right -- impossible. You cannot do the
wrong</p><p>If you know yourself that it is wrong. People go on doing the wrong
because</p><p>It is somebody else knowing that it is wrong. People go on going
against the right because It is somebody else -- Moses, Christ, Buddha
Saying that this is wrong</p><p>But it is not <em>their</em> experience. In fact, deep down they
think,</p><p>'Buddha is right,</p><p>Christ may have been a great man But he can't be right.'</p><p>Their darkness goes on showing them A totally different path</p><p>And they go on falling in it Hence their life becomes split:</p><p>On the one hand they agree</p><p>With Christ and Buddha; on the other hand They go on against their
teachings.</p><p>They become split and they become hypocrites. My whole effort here
is</p><p>Not to create hypocrites any more. The world is full of them:
Christians,</p><p>Hindus, Mohammedans, Jainas, Buddhists -- They are all hypocrites</p><p>For the simple reason That they are trying to live</p><p>According to somebody <em>else</em> experience. And because it is not

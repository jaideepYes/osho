It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Maitena) This is your name: Ma Asti Maitena. Asti means existence. Maitena means esteemed by, loved by.\nExistence care for everybody. Without existence loving us we cannot exist even for a single moment. It goes on pouring life into us\nWe are immensely esteemed by existence Although we go on taking it for granted -- That's where our stupidity lies.\nIf we take it for grated there is no gratitude We think as if we deserve\nWe think as if it is our right; in fact\nWe think as if we are not getting as much as we deserve, hence there is A constant undercurrent of complaints.\nThis is the state of the irreligious man. The religious man feels gratitude Immense gratitude.\nJust for sheer being he is grateful.\nAnd once you start feeling gratefulness There are thousand and one things\nTo feel grateful for.\nAnd the more you feel grateful 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe more gifts go on arriving. Many gifts are not reaching to us Because of our complaining mind.\nIf this complaining mind is put aside\nAll the stars are ours and all the mysteries That existence contains are ours.\n(To Rinie) -- Your name: My Dhyan Rinie. Dhyan means means Meditation. Rinie is a beautiful name; It has many meanings and all meanings are of\nSignificance.\nThe first meaning is pure, purity.\nMan needs a pure heart to commune with existence. The heart becomes pure\nWhen the mind is no more dominant within you. Till the mind dominates\nThe heart remains impure. The mind clings to the heart Like dust clinging to a mirror.\nMind is nothing but thought-dust.\nEach thought is just dust and nothing else. One has to clean all thoughts\nThen purity is attained.\nPurity has nothing to do with morality. Of course, a pure heart is moral but\nA moral person need not be pure.\nA moral person is still living in his head\nHis morality is still a domination of the head. The head is saying, 'Do this, don't do that.' And the head is very calculative:\nIt calculates about this world It calculates bout the other too.\nIt does not know purity because\nit is not innocent, hence remember:\nMorality does not lead to purity, The vice versa is not true.\nPurity certainly leads to mortality\nBut first comes purity, then morality follows. And the second meaning is clean\nSpotlessly clean.\nMind is cunning, it cannot be clean.\nIt is crafty, it is continuously playing tricks With others and with oneself -- it is a politician. Heart is love and only love can be clean.\nDiplomacy is bound to be dirty. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe third meaning is crystal. Gurdjieff used to say, 'Unless a man Becomes crystalized, he has no soul.'\nIf he was giving you the name, he would have\nSimply jumped upon the word 'crystal', because That contains his whole philosophy.\nOrdinarily a man is a crowd, fragments --\nHe is not one, he is many, he is multi-psychic And that is his misery:\nThere is constant war inside\nAll the fragments are fighting for supremacy. And this is how our whole life is wasted: Our all energies go down the drain\nAnd man needs a single centre of being And that is crystallization.\nMeditation brings crystallization It melts the many fragments Into one integral whole.\nAnd there are other three meanings also:\nBeauty, grace and devotion -- they are by-products. One who is pure, clean and crystallized\nHe is bound to be beautiful.\nA tremendous inner beauty arises\nAnd it radiates outside. Life becomes graceful. All ugliness and meanness disappears\nOne starts enjoying sharing whatsoever one has One is always ready to share and give\nJust for giving's sake.\nAnd the ultimate consequence of all this process Is devotion: one comes to know what devotion is. Devotion means the feeling\nThat god surrounds you;, that god is everywhere That you are within and without, full of god Everything is overflowing with god!\nSeeing it, feeling it --\nWhat you can do, except surrender! That surrender is devotion.\nAnd all these things\nCan become possible through meditation. Meditation is the magic key.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Gebhard) -- This is your name: Swami Atit Gebhard. Atit means go beyond, surpass, because Gebhard is a dangerous word. It means the gift of being hard.\nHitherto humanity has praised hardness very much Particularly in man.\nFor centuries man has been a male chauvinist pig! He has praised all that is aggressive, cruel Violent, warlike, and\nHe has condemned all that is feminine. And it is because of this\nA great problem has arisen. The problem is: All that is beautiful is feminine\nAnd if you condemn the feminine\nThen the beautiful disappears from the world. And we have struggled hard\nTo destroy the beautiful.\nThe ugly has dominated the beautiful\nAnd he hard has been praised against the soft. By becoming a sannyasin\nYou have to change all priorities.\nLao Tzu says, 'Don't be hard like a rock But be soft like water.'\nHe calls his way of life the watercourse way. And he says, 'Ultimately the soft\nWins over the hard,\nThe rock will disappear one day. Let the water go on falling on it\nAnd the rock will be reduced to sand.'\nOf course, right now you cannot see it happening It will take time\nBut the rock cannot destroy the water. For that one needs a little deeper insight. A longer vision, a bigger perspective.\nAnd we are very short-sighted, We only see so far.\nBecause of this shortsightedness\nThe rock seems to be worth choosing, not water. Those who have seen reality\nInto true perspective of eternity They say something totally different. Let softness be the gift.\nA soldier needs to be hard\nAn sannyasin needs to be soft. A soldier needs to be aggressive Violent, destructive.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nA sannyasin needs to be just the opposite: Receptive, loving.\nA sannyasin basically lives in a kind of let-go. So go beyond your old name.\nIt is good, so I am keeping the old So it will remind you that\nYou have to go beyond it. And I am adding the new too That you have to go beyond.\nYour name has both, your past and your future. Not only your past but the past of humanity And not only your future\nBut the future of humanity.\nWe have to absorb feminine qualities. The woman has to be accepted.\nWithout the woman man is half\nJust as woman is half without the man.\nAnd when both energies meet and mingle\nThey are not opposites, they are complementaries. And they help and a higher synthesis arises.\nThe effort to live in a man-oriented world Has failed, utterly failed.\nOur whole history is a history of failure. Now we have to try something else.\nIt is time we should try -- if we don't try Then humanity's future is doomed.\nWe have come to a cul-de-sac.\nMan and woman have to merge their energies Into one so that we can have a human world Neither male-oriented nor female-oriented Neither a patriarchy nor a matriarchy -- Simple human.\nAnd that's my effort here.\nMy sannyasins have to become Heralds of a new age, of a new man.\n(To Sylvie) -- This is your name: Ma Subhadro. Subhadro means grace.\nGrace is beauty of the inner.\nIt filters out too but it originates At the very centre of your being.\nAnd slowly slowly it starts radiating Through your mind, through your body But it is not of the body\nIt comes from somewhere deeper than the body. It is not of the mind either.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are physically beautiful people\nWe give them awards -- a Miss Universe. There are psychologically beautiful people We give them Nobel prizes.\nBut we have not yet recognized A spiritually beautiful person.\nWe have not been able to ignore them\nBut we have not been able to recognize them. We have crucified them, that's why I say\nWe have not been able to ignore them.\nWe have poisoned then, killed them, murdered them We have done all kinds of thing\nThat is their reward.\nbut it doesn't matter to a spiritual person. He rejoices even in his death.\nOne who has attained to grace Rejoices in everything\nEven the darkest night is not dark for him, It is luminous.\nEven the thorn is transformed into his vision In a flower.\nGrace cannot be cultivated, obviously. You can go to the beautician for the body You can go to the universities for the mind but for the inner grace\nYou will have to go inwards. Buddhas can only point the way They can only give you vague hints Not specific programmes\nBecause the inner journey is a mysterious journey No maps can be made\nNo fixed programmes can be given Because each individual\nHas to travel in a different way And each individual\nHas to go in a different inner world Because each individual\nHas a unique inner territory.\nMeditation is the only way that brings you To grace, in inner beauty, it inner realization. But once attained\nYour whole life becomes flooded with it. Then whatsoever you touch turns into gold.\n(To Herbert) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Vinamaro. Deva means divine. Vinamaro means humbleness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHumbleness is never a human achievement It cannot be by its very nature.\nIf it is your achievement, the ego will pretend\nThat 'I have achieved humbleness,' And that is a contradiction.\nThe ego will say, 'Look. I have become humble. Nobody is more humble than me.\nI am the humblest person on the earth.' And the ego can go on playing the game. Just few days before, Pope Paul\nPlayed the drama of being Jesus:\nHe carried the corss to a hill nearby the Vatican And thousands of people followed him\nAnd he touched the feet of a poor beggar Washed the feet and kissed the feet -- And this is pure exhibitionism.\nThis is showing that 'Look, how humble am I. Nobody is more humble than me.'\nBut it is all drama, it is only for the show. Real humbleness comes as a gift from god. All that man can do is an effort to understand The ways of the ego -- that's all.\nOne can watch how the ego functions\nOne can see its cunning and subtle strategies\nTactics, its trips,\nAnd one can watch it in all possible ways.\nAnd the miracle is: The more you become aware Of its strategies and tricks and trips\nThe more and more those trips\nAnd tricks and strategies start evaporating. Just be sheer awareness this miracle happens And one day suddenly, there is no ego\nAnd in that moment something from the beyond Descends in you as a gift, just as a shower.\nYou cannot say 'I am humble,' you can simply say 'I am no more, humbleness has happened.'\nYou cannot claim it as your own achievement. Meditation helps you\nTo become aware of the ways of the ego And then everything else can be left to god.\n(To William) -- Deva Yogen. Deva means divine; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYogen means meeting -- meeting with the divine. It is possible any moment; there is no particular Fixed moment for it to happen\nHence it is unpredictable -- it can happen right now. All that is needed is the courage to drop the ego.\nWhatsoever time one wants to take To gather courage to drop the ego That is the time that the meeting\nHas to be postponed for that time only. Once you are ready to drop the ego\nTo lose your identity,\nTo say totally with the heart\n'I am no more' -- suddenly, god is! It is a very strange meeting.\nOrdinarily in a meeting two persons are needed. This is a very strange meeting.\nThis meeting happens only when one is absent. If two are present it never happens.\nOf you are there and god is there Then it won't happen\nBecause you will be the barrier.\nIf you are not there then it happens. In your absence the barrier falls The block disappears\nSuddenly you are one with god\nThere is nothing to divide, nothing to separate. It is like a dewdrop\nSlipping from a lotus leaf into the lake. Be a dewdrop -- allow yourself\nTo slip from the lotus leaf Don't cling to the lotus leaf. This buddhafield is only a lake Sannyas is only a lotus leaf\nYou are a dewdrop on the lotus leaf Don't cling! Slip!\nAnd go dancing, go singing, die into the lake! And immediately you are no more but god is. And that's what you in reality are\u003e\nYou are that -- 'Tat-tvam-asi'\nThat is one of the greatest statements ever made; Thou art that.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #4\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2313","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2313 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

man.</p><p>For centuries man <em>has</em> been a male chauvinist pig! He has
praised all that is aggressive, cruel Violent, warlike, and</p><p>He has condemned all that is feminine. And it is because of this</p><p>A great problem has arisen. The problem is: All that is beautiful is
feminine</p><p>And if you condemn the feminine</p><p>Then the beautiful disappears from the world. And we have struggled
hard</p><p>To destroy the beautiful.</p><p>The ugly has dominated the beautiful</p><p>And he hard has been praised against the soft. By becoming a
sannyasin</p><p>You have to change all priorities.</p><p>Lao Tzu says, 'Don't be hard like a rock But be soft like water.'</p><p>He calls his way of life the watercourse way. And he says,
'Ultimately the soft</p><p>Wins over the hard,</p><p>The rock will disappear one day. Let the water go on falling on
it</p><p>And the rock will be reduced to sand.'</p><p>Of course, right now you cannot see it happening It will take
time</p><p>But the rock cannot destroy the water. For that one needs a little
deeper insight. A longer vision, a bigger perspective.</p><p>And we are very short-sighted, We only see so far.</p><p>Because of this shortsightedness</p><p>The rock seems to be worth choosing, not water. Those who have seen
reality</p><p>Into true perspective of eternity They say something totally
different. Let softness be the gift.</p><p>A soldier needs to be hard</p><p>An sannyasin needs to be soft. A soldier needs to be aggressive
Violent, destructive.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

divine. Vinamaro means humbleness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

nature.</p><p>If it is your achievement, the ego will pretend</p><p>That 'I have achieved humbleness,' And that is a contradiction.</p><p>The ego will say, 'Look. I have become humble. Nobody is more humble
than me.</p><p>I am the humblest person on the earth.' And the ego can go on playing
the game. Just few days before, Pope Paul</p><p>Played the drama of being Jesus:</p><p>He carried the corss to a hill nearby the Vatican And thousands of
people followed him</p><p>And he touched the feet of a poor beggar Washed the feet and kissed
the feet -- And this is pure exhibitionism.</p><p>This is showing that 'Look, how humble am I. Nobody is more humble
than me.'</p><p>But it is all drama, it is only for the show. <em>Real</em>
humbleness comes as a gift from god. All that man can do is an effort to
understand The ways of the ego -- that's all.</p><p>One can watch how the ego functions</p><p>One can see its cunning and subtle strategies</p><p>Tactics, its trips,</p><p>And one can watch it in all possible ways.</p><p>And the miracle is: The more you become aware Of its strategies and
tricks and trips</p><p>The more and more those trips</p><p>And tricks and strategies start evaporating. Just be sheer awareness
this miracle happens And one day suddenly, there is no ego</p><p>And in that moment something from the beyond Descends in you as a
gift, just as a shower.</p><p>You cannot say 'I am humble,' you can simply say 'I am no more,
humbleness has happened.'</p><p>You cannot claim it as your own achievement. Meditation helps you</p><p>To become aware of the ways of the ego And then everything else can
be left to god.</p><p>(To William) -- Deva Yogen. Deva means divine; 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

moment; there is no particular Fixed moment for it to happen</p><p>Hence it is unpredictable -- it can happen right now. All that is
needed is the courage to drop the ego.</p><p>Whatsoever time one wants to take To gather courage to drop the ego
That is the time that the meeting</p><p>Has to be postponed for that time only. Once you are ready to drop
the ego</p><p>To lose your identity,</p><p>To say totally with the heart</p><p>'I am no more' -- suddenly, god is! It is a very strange meeting.</p><p>Ordinarily in a meeting two persons are needed. This is a very
strange meeting.</p><p>This meeting happens only when one is absent. If two are present it
never happens.</p><p>Of you are there and god is there Then it won't happen</p><p>Because you will be the barrier.</p><p>If you are not there then it happens. In your absence the barrier
falls The block disappears</p><p>Suddenly you are one with god</p><p>There is nothing to divide, nothing to separate. It is like a
dewdrop</p><p>Slipping from a lotus leaf into the lake. Be a dewdrop -- allow
yourself</p><p>To slip from the lotus leaf Don't cling to the lotus leaf. This
buddhafield is only a lake Sannyas is only a lotus leaf</p><p>You are a dewdrop on the lotus leaf Don't cling! Slip!</p><p>And go dancing, go singing, die into the lake! And immediately
<em>you</em> are no more but god is. And that's what you in reality

It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Paul) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Paul. Anand means bliss. Paul means rest.\nBliss it a by-product of relaxation, of rest. Misery comes out of tension. It is nothing but tension, anxiety, anguish. And just the opposite is bliss: When there is no tension in your being, when all is at rest, when you are not worried about the past, nor concerned about the future, when you are relaxed, utterly herenow, bliss arises on its own accord. One cannot achieve it, it is not a goal to be achieved. It is simply a by-product.\nEverybody seeks for bliss, hence everybody misses it, or almost everybody. Those who have found it can be counted on fingers, and they have found it not by making a goal of it but by dropping the very idea of a goal. Not by making an object of desire but by understanding desiring and seeing that desiring brings conflict, desiring brings tension, anxiety, misery. They drop desiring, and suddenly from all nooks and corners of existence bliss rushes towards you. It is your self-nature, not a goal to be achieved. When the achieving mind ceases, bliss is. When the achieving mind functions, bliss is not. That's the whole secret of all the religions, of all mysticism. If one can understand this simple secret there is nothing more to understand in life. It is enough -- this is a master key.\n(To Marjolijn) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Marjolijn. Deva means divine. Marjolijn is a form of Mary: it means fragrance. Your full name will mean: Divine fragrance.\nAs long as man is man, he stinks. Only when he surpasses humanity fragrance arises in him because to be a man means to be an egoist, to be a man means to be separate from the whole. And to transcend humanity means to dissolve into the whole, to surpass the ego. The moment you are one with the whole there is grat fragrance, infinite fragrance, eternal fragrance.\nMan is bound to remain in misery for the simple reason because he thinks in terms of his won identity, he thinks in term of separation, and remember: No man is an island. The think oneself separate from the whole is the only illusion. All other illusions arise out of it. We are part of the vast continent, we are not islands. To remember it is the only way to be transformed. We have not really to drop anything because the very idea of separation is false. It is just an idea, it is like somebody is calculating and goes on doing the same mistake again and again: Two plus two and he puts five. All that is needed is to understand that two plus two is not five; two plus two is four. Once it is understood everything becomes clear. This is just a mathematical error, a mistake. It arises because of certain reasons: We have separate bodies that gives the idea of separation. We have separate mind, that gives the idea of separation, but we are neither the body nor the mind. We are consciousnesses. The moment you start feeling yourself as a consciousness, then there is no separation , then two plus two is four; before that two plus two is everything except four. Sometimes it is three, sometimes it is five, but it is never four.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd to live in this illusion is bound to create problems and all those problems go on and on accumulating. They cannot be solved unless we change our very approach from the beginning. A radical change is needed not some reformation and that radical change happens when we drop our personality into the ocean of the god, when the dewdrop of the ego disappears into the ocean. We don't lose\nanything, we gain. We simply lose our small boundaries and we become vast and infinite. In that vastness is fragrance.\nTo live in an ego is to live in a very small dark hole -- it is ugly, it stinks. To be initiated as a sannyasin means taking the first step out of the cave of the ego into the open sky, under the stars. Suddenly you start growing wings. They have always been there but there was not space enough to use them. Sannyas gives you space, it gives you the whole sky. It makes you the infinite available and just a small price has to be paid: The false ego has to be dropped.\n(To David) -- Your name: Swami Anando David. Anando means bliss. David means beloved of god, beloved of Jehovah.\nWe are not aware at all that existence goes on pouring its love for us, in every possible way. Hence we remain ungrateful, hence we remain continuously complaining, hence prayer cannot arise in our hearts because prayer is nothing but another name for gratitude, for thankfulness. The complaining mind can never be religious, it is impossible for the complaining mind to be religious, because the complaining mind hat not become aware of a basic reality: that existence loves you, that it takes care of you, that your are befriended by the winds, by the rain, by the sun, by the moon. That whatever happens -- it may appear a curse to you, but it is never a curse, it is always a blessing. Maybe in the beginning it appears like a curse because our vision is very limited, our perspective is very small: We can't see the whole thing, we can't see all the implications of it, we can't see the whole series of events that will be followed by it. Otherwise we will always be grateful, we will always feel blessed.\nEven in death, a man who understand find tremendous thankfulness towards god because for him death is a rest for him. For him death is not the end of life but the beginning of a far greater like than this one.\nThis was just a rehearsal of the real life -- it was not real. Real drama starts after the death -- for those who understand. For those who don't understand they think the rehearsal is the real thing, and when the rehearsal end, they cry and weep and they cling and they don't want to leave it.\nEverything is a blessing!\nOne of the contemporary British philosophers C.E.M. Jode (sp. not checked) fell ill, very seriously ill.\nSomebody gave him a book of Georges Gurdjieff. He had come across Georges Gurdjieff's books before too, but he had never bothered about them. He had no time. He was more interested in academic philosophy\n-- Hegel, Kant and Bradley and people like that. And this man Gurdjieff looked almost a madman. But he was ill and nothing else to do, so he just started looking into the book by the way, to pass time and he became immensely interested. For the first time he had come across something really authentic. Hegel, Kant and Bradley -- those were only thinkers. This man knows! Each single word had the impact of tremendous authenticity and authority. This man was speaking like Jesus, like Buddha. He was not infering, he was simply sharing his experience. And that one month's seriousness transformed his whole being. Lying down on the bed he started meditating the way Gurdjieff proposes. Gurdjieff used to call meditation self-remembering: Whatsoever you do, do with deep remembering that you are doing it; don't forget yourself. Walking, remember that you are walking. Talking, remember that you are talking. Listening, remember that you are listening. Each act has also to be an act of remembrance. Lying down on the bed, tossing and turning he started remembering that 'I am lying on the bed,' that 'My head is aching,' that 'My back is aching.' There was nothing else to do -- he thought, 'Why not try what this man is saying?' And just trying those small ideas he became more and more intrigued.\nBy the time he was cured he was a different man. Just remembering he became aware that he is not the body at all. Then he used to say to his friends that, 'I had never been ill and I was very angry when I became ill because I have always followed all the rules and regulations that a man should follow who wants to be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalways healthy and still I fell ill and seriously ill -- I was almost on the deathbed. I started cursing god, I started doubting god. I started thinking that, \"This is all nonsense. Life is an accident and death is an accident, everything is an accident.\" But meditating I realized that this was a great gift from god. In my whole life I\nhave never been so blessed as this illness has proved.'\nThat's the meaning of David: God loves you, so whatever happens to you, feel grateful. Even sometimes when you find it very difficult to feel grateful, feel grateful, because you can be wrong, god cannot be wrong -- existence cannot be wrong.\nIf this climate -- that god loves you goes on deepening inside you , if this becomes your very being you will be reborn out of it. It will become a rebirth and that's what real sannyas is: a rebirth, a new perspective about things and life and existence, a new vision.\n(To Monika) -- Your name: Ma Monika. It is a tremendous beautiful name; it has two meanings. One comes from Greek, the other from Latin.\nThe first meaning is aloneness; not loneliness, remember, but aloneness. Loneliness is emptiness, aloneness is fullness. In loneliness you are missing the other, in aloneness you are enjoying yourself.\nAloneness is the most sacred experience of life.\nAnd the second meaning comes from Latin; through Latin it means a woman of wisdom. Wisdom can arise only if you know how to be alone. Wisdom is your self-nature. When you are absolutely alone when you have forgotten the whole world, when you are just yourself utterly blissful within yourself there is no need for the other, no hankering for the other, no desire for anything else. In that rest within one's being, wisdom arises. Wisdom does not mean knowledge. Wisdom means insight, wisdom means clarity. Wisdom does not mean information, wisdom means transformation. Wisdom means a totally new way of looking at life. Ant this is the whole of sannyas: to learn to be alone and to allow the wisdom to surface in your being.\nThen you can live in the world but then even in the crowd you will be alone unaffected, undistracted, unimpressed. You will be in the world but not of the world and you will have the capacity to see what is right and what is wrong. You will not depend on outside commandments. You will not depend on outside commandments. You will not depend on the Bible, on the Gita, on the Koran: You have found your own scripture, you have found god's voice within your own heart. Now there is no need to go for second-rate second-hand information. Now you have a direct line to god. That's the whole purpose of sannyas: To help you\nto be connected with god directly.\n(To Manuel) -- This is your name: Swami Ananto. Ananto means the infinite, another name for god.\nGod is indefinable, so no word is really adequate enough to describe him, but we have to use words This is one of the most beautiful word which comes very close in describing god. God is as infinite as the sky as unbounded as the whole universe. No boundaries, no limits -- and that's your nature too: god is your nature.\nGod is not something outside, not something that belongs to the existence. It is the centre of all, it is as much yours as it is anybody else. We are different on the circumference but we are one at the centre. No difference at all at the centre. Farther we go from the centre we start becoming different; we start becoming persons, we start gathering personality, we start becoming faces, masks. The closer we come to the centre the masks start disappearing, the personality starts evaporating, we start becoming one.\nThat's what I mean when I say: No man is an island. We are part of a vast continent, of an infinity, on an eternity, beginningless, endless. To know it brings great rejoicing, obviously, because to know it means there is no death, to know it means you have been here forever and you will be here forever. To know it means your inner purity is absolutely virgin, it has not been polluted. Thousands of lives have happened but it has not polluted to you. Those lives have been just dreams. You have dreamed many dreams in the night but in the morning you are not polluted by your dreams. You may have been a murderer in the dream or you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmay have been a mahatma in the dram -- it doesn't matter. whether you were a mahatma or a murderer, in the morning you find both were dreams, both were false and your reality has remained unaffected. Many stories we have lived, many dramas we have played. Many roles we have passed through, but this is the miracle that we are absolutely unaffected, we are virgin. Our inner purity is\nincorruptible.\nMeditation will give you a taste of that incorruptible purity, of that incorruptible innocence and from there, one can jump into the ultimate, into the infinite.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2363","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2363 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

something <em>really</em> authentic. Hegel, Kant and Bradley -- those
were only thinkers. This man <em>knows</em>! Each single word had the
impact of tremendous authenticity and authority. This man was speaking
like Jesus, like Buddha. He was not infering, he was simply sharing his
experience. And that one month's seriousness transformed his whole
being. Lying down on the bed he started meditating the way Gurdjieff
proposes. Gurdjieff used to call meditation self-remembering: Whatsoever
you do, do with deep remembering that you are doing it; don't forget
yourself. Walking, remember that you are walking. Talking, remember that
you are talking. Listening, remember that you are listening. Each act
has also to be an act of remembrance. Lying down on the bed, tossing and
turning he started remembering that 'I am lying on the bed,' that 'My
head is aching,' that 'My back is aching.' There was nothing else to do
-- he thought, 'Why not try what this man is saying?' And just trying
those small ideas he became more and more intrigued.</p><p>By the time he was cured he was a different man. Just remembering he
became aware that he is not the body at all. Then he used to say to his
friends that, 'I had never been ill and I was very angry when I became
ill because I have always followed all the rules and regulations that a
man should follow who wants to be 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

on the deathbed. I started cursing god, I started doubting god. I
started thinking that, "This is all nonsense. Life is an accident and
death is an accident, everything is an accident." But meditating I
realized that this was a great gift from god. In my whole life I</p><p>have never been so blessed as this illness has proved.'</p><p>That's the meaning of David: God loves you, so whatever happens to
you, feel grateful. Even sometimes when you find it very difficult to
feel grateful, feel grateful, because <em>you</em> can be wrong, god
cannot be wrong -- existence cannot be wrong.</p><p>If this climate -- that god loves you goes on deepening inside you ,
if this becomes your very being you will be reborn out of it. It will
become a rebirth and that's what real sannyas is: a rebirth, a new
perspective about things and life and existence, a new vision.</p><p>(To Monika) -- Your name: Ma Monika. It is a tremendous beautiful
name; it has two meanings. One comes from Greek, the other from
Latin.</p><p>The first meaning is aloneness; not loneliness, remember, but
aloneness. Loneliness is emptiness, aloneness is fullness. In loneliness
you are missing the other, in aloneness you are enjoying yourself.</p><p>Aloneness is the most sacred experience of life.</p><p>And the second meaning comes from Latin; through Latin it means a
woman of wisdom. Wisdom can arise only if you know how to be alone.
Wisdom is your self-nature. When you are absolutely alone when you have
forgotten the whole world, when you are just yourself utterly blissful
within yourself there is no need for the other, no hankering for the
other, no desire for anything else. In that rest within one's being,
wisdom arises. Wisdom does not mean knowledge. Wisdom means insight,
wisdom means clarity. Wisdom does not mean information, wisdom means
transformation. Wisdom means a totally new way of looking at life. Ant
this is the whole of sannyas: to learn to be alone and to allow the
wisdom to surface in your being.</p><p>Then you can live in the world but then even in the crowd you will be
alone unaffected, undistracted, unimpressed. You will be in the world
but not of the world and you will have the capacity to see what is right
and what is wrong. You will not depend on outside commandments. You will
not depend on outside commandments. You will not depend on the Bible, on
the Gita, on the Koran: You have found your own scripture, you have
found god's voice within your own heart. Now there is no need to go for
second-rate second-hand information. Now you have a direct line to god.
That's the whole purpose of sannyas: To help you</p><p>to be connected with god directly.</p><p>(To Manuel) -- This is your name: Swami Ananto. Ananto means the
infinite, another name for god.</p><p>God is indefinable, so no word is <em>really</em> adequate enough to
describe him, but we have to use words This is one of the most beautiful
word which comes very close in describing god. God is <em>as</em>
infinite <em>as</em> the sky as unbounded as the whole universe. No
boundaries, no limits -- and that's your nature too: god is your
nature.</p><p>God is not something outside, not something that belongs to the
existence. It is the centre of all, it is as much yours as it is anybody
else. We are different on the circumference but we are one at the
centre. No difference at all at the centre. Farther we go from the
centre we start becoming different; we start becoming persons, we start
gathering personality, we start becoming faces, masks. The closer we
come to the centre the masks start disappearing, the personality starts
evaporating, we start becoming one.</p><p>That's what I mean when I say: No man is an island. We are part of a
vast continent, of an infinity, on an eternity, beginningless, endless.
To know it brings great rejoicing, obviously, because to know it means
there is no death, to know it means you have been here forever and you
will be here forever. To know it means your inner purity is absolutely
virgin, it has not been polluted. Thousands of lives have happened but
it has not polluted to you. Those lives have been just dreams. You have
dreamed many dreams in the night but in the morning you are not polluted
by your dreams. You may have been a murderer in the dream or you

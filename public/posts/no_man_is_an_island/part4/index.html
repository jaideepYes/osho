It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Iris) -- Your name: Ma Iris. Iris is a beautiful Name; it means rainbow. In Greek mythology\nThe rainbow represents the messenger of gods Because it is a bridge between man and god.\nIt joins the earth and heaven And it is seven-colored.\nMan also has seven planes of being. Existence is seven-layered and the rainbow Connects existence in every dimension.\nMy sannyasin has to be a multi-colored\nMulti-dimensional person -- not one-dimensional.\nThe ancient idea of monks and nuns Was one-dimensional.\nthey were escapists, they were avoiding life. My sannyasin has to live in the life\nWith all its sweetness and bitterness With all its days and nights\nWith all its summers and winters. My sannyasin has to taste everything\nNothing has to be left untasted, unexperienced. Only when one experiences life in its totality One becomes aware of god; hence rainbow\nIs also symbolic of my approach towards life. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Hette) -- This is your name: Swami Veet Hette. Veet means going beyond. Hette is a dangerous name. It means dispute, conflict.\nAnd a sannyasin is to go beyond all dispute And beyond all conflict.\nPeople are continuously in dispute About everything:\nThey are in dispute with others They are in dispute with themselves, Quarreling is their very style of life. They are in conflict with others\nAnd they are in conflict with themselves. Even the so-called saints don't drop conflict. On the contrary; they escape from the world To escape from conflict with others.\nThat is easy -- you can escape from the world. And when there is nobody else to fight with Of course, you cannot fight with others\nBut then your whole energy turns upon yourself. Your whole violence turns upon yourself.\nHence the so-called saints Are more in inner conflict\nThan the ordinary people because\nThe ordinary people have at least a division. A major part of their life\nIs wasted in fighting with others.\nOnly a minor energy remains to fight with oneself Very little, not more than five per sent.\nBut the saint\nHas hundred per cent energy available And what to do with that energy?\nHe knows only one way\nAnd that is to put the energy into fight: He starts fighting with himself\nHe becomes destructive, self-destructive. He does violence to himself\nHe becomes a masochist, he tortures himself. And it is a very ugly fact of the history\nThat we have respected these pathological people For centuries.\nAnd of we respect these people, of course We try to imitate them.\nIf we respect them, they become our ideals. Somehow we would like to live\nTheir way of life one day.\nAnd whatsoever we can do in our own small way 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe try to do.\nMy sannyasin has to drop,\nNot the world, but conflict itself. He has to transform his energy From conflict into harmony From dispute into trust.\nLife is too short to waste it in dispute It is too short to waste it in fighting\nThis small bit of energy what we have got\nHas to be transformed into a celebration because Theirs is the kingdom of god.\nBut celebration is possible\nOnly when all conflict has been dropped. So don't fight with others\nAnd don't fight with yourself -- stop fighting! Start loving! Love is my message.\n(To Diethelm) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Diethelm. Deva means god or more exactly, godliness. Diethelm\nMeans protector.\nOr if ;you really want\nto be very close to the truth Then godliness is our protection.\nWe are continuously protected by divine energy In every possible way, because we are part of it. No man is an island -- separate, apart.\nWe are part of the whole, Intrinsic part of the whole. The whole takes every care Just we have to learn to trust. The more we trust\nThe more care flows from the whole. The more we distrust\nWe stop the care that was flowing towards us. Our distrust closes us, our trust opens us.\nIf we distrust we live in fear\nAnd we live in darkness and we live in misery. If we trust we live in joy, we live in bliss\nWe live in light; life becomes\nA non-serious affair, it becomes laughter.\nThen it has a beauty and tremendous grandeur And utter splendor, indescribable in words Inexpressible in language --\nIt can only be experienced.\nAnd the whole secret is in a single word 'trust'. Trust existence and you will be able\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo taste the greatest joys of your life The ultimate peaks of bliss.\n(To Wim) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Wim. Dhyan means meditation. Wim means resolution, Unwavering, absolute determination.\nMeditation is possible only\nWhen one takes a jump into absolute commitment. It is not possible\nIf you are only curious about it. It is possible only\nIf you risk everything, if you risk all.\nThe curious person cannot risk anything. He simply wants to know\nBut he does not want to get involved. He wants to know from the outside.\nHe does not want to become a participant Because to become a participant is risky. First he wants to become sure.\nOne cannot move into the world of meditation in a lukewarm way.\nOne has to boil at the hundred degree heat Only then there is evaporation.\nAnd meditation is a kind of evaporation. You evaporate. What is left is totally\nSomething new that you had never known before That it ever existed\nYou had not even suspected about it. The old is gone, completely gone\nAnd something absolutely new has arrived. There is a discontinuity.\nIt is not continuous with the old that's why I call Meditation is the only revolution.\nAll other revolutions are only called revolutions, They are reformations.\nThey are just renovating the old building. Meditation is dismantling the whole old building And creating a totally new house, totally new Which has no connection with the old.\nIt does not even resemble with the old.\nFor that certainly, great resolution is needed. When the intensity is total\nMeditation can happen in a single moment. Sannyas means you are becoming committed 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYour are becoming involved\nYou are no more a spectator now, Your are becoming a participant\nIn a tremendous journey of the unknown. Even the courage to become a sannyasin Is something very precious because it is\nThe most significant decision of one's life.\nIt is an effort to change the mundane into sacred. (To Ilene) -- This is your name: Ma Devagarbha. Devagarbha means pregnant with god.\nEverybody is pregnant with god -- We may know, we may not know but god exists in us as a potentiality.\nWe can make it a reality any time we decide. It is only a question of deciding\nOf being decisive.\nA wavering mind can't help\nOtherwise one moment one thinks one thing Another moment one thinks another thing.\nA rabbi was being interviewed. The old rabbi has died\nAnd the synagogue needed a new rabbi. The committee asked the rabbi,\n'Are you capable of taking decisions?' He said, 'Sometimes yes, sometimes no.' But that's how the mind works.\nSannyas is something of the heart\nNot of the mind.\nWhen it is of the mind it is of no value When it is of the heart\nIt is the most valuable thing in life Because when it is of the heart\nYou start moving towards transforming Your potential into the actual\nYou start becoming more and more aware Of what you are and what you can be.\nEvery being, howsoever fast asleep and snoring Is a god incarnate:\nHe needs only a little awakening Just a little shaking\nA little cold water thrown into his eyes. But the ultimate decision is always yours. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI can throw cold water in your eyes -- That's what I go on doing.\nAnd in a winter morning it hurts\nAnd nobody want to get up: One wants to have A little more sleep, just few minutes,\nAnd the mind goes on postponing.\nFew minutes more -- that's how we have lived For many lives -- postponing, postponing.\nWe have not lived\nWe have been only postponing life.\nBy becoming a sannyasins one is taking a decision That 'Now no more postponement.\nWe want to live right now.\nWe want to transform our being this very moment And we are bent upon it. And this can happen\nOnly though your own decision. Outer help is possible\nBut without inner decision, no help is of any help Because a person may be awake\nAnd still may continue to hide behind the blanket Keep his eyes closed.\nAnd it is easy to wake up a man who is asleep It is very difficult to wake up a man\nWho is awake and pretending to be asleep. It is almost impossible.\nAnd this happens many time to sannyasins: when they wake up for the first time\nThey don't want to recognize the fact So they go on keeping their eyes closed. They go on hoping that those dreams\nThat have disappeared, may come back again. They were beautiful dreams, sweet dreams.\nThey toss and turn, they pull the blanket They go underneath the blanket\nThey pretend that they are fast asleep They pretend to snore.\nBut once you are a sannyasin I am really after you.\nSo be aware of it from the very beginning.\n(To Angelo) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Punito. Deva means divine; Punito means purity -- divine purity. It is achieved when you have accepted\nThe failure of all human effort. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen you have accepted that\n'There is no way for me to know the truth, ' that 'Whatsoever I do is bound to go wrong,' Because the doer itself is the greatest fallacy And anything that comes out of the ego --\nAnd that is our doer --\nLeads into more and more fallacies. When this is recognized\nWhen this is clearly seen, one stops all efforts One becomes still, effortless\nOne stops all searching, all seeking And when everything is still\nSomething from the beyond descends in our being Floods our being.\nThat is divine purity, that is divine bliss. There are thousand and one names for it You can call it enlightenment, salvation God realization, self-realization\nBut one thing is absolutely certain That man has to accept his total failure Only then surrender happens.\nIn that surrender the ego disappears. And out of that surrender is victory.\n(To Roberto) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Sagaro. Deva means divine. Sagaro means ocean.\nMan appears from the outside Just like a small drop\nbut from the inside he is totally different. The inside view is that of an ocean.\nFrom the outside we appear like small dewdrops Because only our body is visible.\nBut from the inside when one is rooted And centered into one's being\nWhen in deep silence the clarity happens When in deep meditation\nOne is able to seek uncloudedly\nWhen all smoke of desires and thoughts disappears When the mirror is absolutely clean\nAnd it reflects that ;which is, then suddenly\nOne becomes aware of one's consciousness Not of one's body.\nIn fact one forgets one's body in that moment. Not only the body, but the mind is also forgotten. In that moment one comes to know\nThe unbounded consciousness. That unbounded consciousness 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat oceanic consciousness, is our true being That's what we are. We are not what we appear. So don't be deceived by the appearance\nDon't decide by looking in the mirror who you are Because the mirror can only reflect the physical.\nYou will have to cleanse the inner mirror\nAnd then only you will know how vast you are. You are as vast as the universe itself.\nThat's why Jesus says, 'I and my father are one.' That is a very old way of saying.\nIn the East mystics have used\nFar more contemporary language. The Upanishadas say, 'Thou art that.'\nMansoor says, 'I am the truth, I am God.' And he does not mean the ordinary I. That I is left behind, log before; in fact\nMansoor is not saying anything on his own. It is god himself declaring through him\nIt is the ocean itself roaring.\nOf course the ocean roars though the waves There is no other way for the ocean\nTo express itself.\nAll the mystics are just waves in the ocean Different waves, different expressions\nBut the message is the same.\nThat is the meaning of your name.\nYou have to make it also your experience.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #5\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2265","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2265 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

determination.</p><p>Meditation is possible only</p><p>When one takes a jump into absolute commitment. It is not
possible</p><p>If you are only curious about it. It is possible only</p><p>If you risk everything, if you risk all.</p><p>The curious person cannot risk anything. He simply wants to know</p><p>But he does not want to get involved. He wants to know from the
outside.</p><p>He does not want to become a participant Because to become a
participant is risky. First he wants to become sure.</p><p>One cannot move into the world of meditation in a lukewarm way.</p><p>One has to boil at the hundred degree heat Only then there is
evaporation.</p><p>And meditation is a kind of evaporation. You evaporate. What is left
is totally</p><p>Something new that you had never known before That it ever
existed</p><p>You had not even suspected about it. The old is gone, completely
gone</p><p>And something absolutely new has arrived. There is a
discontinuity.</p><p>It is not continuous with the old that's why I call Meditation is the
only revolution.</p><p>All other revolutions are only called revolutions, They are
reformations.</p><p>They are just renovating the old building. Meditation is dismantling
the whole old building And creating a totally new house, totally new
Which has no connection with the old.</p><p>It does not even resemble with the old.</p><p>For that certainly, great resolution is needed. When the intensity is
total</p><p>Meditation can happen in a single moment. Sannyas means you are
becoming committed 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

sannyasin Is something very precious because it is</p><p>The most significant decision of one's life.</p><p>It is an effort to change the mundane into sacred. (To Ilene) -- This
is your name: Ma Devagarbha. Devagarbha means pregnant with god.</p><p>Everybody is pregnant with god -- We may know, we may not know but
god exists in us as a potentiality.</p><p>We can make it a reality any time we decide. It is only a question of
deciding</p><p>Of being decisive.</p><p>A wavering mind can't help</p><p>Otherwise one moment one thinks one thing Another moment one thinks
another thing.</p><p>A rabbi was being interviewed. The old rabbi has died</p><p>And the synagogue needed a new rabbi. The committee asked the
rabbi,</p><p>'Are you capable of taking decisions?' He said, 'Sometimes yes,
sometimes no.' But that's how the mind works.</p><p>Sannyas is something of the heart</p><p>Not of the mind.</p><p>When it is of the mind it is of no value When it is of the heart</p><p>It is the most valuable thing in life Because when it is of the
heart</p><p>You start moving towards transforming Your potential into the
actual</p><p>You start becoming more and more aware Of what you are and what you
can be.</p><p>Every being, howsoever fast asleep and snoring Is a god
incarnate:</p><p>He needs only a little awakening Just a little shaking</p><p>A little cold water thrown into his eyes. But the ultimate decision
is always yours. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

just few minutes,</p><p>And the mind goes on postponing.</p><p>Few minutes more -- that's how we have lived For many lives --
postponing, postponing.</p><p>We have not lived</p><p>We have been only postponing life.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasins one is taking a decision That 'Now no more
postponement.</p><p>We want to live right now.</p><p>We want to transform our being <em>this</em> very moment And we are
bent upon it. And this can happen</p><p>Only though your own decision. Outer help is possible</p><p>But without inner decision, no help is of any help Because a person
may be awake</p><p>And still may continue to hide behind the blanket Keep his eyes
closed.</p><p>And it is easy to wake up a man who is asleep It is very difficult to
wake up a man</p><p>Who is awake and pretending to be asleep. It is almost
impossible.</p><p>And this happens many time to sannyasins: when they wake up for the
first time</p><p>They don't want to recognize the fact So they go on keeping their
eyes closed. They go on hoping that those dreams</p><p>That have disappeared, may come back again. They were beautiful
dreams, sweet dreams.</p><p>They toss and turn, they pull the blanket They go underneath the
blanket</p><p>They pretend that they are fast asleep They pretend to snore.</p><p>But once you are a sannyasin I am <em>really</em> after you.</p><p>So be aware of it from the very beginning.</p><p>(To Angelo) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Punito. Deva means
divine; Punito means purity -- divine purity. It is achieved when you
have accepted</p><p>The failure of all human effort. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>When you have accepted that</p><p>'There is no way for me to know the truth, ' that 'Whatsoever I do is
bound to go wrong,' Because the doer itself is the greatest fallacy And
anything that comes out of the ego --</p><p>And that is our doer --</p><p>Leads into more and more fallacies. When this is recognized</p><p>When this is clearly seen, one stops all efforts One becomes still,
effortless</p><p>One stops all searching, all seeking And when everything is still</p><p>Something from the beyond descends in our being Floods our being.</p><p>That is divine purity, that is divine bliss. There are thousand and
one names for it You can call it enlightenment, salvation God
realization, self-realization</p><p>But one thing is absolutely certain That man has to accept his total
failure Only then surrender happens.</p><p>In that surrender the ego disappears. And out of that surrender is
victory.</p><p>(To Roberto) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Sagaro. Deva means
divine. Sagaro means ocean.</p><p>Man appears from the outside Just like a small drop</p><p>but from the inside he is totally different. The inside view is that
of an ocean.</p><p>From the outside we appear like small dewdrops Because only our body
is visible.</p><p>But from the inside when one is rooted And centered into one's
being</p><p>When in deep silence the clarity happens When in deep meditation</p><p>One is able to seek uncloudedly</p><p>When all smoke of desires and thoughts disappears When the mirror is
absolutely clean</p><p>And it reflects that ;which is, then suddenly</p><p>One becomes aware of one's consciousness Not of one's body.</p><p>In fact one forgets one's body in that moment. Not only the body, but
the mind is also forgotten. In that moment one comes to know</p><p>The unbounded consciousness.

are not what we appear. So don't be deceived by the appearance</p><p>Don't decide by looking in the mirror who you are Because the mirror
can only reflect the physical.</p><p>You will have to cleanse the inner mirror</p><p>And then only you will know how vast you are. You are as vast as the
universe itself.</p><p>That's why Jesus says, 'I and my father are one.' That is a very old
way of saying.</p><p>In the East mystics have used</p><p>Far more contemporary language. The Upanishadas say, 'Thou art
that.'</p><p>Mansoor says, 'I am the truth, I am God.' And he does not mean the
ordinary I. That I is left behind, log before; in fact</p><p>Mansoor is not saying anything on his own. It is god himself
declaring through him</p><p>It is the ocean itself roaring.</p><p>Of course the ocean roars though the waves There is no other way for
the ocean</p><p>To express itself.</p><p>All the mystics are just waves in the ocean Different waves,
different expressions</p><p>But the message is the same.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name.</p><p>You have to make it also your experience.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #5</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

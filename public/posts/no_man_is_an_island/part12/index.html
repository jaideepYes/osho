It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Gertie) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Gertie. Anand means bliss. Gertie means courageous spirit. Bliss is only for the courageous\nThe cowards live in misery;\nThey have to, because they cling to misery. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThey think misery clings to them -- That is sheer nonsense.\nMisery has no interest in anybody but They are cowardly people\nThey cannot let go of anything Even though it is misery.\nThey think, at least it is familiar and they are Afraid of the unfamiliar, of the unknown.\nCourage simply means one thing:\nBeing in love with the unknown. And that is the way of the sannyasin:\nAlways being ready to go into the unknown Always ready to leave the known behind.\nThen life becomes moment to moment bliss And the bliss goes on\nReaching higher and higher peaks Because there is no end to the unknown. It is not exhaustible\nHence bliss is inexhaustible.\n(To Agnes) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Agnes. Deva means divine. Agnes means gentleness.\nGentleness is one of the most divine qualities Because the first requirement for being gentle\nIt to drop the ego -- ego is never gentle.\nEgo is always aggressive, it cannot be gentle. It is never humble\nIt is impossible for it to be humble.\nIts whole project crumbles if it becomes humble. And gentle is the way to reach to god.\nOne should be more like water than like a rock And remember always: In the long run\nThe water becomes victorious over the rock. One should be feminine rather than masculine. To be feminine is to be gentle\nHence even if a man becomes gentle He starts having the grace of a woman.\nAnd if the woman becomes hard, aggressive Violent, then she loses all gentleness\nShe becomes masculine. Friedrich Nietzsche\nHas condemned Jesus and Buddha as feminine. I don't condemn them but I agree with him: They were really so gentle\nThat it is absolutely true to call them feminine.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI take it as a compliment, not as a condemnation. A sannyasin has to be gentle.\nHe is not a soldier, he is not a rock.\nHe is water; his way is the watercourse way.\n(To James) -- This is your name: Swami Samarpan James.\nSamarpan means surrender, total surrender, a state of Ultimate let-go. And James means god is our protector.\nBut only a man of deep surrender Knows that god is our protector. If you are not surrendered\nYou can never come to know that beautiful truth. The unsurrendered man tries to protect himself, Obviously, there is nobody else to protect him He is alone and\nHe has to struggle and fight against everybody: Against nature, against society.\nHis whole life is a struggle to survive.\nCharles Darwin says\nThe whole history of life on the earth Is nothing but the struggle for survival And the fittest survive.\nSo you have not only to be fighting continuously You have to prove your mettle.\nYou have to be more aggressive than others You have to be more cunning than others You have to be more destructive than others, Only then you can succeed.\nCharles Darwin knew nothing of surrender. He has seen only the superficial history of life He has not looked into the depths.\nThere have been people\nLike Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu\nWho have lived without any struggle With no idea to survive\nWho were ready to die any moment\nWho were so surrendered to the whole that There was no question to protect themselves Or to fight for their protection\nOr even to fight for their existence, yet They lived the highest quality of life They reached the ultimate pinnacle of joy. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBertrand Russell says\nThere are three struggles in life.\nOne is with nature; science arises out of it. Another is with society;\nSociology, morality, ethics, these arise out of it. And the third is\nThe struggle of man with his own instincts; Out of that struggle religion arises.\nNow he has explained everything With a single idea of struggle.\nThese is no need for any concept, for any Hypothesis for surrender in his vision of life But his vision of life is not of much depth.\nIt is the same: It is really nothing but\nA reinterpretation of the Darwinian hypothesis. Bertrand Russell also lived\nWithout knowing anything of meditation. Meditation's whole secret is surrender, trust And then a totally different dimension opens up. Suddenly you know god protects you\nYou are safe, you have always been safe You were unnecessarily struggling.\nThere was no need to struggle\nYou were simply wasting your energy.\nYou would have rejoiced with the same energy. You would have danced with the same energy. Your life would have been\nA beautiful flowering and a fragrance With the same energy\nThat you wasted in fighting, all kinds of fights.\n(To Detlef) -- This is your name: Swami Veet Detlef. Veet means go beyond, transcend, surpass. Detlef Means the son of the people.\nSannyas is a rebellion:\nRebellion against the mass psychology\nRebellion against conventions, traditions Rebellion against all that is old and rotten, And the people represent the old, the rotten. They live by it, that is their way of life.\nThey live in superstitions All kinds of superstitions.\nThey call those superstitions religions:\nThey may be Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, Jews -- it makes no difference. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJust different traditions, different superstitions But superstitions all the same.\nDifferent traditions\nBut traditionalism is the same. Different conventions\nBut the mind of a conventionalist is the same. They are all conformists\nThey cling to the status quo, the established.\nThey are not courageous enough to be individuals. So from this moment\nYou are no more son of the people but son of god. Enough is enough -- be finished with the people! Get out of the crowd and start living on your own According to your own light.\nIt is going into danger\nIt is going into insecurity\nBut tremendous is the joy of danger And great is the adventure of insecurity. Only those few fortunate ones grow Who dare to drop out of the crowd.\nJesus, Buddha, Zarathustra These are all dropouts\nOtherwise Jews are not so bad people: They would not have crucified Jesus. He must have become really dangerous:\nDangerous to the very structure of the society Dangerous to all the values that\nThe rabbis have lived for centuries.\nIf they decided to kill Jesus, he must have\nProvided all kinds of reasons for them. Ordinarily they are not that bad people Because before Jesus\nThey have not done anything like that And since Jesus also\nThey have not done anything like that. Jesus just have travelled really Towards individuality, total freedom. I call Jesus a real sannyasin.\nAnd so is the case with Buddha\nAnd Zarathustra and Lao Tzu, all the great ones They have not followed the masses.\nTo follow the mass, to follow the crowd\nIs to remain stupid, is to remain adjusted to The lowest intelligence\nThe lowest strata of the society.\nIf you really want to be a peak of intelligence You have to be all alone.\nSo from this moment drop that idea Of being a song of the people 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTranscend that very idea.\n(To Diane) -- This is your name: Ma Swargo. Swargo means paradise.\nWe have never lost paradise We are still in paradise because There is nowhere else to go;\nJust we have fallen asleep and we have started Dreaming thousands of other things --\nThey are all dreams.\nSomebody is dreaming he is a tiger And somebody is dreaming he is a dog And somebody is dreaming he is a man\nAnd somebody is dreaming something else But these are all dreams.\nThe moment you wake up\nYou are nothing but a drop of god. And a drop of god\nIs as much godly as the whole of god.\nIf you can understand a single dewdrop You have understood all the oceans Because it contains the whole secret.\nIf you can understand the formula H20 And that formula contains all the oceans,\nNot only of this earth; wherever water exists That formula contains in miniature\nThe whole of god.\nBut that awareness comes only through\nA constant persistent effort for awakening. That's what sannyas is all about.\nIt is not learning a new philosophy\nIt is learning a new way of being conscious. All that we know up to now\nIs only ways of how to fall asleep How to remain asleep\nHow to make your sleep more comfortable That's all.\nOur education, our society, they all teach us How to remain comfortably asleep.\nThe more comfortably asleep you are\nThe more in a coma you are.\nTo be in contact with a master means 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nA disturbance.\nOuspensky has dedicated one of his books To George Gurdjieff, his master.\nIn his dedication he says\n'To Georges Gurdjieff, my master\nThe disturber of my sleep and dreams.' A master has, out of necessity\nTo disturb your dreams and your sleep.\nSo only very few, chosen few, who have guts Can remain with the master\nOtherwise others escape.\nThose who are seeking consolation This is not the place for them.\nThose who are seeking awakening Then this is the place for them.\nThis may be the only place right now Upon the whole earth\nWhere awakening is possible. Consolation is available anywhere\nThousands of people are offering consolation. So let that decision\nTake a deep root in your heart:\nThat this is a decision to wake up\nAnd whatsoever the risk and whatsoever the cost. Once you have become absolutely decisive\nIt is not difficult, but all depends on you. I can help, I can show the way\nBut you have to follow it.\nThe Buddhas can only show the way.\n(To Joe) -- This is your name: Swami Anutoshen. Anutoshen means deep, deep contentment.\nA sannyasin has to learn A very paradoxical thing:\nHe has to be utterly discontented With the outside life: With the society With the state, with the church\nWith all that is established\nAnd he has to be at the same time, Utterly contented with himself.\nIf you are discontented with the outside And contented with yourself\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nA revolution starts happening.\nPeople are living just the other way round: They are contented with the society\nWith the established values,\nThey are discontent with themselves; Continuously condemning themselves Continuously devaluating themselves. It has to be changed.\nLove yourself, respect yourself. Unless you love and respect yourself You cannot enquire withinwards\nYou cannot penetrate the inner mystery.\nThe doors open only\nFor those who are in deep love with themselves. And you can move in your interiority only if you Have become utterly frustrated with the outside. If some hope is still there\nYou will linger upon; you will say, 'Let us try this, let us try that.\nMaybe something still can happen; I may still Get some joy, some bliss from the outside.' Be utterly hopeless about the outside.\nThere is no hope. When you have\nCompletely become hopeless about the outside then The energy starts turning in on its own accord, There is nowhere else to go!\nYou are no more interested In money, power, prestige\nThen your whole energy turns in And that turning in is sannyas That turning in is meditation.\nAnd once you have tasted your own being\nThen life is a sheer joy, an utter beauty A tremendous benediction.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #13\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2080","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2080 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

moment</p><p>You are no more son of the people but son of god. Enough is enough --
be finished with the people! Get out of the crowd and start living on
your own According to your own light.</p><p>It is going into danger</p><p>It is going into insecurity</p><p>But tremendous is the joy of danger And great is the adventure of
insecurity. Only those few fortunate ones grow Who dare to drop out of
the crowd.</p><p>Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra These are all dropouts</p><p>Otherwise Jews are not so bad people: They would not have crucified
Jesus. He must have become <em>really</em> dangerous:</p><p>Dangerous to the very structure of the society Dangerous to all the
values that</p><p>The rabbis have lived for centuries.</p><p>If they decided to kill Jesus, he must have</p><p>Provided all kinds of reasons for them. Ordinarily they are not that
bad people Because before Jesus</p><p>They have not done anything like that And since Jesus also</p><p>They have not done anything like that. Jesus just have travelled
<em>really</em> Towards individuality, total freedom. I call Jesus a
real sannyasin.</p><p>And so is the case with Buddha</p><p>And Zarathustra and Lao Tzu, all the great ones They have not
followed the masses.</p><p>To follow the mass, to follow the crowd</p><p>Is to remain stupid, is to remain adjusted to The lowest
intelligence</p><p>The lowest strata of the society.</p><p>If you really want to be a peak of intelligence You have to be all
alone.</p><p>So from this moment drop that idea Of being a song of the people

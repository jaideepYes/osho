The only freedom is the freedom from the mind.\nAll other freedoms are false. Political, economical, ideological -- They are simply changing\nFrom one prison into another.\nWhile you are changing it looks like freedom The newness of the new prison, the novelty of it Gives you a sense of freedom but\nSoon one realizes that one is trapped again.\nThis has been the whole history Of human revolutions.\nThe very few people who have attained freedom Are those who have attained by dropping the mind; Becoming absolutely silent is freedom.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLiving out of that silence is freedom.\n(To Ivan) -- This is your name: Swami Prem Ivan. Prem means love. Ivan means god's gracious gift. Love is the greatest gift of god\nBut we go on carrying it as a potential,\nWe never actualize it; the seed remains a seed. We never help it to grow into a tree\nWe never work hard to bring it to flowering Hence the misery of life.\nThe blissful person is one Who has bloomed, blossomed Whose love is released\nWhose love has become a fragrance Who has expressed his heart\nWho has sung his song.\n(To Anna) -- Your name: Ma Anna. Anna means prayer. God has no language\nExcept the language of silence, so if you talk In Hebrew or in Arabic or in Sanskrit\nYou are wasting your time -- he won't understand. There are three thousand languages on the earth And scientists say there are at least\nFifty thousand earths where life\nHas evolved almost to the same point as here. So you can think how many languages\nThere must be in the whole universe. To talk to god is stupid.\nAnd by prayer it has been always thought That you have to say something --\nThat is absolutely wrong: You have to learn To be silent, in a deep surrender\nAnd unsaid thankfulness, unuttered love, That is prayer.\nSay it and you have to destroy it Say it and you have to falsify it.\nSay it and you have to make it mundane. Leave it unsaid, unmanifested\nBecause god is unmanifest. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf you can leave your love For existence unmanifest\nThen there is immediate communion And that communion is prayer.\nTo me, meditation and prayer are not different They are two names for the same phenomenon. Be silent --\nYou can call it meditation, you can call it prayer But learn to be silent,\nLearn to listen to existence.\nRather than talking to god, listen to him! And he is speaking:\nThrough the wind passing through the pine trees And the sound of running water\nAnd the fragrance of flowers And the songs of the birds -- These are all his messages.\nOn each leaf is his signature\nThe whole existence it his scripture. Learn to be silent, learn how to listen\nThankfully, gratefully, in a deep trust and love And then you will know what prayer is.\nIt is a very subtle phenomenon\nIt is a flame in the heart, a light in the heart A radiance in the heart, a dance in the heart! (To Helga) -- This is your name: Ma Helga Helga means holy.\nBut the word 'holy'\nHas been misused by the priests for centuries. They have made it synonymous\nWith the virtuous, the pious, the religious -- It is not synonymous with those words.\nIt is a far bigger phenomenon.\nPiousness, religiousness, virtuousness Are simply few aspects of holiness.\nThey are not synonymous with it Just few fragments of it.\nHoliness really means wholeness; A person who is whole is holy.\nA person who lives life in its wholeness is holy. Your saints are not holy -- they may be religious They may be very virtuous, they may be pious But they are not holy because\nTheir life is a very paralysed life 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nCrippled life, one-dimensional. They don't live life in its totality. They reject much\nThey choose only few parts of life and they try To remain confined to those few parts.\nThey are choosers\nAnd a chooser can never be holy. To be holy means\nTo live in a choiceless awareness And to live life in all its colors In all its possibilities.\nOne has to be a rainbow, all the seven colors. One has to live\nAll the sweetness and the bitterness\nThe days and the nights, the good and the bad. A really whole person\nIs as much a saint as he is a sinner Because he is whole!\nThe sinner is not whole, the saint is not whole They are partial, they have chosen.\nThey are against each other: What the saint has chosen The sinner has rejected What the sinner has chosen\nThe saint has rejected\nBut the whole person does not reject because To reject anything is to reject god\nBecause god is total: to really love god One needs courage, the guts\nTo live life in its wholeness without any choice And that's what I teach here.\nMy sannyasin has to be really holy Holy in the sense of wholeness.\n(To Heidi) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Heidi. Dhyan means meditation. Heidi means nobleness. Nobleness arises out of meditation\nIt has nothing to do with birth.\nIt certainly has to do something with a new birth Not the ordinary birth but a birth\nThat happens inside you though meditation. When the mind dies, the ego dies\nAnd you are born anew, egoless Mindless, as pure consciousness, then\nThe fragrance of that consciousness is nobleness; Then your life has a beauty, a grace of its own.\nIt radiates peace\nIt creates an atmosphere around it of bliss. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe very presence of such a person Brings a climate of joy.\nWherever he goes spring follows him -- That is true nobleness.\n(To Michael) -- Your name: Swami Michael. Michael means godly.\nEveryone is godly\nBut very few people are aware of the fact. People are fast asleep\nAnd dreaming all kinds of things. In their dreams\nThey have become something else than they are. The dream is a distraction from your nature\nThe dream\nAlways takes you away from where you are. Have you watched this quality of the dream? -- If you are sleeping in a room\nYou never dream of the same room -- never.\nI have observed thousands of people's dreams: They never dream of the same room, the same bed\nThe same woman they are sleeping with -- never. They may be on the moon\nThey may be even on the sun, but they can't Be in the same room where they are sleeping. They may be with Sophia Loren\nBut not with the woman they are sleeping with. And they may be elephants, lions, centipedes Anything -- but never the person they are.\nThat is one of the basic quality of a dream that It takes you away from where you are\nIt distracts you from your nature. That's why very few people\nAre aware of their godliness Otherwise everyone is a god.\nWe come from god, we are born out of him\nWe are part of him, we can't be alive without him. He is our life, he is our breath\nHe is our heartbeat, but we are absolutely unaware. To be a sannyasin means\nA tremendous effort to wake up\nSo that you can know who you are.\nAnd the day it is known Your life is transformed. You live in the same world 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut you are no more the same\nHence the world is no more the same. Right now it is all misery and a night mare Once you are awake it is paradise\nThe very paradise; suddenly you know That Adam and Eve never left paradise\nThey had only fallen asleep and started dreaming That they had been expelled.\nIt is a dream that the serpent has persuaded Eve That 'Eat this apple.'\nNow how apple can take you out of paradise? I have been eating so many apples, just to see Whether it can drive me out of paradise.\nIt has not done anything of that sort!\nAfter at least thirty years of experimentation I can tell you: That is all nonsense!\nThey dreamt, otherwise serpents don't speak. But in dreams everything is possible Serpents speak. It is only a dream story.\nAdam and Eve are still in paradise because There is nowhere else to go.\nEven if god wants to expel, where will he expel? The whole is full of him, the whole belongs to him There is no other place.\nThere is no place where he is not. So everywhere is paradise\nAll that is needed is an awakening And that can easily be done.\nVery small devices can help, mm? Just an alarm clock can do it.\nAll techniques of meditation Are nothing but alarm clocks Simple devices to wake you up.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- Ten days more, then I leave.\n-- Try to wake up! (much laughter) And if you cannot then come back again! Good!\n(To Eckhard) -- Your name: Swami Eckhard. Eckhard means courageous spirit.\nThat is the only requirement\nFor being a sannyasin -- nothing else is required. I don't ask you to be virtuous\nA man of great character, moral, pious; I simply ask one thing:\nIf you are courageous enough Then everything is possible, Even the impossible is possible. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nCourage is the most fundamental religious value Although it has never been accepted like that.\nOn the contrary, all the religions Have exploited man's cowardice: They make you afraid\nAnd once you are trembling in fear\nYou are easily exploitable, manipulatable. Then the priests\nCan take you under their protections\nAnd they can say, 'Son, don't be worried -- We will protect you, we will pray for you.\nYou just follow what we say, you do what we say And we will see that you reach heaven.\nIf you don't follow us,\nIf you don't listen to us, you will fall into hell.' And they have depicted hell so colorfully that Anybody will become afraid.\nAnd they have described heaven so beautifully It creates greed.\nHell creates fear, heaven creates greed. And between these two the whole humanity Has been reduced into a spiritual slavery.\nMy sannyasin is not a spiritual slave He is a rebel.\nReligion has nothing to do with slavery It is pure rebellion; hence I say\nCourageousness is\nThe most fundamental quality.\nAnd we need now courageous people in the world So that they can destroy all these strategies Which are rooted in man's consciousness.\nThey have exploited humanity so long, it is time That it all should be stopped\nAnd stopped forever.\n(To Nelly) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Nelly. Anand means bliss. Nelly means a vigilant spirit.\nBliss is a by-product of awareness, of vigilance. Vigilance is the very essence of meditation; one has to be watchful, alert, awake. The watchfulness has to go slowly slowly deeper. First be watchful of your actions, that means watchfulness of your body -- walking, sitting, lying down, taking a shower. In all the gestures of the body you should keep a little alertness, of what is happening, of what you are doing. And you will be surprised, as you become watchful your actions take on a new quality; they become graceful, they are no more hurried. They start radiating a certain peace, a certain joy. And then the second watchfulness is about the thoughts, what thoughts are moving in the mind. No effort to interfere, no need to stop, no need to fight, just remain vigilant -- that is awareness of the mind. And if the first becomes possible, the second is not difficult; but start from the first.\nMany people start from the second and find it very difficult -- it is natural. If you start from the second it will be difficult. One should start from the gross and then go on to the subtle and then to the subtlest. When you have become capable of being vigilant of thoughts, you will be surprised, they are disappearing. The more you become aware the less they are. When you are perfectly aware, they simply evaporate, a silence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nprevails. Bodily actions become graceful when you become watchful and when you become watchful of the mind, mind becomes utterly non-existential. All turmoil ceases. There is pure silence, a soundless silence.\nThen turn to your feelings, the subtlest; your emotions, your sentiments. Then become vigilant of them.\nThese are the three watchfulnesses and if one can become watchful of all these three then the fourth happens on its own accord -- that you have not to do. When you succeed in all these three, the fourth is the reward: you become aware of your being. That is a gift from god, that is self-realization. Watching your feelings, feelings will also disappear. And when there are no thoughts and no feelings then you are only body and being. These two are realities: body belongs to the earth and the being belongs to the beyond.\nThese are two realities, they cannot disappear. Thoughts and feelings are just by- products, epiphenomena; they are not realities they are both shadows, so both disappear. Body remains but now it is very graceful; being resides in the body and the body becomes the temple of the being. Now you know the body will die.\nBut you die gracefully and you know also that your being is undying so there is no fear left.\nMake your name your sadhana, your very practise, your very spiritual effort. (To Thomas) -- This is your name: Swami Atmanand.\nAtmanand means self is bliss. Bliss is not something outside you It is your very nature.\nHence it has not to be achieved It has only to be discovered.\nIt is already the case\nJust you have to dig within your own being. You have to go inwards and you will find it. Right now it is there\nJust a connection has to be made A bridge has be created.\nAnd all the meditations are nothing but bridges; Bridges between you and your own self.\nOnce this is understood\nThat bliss is not somewhere outside Your life takes a radical change\nYour search becomes inner, otherwise\nPeople are running after money, power, prestige Hoping that by attaining these things\nThey will find bliss - they will not find anything They will only find\nThat their whole life has been a wastage. With the same effort they would have arrived At the very kingdom of god.\n(To Heidi) -- This is your name: Ma Devi. Devi means goddess.\nOne has to be reminded\nThat one is a god or a goddess.\nIt is only a question of remembering\nIt is not something that you have to become. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou are that from the very beginning You have never been otherwise.\nThe function of the master is to remind you\nTo help you to be aware of the fact that you are. The master is not to indoctrinate you\nHe does not give you creeds and dogmas And doctrines and philosophies.\nHe simply shakes you, shocks you, so that You can become a little awake, alert\nAnd something that you have forgotten Can be remembered again.\nIt is a forgotten language\nWhich can be remembered; it is just there\nBut on top of it there is much rubbish Which has gathered in many many lives:\nExperiences, knowledge, scriptures, ideologies -- All that rubbish has to be thrown out\nYou have to be emptied of that rubbish. Once that rubbish is thrown out\nYour innermost core\nShines forth like a Kohinoor.

silent,</p><p>Learn to listen to existence.</p><p>Rather than talking to god, listen to him! And he is speaking:</p><p>Through the wind passing through the pine trees And the sound of
running water</p><p>And the fragrance of flowers And the songs of the birds -- These are
all his messages.</p><p>On each leaf is his signature</p><p>The whole existence it his scripture. Learn to be silent, learn how
to listen</p><p>Thankfully, gratefully, in a deep trust and love And then you will
know what prayer is.</p><p>It is a very subtle phenomenon</p><p>It is a flame in the heart, a light in the heart A radiance in the
heart, a dance in the heart! (To Helga) -- This is your name: Ma Helga
Helga means holy.</p><p>But the word 'holy'</p><p>Has been misused by the priests for centuries. They have made it
synonymous</p><p>With the virtuous, the pious, the religious -- It is not synonymous
with those words.</p><p>It is a <em>far</em> bigger phenomenon.</p><p>Piousness, religiousness, virtuousness Are simply few aspects of
holiness.</p><p>They are not synonymous with it Just few fragments of it.</p><p>Holiness really means wholeness; A person who is whole is holy.</p><p>A person who lives life in its wholeness is holy. Your saints are not
holy -- they may be religious They may be very virtuous, they may be
pious But they are not holy because</p><p>Their life is a very paralysed life 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

quality of the dream? -- If you are sleeping in a room</p><p>You never dream of the same room -- never.</p><p>I have observed thousands of people's dreams: They never dream of the
same room, the same bed</p><p>The same woman they are sleeping with -- never. They may be on the
moon</p><p>They may be even on the sun, but they can't Be in the same room where
they are sleeping. They may be with Sophia Loren</p><p>But not with the woman they are sleeping with. And they may be
elephants, lions, centipedes Anything -- but never the person they
are.</p><p>That is one of the basic quality of a dream that It takes you away

consciousness.</p><p>They have exploited humanity so long, it is time That it all should
be stopped</p><p>And stopped forever.</p><p>(To Nelly) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Nelly. Anand means bliss.
Nelly means a vigilant spirit.</p><p>Bliss is a by-product of awareness, of vigilance. Vigilance is the
very essence of meditation; one has to be watchful, alert, awake. The
watchfulness has to go slowly slowly deeper. First be watchful of your
actions, that means watchfulness of your body -- walking, sitting, lying
down, taking a shower. In all the gestures of the body you should keep a
little alertness, of what is happening, of what you are doing. And you
will be surprised, as you become watchful your actions take on a new
quality; they become graceful, they are no more hurried. They start
radiating a certain peace, a certain joy. And then the second
watchfulness is about the thoughts, what thoughts are moving in the
mind. No effort to interfere, no need to stop, no need to fight, just
remain vigilant -- that is awareness of the mind. And if the first
becomes possible, the second is not difficult; but start from the
first.</p><p>Many people start from the second and find it very difficult -- it is
natural. If you start from the second it will be difficult. One should
start from the gross and then go on to the subtle and then to the
subtlest. When you have become capable of being vigilant of thoughts,
you will be surprised, they are disappearing. The more you become aware
the less they are. When you are perfectly aware, they simply evaporate,
a silence 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

when you become watchful of the mind, mind becomes utterly
non-existential. All turmoil ceases. There is pure silence, a soundless
silence.</p><p>Then turn to your feelings, the subtlest; your emotions, your
sentiments. Then become vigilant of them.</p><p>These are the three watchfulnesses and if one can become watchful of
all these three then the fourth happens on its own accord -- that you
have not to do. When you succeed in all these three, the fourth is the
reward: you become aware of your being. That is a gift from god, that is
self-realization. Watching your feelings, feelings will also disappear.
And when there are no thoughts and no feelings then you are only body
and being. These two are realities: body belongs to the earth and the
being belongs to the beyond.</p><p>These are two realities, they cannot disappear. Thoughts and feelings
are just by- products, epiphenomena; they are not realities they are
both shadows, so both disappear. Body remains but now it is very
graceful; being resides in the body and the body becomes the temple of
the being. Now you know the body will die.</p><p>But you die gracefully and you know also that your being is undying
so there is no fear left.</p><p>Make your name your sadhana, your very practise, your very spiritual
effort. (To Thomas) -- This is your name: Swami Atmanand.</p><p>Atmanand means self is bliss. Bliss is not something outside you It
is your very nature.</p><p>Hence it has not to be achieved It has only to be discovered.</p><p>It is already the case</p><p>Just you have to dig within your own being. You have to go inwards
and you will find it. Right now it is there</p><p>Just a connection has to be made A bridge has be created.</p><p>And all the meditations are nothing but bridges; Bridges between you
and your own self.</p><p>Once this is understood</p><p>That bliss is not somewhere outside Your life takes a radical
change</p><p>Your search becomes inner, otherwise</p><p>People are running after money, power, prestige Hoping that by
attaining these things</p><p>They will find bliss - they will not find anything They will only
find</p><p>That their whole life has been a wastage. With the same effort they
would have arrived At the very kingdom of god.</p><p>(To Heidi) -- This is your name: Ma Devi.

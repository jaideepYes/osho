It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Torsten) -- This is your name. Swami Anando Torsten. Anand means bliss. Torsten means god's jewel.\nBliss is the most precious phenomenon. There is nothing higher to it\nNothing deeper to it.\nTo attain bliss is the goal of life, To miss it is to miss all.\nAnd very few people have attained it While it is everybody's birthright\nIt is our very nature:\nWe are destined to attain it.\nWe lose it by our own great effort We make all kinds of hindrances We obstruct, we create walls\nWe create prisons around our being,\nAnd then we live in darkness and misery. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy work here consists in destroying All the walls of your prison\nAll the walls that surround you, gross and subtle Of concepts, ideologies, religions, philosophies, To make you totally free\nFrom all that mind has given to you.\nTo be free from mind is the beginning of bliss To be totally free from mind is its attainment.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Ennio. Anand means bliss. Ennio means the number nine.\nThe number nine represents the highest number; After that there is repetition.\nNine means the climax. Bliss is the climax. And people live in misery.\nMisery can be represented by a zero, emptiness. But not the emptiness of a Buddha\nBecause Buddha's emptiness is very full, It is not empty at all.\nIt is simply empty of the ego But is full of egolessness.\nIt is empty of misery but full of bliss.\nIt is empty of noise, but\nfull of silence and the music of silence.\nI am talking about the ordinary emptiness; Everybody feels it, that's why people don't go in.\nMasters from immemorial times have been telling people: go within,\nknow thyself, the kingdom of god is within you. People listen and yet, they don't listen at all Because their own experience is\nOf a totally negative emptiness; they don't see any kingdom within they don't see any light\nthey see only death and darkness. When I am saying zero\nI am referring to the ordinary man's experience Of an empty, meaningless life.\nBut zero is also a very mysterious figure:\nIt can also represent the Buddha, the Christ. It can also represent the ultimate but then\nIt has a totally different meaning 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd a different context; then it means fullness Totality, wholeness, perfection.\nBut ordinarily we live at the negative zero. And you have to reach\nTo the ninth plane of existence,\nyou have to go beyond your misery. People go on living in misery\nFor the simple reason that they think it is created by others; it is not so.\nYou are the creator.\nOnce this is understood, misery can be dropped. Then it is up to you: you can drop it gradually Or you can drop it in a single blow.\nIf you drop it gradually, then you go From zero to one, from one to two, slowly slowly, step by step.\nIf you are courageous enough\nyou can take a quantum leap, you can jump from the negative zero to ninth plane, directly. There is no need to go gradually\nBut everybody has to follow his own pace. Hence there are two kinds of people in the world Who are really divided spiritually.\nThe one category is of those\nWho go very cautiously, gradually, slowly. Nothing is wrong about it; they take their time. But there is also the other category:\nthe people who can take a jump from the known into the unknown\nwho can risk, who are like gamblers.\nAnd I think gambling will suit you... It suits the Italians!\nSo don't go gradually. Jews go gradually Because they are business-minded people, they function through calculation.\nBut Italians are not calculators...\neven if they want to be, they cannot calculate -- So why bother: from one to two, two to three, all that mathematics.\nJust take a jump, from zero to nine. My sannyas is really for the gamblers. I accept the other kind of people also...\nand I slowly persuade them to be gamblers!\n-- How long you will be here?\n-- I don't know.\n-- That's good. Do many groups. And Italians don't go back. And don't be so much afraid!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Michael) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Jivano. Anand means bliss. Jivano means life.\nMisery is death, the only death.\nWhat we know as death is not a reality; You are simply changing a house, From one body to another\nOr you are changing your garments From the old to the new.\nThe so-called death is not really a death But there is a far more real death --\nI call that real death misery.\nTo live in misery is not to live at all. To live in misery\nIs simply to move like a corpse,\nTo drag oneself somehow to one's own grave. And that's how the majority of people live -- No wonder they never come across bliss: Misery becomes their habit\nTheir very style of existing. To vegetate Becomes synonymous for them with life. Because they breathe, they eat,\nThey sleep, they reproduce children\nSo they think they are alive -- that's no life. That can be done in a far better way\nBy any computer.\nA computer can do all these things.\nHe can drink, he can eat, he can go to sleep He can even write love letters, make love And sooner of later\nComputers will produce children And they will be far better children Than we have ever produced because\nThe computers will go very scientifically at it. And they can do all mind work\nThat we think makes man special; in fact A computer can do within a single minute The work of one thousand scientists...\nAnd more reliably.\nLive begins only when bliss enters your being But for that you have to be vulnerable:\nOpen to the winds and the rain and the sun, Open to existence. It needs guts to be open\nBecause it is dangerous, to live is dangerous; To die is very comfortable. In fact there is\nNo place more comfortable than the grave -- No problems, no anxieties,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOne simply has gone to sleep forever. People like deathlike life -- Comfortable, convenient, but they miss The whole thrill, the adventure\nThe zest, the juice. Remember it\nThat the first and the foremost thing For a man of intelligence\nIs to seek and search for bliss. Once you are in contact with bliss\nOnce you have tasted it, you are reborn. Then real life begins\nThen you know what it is all about.\n(To Bernd) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dwariko.\nAnand means bliss, Dwariko is the city of god Krishna In Indian mythology it is the city of the gods.\nLiterally it means the door. The English word 'door' Comes from the same root as dwariko.\nGod's door -- bliss is god's door. And once you have entered into bliss You live in the city of gods.\nYou can call it paradise, the garden of Eden -- These are different names of the same thing. The thing that is referred by\nSo many different names is bliss. Man has lost track\nHe has lost completely who he is\nFrom where he comes, where he is going. He lives without an identity\nBut to live without an identity is difficult So he creates false identities:\nA name, an address -- and he believes in them that 'This is what I am.' You are not that.\nYou live on the earth but\nYou belong to the city of gods You belong to the beyond.\nAnd the beyond is always ready to welcome you But you keep your back towards it and\nYou go on rushing, running after trivia, Mundane things: money, power, prestige. If you don't get them you are miserable\nIf you get them then too you are miserable. Whether you fail or succeed\nYou fail all the same. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe only victorious person is one\nWho enters within his being and comes to know 'Who am I' -- he has entered into paradise again, He regains paradise lost.\nMeditation is the only way\nTo enter into your own being; just as mind Is the only way to enter into the world\nMeditation is the only way To enter into your own self.\nAnd paradise is not outside you; It is within you.\nThis is your name: Swami Anand Dharma. Anand means bliss. Dharma means religion.\nBliss is my religion. I don't teach you God, I don't teach you any other ideology, I simply teach you the art of being blissful. Once you are blissful everything else follows on its own accord. You will come to know God, you will come to know truth, you will come to know everything that is worth knowing. But it all happens in the climate of bliss.\nSo first create that climate. Let the spring of bliss come and then thousands of flowers start blooming.\nThen there is peace and silence, and love and compassion. Then there is great sensitivity, creativity, great joy, the experience of bliss, and life becomes a celebration.\n(To Lino) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Upasani. Anand means bliss. Upasani means one who is in prayer. Bliss it the only right kind of prayer.\nYou need not say any prayer\nYou need not utter a single word; in fact God understands no language,\nHe understands silence, but silence can be dead Then it cannot communicate with god.\nIt has to be alive, it has to be dancing\nIt has to be blissful. Then there is communion. Whenever your heart is full of joy\nYou are closest, closest to god. The word 'upasani'\nLiterally means to sit close by. Metaphorically it means prayer\nBut both meanings have to be understood. Prayer brings you close to god\nBut to be close to god there is only one way 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd that is being blissful. Misery creates distance\nDisconnects you with existence, isolates you Makes you an island unto yourself -- Closed, alienated, and of course then\nThere is great anxiety and fear Because you are so alone.\nBliss connects, bliss becomes a bridge:\nYou are no more an island when you are blissful You become part of\nThe whole continent of existence You become part of this vastness. And that is to be close to god\nTo sit close to him. And that is prayer also; Prayer in the truest sense\nNot the so-called prayer\nThat you will come across in the temples And the churches and the mosques; Those prayers are false, pseudo,\nCreations of human imagination and desire. Be blissful and you will be prayerful.\nAnd then there is no need to pray In the morning or in the evening\nOr five times a day like a Mohammedan does: You are twenty-four hours in prayer\nYour very breathing becomes prayerful Your every being is prayerful.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #29\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1976","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1976 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Comfortable, convenient, but they miss The whole thrill, the
adventure</p><p>The zest, the juice. Remember it</p><p>That the first and the foremost thing For a man of intelligence</p><p>Is to seek and search for bliss. Once you are in contact with
bliss</p><p>Once you have tasted it, you are reborn. Then real life begins</p><p>Then you know what it is all about.</p><p>(To Bernd) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Dwariko.</p><p>Anand means bliss, Dwariko is the city of god Krishna In Indian
mythology it is the city of the gods.</p><p>Literally it means the door. The English word 'door' Comes from the
same root as dwariko.</p><p>God's door -- bliss is god's door. And once you have entered into
bliss You live in the city of gods.</p><p>You can call it paradise, the garden of Eden -- These are different
names of the same thing. The thing that is referred by</p><p>So many different names is bliss. Man has lost track</p><p>He has lost completely who he is</p><p>From where he comes, where he is going. He lives without an
identity</p><p>But to live without an identity is difficult So he creates false
identities:</p><p>A name, an address -- and he believes in them that 'This is what I
am.' You are not that.</p><p>You live on the earth but</p><p>You belong to the city of gods You belong to the beyond.</p><p>And the beyond is always ready to welcome you But you keep your back
towards it and</p><p>You go on rushing, running after trivia, Mundane things: money,
power, prestige. If you don't get them you are miserable</p><p>If you get them then too you are miserable. Whether you fail or
succeed</p><p>You fail all the same. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

entered into paradise again, He regains paradise lost.</p><p>Meditation is the only way</p><p>To enter into your own being; just as mind Is the only way to enter
into the world</p><p>Meditation is the only way To enter into your own self.</p><p>And paradise is not outside you; It is within you.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Anand Dharma. Anand means bliss. Dharma
means religion.</p><p>Bliss is my religion. I don't teach you God, I don't teach you any
other ideology, I simply teach you the art of being blissful. Once you
are blissful everything else follows on its own accord. You will come to
know God, you will come to know truth, you will come to know everything
that is worth knowing. But it all happens in the climate of bliss.</p><p>So first create that climate. Let the spring of bliss come and then
thousands of flowers start blooming.</p><p>Then there is peace and silence, and love and compassion. Then there
is great sensitivity, creativity, great joy, the experience of bliss,
and life becomes a celebration.</p><p>(To Lino) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Upasani. Anand means
bliss. Upasani means one who is in prayer. Bliss it the only right kind
of prayer.</p><p>You need not say any prayer</p><p>You need not utter a single word; in fact God understands no
language,</p><p>He understands silence, but silence can be dead Then it cannot
communicate with god.</p><p>It has to be alive, it has to be dancing</p><p>It has to be blissful. Then there is communion. Whenever your heart
is full of joy</p><p>You are closest, closest to god. The word 'upasani'</p><p>Literally means to sit close by. Metaphorically it means prayer</p><p>But both meanings have to be understood. Prayer brings you close to
god</p><p>But to be close to god there is only one way 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

yourself -- Closed, alienated, and of course then</p><p>There is great anxiety and fear Because you are so alone.</p><p>Bliss connects, bliss becomes a bridge:</p><p>You are no more an island when you are blissful You become part
of</p><p>The whole continent of existence You become part of this vastness.
And that is to be close to god</p><p>To sit close to him. And that is prayer also; Prayer in the truest
sense</p><p>Not the so-called prayer</p><p>That you will come across in the temples And the churches and the
mosques; Those prayers are false, pseudo,</p><p>Creations of human imagination and desire. Be blissful and you will
be prayerful.</p><p>And then there is no need to pray In the morning or in the
evening</p><p>Or five times a day like a Mohammedan does: You are twenty-four hours
in prayer</p><p>Your very breathing becomes prayerful Your every being is
prayerful.</p><h3 style=padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #29</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

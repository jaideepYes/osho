It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Benita) -- Your name:..She follows?\nMa Dhyan Benita. Dhyan means meditation. Benita Means the blessed one.\nEveryone is a blessed being\nBut it is only through meditation That one recognizes the face\nOtherwise the treasure remains hidden\nUnknown, unrecognized and we remain beggars. We are born of god\nThere can be no other higher blessing. We carry eternity in our being, Nothing more can be desired.\nWe have all the seeds which can become Great lotuses of bliss, benediction\nBut they will remain seeds unless we provide them The right soil of meditation.\nMeditation is the only way for transforming Our unconscious state into a conscious one, The only way to know ourselves.\nThere has never been any other way And there will never be another Because the problem is the mind\nAnd meditation helps you to transcend the mind It helps you to go beyond it\nSuddenly all problems disappear,\nAll darkness disappears. You are full of light. In that light you recognize who you are.\nThat very recognisation\nIs a declaration of one's blessedness\n(To Manfred) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Manfred. Dhyan means meditation. Manfred means man of peace.\nEverybody would like to be a man of peace But just by liking\nOne cannot become a man of peace. People go on shouting for peace\nAnd the same people go on preparing for war. The same people go on talking about peace 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd the same people\nGo on piling up atom bombs, hydrogen bombs; They are not different people.\nIt is a very strange phenomenon: Man lives in such a contradiction For the simple reason that\nIt is easy to desire good and beautiful things But to materialize them\nIs a totally different thing. To dream is one thing,\nTo make the dream a reality is another. And everybody can afford dreams And when you are dreaming\nYou can dream beautiful dreams\nBut dreams are dreams: when you wake up They have not changed your reality\nEven by an iota -- the reality remains the same. And man becomes split: He dreams good things About god, about peace, about love, and he Prepares for war, for destruction, for violence.\nEven in the name of peace\nHe is ready to plunge into a war; in fact\nAll wars have been fought in the name of peace All countries prepare for war but they all say that 'We are only preparing for war to save peace\nWe are not preparing for war.'\nThey all call their war ministries 'Defence ministries'. Then one wonders: Who has the aggressive ministry?\nNo country has any aggressive ministry, All are defense ministries,\nThey are all preparing for defense -- Who attacks them?\nIn fact, even when the war has been fought And millions of people have been killed\nIt remains an undecided phenomenon; Who started it? So whosoever wins the war Writes the history and he proves\nThat the defeated one was the cause of it. So all history is rubbish\nBecause it is written by the victorious.\nIt is not true, it has nothing to do with truth; It is simply one standpoint, the standpoint Of the one who has become victorious.\nIf the other party had won\nThe history would have been totally different. If Adolf Hitler had won the war\nThen Churchill and Roosevelt and Stalin, These would have been the war criminals. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThen the history would have been Totally different; then these people Would have been the proved that They were the aggressive people\nAnd Adolf Hitler was the saviour of humankind. But now because he has lost the war\nHe is a criminal.\nThe other criminals have become heroes. They are all criminals in fact.\nAll politicians are criminals\nAnd all politicians talk about peace And they go on deceiving people. A real man of peace\nWill have to go through an inner transformation, Only then the dream becomes a reality.\nMeditation is the alchemy\nOf transforming your aggressive energies Into peaceful energies.\nIt transforms your violence into love.\nThey are not different, it is the same energy. And remember always: energy is neutral,\nIt is neither good nor bad.\nEnergy used non-meditatively becomes dangerous It is a sword in a small child's hand: Either\nHe is going to harm himself or somebody else. If no harm happens\nThat will be simply an accident.\nIf harm happens that is not an accident at all, That was bound to happen, it was inevitable. We have energies but we are not grown-ups. Hence our energies go berserk.\nMeditation is the process of growing up. And never forget the simple fact\nBut which is always forgotten,\nThat growing old is not growing up. Growing old is simple.\nIt has nothing to do with you, It happens on its own.\nYou go on aging because time goes on passing.\nIt depends on the clocks and the calendars, It has nothing to do with you.\nIf it has something to do with you Nobody will ever grow old.\nWho would like to become old? Everybody would have been young.\nBut growing up is a totally different process; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt needs a deliberate, conscious effort On your part.\nSo it happens, a man may be only Twelve-year-old psychologically. Then he is in difficulty\nAnd not only he is in difficulty.\nAnd these are the senior citizens of the world. By the time these fools are becoming senile They attain to great power.\nIt takes time to attain to power:\nTo become a president\nOr to become a prime minister, it takes time. By the time you are\nA prime minister of a country You may be at least sixty\nOr more -- seventy, eighty.\nMorarji Desai became prime minister of India -- He was eighty-four, whole life's struggle\nTo become prime minister, a childish idea.\nAn eighty-four years is just a physiological age Because the childish idea is there.\nAnd these people wield the power\nAnd they create destruction in the world Growing up means: psychologically you become Mature, centered, integrated and all integration All centering, all maturity comes\nBy becoming more and more watchful of your mind And all its stupidities. Mind is a monkey.\nYou have to watch it and you have to see\nAll kinds of foolishnesses that it goes on doing And goes on manipulating you to follow it.\nMeditation is simply\nThe art of watching the mind. Once you start watching\nThe monkey stops manipulating you.\nOnce you become more and more watchful Distance is created\nBetween you and your own mind, You are no more identified.\nA moment comes when you are simply consciousness And that very moment mind disappears\nBecause it has no more any hold over you. That moment is the moment\nWhen for the first time you know what it is To be a man of peace.\nPeace starts overflowing you. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn a thousand ways peace radiates through you. You live peace, you breathe peace,\nWhatsoever you do has the grace and the beauty And the touch of godliness in it!\n(To Maia) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Maia. Deva means divine. Maia means rebellion.\nThe ordinary revolution\nIs apparently revolutionary -- only apparently. It gives you a false feeling of change\nBut it never changes anything in fact. Man has seen many revolutions:\nThe French revolution and the Russian revolution And the Chinese revolution, but all have failed; For the simple reason that\nRevolution never takes account of consciousness. It tries to change the structure of the society\nNot the consciousness of human beings. Structure is superficial,\nIt is not the center of life.\nSo you can change the structure, It is like changing the house: You live in one house,\nThinking that you are a very bad person\nYou change the house, you go into another house But that is not going to change you,\nYou will remain the same person. Only the house will be different:\nThe windows will be in different places And the doors will be in different places\nMaybe it is made of marble and very beautiful But what about you? -- you are the same person. You will go on doing\nThe same stupid things as you were doing before. Revolution changes the houses people live in, Rebellion changes consciousness.\nHence rebellion is divine, it is inner. Revolution is outer, mundane Rebellion is sacred.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSannyas is a rebellion And that is the only thing\nThat has ever succeeded,\nBut very few people have tried it. Still, its impact has been tremendous. Had a little more people tried it\nLife would have been totally different. We can count those people on fingers:\nA Buddha, a Jesus, a Moses, a Zarathustra, Only few names here and there.\nBut those few names have transformed humanity. With those few people\nHumanity has gone higher and higher. It is a miracle\nThat just a man like Buddha changes so much Without changing anything on the outside; He simply changes himself\nBut his change triggers a process\nWhich still continues; it becomes a chain. He is not a Karl Marx, he is not a Lenin\nHe is not a Stalin, he is not a Mao Tse Tung, But these people will be forgotten\nThese people will remain\nJust footnotes somewhere in the history\nThese people will be remembered only as nightmares But Buddha will always be remembered\nAs a cool breeze which still goes on blowing, A river which still is alive\nWhich is eternal in a way.\nAnd those who are capable of drinking out of it Can still drink out of it.\nMy sannyasins have to be great lights, Great rebels, great ecstatic people\nWho are not concerned with the outside things But to change themselves and create\nA process of change through that.\nIt is an individual to individual effort, Heart to heart phenomenon but that's\nThe only thing that is going to change one day The whole face of the earth.\n(To Jochen) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Jochen. Anand means bliss. Jochen means appointed by god.\nEveryone is appointed by god\nBut we have forgotten completely our mission\nWe have forgotten even why we are here 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe have forgotten the message That has to be delivered.\nWe have forgotten who has sent us and we have Forgotten to whom the message has to be delivered We have forgotten everything!\nWe are living in a deep forgetfulness And we call it life.\nAnd people who are so utterly forgetful, Of everything\nThink themselves intelligent people.\nIf you ask the awakened ones they will call This is sheer foolishness.\nWe have to wake up out of this foolishness, We are here to fulfil a certain purpose.\nEveryone is here to sing a song\nTo dance a dance, to release a certain perfume\nBut that is possible only\nIf you become very very conscious, That is possible only\nIf you become so much alert that\nYou can see yourself directly, not via others. Right now\nWhatsoever you know about yourself is via others: Somebody says you are very nice\nAnd you believe it. Of course,\nEverybody wants to believe that one is nice. And somebody says you are very intelligent And you believe it.\nThere are troublesome people also Who say you are not intelligent, You are stupid, you are a fool; Nobody believes them but\nThey create a disturbance. That's why we get angry:\nEverything was running so smoothly,\nYour father, your mother, your uncle, everybody Was saying you are so nice, so beautiful,\nThen somebody turns up and says that You are just a fool -- how he annoys you. And he may be right!\nThere is far more possibility that he is right Because the world is full of fools.\nBut no mother can think that her son is a fool. She will realize it only but later on when the son Has fallen in the hands of another woman.\nThen she will realize that he was a fool Because then she will see that\n'I have made so much effort and worked hard ... It took twenty-five years for me\nTo make him intelligent enough And here comes another woman And within five minutes\nShe make a fool out of the same man!'\nBut till that happens, she will believe in you That you are a great hero,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat you are somebody special Because through your speciality\nShe becomes unique: Her son is special. Your father believes that you are great Because though you he is great!\nSo anybody who disturbs you, annoys you Says anything against your beautiful beliefs Enrages you -- you may not believe him But he creates a contradiction in you,\nYou become confused.\nThat's why everybody is in confusion Bound to be because contradictory opinions Are coming from every side\nFrom every nook and corner. One person says on thing\nAnother person says another thing\nAnd you go on collecting all these things. And it is impossible\nTo make any sense out of the whole So you are just like a patchwork:\nMm? You drop all that is not good and nice, You drop it into the unconscious.\nIt remains there and you make\nA beautiful image out of public opinion But it is not self-knowledge,\nYou don't know anything about yourself directly. You know your face through the mirror.\nZen masters say to their disciples, 'Discover your original face.'\nIt happened once, a great Zen master, Bokoju Told one if his disciples,\n'Discover your original face.'\nAnd another day he came with a mirror And he said, 'Yes, sir\nI have looked into the mirror -- This is my original face!'\nAnd the master threw him out and said that 'Never come back again\nBecause this is not a place\nFor such damned fools as you are.\nI accept fools but not damned fools!\nHow can the mirror show your original face? It can only reflect your mask.\nFor the original face you have to go inwards 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou have to discover it\nAt the very core of your being.\nNo mirror can help, no scripture can help, All the Buddhas can only indicate the way But no Buddha can go with you there.\nI can show you the way\nBut you will have to follow,\nYou will have to do it on you own.' Once you know your original face\nA great joy arises, great bliss is born. Suddenly you see that you are not accidental\nYou are appointed by god, that you are carrying Some important message for existence,\nThat you are needed\nThat you are fulfilling a certain deep purpose In this great scheme of things\nYou are fulfilling\nSome intrinsic, organic utility That gives great peace, great joy.

energy is neutral,</p><p>It is neither good nor bad.</p><p>Energy used non-meditatively becomes dangerous It is a sword in a

happen, it was inevitable. We have energies but we are not grown-ups.
Hence our energies go berserk.</p><p>Meditation is the process of growing up. And never forget the simple
fact</p><p>But which is always forgotten,</p><p>That growing old is not growing up. Growing old is simple.</p><p>It has nothing to do with you, It happens on its own.</p><p>You go on aging because time goes on passing.</p><p>It depends on the clocks and the calendars, It has nothing to do with

godliness in it!</p><p>(To Maia) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Maia. Deva means divine. Maia
means rebellion.</p><p>The ordinary revolution</p><p>Is apparently revolutionary -- only apparently. It gives you a false
feeling of change</p><p>But it never changes anything in fact. Man has seen many
revolutions:</p><p>The French revolution and the Russian revolution And the Chinese
revolution, but all have failed; For the simple reason that</p><p>Revolution never takes account of consciousness. It tries to change
the structure of the society</p><p>Not the consciousness of human beings. Structure is superficial,</p><p>It is not the center of life.</p><p>So you can change the structure, It is like changing the house: You
live in one house,</p><p>Thinking that you are a very bad person</p><p>You change the house, you go into another house But that is not going
to change you,</p><p>You will remain the same person. Only the house will be
different:</p><p>The windows will be in different places And the doors will be in
different places</p><p>Maybe it is made of marble and very beautiful But what about you? --
you are the same person. You will go on doing</p><p>The same stupid things as you were doing before. Revolution changes
the houses people live in, Rebellion changes consciousness.</p><p>Hence rebellion is divine, it is inner. Revolution is outer, mundane
Rebellion is sacred.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

tremendous. Had a little more people tried it</p><p>Life would have been totally different. We can count those people on
fingers:</p><p>A Buddha, a Jesus, a Moses, a Zarathustra, Only few names here and
there.</p><p>But those few names have transformed humanity. With those few
people</p><p>Humanity has gone higher and higher. It is a miracle</p><p>That just a man like Buddha changes so much Without changing anything
on the outside; He simply changes himself</p><p>But his change triggers a process</p><p>Which <em>still</em> continues; it becomes a chain. He is not a Karl
Marx, he is not a Lenin</p><p>He is not a Stalin, he is not a Mao Tse Tung, But these people will
be forgotten</p><p>These people will remain</p><p>Just footnotes somewhere in the history</p><p>These people will be remembered only as nightmares But Buddha will
always be remembered</p><p>As a cool breeze which still goes on blowing, A river which still is
alive</p><p>Which is eternal in a way.</p><p>And those who are capable of drinking out of it Can still drink out
of it.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be great lights, Great rebels, great ecstatic
people</p><p>Who are not concerned with the outside things But to change
themselves and create</p><p>A process of change through that.</p><p>It is an individual to individual effort, Heart to heart phenomenon

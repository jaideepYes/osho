Ricardo means hard, hardness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLet hardness be your past Discontinue yourself with it. Let softness be your future.\nSannyas has to be a discontinuity: One has to die to the past\nSo that one can be reborn. Hardness is a quality\nWhich is very much praised in the world, in fact All that is violent, masculine pays in the world Because we have created such an ugly society.\nIt is rooted into our animal heritage. Physically we have come far\nAway from animals, but psychologically We re still there, in the jungle.\nThe psychological revolution\nHas to yet happen; it has not happened.\nOnce a man was saying to Bertrand Russell that 'What's your opinion about civilization?' Russell said, 'It is a good idea --\nSomebody has to practise it.' It has not yet happened\nIt is just a good idea, it is utopia. Man lives in a very uncivilized way.\nHence qualities which are warlike are praised Qualities which are flowerlike are condemned. To be soft is thought to be feminine.\nIt is feminine, but there is nothing wrong in it. In fact it should be praised\nBecause it is feminine.\nWe have to create a new world, a new society In which qualities rooted in love are praised, Not rooted in war.\nThen softness, openness, vulnerability will become great values.\nThey are values for a sannyasin.\nThe sannyasin has to live the future now. He belongs to the future hence\nHe will have to go through many difficulties Because he will have to live with people Who are clinging to the past --\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd they are the majority.\nA Sannyasin is bound to find himself an outsider, But it is good: all pioneers are outsiders.\nSo drop all that is hard in you, Become very conscious --\nDon't carry anything hard in you And transform all the qualities\nInto softness, into tenderness, into love.\n(To Hildegard) -- This is a beautiful name hence I will keep it exactly as it is: Ma Hildegard.\nIt means protected by the mother goddess Hilde. Two things are implied in it.\nOne is that god is conceived as a mother, Not as father -- which is far more truer. God as a father is not so true; in fact\nThe very institution of father is arbitrary. It is created by the society\nHence it has gone through many changes. There is every possibility in future\nThe very institution may disappear; Father may become almost irrelevant. In fact the very idea of father arises Out of private property.\nBecause man became\nVery conscious of possessing property He started possessing the woman;\nHe won't allow the woman The freedom to move freely\nWithout being possessed by anybody in particular. And of course, man is in a certain way\nStronger than the woman;\nIn an animal way he is stronger,\nIn a muscular way he is stronger, obviously. If you put Buddha and Mohammed Ali Against each other\nMohammed Ali is stronger Buddha is bound to be defeated, He may be even killed.\nHe is stronger in a totally different dimension. Mohammed Ali may not be\nEven aware of that dimension.\nThe woman is stronger in a different way. She has more loving qualities, more heart, More capacity to be patient\nGreat capacity to resist\nAll kinds of misfortunes, immense power 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo pass through suffering unaffected. Man s very weak in that way.\nBut muscularly he is powerful. His height is a little bigger\nHis bones are a little stronger\nHe can overpower physically any woman Hence he started possessing other properties. And he wanted to be absolutely certain that Only his children\nShould be the owner of his property. That was the beginning\nOf the institution of fatherhood. Mother is a natural phenomenon Father is artificial.\nIn animals there is no father, only the mother. In birds, only the mother;\nThe father is only accidental It is not so intrinsic.\nThe same is possible once women become More freer economically\nMore freer psychologically,\nThe same is going to happen again.\nIn the future, fatherhood is going to disappear. It can be predicted\nAnd very confidentially predicted That father has outlived.\nBecause in the past\nThe male became very important -- He created all the institutions Around the idea of the masculine. Even god became masculine.\nThe Christian Trinity has no woman in it. All the three are male members.\nIt is a gay club! And must be utterly boring! At least one woman is needed\nTo make things a little juicy! Even if one woman was there\nThere must have been many gossips and Things would have started moving.\nNothing has happened since god created the world. All those three -- god the father\nAnd god the son, and the holy ghost -- They go on sitting. What they are doing? They must be feeling very empty.\nJust the entry of a single woman And there will be trouble 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd there will be problems\nAnd jealousies and fight will start And triangles will be created:\nHoly ghost will fall in love and fight! And there will be some story in it.\nYou cannot write a novel without a woman -- I have never seen, you cannot\nThat is not possible\nBut the masculine mind imposes the idea. It is far more truer that god is a woman Because god is a womb.\nOut of the womb everything has arisen Out of god's womb the whole creation These millions of forms: Trees\nBirds and animals and rivers and mountains And stars, suns and moons, millions of forms. God must have a womb of infinite capacity.\nOnly a womb can be creative\nNo man can create a single child. Cannot give birth to a single child. A woman will be needed.\nAnd this is accepted in the story of Jesus' birth: The father is discarded, it can be discarded.\nJoseph is not needed\nBut virgin mother cannot be discarded. Even the male chauvinists\nCould not discard the mother because\nThen the whole idea would have been so absurd. It is already fifty per cent absurd but then\nIt would have been hundred per cent absurd. Then Jesus will have to come suddenly\nFrom nowhere, not even out of virgin mother. That story unknowingly accepts one thing that Father is discardable but the mother is not.\nSo this is one implication of Hildegard That god is mother\nAnd motherly qualities should be developed If one wants to come closer to god.\nThe second thing to remember is That god is always protecting;\nWe are not aware -- that is our fault. And because we are not aware\nSo we are never grateful, otherwise\nHe is constantly protecting, he is caring 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHe is surrounding us\nIn every possible way to help us grow,\nHe is a constant nourishment.\nHe is our very life. We are not alone. If these two things you can remember They will transform your whole life. Develop womanly qualities.\nThere is a danger to womanly qualities Very great danger:\nFirst man destroys womanly qualities because He was very much afraid of womanly qualities; They were competitive to his qualities\nAnd they were certainly softer, more beautiful More aesthetic -- he destroys them.\nHe destroyed woman as much s he could. He paralyzed all his ...\nHe used all his power to paralyze woman. And now the modern woman\nIs committing the same mistake on her own accord. Now she is trying to become like man\nShe is trying to become a competitor So she is trying to develop hardness The fighting attitude.\nThe modern woman is trying to be Strong, as strong as man is\nBut that is going to destroy her totally. Man has already done much harm.\nAnd the remaining will go because\nOf this so-called woman's liberation movement. It is suicidal.\nWoman certainly needs freedom:\nFreedom to be a woman\nNot freedom to become a man.\nThat is not freedom, that is imitation And imitation is not going to help.\nThe woman need not become A secondary type of man.\nShe should remain herself\nHer own self, her authentic self.\nReal woman's liberation has not yet started. I hope that my sannyasins\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWill trigger that process too.\nThen the problem will be totally different\nIt is not a question of becoming another man. The question is how to be uniquely woman. So develop womanly qualities\nAnd they are totally different from man Utterly different, the polar opposite of man. So no woman can really become a woman By imitating a man;\nShe will be only a carbon copy And carbon copies are ugly.\nAnd the second thing to remember that Never feel alone, god is always with you: In each of your breath,\nIn each heartbeat god is with you The whole existence supports you So never feel alienated, alone.\nEven in moments of despair, anguish, anxiety Remember, that you are well-protected,\nThat there is no need to become a pessimist.\nNever allow your hope to die!\nGo on hoping even against hope, against all hope. Go on believing in the dawn\nHowsoever the night is dark -- That's the beginning of sannyas.\n(To Philip) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Philip. Dhyan means meditation. Philip means strong in spirit.\nMeditation is possible only for those who are really strong in spirit. It has nothing to do with physical strength but it certainly has to do something with an unwavering determination. The wavering person cannot go deep in meditation because meditation takes time to grow. It is not like seasonal flowers; it is like a cedar of Lebanon, it takes years, one has to be very patient.\nThere is a Sufi story. A king was passing on his horse, he had gone for a morning round of the capital, disguised. He saw a very old man, very very old man. He had never seen an ancient man, watering a small plant of a mango tree. He wondered, he stopped. He said, \"Old man, you seem to be really a great optimist.\nYou are so old that I don't think you will survive even a week and what are you doing? -- watering such a small plant of a mango tree? It will take years! You will not be here to taste those fruits.\"\nThe old man laughed and he said that, \"My father lived a hundred and forty years and I am only a hundred and thirty. And he was planting trees even when he was a hundred and forty. And it is because of him that I have enjoyed beautiful fruits and flowers. So what does it matter whether I am here or not?\nSomebody will enjoy! I have enjoyed trees planted by others. Others will enjoy my planted trees. This is the only way to repay, otherwise I will be dying in debt. And who knows? If my father could live to a hundred and forty, I am still very young -- just a hundred and thirty. I may live to see this tree flower.\"\nThe king said, \"If you live then don't forget me. Bring the first fruits to me. I would like to see. This will be a miracle.\"\nAnd after ten years the old man knocked on the king's gate with a bucket full of mango fruits. The king had completely forgotten. He asked, \"Who are you?\" He said, \"You have forgotten me\" - he reminded him.\n\"And these are the fruits, the first fruits of the tree. And do you see, I am still alive and I am still planting new trees. Who knows? -- I may still live.\"\nAnd the king was surprised because the man looked younger than before. He asked, \"I am more puzzled even than before. I was puzzled that time but now I am even more puzzled, you look younger!\"\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe man said, \"One who lives with hope remains always young. I am growing younger every day because a new day, every day surprises me -- I am still alive! What wonder! And that wonder keeps me young, but you have grown very old. I knew that very day that you will grow very old, very soon and you will die very soon. And I tell you that you will die before me. You don't have a strong spirit, you live in pessimism,\" the old man said.\nMeditation needs that kind of strong spirit, then certainly one comes to taste the fruits of the ultimate.\nOne comes to taste nectar, one comes to know eternity.\nSo put all your energies with great hope, with great patience and with an unwavering determination to create a meditative energy in you.\n(To Arlene) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Anubhuti. Dhyan means meditation. Anubhuti means experience. Meditation is not a thought, it is not philosophy.\nIt is existential, it is an experience.\nIt is like love: just by thinking about love You cannot know love.\nYou may know much about love\nBut to know about love is not to know love To know love there is only one way:\nTo fall in love, to experience it -- And that's how it is with meditation:\nYou can think about it, you can study about it, There are thousands of books on meditation. People have written down the centuries\nGreat treatises on meditation. You will become a great scholar\nAbout meditation, but that is not knowing it. Knowing means experiencing.\nThere is no need to go in the scriptures; One needs to go into oneself\nOne has to fall into one's being.\nIn love you fall into somebody else being, In meditation you fall into your own being. They are very alike, the fall is the same\nJust the direction is different:\nLove is other-directed Meditation is self-directed. The process is the same That you fall from the head.\nIn love you fall from thinking into feeling\nIn meditation you fall from thinking into being. This is the inner triangle, the inner trinity: Thinking, feeling, being.\nPeople live in thinking;\nVery few people come to know what feeling is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd even rarer are those people Who come to know what being is.\nSannyas means the great adventure into being It is the greatest adventure there is\nBecause it releases the greatest ecstasy And it allows you to know\nYour ultimate reality, your immortality. It allows you to know\nThat you are birthless, deathless.\nIt makes you free from all fear, anxiety It opens the doors of blessings: Millions of blessings\nStart showering on you like flowers And they go on showering forever And forever.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #25\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2629","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2629 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

god is a woman Because god is a womb.</p><p>Out of the womb everything has arisen Out of god's womb the whole
creation These millions of forms: Trees</p><p>Birds and animals and rivers and mountains And stars, suns and moons,
millions of forms. God must have a womb of infinite capacity.</p><p>Only a womb can be creative</p><p>No man can create a single child. Cannot give birth to a single
child. A woman will be needed.</p><p>And this is accepted in the story of Jesus' birth: The father is
discarded, it can be discarded.</p><p>Joseph is not needed</p><p>But virgin mother cannot be discarded. Even the male chauvinists</p><p>Could not discard the mother because</p><p>Then the whole idea would have been so absurd. It is already fifty

never feel alienated, alone.</p><p>Even in moments of despair, anguish, anxiety Remember, that you are
well-protected,</p><p>That there is no need to become a pessimist.</p><p>Never allow your hope to die!</p><p>Go on hoping even against hope, against all hope. Go on believing in
the dawn</p><p>Howsoever the night is dark -- That's the beginning of sannyas.</p><p>(To Philip) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Philip. Dhyan means
meditation. Philip means strong in spirit.</p><p>Meditation is possible only for those who are really strong in
spirit. It has nothing to do with physical strength but it certainly has
to do something with an unwavering determination. The wavering person
cannot go deep in meditation because meditation takes time to grow. It
is not like seasonal flowers; it is like a cedar of Lebanon, it takes
years, one has to be very patient.</p><p>There is a Sufi story. A king was passing on his horse, he had gone
for a morning round of the capital, disguised. He saw a very old man,
very very old man. He had never seen an ancient man, watering a small
plant of a mango tree. He wondered, he stopped. He said, "Old man, you
seem to be really a great optimist.</p><p>You are so old that I don't think you will survive even a week and
what are you doing? -- watering such a small plant of a mango tree? It
will take years! You will not be here to taste those fruits."</p><p>The old man laughed and he said that, "My father lived a hundred and
forty years and I am only a hundred and thirty. And he was planting
trees even when he was a hundred and forty. And it is because of him
that I have enjoyed beautiful fruits and flowers. So what does it matter
whether I am here or not?</p><p>Somebody will enjoy! I have enjoyed trees planted by others. Others
will enjoy my planted trees. This is the only way to repay, otherwise I
will be dying in debt. And who knows? If my father could live to a
hundred and forty, I am still very young -- just a hundred and thirty. I
may live to see this tree flower."</p><p>The king said, "If you live then don't forget me. Bring the first
fruits to me. I would like to see. This will be a miracle."</p><p>And after ten years the old man knocked on the king's gate with a
bucket full of mango fruits. The king had completely forgotten. He
asked, "Who are you?" He said, "You have forgotten me" - he reminded
him.</p><p>"And these are the fruits, the first fruits of the tree. And do you
see, I am still alive and I am still planting new trees. Who knows? -- I
may still live."</p><p>And the king was surprised because the man looked younger than
before. He asked, "I am more puzzled even than before. I was puzzled
that time but now I am even more puzzled, you look younger!"</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-6>Osho's books on

growing younger every day because a new day, every day surprises me -- I
am still alive! What wonder! And that wonder keeps me young, but you
have grown very old. I knew that very day that you will grow very old,
very soon and you will die very soon. And I tell you that you will die
before me. You don't have a strong spirit, you live in pessimism," the
old man said.</p><p>Meditation needs that kind of strong spirit, then certainly one comes
to taste the fruits of the ultimate.</p><p>One comes to taste nectar, one comes to know eternity.</p><p>So put all your energies with great hope, with great patience and
with an unwavering determination to create a meditative energy in
you.</p><p>(To Arlene) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Anubhuti. Dhyan means
meditation. Anubhuti means experience. Meditation is not a thought, it
is not philosophy.</p><p>It is existential, it is an experience.</p><p>It is like love: just by thinking about love You cannot know
love.</p><p>You may know much <em>about</em> love</p><p>But to know about love is not to know love To know love there is only
one way:</p><p>To fall in love, to experience it -- And that's how it is with
meditation:</p><p>You can think about it, you can study about it, There are thousands
of books on meditation. People have written down the centuries</p><p>Great treatises on meditation. You will become a great scholar</p><p>About <span class=p>meditation, but that is not knowing it. Knowing
means experiencing.</span></p><p>There is no need to go in the scriptures; One needs to go into
oneself</p><p>One has to fall into one's being.</p><p>In love you fall into somebody <em>else</em> being, In meditation you
fall into your own being. They are very alike, the fall is the same</p><p>Just the direction is different:</p><p>Love is other-directed Meditation is self-directed. The process is
the same That you fall from the head.</p><p>In love you fall from thinking into feeling</p><p>In meditation you fall from thinking into being. This is the inner
triangle, the inner trinity: Thinking, feeling, being.</p><p>People live in thinking;</p><p>Very few people come to know what feeling is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-7>Osho's books on

adventure there is</p><p>Because it releases the greatest ecstasy And it allows you to

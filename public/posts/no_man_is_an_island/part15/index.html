It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Valeria) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Valeria.\nDhyan means meditation. Valeria means determined resolution. Meditation needs a very determined heart.\nThe wavering mind\nIs incapable of going into meditation. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt needs an unwavering perseverance Because it takes time.\nFor so many lives we have lived non-meditatively That is has become almost our nature.\nThat non-meditativeness surround us like a rock And it has to be broken.\nAnd unless we break the rock\nOur inner nature will never manifest itself. So if one meditates one day\nAnd hopes to attain something and finds\nThat nothing has been achieved and drops the idea Then he will never be able to go\nInto the world of meditation.\nIt needs an absolute commitment that Whatsoever happens, irrespective of any results I am determined to go into it and\nI am ready to wait and I am ready to risk all. The deeper the resolution\nGreater the determination Easier becomes the process. If the determination is total And the intensity is absolute\nIt can even happen in a single moment.\nIt all depends on your intensity:\nA passionate love affair it has to be.\nOne cannot just play around with the idea of it. It has to become one's life.\nAnd it is worth risking all because There is nothing more precious than it. It opens the door to the divine treasures To the eternal kingdom of god.\n(To Mario) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Mario Dhyan means meditation. Mario means rebellion.\nMeditation is the only rebellion there is, The true rebellion.\nAll others are only pseudo coins.\nOne can change the social structure, the political structure But if man remains the same inside\nNothing is changed.\nHe will again do the same things, Maybe labels will be different now. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFor example, in Russian revolution Capitalists disappeared\nThe proletariat disappeared, the division Between the poor and the rich disappeared; A new division appeared: The division Between the powerful and the powerless.\nIt is the same game\nNow just the names are different. Now those who are in power They are the rich people.\nAnd those who are not in power\nThey are the poor people; revolution has failed. And that has been the case always:\nAll revolutions have failed.\nOnly few rebellious people have succeeded. A Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Jesus,\nThey transformed their consciousness And they lived in a total different way. If we really want\nTo change the whole earth into a paradise The only possible way\nAnd I say the only possible way\nIs to create as great a meditative force In the world as possible.\nIf millions of people are meditators Then we can change the world because\nThe meditator is no more interested in ego trips Otherwise, you distribute the money --\nThe ego trip comes in a new form:\nIt becomes a power trip\nOr some other form, but the division will continue. Unless from your innermost core\nThe ego disappears, it dies totally Without leaving any trace\nNo revolution can succeed.\nHence I am not interested in changing the society. My whole interest is in the individual.\nAll social revolutions have failed,\nNow the time has come to think of the individual And focus whole energy on the individual.\nThe individual is the only hope.\nIf millions of individuals can change\nThrough meditation if they can realize A kind of egolessness\nThen they will create a society, naturally Spontaneously, which will be classless. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo Burkhart -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Burkhart. Dhyan means meditation. Burkhart means courageous spirit. Courageous spirit is one of\nThe most essential things for a religious man. Without courage nobody can be religious.\nCowards can't afford to be religious Because it is a journey into the unknown Into the uncharted.\nIt is going to the farther shore.\nThere is no guarantee that one will reach No guarantee even\nWhether the farther shore exists at all.\nIt needs really guts to drop that which you have\nFor that which is just an idea right now. It needs tremendous idealism\nIt needs a poet not a mathematician. It is not calculation, it is a love affair. It is almost mad in the eyes of those Who are calculating.\nAnd meditation is the way to go into the unknown. It is going beyond the mind.\nMind consists of the known\nOf the familiar, of the experienced. To go beyond the mind means\nGo beyond all boundaries.\nIt is risking, it is jumping into an abyss\nBut blessed are those who can gather that courage Because theirs is the kingdom of god.\n-- This is your name: Swami Dhyano Frank.\nDhyano means meditation. Frank means living in freedom. A man lives in slavery without meditation\nBecause he lives unconsciously He lives like a robot.\nMeditation starts changing you: It transforms\nYour unconsciousness into consciousness It changes your darkness into light.\nIt is the only alchemy which transforms\nThe raw energy into a refined world of mysteries. Meditation is a great art.\nOne has to be very very skillful and intelligent 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo be meditative.\nIt is not for the unintelligent It is not for the mediocre.\nIt requires intelligence, and the irony is that Only mediocre people go to the temples And the churches and the mosques.\nTemples are full of mediocres and cowards. They are there simply because\nThey are afraid of life, afraid of death Afraid of anything!\nThey live in a kind of phobia.\nIn fact thousands of phobias around them And they are not intelligent enough\nTo solve any problem\nSo they go on asking the stupid priests Who are just like parrots\nWho go on repeating the scriptures.\nThey have not solved their problems either.\nBut this is a strange game -- this goes on and on. There are fools and there are charlatans\nTo exploit those fools.\nAnd the charlatans are bound to remain there Unless fools disappear from the world.\nMeditation requires only two things: You should be courageous\nYou should be a little intelligent.\nAnd these are the essential religious qualities. Once courage and intelligence are there\nThen there is no problem.\nMeditation is bound to happen, is inevitable -- Just a little effort, a very little effort\nAnd tremendous is the outcome.\nAnd once you become conscious You can live in freedom Otherwise you live like a slave, Slave of thousand and one things.\nSlave of the crowd, slave of the tradition\nSlave of the church, slave of your own instincts. There are so many layers of slavery\nBut we accept them\nWe have taken them for granted so we don't think That they are bad, ugly, disgusting.\nOnce you have tasted a little freedom You will be surprised:\nWhat kind of life you had lived before? It was not life at all.\nSannyas means\nEntering into a totally new kind of life Bringing a new quality of life in your being. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(To Walter) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Siddho.\nDhyan means meditation. Siddho means one who has achieved. Sannyas is a pilgrimage: A pilgrimage\nFrom the dark night of the soul Towards the dawn of the spirit.\nIt is not a ritual, it is an inner revolution. It is not a formality, it is a love affair.\nUnless it is something form your very heart\nIt won't work. It is not a question of believing It is not a question of intellectual conviction. It is a question of falling in love\nWith something which one can feel\nBut one cannot understand by intellect itself. It is a quantum leap.\nYou may never have done Anything like that before. But good that you have\nGathered courage enough to go into it; One hesitates in the beginning.\nThe mind pulls backwards...\nDon't listen to the mind -- listen to the heart!\nLearn more and more listening the heart And follow the heart.\nThe mind is not yours,\nIt is given by the society.\nThe heart is yours, it is given by god himself! If you listen to the heart\nMeditation will not be difficult It can be achieved.\nAnd once meditation is achieved Then there is no problem left\nYou have clarity, you can see things as they are. Then there is no question\nOf choosing what to do and what not to do; You immediately know what to do.\nThere is no question of alternatives.\nYou simply know this is the right thing to do And one never repents.\nThat is the state of siddho:\nOne never repents, one never commits a mistake. The whole world may think\nThat you are committing a mistake\nBut as far as your heart is concerned You are totally in it\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou know it from your very being\nThat it is not a mistake and you never repent. You know ultimately it is going to be good. Maybe right now it is impossible\nTo conceive what will be the ultimate outcome But the heart knows far better because the heart Lives in the deepest of the mysteries of existence. For the heart there is not past and no future, There is only present.\nOnce meditation is fulfilled\nOnce you have achieved meditation\nYour life has a smoothness, a grace, a beauty.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #16\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1693","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1693 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

a pilgrimage: A pilgrimage</p><p>From the dark night of the soul Towards the dawn of the spirit.</p><p>It is not a ritual, it is an inner revolution. It is not a formality,
it is a love affair.</p><p>Unless it is something form your very heart</p><p>It won't work. It is not a question of believing It is not a question
of intellectual conviction. It is a question of falling in love</p><p>With something which one can feel</p><p>But one cannot understand by intellect itself. It is a quantum
leap.</p><p>You may never have done Anything like that before. But good that you
have</p><p>Gathered courage enough to go into it; One hesitates in the
beginning.</p><p>The mind pulls backwards...</p><p>Don't listen to the mind -- listen to the heart!</p><p>Learn more and more listening the heart And follow the heart.</p><p>The mind is not yours,</p><p>It is given by the society.</p><p>The heart is yours, it is given by god himself! If you listen to the
heart</p><p>Meditation will not be difficult It can be achieved.</p><p>And once meditation is achieved Then there is no problem left</p><p>You have clarity, you can see things as they are. Then there is no
question</p><p>Of choosing what to do and what not to do; You immediately know what
to do.</p><p>There is no question of alternatives.</p><p>You simply know this is the right thing to do And one never
repents.</p><p>That is the state of siddho:</p><p>One never repents, one never commits a mistake. The whole world may
think</p><p>That you are committing a mistake</p><p>But as far as your heart is concerned You are totally in it</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>You know it from your very being</p><p>That it is not a mistake and you never repent. You know ultimately it
is going to be good. Maybe right now it is impossible</p><p>To conceive what will be the ultimate outcome But the heart knows far
better because the heart Lives in the deepest of the mysteries of
existence. For the heart there is not past and no future, There is only
present.</p><p>Once meditation is fulfilled</p><p>Once you have achieved meditation</p><p>Your life has a smoothness, a grace, a beauty.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=no-man-is-an-island>No Man is an Island</h3><p>Chapter #16</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

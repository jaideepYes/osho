It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Linda) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Linda. Anand means bliss. Linda means beautiful.\nBliss is the only real beauty in existence Everything else is superficial Everything else is phony.\nOnly bliss is our ultimate truth Only bliss is not false because It comes from our deepest core\nFrom the very roots of our being. It arises out of the center.\nEverything else is on the circumference\nExcept bliss -- hence the search for bliss:\nIt is really the search for one's own being, It is the search for self-knowledge\nIt is the search to discover one's own nature.\nThe moment we know who we are, bliss happens Or vice versa: The moment we are blissful\nWe know who we are.\nBliss is the taste of our being, the flavour The fragrance of our being.\nAnd once the bliss has happened -- 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd everybody is entitled for it It is everybody's birthright...\nIf it doesn't happen, only we are responsible: We are not searching and seeking for it\nWe are not really interested Involved into the search,\nWe are not intense enough to go into the depth.\nWe talk about it but we don't risk anything. Sannyas is the first step\nOf risking for the search.\nAnd the more you risk, the more you gain. When one is ready to risk all, unconditionally Immediately bliss happens.\nSuddenly it starts welling up. One's whole being becomes full of\nA new kind of joy, untasted before, unknown before. And it transforms everything:\nIt makes everything beautiful\nIt transforms everything into golden.\n(To Elizabeth) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Elizabeth.\nAnand means bliss. Elizabeth means consecrated to god, Surrendered to god. One can be surrendered to god\nOut of despair or, out of bliss.\nAnd from the outside both appear to be the same, They are not; they are diametrically opposite.\nThe surrender that comes out of despair Is of no value at all: It is no surrender, It is failure, it is frustration.\nOne is doing it as the last resort Not out of joy.\nOne is not going into it dancingly\nOne is not moving into it as a celebration. Misery is never a bridge between you and god And the strangest thing is that\nPeople remember god only in misery.\nWhen they are happy they forget all about god -- Who cares about god? For what?\nThey don't need, they are already happy Things are going perfectly well.\nWhen things are not going well Then they start thinking of god. They want to use god as a means\nAnd god cannot be used as a means -- that is ugly That is profane, that is very irreligious.\nGod is the ultimate end. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou can consecrate yourself\nOut of joy only, out of bliss only\nThen only you will not use god as a means, There is no question of using god.\nYou are simply surrendering to him because\nHe has given you so much -- it is out of gratitude It is out of thankfulness.\nYou are not asking anything You are not desiring anything. He has already given so much -- What can we desire?\nA real religious person has no desire To be fulfilled from god: he surrenders In joy, in gratitude.\nAnd that's my whole approach here That's why I don't want to believe in god. I want to love, to live, to laugh\nTo enjoy life so totally that Out of that very enjoyment You start becoming aware\nOf the great gift that existence has given to you.\nAnd then the natural outcome is that\nA thankful starts arising out of your heart Out of the very depths of your being --\nIt is not something in the head\nIt is not cultivated by the priests. One cannot avoid it, it is inevitable. If you have tasted life in its totality If you are drunk with life\nIt is impossible not to feel thankful\nIt is impossible not to bow down to the ultimate Not to say yes to the ultimate.\nAnd when yes comes out of joy It has tremendous beauty.\nAn sannyasin has to be blissful And out of blissfulness, prayer\nAnd out of prayer, the experience of god.\n(To Daniel) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Jayesh. Anand means bliss. Jayesh means the victorious one.\nBliss makes one victorious.\nMoney cannot make one victorious; at the most 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt covers up your property\nIt does not make you rich, remember.\nIt simply helps you to forget your poverty, That's all -- poverty remains, persists\nBut becomes repressed.\nWealth is a way to repress poverty Power is a way\nTo repress your inferiority complex, But you remain inferior\nPower cannot make you superior.\nYou can become the president of a country You can become a prime minister of a country But you remain the same person,\nOnly the label changes, nothing else. It changes nothing in you but\nOne can become hypnotised by the label. People live by labels\nPeople become very hypnotized by labels.\nVincent Van Gogh's paintings were not sold So he used to give to his friends --\nWhat else to do with the paintings? Not even a single painting was sold. When he died even friends\nWere not ready to hang his paintings\nIn their sitting rooms, in their drawing rooms Because those paintings were very strange.\nTo hang them there\nWas thought to become a laughing stock. Anybody will see and he will think,\n'Have you gone mad or something? What is this? What nonsense is this?'\nSo they will accept\nJust not to hurt the feeling of Van Gogh\nBut they will throw the paintings in the basement And then Van Gogh became famous when he died And then people\nStarted searching for his paintings and suddenly Paintings started coming into the drawing rooms Of the kings and the emperors\nAnd the prime minister and the presidents -- Even ordinary people were not ready!\nOne man was hanging a painting in his bathroom Because nobody else will see except himself.\nAnd he can tolerate it -- he is a friend of Van Gogh And the man is dead: Just in his memory\nHe can suffer it. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen Van Gogh's name started becoming famous The painting moved to the drawing room and\nHe was jubilant that he has a real painting.\nBut some critic wrote an article and proved that It is phony, it is not true, it is not authentic\nSo he threw it into the basement -- The same painting.\nBut then there was great controversy\nAnd other critics proved that it was authentic Other scholars proved it was authentic.\nWhen it was proved authentic\nIt came back again into the drawing room. People live by labels! Nobody seems\nTo be interested in the painting itself.\nThe man is more concerned what others say. And these are the power seekers:\nThey are always concerned what others are saying And they completely forget who they are.\nThese are not the victorious people.\nThey may have money, they may have power But they are poor people, very poor\nThey are beggars.\nThey real victorious people are very few. They are the Buddhas, the awakened ones. The are the people who have achieved bliss. And the miracle is that\nIf you want to conquer the world\nIt is a very very arduous task because There are so many competitors\nAnd if you want to conquer yourself There is no competition at all.\nYou can simply go in and conquer yourself -- No fight with anybody\nNo competition with anybody\nNo jealousy, no question of any politics... But people never go inside.\nSannyas means a radical change in your life style Turning your energies inwards\nA one-hundred-eighty degree turn is needed. And bliss is there, just you have to turn in.\nYou have to become again rooted in your being. You have become uprooted,\nThat's why you are miserable. Once you gain roots again 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nInto the soil of your being\nThere will be great greenery and great flowering And life will become a joy.\nEach moment then is so lovely, is so ecstatic\nThat even Alexander the Great\nWill find himself poorer in comparison.\nHe had really found him poorer in comparison When he came to India and met few mystics. He wept! -- because he could see the point That he has wasted his life\nAnd these people have nothing, still They are so blissful, so peaceful\nAs if they own the whole world.\nAnd I own the whole world and I am so miserable. So what is the point of owning the whole world?\nIn fact there is no point -- but it was to late.\nHe had gone back with a deep decision in his mind That one he is back home\nHe will start pondering over the matter\nOf inner journey, of inner conquest because He has heard many stories here...\nBuddha was still in the air --\nJust three hundred years had passed: Buddha was still very much alive.\nWhen Alexander came, Buddha's vibe\nWas still very much all over the country.\nWherever he went he found many enlightened people Buddha had left a great chain\nOf enlightened people.\nAnd wherever he went he heard the name of Buddha And the bliss that he had attained\nAnd the truth and the ultimate. He went with the decision\nBut he could not reach home -- he died in the middle He never reached back home, it was too late.\nOtherwise this man had power, had the energy. If he could conquer the whole world\nHe could have conquered himself too, But nobody had told him.\nHe was being taught by\nA stupid philosopher, Plato.\nHe was just a philosopher, he was not a mystic. Although he had lived with Socrates\nAnd he had reported Socrates very authentically He was a good tape recorder, but that's all,\nA good computer, but that's all. He himself was not a mystic.\nHe himself was in search of some mystic. When Alexander was coming to India\nHe had asked him that, 'At least 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBring one sannyasin from India for me as a gift.' But no sannyasin was ready to go.\nSannyasins are not interested in going anywhere They are interested in going only inwards Because that is where their real home is.\nTo go in and become victorious.\n(To Elke) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Pakhi. Anand means bliss; pakhi means a bird -- a bliss bird.\nAnd you look like a bird! -- just ready to be pushed out of the nest and you will be able to fly into the sky.\nWe have wings but we have not used them yet. And because we have not used them, we have become oblivious that they are there. And small wings are not that small; because they can cover the whole sky, their capacity is infinite, immense, immeasurable. There is nothing more beautiful than a bird on the wing.\nThat's what a buddha is: a bird on the wing -- containing the whole sky under his small wings. Moving towards the ultimate frontier of existence, always moving from the known towards the unknown, never afraid of the unknown; in fact,\nalways intrigued with the unknown. Always dropping the known because once you have known it, it is only for stupid people to repeat it. It is sheer stupidity to go on repeating an experience. The intelligent person would like new experiences, new vistas to open up, new visions. And that's what the bird on the wing represents.\nSo keep that as a symbol deep in your heart: all my sannyasins have to become birds. We are all living in cages -- Christian cages, Hindu cages, Mohammedan cages, beautifully decorated: on some cages the Koran is inscribed, on some other cages the Gita is inscribed, on some other cages there is something else...\nsayings of Buddha, Confucius, Moses. And there are golden cages studded with diamonds -- but cages are cages. We are not made to live in cages.\nA sannyasin has to get rid of all cages: of religion, of nation, of caste, of ideology. You have to go on dropping all cages so that one day the whole sky opens up and becomes available to you.\nThat's what god is all about: the whole open sky. And freedom is the only thing worth trying for.\nFreedom achieved, everything follows; without freedom there is no possibility of anything.\nJesus says, \"First ye seek the kingdom of god then all else shall be added unto you.\" That is an old type of expression, but what he means by the kingdom of god is exactly what I mean by freedom. So if I have to say, I will say, \"First seek ye the ultimate freedom then all else shall be added unto you.\"\n(To Marinus) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Vissarjan. Anand means bliss. Vissarjan means dissolved in.\nBliss is possible only\nIf you are ready to dissolve into it.\nJust like a river dissolves into the ocean\nIf you are ready to dissolve into the whole\nBliss is the outcome.\nIf you resist dissolution\nIf you try to remain a separate entity -- That's what everybody is doing:\nTrying to be an ego\nTrying to protect oneself, defend oneself. Everybody is fencing oneself against the whole Everybody is afraid of the whole because\nThe whole is vast, surrounds you from everywhere And we are creating great walls, China Walls\nTo protect ourselves 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOtherwise it will flood us, it will overwhelm us So we make great China Walls\nAnd hide behind them and remain small. This is the way of the stupid man\nBut the majority consists of the stupid people. The intelligent person knows that\nThis is futile, it is an exercise In futility, utter futility.\nWe are not separate, no man is an island. We are part of the continent\nSo it is useless to fight with the continent.\nThere is no need to waste your energy in fighting The same energy can be used into celebrating.\nDissolve into the whole, drop the ego Forget yourself that you are separate And that is the beginning of sannyas. Feel yourself as part of the whole.\nIn the beginning it is only a feeling Slowly slowly it deepens.\nOne day it is not a feeling:\nIt is a truth, it is your being. That day sannyas is fulfilled\nYou have arrived -- you have arrived home! Then bliss is yours and eternal bliss is yours. Then there is not death because\nOnce ego is dropped you cannot die It is the ego that dies.\nIt is a false entity, it is bound to die.\nYou can put all your energies into saving it Still, it is going to die.\nDon't try to do the impossible\nSee the point of it: Live the whole\nAnd forget yourself as a separate entity And then see how beautiful it is\nAnd how sweet it is\nAnd how each moment becomes a benediction. (To Gerda) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Geha Anand means bliss. Geha means home.\nBliss is our true home; without bliss\nWe are homeless wanderers, wanderers in a desert. Without bliss we are refugees\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe don't have a home.\nAnd man's foolishness is such that he\nIs carrying everything he needs within himself\nBut he does not look in.\nHe goes on searching everywhere else Except in his own being... and bliss is there! Hence he never finds bliss.\nHe will find everything else except bliss But that is the only thing worth finding.\nSannyas has to become a revolution in your life. After sannyas you have to live\nIn a totally new style.\nThings that you were never concerned about Will become valuable now; for example Money will not be so valuable as meditation Power trips will not be valuable any more Then inner ecstasies,\nPrestige will not be of your concern any more, But integrity, an inner integration.\nYou will become less and less interested\nIn the outer concerns of the day to day world And you will become more and more concerned About your subjective world,\nWhich has been ignored, neglected for lives\nBut it contains the real treasure\nIt contains the very kingdom of god It contains your real home.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2915","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2915 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

in going only inwards Because that is where their real home is.</p><p>To go in and become victorious.</p><p>(To Elke) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Pakhi. Anand means bliss;
pakhi means a bird -- a bliss bird.</p><p>And you look like a bird! -- just ready to be pushed out of the nest
and you will be able to fly into the sky.</p><p>We have wings but we have not used them yet. And because we have not
used them, we have become oblivious that they are there. And small wings
are not that small; because they can cover the whole sky, their capacity
is infinite, immense, immeasurable. There is nothing more beautiful than
a bird on the wing.</p><p>That's what a buddha is: a bird on the wing -- containing the whole
sky under his small wings. Moving towards the ultimate frontier of
existence, always moving from the known towards the unknown, never
afraid of the unknown; in fact,</p><p>always intrigued with the unknown. Always dropping the known because
once you have known it, it is only for stupid people to repeat it. It is
sheer stupidity to go on repeating an experience. The intelligent person
would like new experiences, new vistas to open up, new visions. And
that's what the bird on the wing represents.</p><p>So keep that as a symbol deep in your heart: all my sannyasins have
to become birds. We are all living in cages -- Christian cages, Hindu
cages, Mohammedan cages, beautifully decorated: on some cages the Koran
is inscribed, on some other cages the Gita is inscribed, on some other
cages there is something else...</p><p>sayings of Buddha, Confucius, Moses. And there are golden cages
studded with diamonds -- but cages are cages. We are not made to live in
cages.</p><p>A sannyasin has to get rid of all cages: of religion, of nation, of
caste, of ideology. You have to go on dropping all cages so that one day
the whole sky opens up and becomes available to you.</p><p>That's what god is all about: the whole open sky. And freedom is the
only thing worth trying for.</p><p>Freedom achieved, everything follows; without freedom there is no
possibility of anything.</p><p>Jesus says, "First ye seek the kingdom of god then all else shall be
added unto you." That is an old type of expression, but what he means by
the kingdom of god is exactly what I mean by freedom. So if I have to
say, I will say, "First seek ye the ultimate freedom then all else shall
be added unto you."</p><p>(To Marinus) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Vissarjan. Anand means
bliss. Vissarjan means dissolved in.</p><p>Bliss is possible only</p><p>If you are ready to dissolve into it.</p><p>Just like a river dissolves into the ocean</p><p>If you are ready to dissolve into the whole</p><p>Bliss is the outcome.</p><p>If you resist dissolution</p><p>If you try to remain a separate entity -- That's what everybody is
doing:</p><p>Trying to be an ego</p><p>Trying to protect oneself, defend oneself. Everybody is fencing
oneself against the whole Everybody is afraid of the whole because</p><p>The whole is vast, surrounds you from everywhere And we are creating

China Walls</p><p>And hide behind them and remain small. This is the way of the stupid
man</p><p>But the majority consists of the stupid people. The intelligent
person knows that</p><p>This is futile, it is an exercise In futility, utter futility.</p><p>We are <em>not</em> separate, no man is an island. We are part of the
continent</p><p>So it is useless to fight with the continent.</p><p>There is no need to waste your energy in fighting The same energy can
be used into celebrating.</p><p>Dissolve into the whole, drop the ego Forget yourself that you are
separate And that is the beginning of sannyas. Feel yourself as part of
the whole.</p><p>In the beginning it is only a feeling Slowly slowly it deepens.</p><p>One day it is not a feeling:</p><p>It is a truth, it is your being. That day sannyas is fulfilled</p><p>You have arrived -- you have arrived home! Then bliss is yours and
eternal bliss is yours. Then there is not death because</p><p>Once ego is dropped you cannot die It is the ego that dies.</p><p>It is a false entity, it is bound to die.</p><p>You can put all your energies into saving it Still, it is going to
die.</p><p>Don't try to do the impossible</p><p>See the point of it: Live the whole</p><p>And forget yourself as a separate entity And then see how beautiful

being... and bliss is there! Hence he never finds bliss.</p><p>He will find everything else except bliss But that is the only thing
worth finding.</p><p>Sannyas has to become a revolution in your life. After sannyas you

for example Money will not be so valuable as meditation Power trips will
not be valuable any more Then inner ecstasies,</p><p>Prestige will not be of your concern any more, But integrity, an
inner integration.</p><p>You will become less and less interested</p><p>In the outer concerns of the day to day world And you will become

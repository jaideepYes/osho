Gunther means war.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nNo more war;\nNeither on the outside nor on the inside Neither with others nor with oneself.\nInstead of war create love,\nLove for others and love for yourself.\nA soldier lives in the climate of war And a sannyasin\nIs just the polar opposite of a soldier:\nHe lives in the climate of love. And the beauty of love is\nThat it conquers without conquering\nIt becomes victorious without any effort It becomes victorious through surrender.\n(To Gregory) -- You have a beautiful name -- it exactly Defines sannyas. Gregory means to be watchful, to be\nAware, to be vigilant.\nThis will be your full name: Swami Anand Gregory. Anand means bliss. Gregory means awareness.\nBliss is a by-product of awareness.\nThe more aware you are, the more blissful The less aware you are, the more miserable. You can measure your blissfulness\nAnd you can know how much aware you are. If there is no bliss in your life\nIt means you are fast asleep. Then don't make Any direct effort to become blissful,\nNobody can succeed in that Because bliss is a by-product, You cannot achieve it directly. You have to go via awareness. If you feel you are miserable That simply shows one thing\nIt is an indication that you are unaware\nSo become more aware, become more meditative. And as meditation will deepen\nMisery will disperse\nAnd the same energy that becomes misery Becomes bliss. All that is needed is\nThe mechanism of awareness.\nIt transforms energy, it is a transformer. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is a very scientific process:\nIt refines the energy, it transforms the energy It purifies the energy.\nIt takes out everything that is not needed And only the essential is left.\nAnd once your energy\nHas passed through awareness, bliss explodes. Misery is an indication, so is bliss\nThey are not goals. Nobody can avoid misery\nAnd nobody can avoid unawareness, One can achieve awareness.\nThat is the right direction to work.\n(To Bernd) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Bernd. Dhyan means meditation. Bernd means brave as a bear. Meditation needs great courage because\nIt is the journey towards the ultimate, It is no ordinary journey. It is entering\nInto the most mysterious, the miraculous Hence it is not for the cowards.\nThe cowards can only pray, they cannot meditate And their prayer is false because\nUnless the prayer is rooted in meditation It can never be real and authentic.\nThe temples and the churches and the mosques Are full of cowards.\nThey are praying god to help them\nAnd god has given you everything you need. And he is not going to listen\nTo all this nonsense\nThat goes on in the name of prayer.\nHe has given you intelligence: Now use it! Man has used intelligence\nAnd he has created great science,\nAnd for thousands of years he was praying For the same things\nAnd nothing happened, nothing materialized. Man has dreamt of flying\nFor thousands of years, as long as you go back Man has been always enchanted\nWith the idea of flying --\nBut praying ... it has not worked. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOnce we applied intelligence Man has become able to fly. Man has always wanted\nTo reach to the moon, to the stars\nBut he was praying. Prayer is impotent Because god has given you the intelligence -- Use it! That's what meditation is:\nIt is use of intelligence for the inner journey. When you use intelligence for the objective world Science is created,\nWhen you use intelligence\nFor the inner world, subjective world Religion is created.\nReligion is as much scientific as any science, But certainly it needs more courage than science Because with science you are not involved,\nYou remain just an observer.\nBut when you enter in your own being\nYou have to become a participant; it is risky. The religions of prayer are false\nOnly the religions of meditation are true. And if prayer arises\nOut of intelligence, out of meditation Then prayer too is true, but then\nIt has a totally different flavor. Then it is not asking for something:\nOn the contrary, it is simply thanking god For all that he has already given us.\n(To Francis) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Francis. Deva means divine. Francis means freedom.\nFreedom is the most divine phenomenon Hence never sacrifice your freedom\nFor anything whatsoever, not even for love Because noting is higher than freedom.\nEverything can be sacrificed for freedom Even life\nBut freedom cannot be sacrificed for anything. Even god can be sacrificed for freedom\nBut freedom cannot be sacrificed for god. Buddha does not believe in god\nBut he believes in freedom.\nMahavira never believed in god But he believes in freedom.\nThey could discard the hypothesis of god 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut they could not discard The hypothesis of freedom;\nIn fact, freedom is the real god. And the whole effort of sannyas is To help you to be free\nTo be free from all traditions All orthodoxies, all conventions\nTo be free from all your inner darkness Unconsciousness, instincts, mechanicalness. In a single word, to be free.\nAnd to live in freedom Is to live a spiritual life\nBut your so-called saints live in slavery. They are not free people, they are really\nThe greatest slaves on the earth, Slaves of dead ideas, ideologies. Here you have to learn\nHow to be free, free of everything.\nOnce your consciousness is completely free It is no more imprisoned,\nThe imprisoned splendor is released. For the first time you know\nWho you are, your glory, your beauty.\nAnd that experience is the experience for which Jesus lived and died\nBuddha lived and taught his whole life Socrates sacrificed himself.\nUp to now only for very few people It has been possible\nTo taste that joy of freedom.\nMy effort here is to make it available To as many people as possible.\nThe time has come\nThat the fragrance of freedom Should be spread all over the earth.\n(To Edda) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Sonar. Deva means divine. Sonar means gold.\nMan is both dust and gold, dust and divine. Form the outside he is just dust.\nIf you observe him you cannot find any gold If scientifically you analyse him\nYou will find nothing else but matter. But if you meditatively go\nInto your own interiority You will not find dust at all\nYou will not find matter at all. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou will find a totally different phenomenon. You will find something\nWhich is absolutely non-material: You will find energy, pure energy You will find godliness, spirituality. That is your true being\nDust only make you ... (inaudible)\nSo when you die it is right to say dust unto dust But that is only half truth:\nThe inner being never dies\nBut it can't be seen from the outside. You can see it\nOnly from the innermost core of your being. Once you have seen it within yourself\nYou can see it in others also But the first experience\nHas to happen within yourself. The moment you know that\nYou are more than the body, suddenly\nThe whole existence is more than it appears And that more is its reality,\nAnd that more is eternal, immortal. It knows no death, no birth.\nAnd that more is blissful, it knows no misery. That more is pure light,\nIt has never known any darkness.\n(To Anton) -- This is your name: Swami Purno.\nPurno means the perfect one. Nobody is imperfect\nHence nobody need to be perfect.\nAll that is needed is to live your life totally. Perfection is already there\nWe come from the perfect Hence we can't be imperfect We are born out of the ultimate\nWe are waves in the ocean of god So whatsoever is the quality of god Is the quality of the waves:\nIf god is perfect, we are perfect.\nSo the very idea of becoming perfect is absurd. There is no need to become perfect\nEveryone is already perfect\nBut we are not living that perfection\nIn its totality, we are living at the minimum. We are not using our potential\nWe are using only a minor part of it; 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nScientists say, not more that seven per cent, Ninety-three per cent potential is simply lost. And it was always there, available for us to use. We have all the money that we need\nBut we are living like a beggar, For the simple reason that\nWe have completely forgotten about the treasure. The function of meditation is:\nTo remember it, to discover it. And the only way to discover it\nThe only way to remember it, is to live\nMore totally, more intensely, more passionately So that more and more potential\nIs transformed into the actual.\nWhen you live hundred per cent you are really Using the great opportunity\nThat god has given to you.\nAnd only at the hundred per cent\nThe transformation happens, never before it.\nSo my effort here is not to make you escapists But in the contrary\nTo make you love life as intensely as possible To live each moment as holy as possible\nAnd slowly slowly\nSomething starts unfolding in you And you start discovering yourself.\nThe more challenges you give to yourself, The more you discover.\n(To Marijke) -- This is your name: Ma Anuraga. Anuraga means love.\nLove is my message, the whole message. The small word contains\nEverything that I want to convey to you.\nIf you can live lovingly, nothing else is needed. If you can understand the ways of love\nYou will understand everything else. If you can go on purifying your love From all that is unclean, from all\nThat is not love but pretends to be love, At the peak of that purification\nYou will find god.\nGod is nothing but love in its purest form In its most essential form.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLove, your so-called love\nIs very much contaminated, polluted. The ego is there which is like a poison And the ego never comes alone;\nIt comes with a great army.\nIt comes with anger, with jealousy, with hatred With all kinds of numbers, trips;\nIt wants to dominate\nIt is ready to destroy one's peace It is ready to be destructive\nTo oneself and to the other. It is very suicidal But pretends to be love\nAnd because it pretends to be love We go on being deceived by it.\nBeware of it!\nIt is the ego that does not allow people Flowering, fulfillment, fruition, otherwise Everybody has the seed to become\nA beautiful flower of love, a lotus.\nBut very few people have been able to become For the simple reason\nThat very few people are alert;\nThey can't discriminate what is what.\nWatch how many things are pretending to be love Which are not love, which cannot be love.\nIf they are love; they cannot create misery -- Let that be the criterion: If they create misery Then they are not love, then get rid of them. Love always gives bliss,\nIt can never give misery -- remember it always Never forget it for a single moment.\nBut people are so stupid:\nRather than dropping those ugly things Which go on masquerading as love They are ready to drop love itself.\nThat's what for thousands of years\nMonks and nuns have done: They dropped love. They were ready to drop love but\nThey were not ready to drop jealousy, Possessiveness, domination, ego.\nThey saved ego and they dropped love, They escaped from the world\nBecause world means opportunities for love. They moved into the monasteries.\nMonks lived separately\nNuns lived separately -- they will not meet. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are monasteries\nWhere no woman has ever entered Has never been allowed to enter For the simple reason\nThat any opportunity for love is dangerous. They are so much afraid of love.\nAnd these stupid people have been called saints For centuries.\nHitherto, man's history has been such a history of stupidity that\nFuture is going to laugh at the whole thing, Our children will not be able to believe That people were ready\nTo drop the real thing for the unreal But they were not ready\nTo drop the unreal for the real. That you have to remember.\nYour name will remind you again and again.\n(To Ernst) -- This is your name: Swami Anuragi. It means love.\nLove has nothing to do with relationship It is more a state of being.\nYou have to become a loving person.\nIt is not a question of being in relationship -- I am not saying don't be in relationships;\nBe in as many relationships as possible\nBecause each relationship has its own uniqueness\nAnd each relationship has its own beauty And each relationship contributes its own joy And of course its own suffering, its own pain It has its own dark nights\nAnd its own beautiful days, But that's how one grows:\nThrough darkness, through light Through sweetness, through bitterness. I am not against relationships\nBut one thing has to be clearly in our vision, That ultimately\nLove is more a question of inner state:\nYou have to be loving, Whether in relationship or not That is not the question.\nAnd you have to be loving to all:\nTo the trees, to the birds, to the animals 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo people -- you have to be loving in general. Even if there is nobody\nAnd you are sitting silently, alone, still You have to radiate love: Just a flower Will go on releasing its perfume Whether anybody is there or not,\nJust as a candle will go on giving its light Whether there is anybody or not.\nSo is a loving person:\nHis love is a perfume, his love is a light. If there is nobody to share,\nIt still radiates, it still goes on spreading Because the loving person can't do otherwise. Once that state is attained you become religious. Religion has nothing to do with rituals\nNothing to do with churches and temples, And the Bibles and the Gitas and the Korans. Religion has something to do\nWith an inner state of love.\nIt has nothing to do with god really. If you are loving\nIf you reach to the pinnacle of love God is bound to happen to you.\nThat is inevitable\nSo we need not bother about it\nWe need not even take any note of it We need not even discuss about it.\nIt is inevitable, it follows love like a shadow.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2638","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2638 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

always wanted</p><p>To reach to the moon, to the stars</p><p>But he was praying. Prayer is impotent Because god has given you the
intelligence -- Use it! That's what meditation is:</p><p>It is use of intelligence for the inner journey. When you use
intelligence for the objective world Science is created,</p><p>When you use intelligence</p><p>For the inner world, subjective world Religion is created.</p><p>Religion is as much scientific as any science, But certainly it needs
more courage than science Because with science you are not involved,</p><p>You remain just an observer.</p><p>But when you enter in your own being</p><p>You have to become a participant; it is risky. The religions of
prayer are false</p><p>Only the religions of meditation are true. And if prayer arises</p><p>Out of intelligence, out of meditation Then prayer too is true, but
then</p><p>It has a totally different flavor. Then it is not asking for
something:</p><p>On the contrary, it is simply thanking god For all that he has
already given us.</p><p>(To Francis) -- This is your name: Swami Deva Francis. Deva means

freedom</p><p>For anything whatsoever, not even for love Because noting is higher

To help you to be free</p><p>To be free from all traditions All orthodoxies, all conventions</p><p>To be free from all your inner darkness Unconsciousness, instincts,
mechanicalness. In a single word, to be free.</p><p>And to live in freedom Is to live a spiritual life</p><p>But your so-called saints live in slavery. They are not free people,
they are really</p><p>The greatest slaves on the earth, Slaves of dead ideas, ideologies.
Here you have to learn</p><p>How to be free, free of everything.</p><p>Once your consciousness is completely free It is no more
imprisoned,</p><p>The imprisoned splendor is released. For the first time you know</p><p>Who you are, your glory, your beauty.</p><p>And that experience is the experience for which Jesus lived and
died</p><p>Buddha lived and taught his whole life Socrates sacrificed
himself.</p><p>Up to now only for very few people It has been possible</p><p>To taste that joy of freedom.</p><p>My effort here is to make it available To as many people as
possible.</p><p>The time has come</p><p>That the fragrance of freedom Should be spread all over the
earth.</p><p>(To Edda) -- This is your name: Ma Deva Sonar. Deva means divine.
Sonar means gold.</p><p>Man is both dust and gold, dust and divine. Form the outside he is
just dust.</p><p>If you observe him you cannot find any gold If scientifically you
analyse him</p><p>You will find nothing else but matter.

something</p><p>Which is absolutely non-material: You will find energy, pure energy
You will find godliness, spirituality. That is your true being</p><p>Dust only make you ... (inaudible)</p><p>So when you die it is right to say dust unto dust But that is only
half truth:</p><p>The inner being never dies</p><p>But it can't be seen from the outside. You can see it</p><p>Only from the innermost core of your being. Once you have seen it
within yourself</p><p>You can see it in others also But the first experience</p><p>Has to happen within yourself. The moment you know that</p><p>You are more than the body, suddenly</p><p>The whole existence is more than it appears And that more is its
reality,</p><p>And that more is eternal, immortal. It knows no death, no birth.</p><p>And that more is blissful, it knows no misery. That more is pure
light,</p><p>It has never known any darkness.</p><p>(To Anton) -- This is your name: Swami Purno.</p><p>Purno means the perfect one. Nobody is imperfect</p><p>Hence nobody need to be perfect.</p><p>All that is needed is to live your life totally. Perfection is
already there</p><p>We come from the perfect Hence we can't be imperfect We are born out
of the ultimate</p><p>We are waves in the ocean of god So whatsoever is the quality of god
Is the quality of the waves:</p><p>If god is perfect, we are perfect.</p><p>So the very idea of becoming perfect is absurd. There is no need to
become perfect</p><p>Everyone <em>is</em> already perfect</p><p>But we are not living that perfection</p><p>In its totality, we are living at the minimum. We are not using our

potential is simply lost. And it was always there, available for us to
use. We have all the money that we need</p><p>But we are living like a beggar, For the simple reason that</p><p>We have completely forgotten about the treasure. The function of
meditation is:</p><p>To remember it, to discover it. And the only way to discover it</p><p>The only way to remember it, is to live</p><p>More totally, more intensely, more passionately So that more and more
potential</p><p>Is transformed into the actual.</p><p>When you live hundred per cent you are really Using the great
opportunity</p><p>That god has given to you.</p><p>And only at the hundred per cent</p><p>The transformation happens, never before it.</p><p>So my effort here is not to make you escapists But in the
contrary</p><p>To make you love life as intensely as possible To live each moment as
holy as possible</p><p>And slowly slowly</p><p>Something starts unfolding in you And you start discovering
yourself.</p><p>The more challenges you give to yourself, The more you discover.</p><p>(To Marijke) -- This is your name: Ma Anuraga. Anuraga means
love.</p><p>Love is my message, the whole message. The small word contains</p><p>Everything that I want to convey to you.</p><p>If you can live lovingly, nothing else is needed. If you can
understand the ways of love</p><p>You will understand everything else. If you can go on purifying your
love From all that is unclean, from all</p><p>That is not love but pretends to be love, At the peak of that
purification</p><p>You will find god.</p><p>God is nothing but love in its purest form In its most essential

nobody</p><p>And you are sitting silently, alone, still You have to radiate love:
Just a flower Will go on releasing its perfume Whether anybody is there

share,</p><p>It still radiates, it still goes on spreading Because the loving
person can't do otherwise. Once that state is attained you become
religious. Religion has nothing to do with rituals</p><p>Nothing to do with churches and temples, And the Bibles and the Gitas
and the Korans. Religion has something to do</p><p>With an inner state of love.</p><p>It has nothing to do with god really. If <em>you</em> are loving</p><p>If you reach to the pinnacle of love God is bound to happen to

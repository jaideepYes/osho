It is for reference purposes only.]\n(To Anna) -- This is your name: Ma Dhyan Anna. Dhyan means meditation. Anna means prayer.\nIt has been the ancient idea that Meditation and prayer are totally different, Not only different but polar opposites.\nHence in the past religions became divided. There were two kinds of religions.\nOne, those who belong to prayer --\nChristianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, Hinduism; And the other category was\nThe religions that belonged to meditation -- Taoism, Buddhism, Jainism.\nBut in my vision the very division is wrong. Meditation itself\nIs the essential core of prayer.\nThere is no prayer without meditation And there is no meditation\nWithout a prayerful heart; they are indivisible. To divide them is to kill both of them.\nIt is like cutting a man into two parts,\nThe left and the right: The man will be dead! You can keep the parts\nBut the parts will not be alive.\nLife is possible only with the whole Only the whole is alive, never the parts. The parts are also alive\nWhen they function in the whole. Take them out of the whole\nAnd they lose all meaning.\nMeditation is beautiful, prayer is beautiful But in a deep togetherness.\nMeditation means getting beyond the mind And that's exactly what prayer means.\nTheir ways are a little bit different But they enter into the same temple 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFrom different doors.\nThe doors are not so relevant. Prayer also gets beyond the mind By entering into the heart.\nIts emphasis is on the heart. Meditation also gets beyond mind but\nIts emphasis is on getting beyond the mind. The ultimate result is the same:\nBoth bring to you a profound silence A wordless state of consciousness.\nOnly in that state of silence One can encounter reality\nBecause one's vision becomes absolutely clear, There is nothing to debar, nothing to obstruct. So I am giving you a name which means Meditative prayer or prayerful meditation.\nMy sannyasins have to become The ultimate syntheses.\nThe future needs a religion\nWhich is not divided on any point; A kind of universal religiousness,\nAnd this will become the very cornerstone.\n(To Dennis) -- This is your name: Swami Dhyan Dennis. I am giving you a very paradoxical name\nBecause reality is paradoxical;\nIt contains all the polar opposites in it. Seen in the right perspective\nThey are not thought to be as opposites, They start looking as complementaries. Hence the paradox\nIs only from the lower world of thinking.\nWhen you reach yourself\nTo the peak of no-thought, there is no paradox; You suddenly see the unity of all the opposites. In the ultimate\nThe day and night meet and merge Life and death meet and merge Summer and winter meet and merge -- There is no difference.\nMeditation means awareness Watchfulness, vigilance.\nAnd Dennis represents the god of wine; It means drunkenness.\nIf you think about them they are opposites: 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nEither you can be drunk or you can be aware If you are aware you cannot be drunk\nBut this is from the lower world of thought. From the ultimate, looked from the high above\nThe meditator is the real drunkard: He is drunk with the divine,\nHe is drunk and aware at the same time Simultaneously -- that is one of the most Incredible experiences of life,\nTo be both together. It is very difficult\nTo understand it intellectually\nBecause intellectually they are opposites. Intellect cannot conceive\nThat they can happen together But that is intellect's limitation.\nWhen physicists for the first time discovered That the ultimate particle, electron\nWhich is the constituent of all matter, Behaves very paradoxically\nThey were at a loss -- to describe it: It behaves as a particle\nAnd also as a wave -- simultaneously. It was impossible\nFor the scientists to describe it.\nEither something can be a particle -- A particle means simply a dot,\nIt can't be a line, simultaneously. A line means many dots\nA single dot is not a line. A wave is a line. For many years there was a great controversy How to describe it\nBecause it does not fit in the ordinary logic. Then they have to listen to reality.\nWhat can they do?\nIf reality is behaving in that mad way\nWe have to describe it the way it is behaving We have to put our logic aside;\nOur logic can't be that important. They tried in every possible way To make some logical statement But is was impossible.\nFinally they decided, that it is both together. Since that day, physics has become metaphysics. Since that day\nPhysicists have started talking like mystics,\nThey had to. And now no great physicist can say That mystics are paradoxical;\nNow they know themselves that You cannot avoid paradox When you encounter reality.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe physicists\nHave encountered reality in an objective way The mystics\nHave encountered reality in a subjective way. The physicist has gone into the object\nDeep to the ultimate core\nAnd the mystic has gone into consciousness Deep into the ultimate core\nAnd both have come the same conclusion: That it is paradoxical.\nSo your name will mean alert drunkenness. Now it is up to you\nTo figure it out what is means!\nIt may take your whole life to find out! But if you can find it out\nYou would have discovered something Of immense value.\n(To Margret) -- This is your name: Ma Anand Dwaro. Anand means bliss. Dwaro means a door.\nBliss is the door to the divine.\nIt is only through bliss what we can\nCreate a bridge, between us and the ultimate. Never try to approach god through misery -- And that's how people try:\nThey go on crying and weeping in deep anguish, They remember god only\nWhen they are in utter misery.\nWhenever life is going good, who cares about god? But those are the real moments to remember god When life is going good.\nAlmost everybody thinks once in a while Of religion, meditation, prayer, god,\nBut almost at the wrong time:\nWhen you are in some misery.\nA beloved has died - then you remember But not while making love\nAnd the right moment is while making love. But that is the time\nWe don't bother at all about god.\nEven if he knocks on the door, we won't open; We will tell him, 'Wait! Don't disturb!\nLeave us alone, Don't you have any sense? Is this the time to disturb, to interfere?' But those are the moments\nWhen you are enjoying, flowing, flowering 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen you are in a dance -- right moments When just a little bit of remembering\nAnd the door can be open unto you. Jesus is right; he says,\n'Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.'\nBut he has forgotten one thing that Don't knock at the wrong times.\nKnock at the right time.\nHe says, 'Ask and it shall be given to you.' He is perfectly right but\nThis is a half statement.\nThe other, far more important half is missing: Never ask at the wrong time.\nAnd the right time to ask is\nWhen there is nothing to ask but only to thank. In fact god functions almost like banks:\nIf you need money, they won't give it to you If you don't need, they will chase you!\nSo whenever you ask something\nYou desire something, god escapes immediately! He is the oldest, ancientmost Jewish banker!\nWhen you don't need ANYthing\nWhen your life is fulfilled and contented Just remember him\nAnd he is just standing by your side Ready to shower everything upon you.\nThis is one of the fundamental laws of life:\nIt is not for beggars, it is for emperors. My sannyasins\nHave to learn the way of the emperors.\n(To Gottfried) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Chaitanyo. Anand means bliss. Chaitanyo means consciousness.\nRemember these two words -- they are key words: Be blissful and be conscious\nBe blissfully conscious, be consciously blissful And then you need not bother about anything else. The whole of religion\nIs contained in these two simple words. No need to believe in any god\nNo need to believe is any afterlife\nNo need to believe in any heaven or hell, In fact, no need to believe at all.\nIf you can follow these two words in your life 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIf they can become a climate around you\nIf you can imbibe them as a style of your life Then all else will follow on its own accord.\n(To Gudrun) -- This is your name: Ma Prem Sonyo Prem means love. Sonyo means gold.\nLove is the most precious thing in life. Love as much as you can,\nDon't be a miser in loving. People are miserly;\nThey want everybody else to love them But they don't give anything.\nThis is the misery of the whole world.] This world can OVERflow with love\nBut the problem is: everybody wants to grab And nobody is ready to give;\nHence people start starving.\nAnd this is a far greater starvation. Just as the body needs nourishment Your soul also needs nourishment; Love is your soul's nourishment.\nBut for thousands of years\nWe have been conditioned against love. And everybody goes on hoarding, as if\nIf you can give love, you will be losing something -- That is not the economics of love.\nIf you give you will have more. It is an inexhaustible source\nYou cannot exhaust it. You can go on giving You will never be empty of it.\nIf everyone starts giving love\ninstead of talking about love\nThis very earth can become a paradise. One old man went to the doctor.\nHe was looking very fragile, very weak.\nThe doctor examined him, a thorough examination -- Must have been a German hospital\nBecause in India you cannot find Anything like 'thorough examination'! German doctors really go to the very roots.\nEven he had not said what he was suffering from, The doctor immediately told him,\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n'Undress,' so he undressed.\nHe examined his whole body and then said, 'But I don't see anything wrong.'\nThe man started giggling and he said, 'But my teeth are aching!'\nThe doctor said, 'Why didn't you say it before?' And the man said, 'I thought you were going To the very root of the problem.'\nBut the doctor said, 'It is good. I have looked at your body.\nTeeth will be taken care of\nBut one thing more I have to suggest to you That you cut your sex life to half\nBecause you are old and you are weak And if you don't cut your sex life to half You will die soon.'\nThe man said, 'Okay, but which half? -- Thinking about it or talking about it?'\nBut that's how people's love life is: Thinking about it and talking about it. That is their whole love life.\nNobody is really sharing, giving.\nMy sannyasins have to love to give, share, And share with the whole existence.\nNot only with human beings --\nWith trees, with rocks, with the stars With the moon, with the sun.\nBe in a loving state constantly\nIn a deep love affair with existence. That is prayer, that is meditation And that will transform you,\nThat will bring a totally new being in you: You will be reborn through it.\nNo Man is an Island Chapter #14\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2057","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_man_is_an_island/>No Man Is An Island</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2057 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Man_Is_An_Island/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Dwaro means a door.</p><p>Bliss is the door to the divine.</p><p>It is only through bliss what we can</p><p>Create a bridge, between us and the ultimate. Never try to approach

real moments to remember god When life is going good.</p><p>Almost everybody thinks once in a while Of religion, meditation,
prayer, god,</p><p>But almost at the wrong time:</p><p>When you are in some misery.</p><p>A beloved has died - then you remember But not while making love</p><p>And the right moment is <em>while</em> making love. But that is the
time</p><p>We don't bother at all about god.</p><p>Even if he knocks on the door, we won't open; We will tell him,

remembering</p><p>And the door can be open unto you. Jesus is right; he says,</p><p>'Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.'</p><p>But he has forgotten one thing that Don't knock at the wrong
times.</p><p>Knock at the right time.</p><p>He says, 'Ask and it shall be given to you.' He is perfectly right
but</p><p>This is a half statement.</p><p>The other, far more important half is missing: Never ask at the wrong
time.</p><p>And the right time to ask is</p><p>When there is nothing to ask but only to thank. In fact god functions
almost like banks:</p><p>If you need money, they won't give it to you If you don't need, they
will chase you!</p><p>So whenever you ask something</p><p>You desire something, god escapes immediately! He is the oldest,
ancientmost Jewish banker!</p><p>When you don't need ANYthing</p><p>When your life is fulfilled and contented Just remember him</p><p>And he is just standing by your side Ready to shower everything upon
you.</p><p>This is one of the fundamental laws of life:</p><p>It is not for beggars, it is for emperors. My sannyasins</p><p>Have to learn the way of the emperors.</p><p>(To Gottfried) -- This is your name: Swami Anand Chaitanyo. Anand
means bliss. Chaitanyo means consciousness.</p><p>Remember these two words -- they are key words: Be blissful and be
conscious</p><p>Be blissfully conscious, be consciously blissful And then you need
not bother about anything else. The whole of religion</p><p>Is contained in these two simple words. No need to believe in any
god</p><p>No need to believe is any afterlife</p><p>No need to believe in any heaven or hell, In fact, no need to believe

Sonyo means gold.</p><p>Love is the most precious thing in life. Love as much as you can,</p><p>Don't be a miser in loving. People are miserly;</p><p>They want everybody else to love them But they don't give
anything.</p><p>This is the misery of the whole world.] This world can OVERflow with
love</p><p>But the problem is: everybody wants to grab And nobody is ready to

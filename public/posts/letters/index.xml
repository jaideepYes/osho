‌CHAPTER 2
Letters to Ma Dharm Jyoti
FIRST PUBLISHED IN OTI 1 SEPTEMBER 1990
Beloved Dharm Jyoti,
Love. Don’t ever repress the mind. Repression is a disease.
And that which is repressed will never be completed. It comes back again and again to attack you.
The mind is to be understood.
Finally, only understanding the mind becomes the solution. Repression is merely postponement of diseases.
The path is neither in indulgence nor repression.</description>

It is how trust arises. Trust arises out of the dark night of doubt. One has to go deep into doubt to find trust. Trust is not something that you can find by dropping the doubt. If you drop the doubt forcibly your trust will always remain shaky. It will be at the most a belief, not a true faith – and belief is impotent. It appears to be like trust but it is not; deep down there is doubt. On the surface, belief; at the centre, doubt. It is better to have the doubt on the surface and trust at the centre – that is far better, and that’s what your situation is. At the centre there is trust; you are not aware of it because you are not aware of your centre either. On the circumference there is doubt. You are aware only of doubt because you are aware only of your personality, not of your essence. But I can see: the trust is there, the seed is there. It is trying to come out. Soon it will be available to your consciousness... just a little more waiting.\nThat’s why I am sending you back; otherwise I would have told you to stay. I say to stay only when I see that your circumference and centre have fallen in harmony, that you are one, because only then will being here be of any value; then only can you really be with me. Otherwise whether you are in England or in Poona will not make much difference.\nI am sending you knowing that you will be sad, that you will be in a kind of suffering and agony. You would have liked me to tell you to stay but that will be against your own growth. One day you are going to be here and forever, but that day we have to wait for, and we cannot force it right now. A forced thing never works. A forced thing remains pseudo, creates a kind of hypocrisy. And because I can see that the possibility will soon become an actuality, I am ready to let you suffer a little bit. This suffering is good.\nIf I say to you ‘Stay, don’t go,’ then too you will suffer, and that suffering will be bad because half of you wants to go and half of you wants to be here. If you are here, the other half that wants to go will make all kinds of troubles for you, all kinds of interferences with your being here. It will find all the negatives that are possible. It will continuously argue with you: ‘Look what you have done and I have always been saying to you “Go back home.”’ It will make you more and more shaky and wavering. It will work on you with a vengeance. If you go back, just the opposite will be the case.\nThis is the inner alchemy. This has to be understood: if you go back then the part that wants to be here with me will suffer and will find all the positives, will find all the negatives there, and sooner or later will be able to defeat the negative part. And the positive ultimately wins; we just have to give it a right situation, a right space to happen.\nSo on the surface it looks as if I am sending you; deep down this is the only way for you to be here one day. This is the only way that you will come closer and closer to me; far away there you will think more of me. Far away you will see the utter uselessness of the part that says ‘Be in England.’ There is nothing.You have lived there, you have lived a certain kind of life – maybe it is convenient and\ncomfortable, secure. Here life may not be so secure, may not be so comfortable, but here life will be growing and there you will only be dying. There you will be in a kind of stagnant stasis. You will live with the past but you will not have any future. You will live in a comfortable grave; that’s how people are living.\nHere my whole work is to pull you out of your comfortable grave. To come out of the grave is risky. To come out of the grave after a long time, into the sun, in the wind, in the rains, looks insecure. But that’s how life grows.\nYou can put a potted plant in the room: it may survive but it will lose lustre, it will lose joy, it will lose life. It may survive and comfortably – there will be no wind and no danger and no rain and no sun burning hot and showering fire, no fear of animals or anybody destroying it in a beautifully modern decorated drawing-room. The pot can be there, the plant can be there, it can survive but it will survive at the minimum.\nBack in the garden, surrounded by all kinds of dangers, it is not only a survival, it is a celebration. Then it will have the joy that happens when you accept challenges and the growth that happens when you fight with challenges, when you overcome them.\nLife should be an adventure, and sannyas is nothing but an adventure into your inner world. I know your longing and I trust your longing and I will wait for the right moment when you can say with your total heart that this is the only place where you would like to be, whatsoever the cost. Then this is your home! But I will have to wait and you will have to wait for the total mind to say it. And that day is not far away, so don’t be worried.\n[Her child asks: What is my meditation?.I don’t know what a meditation is.]\nThat’s good! Mm, but you want to know? Mm mm. Start dancing! Wild dance is your meditation.\n[To the mother] Tell him to go to the music group in the night so he can start dancing there, [to the child] and when you are back home for at least twenty minutes, thirty minutes every night, dance. Put on any music and dance, enjoy dancing, and that will be your meditation.\nAnand means bliss, mandir means a temple – a temple of bliss. Man is born to be blissful. To miss it is our own responsibility. You cannot blame anybody else if you miss bliss in life. People go on blaming others. That is just an effort to save their own face, but it is foolish. And the more you blame others, the less is the possibility of your becoming blissful. To blame others means that your bliss depends on others; you have taken a very wrong standpoint from the very beginning.\nBliss does not depend on anybody else; it is independent. It is your self-nature: it is already there, just to be recognized, welcomed. It has to be accepted, not produced, because it is already the case. To blame others means you have moved in a wrong direction. Now you will always think that others are preventing you from being blissful, and you can always find a thousand and one causes for not being blissful. Not a single cause is valid.\nMisery comes from outside, misery has causes outside; bliss does not come from outside. It is you, your very being. It is uncaused; it is not an effect of some cause. Once this is understood the blaming mind stops. And to stop the blaming mind is to take a tremendously significant turn. Then you start looking in a different direction. If you are not feeling blissful that means you are not being harmonious with your being, that’s all; that you are not in tune with your being, that’s all; that your mind is moving in a different way from your real nature; that there has come a disparity between you and your mind; that the mind is dragging you towards the south and your being is going towards the north – hence the problem. When the mind follows like a shadow, when you are the master and the mind is the slave and when it is always in tune with you, there is always bliss.\nRespect the body because it is the temple. It is the most beautiful thing that has happened in nature. But people condemn the body too; those condemnors will find something or other. They will condemn the society, they will condemn the economic structure, they will condemn this and that – education, parents, family. And when they cannot find anybody else to condemn, when they have moved alone into the forest, they will condemn their own body; the old habit persists. They will say ‘It is because of the body, this wretched body, this enemy. It is driving me crazy and because of it I cannot feel peace and blissful. Sol have to get rid of the body.’ Then they start trying to get rid of the body, and in the name of spirituality many schools of suicide continue in the world; they are just suicidal. Then they start torturing the body, fasting, beating the body, making everything as uncomfortable, as inconvenient as possible. They devise new methods and means of masochism. But this is not the way to be blissful. And when you destroy the temple, you are hurting the deity within.\nThe temple is a beautiful shelter for the deity. Use it, love it, and try to find out what is hidden in it. God is hidden in it.\nDeva means god, paro means transcendental. God is another name of the beyond; god is not a person. God is the unknowableness of existence... the mysteriousness of existence, the unfathomableness of existence. To reduce god to a person is to destroy the whole beauty of the idea. Then people start worshipping, because god becomes a person. What else is there to do? – worship, praise, pray. This is how religion goes on the wrong track.\nThe moment god becomes the mysteriousness of life there is no question of worship but of enquiry, of adventure, of exploration. When god becomes the unknowableness of life then religion need not become worship. Then religion has to become wonder, awe... and then it is tremendously alive.\nWorship is dead, wonder is alive. So I say wonder is real worship. To be in awe is to be in prayer. Whenever you are in awe your mind stops of its own accord.\nSeeing a beautiful sunset the mind stops, maybe only for a few seconds or just for a second, but in that very second there is prayer. In that vibrant, alive moment you are transported into another world. The beauty of the sunset has taken you into the mystery of mysteries, into the holy of holies. For a moment you are not a mind but an expanded consciousness, unbounded. You are no more confined in the body – you are as vast as the sky itself. For a moment the observer becomes the observed: you are not there separate from the sunset looking at it, you are it... and that is the moment of prayer. Not a single word is uttered and the prayer is complete. You have not even bowed down and you are surrendered. You have not quoted the Bible or the Koran or the Geeta, but in that moment is contained all the Bibles and all the Korans and all the Geetas.\nThis is the meaning of the transcendental; and once you start thinking of the transcendental, you will find god, any moment, anywhere. A bud is becoming a flower and you will see the transcendental beauty of it. Suddenly in the silence of the night a bird starts calling and the silence becomes deepened... and there is the transcendental! Somebody looks towards you with great love and in those eyes, in that moment, in that contact, is the transcendental.\nOnce god is not a person you will come across him here and there and everywhere. Jesus says ‘Cut the wood and you will find me there. Turn the stone, and look – I am there!’ Then each leaf has a beauty, each stone has a divineness and each moment becomes suffused, luminous, with the unknown and the unknowable.\nTo live in this utter grandeur of life is to be a sannyasin.\nDeva means divine, hanso means a swan – it is a metaphor for the soul: the divine swan. In India the swans live deep in the Himalayas. They come only to the plains when it is too cold there; and when the season is over, the winter is over, they go back. When they are on the plains they suffer very much... nostalgia for the Himalayas, the virgin beauty of the Himalayas, the silence. And the lake Mansarovar where they live in the Himalayas has the purest water in the world. Man has not yet reached there to pollute it. I think it will be the last place in the world to be polluted. Rarely, once in a while, a traveller, a pilgrim, reaches there... very rarely.\nNaturally the swans suffer very much because here they have to live in dirty ponds – muddy, polluted, poisoned, and the noise, the people, the ugliness – so they continuously dream of Mansarovar, of the lake in the Himalayas. They continuously think about how to go back. Even to wait for the few months of winter is too difficult; they feel homesick.\nBecause of this the metaphor arose that the human soul is a swan, a white swan. Its home is in god, hence on the earth, in the world, it suffers and it longs to go back to god. Religion is nothing but a return journey. It is a search for the home, a search for the source, a search for the original face.\nRemember: man is an outsider in the world; hence the feeling of alienation. One cannot feel at home here. We do everything to make ourselves at home but still something deep down goes on saying ‘This is not the place. Sooner or later we will have to leave; it is not more than a caravanserai, just an overnight’s stay and in the morning we will have to go.’ Deep down someone goes on saying\n‘Remain detached. Don’t get too entangled because soon you will have to leave and all those entanglements will become a very deep misery. Remain unattached, aloof. Just be a passer-by, a pilgrim who passes through many places but never makes any place his home.’\nThis world is a pilgrimage – don’t get lost in it. Even while you are in it, go on remembering god. [Osho speaks in Hindi to an Indian sannyasin and then in English:]\nNo, nobody can succeed by trying. Trying to forget means that you are again remembering. Trying to forget means remembering and remembering. The very effort to forget will not allow you to forget. That is not the way. Just the opposite will be the result if you try to forget something. Nobody can try to forget.\nHave you not heard the famous story...? A politician was continuously going to see a saint and he was asking again and again ‘Give me a mantra so that I can become the Prime Minister of the country. You are an enlightened one and you know all the secrets of life. Why not give me a little key? This is my only ambition.’\nTired of the politician, to be finished with him, the saint said one day ‘Okay, now I will give you one – this is the mantra, just a small mantra. Five minutes chanting of the mantra will do, but remember only one thing: while you are chanting it, don’t think of the monkey.’\nThe politician said ‘This is so simple. I have never been thinking of the monkey. For my whole life I have never thought about the monkey. Why should I think about the monkey? What kind of condition is this?’\nThe saint said ‘Then you can go. Just take a good bath, sit silently, repeat the mantra for five minutes, but remember: don’t remember the monkey, that’s all. That is the only condition to be fulfilled.’\nThe politician was awake the whole night. He would take a bath again, would sit for five minutes and would try, but the moment he tried, monkeys and monkeys – not one but many! He tried and tried to forget the monkeys and the more he tried to forget, the more they were there mocking him and shouting at him and making faces at him. By the morning he was almost mad!\nHe rushed to the saint and said ‘What have you done? If you had not told me about this monkey I would have succeeded, but now it seems impossible – in this life. This mantra won’t be of any use, because that monkey I cannot forget. It is impossible and I have tried all that I can do to forget it.’\nNow, this is a simple psychological process: if you want to forget you will never forget. That is not the right way. One thing – this has to be understood: never try to forget anything, otherwise you will never forget.\nThe second thing: people think that because they have loved so much, that’s why they cannot forget. That is wrong, utterly wrong. You may feel hurt when I say that. People cannot forget because they have not loved enough; hence there is a guilt feeling. If you have really loved the woman then there is no problem. But the problem is that nobody loves enough. It is not only a question of you: nobody loves enough. And when the woman is there, who bothers? Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow – we\nwill love tomorrow. Today let us fight then tomorrow we will love. And today there are small things, just small things and quarrels, and everything... jealousies and possessiveness and domination. We hope that tomorrow everything will settle. We will become wiser and she will become wiser and then there will be great love.\nNow, the problem is that tomorrow will never come. The woman is dead, so you are feeling guilty. It is not because of love. Love can forgive and forget. Love has that capacity to forgive and forget. Love is immensely powerful.\nThe question is guilt. You are feeling guilty: you didn’t love the woman as you should have and now there is no opportunity left. Now you will not see her again, never meet her again; now that unfulfilled love haunts you. You would like to cry and weep and ask forgiveness of her and say ‘While you were here I couldn’t do anything for you. Now you are gone and I cannot do anything because I don’t know where you are, or whether you are or not.’\nThis creates the problem, so this is the second thing to understand. If you go on thinking that you are remembering her because of your love, then you will never forget, because that gives you a great joy – that it is because of love. You are not like others: their woman dies and the next day they are ready to marry again, you are not like those people. You are taking a great ego interest in it, that you loved so much you cannot forget. Now the very idea of love will be an ego gratification. These are the tricks of the mind that have to be understood. It is nothing to do with love.\nIf you loved the woman, it is over. She is gone and you loved her as much as you could. What more could you have done? Even if she was alive your love would have been just a repetition, and all repetitions are boring, they are tedious. What else was there to do? All that you could do you have done. It is not because of love. But the mind is very cunning: it hides things behind beautiful names. Guilt is there; the mind will label it love, and then it can protect it. Once you see it is guilt you will not protect it, you will not feel any ego satisfaction in it. The guilt has to be dropped.\nThe third thing to be understood is: our commitment is not towards persons, our commitment is towards love itself. If you are really ready to understand, that woman was only a personification of womanhood, one form of womanhood, and there are millions of women in the world, all forms of the same womanhood. Start loving again! My own understanding is this, that if you have enjoyed a woman’s love, you owe it to her to start loving somebody else. If love has been such a deep satisfaction then you will be committed to love.\nThe people who never get married again because the woman died or the man died go on bragging that because they loved so much they cannot get he married. All nonsense! In fact their love has been such a failure that they are afraid to go into it again. If love has really been a success, they will immediately be ready to go into another love experience, with another form of womanhood, with another form of manhood.\nThe commitment is to be towards love – and there is no betrayal in it; you are not betraying anybody. Those ideas have to be dropped. In the Indian mind particularly those ideas are very deep – that if you get married, if you love another woman, you are betraying. That is nonsense! If you don’t go into love again, that is betrayal – betraying love, betraying the woman. It is an insult to the woman who died, because she could not make you so satisfied with love that you would like to have the\nexperience again with somebody else. She made you so nauseated with love that you have become afraid of moving into another relationship again.\nMy approach is totally different: if you really loved that woman, love again; love again and again and again. And you will be surprised that when you are again in love with another woman you will feel tremendously grateful to the woman who has died. She has made you so in tune with love. She has given you the taste of love so that now you can love again, so that you can love somebody else too. And if you love the other woman you will find the same energy again, because it is the same energy; only forms are different. Man and woman – there are only two lovers in the whole world. All else is just non-essential.\nSo become available to love again. Otherwise your love energy will remain stuck, and with nowhere to flow it will start moving in a vicious circle, remembering the woman again and again and making a wound inside. It will become ill. It will be like a psychological cancer. And the woman who has left you will not be happy; she will suffer because you will be suffering. Wherever she is she will suffer. If she really loved you, she will be happy when you are again flowing, loving, enjoying. In those moments of enjoyment you will feel grateful to the woman, and that will be true love.\nSo my suggestion is: find another woman, and this time don’t get married. This time, fall in love and then get married. Let love be first and marriage second; this will be the right approach. Otherwise you will become pathological, unnecessarily ill and suffering. And there is no point in it. We all have to go; sooner or later you will die. Before you die, let your love flow; let somebody become happy through your love. Share it!\nYou have come to the right person! If you go anywhere else in this country you will find wrong suggestions given to you. This country carries a very very morbid mind. And they will help you – they will say ‘You are great!’ They will say ‘This is how one should be. You are a true Indian; you represent the true image of India.’ You simply represent a kind of pathological tradition.\nDrop all that nonsense!\nFeel happy and start moving again. One should not be finished by so small a thing. Love is greater than persons. Persons come and go – love continues. And you are alive, you can breathe. Don’t feel any betrayal.\nThis country has even done that! In the past this country created the idea in women’s minds that if their husband is dead they don’t have the right to breathe, because that is betrayal. So they should jump in the funeral pyre with him, become a ‘sati’, bury themselves alive. What ugliness – supporting suicide! And poor women have been killing themselves because the idea was planted in their minds ‘When your husband is dead, how can you live? To live means you are betraying. Even in living you are betraying!’ Now we know that was nonsense.\nIn the same way sooner or later the country will have to understand that when you are alive you have to love too. Love is a function of life just as breathing is. If you can breathe, if you can eat, if you can take a bath, if you can sleep, then why not love? To destroy your love means to live half-heartedly, and then naturally you will think of the past. You will remain past-oriented because there is no future. You know now you are not going to love anybody, so all that you can do is to\ngo again into those memories and make them more and more painted and colourful. They may not have been as beautiful as you are thinking, but a hungry mind will paint them very colourful and very beautiful.\nNever get too attached to the past, because the past is gone and gone forever. Remain available to the present and to the future. That is the meaning of being alive: if you are alive you have to breathe, you have to love, you have to share. This has to be the change that you have to bring... and with this sannyas, let the whole past disappear.\n[A sannyasin says: I’ve been feeling, especially for the last week, that I’ve had tastes and experiences of bliss, ecstasy and the divine. In the last week I’ve been experiencing a lot of pain as I experience all my blocks and how asleep I am and how much my mind distracts. It’s very uncomfortable.]\nI can feel everything. Mm mm.… It is something very meaningful – even this pain. It happens only when your energy starts moving into new spaces where it has never moved before. It is the beginning of something tremendously important, but because it is new the body will have to go through a few pains, because new paths have to be created for the energy.\nAnd you need not be worried: the energy will create the paths itself because you have enough energy. The problem is when the energy is not enough and the path has to be created. When the river has enough water, no need to worry; the very amount of water creates its way. And so is the case with energy: you have more than you need, so it is going to break all those blocks in you. They are not to be removed, there is no need to remove them. They have to be removed when the energy is not enough to remove them; then outer processes have to be used.\nFor example, Rolfing can be helpful but only when the energy is not enough. Postural Integration is helpful but only when the energy is not enough. But when the energy is like a flood, no Rolfing, no Postural Integration is needed. The energy will come and take all the rocks away; it will make its own path. And you are fortunate to have more than you need. But it is clashing with the rocks so there will be pain, but accept this pain as a growth pain.\nDon’t think of it as a disease. Feel joyous about it, that your energy is moving and creating new paths. And with those new paths you will start finding new places of being. These days that you have been here have been really significant. Something of immense value has started moving. Just do two things.…\nOne is: continue to meditate every day – one meditation. But choose one and then insist on the same; don’t change it. You can choose any one that you like, but let it be something very active – Dynamic, Kundalini, Nataraj – anything dynamic that will help the energy to move faster.\nAnd the second thing that you have to do is: before you go to sleep in the night, just lie down, turn the lights off, lie down under your blanket, and feel your body is dying. Start from the toes and feel that they are dying and move slowly upwards: the legs are dying, the thighs are dying; go on moving upwards and let the whole body die. It will take at least five to seven minutes; slowly slowly you come to the head and all is dead. When you feel that all is dead, finished, that the body is a corpse, then do a small meditation which will be of immense help.\nStart feeling that great light is entering from the head, golden light – as if suddenly a sun has risen and it is pouring all its gold into you. It is going in, going in, going in... the whole body has become a hollow bamboo and the light is falling in and passing through like a flood, and it goes out from the toes. For five minutes let this happen, then after five minutes – just approximately, you need not look at the watch, just approximately – after five minutes change the whole process. Now start thinking of a dark energy, negative – like a dark night with not a single star in it, a dark energy flow entering from the toes, moving upwards, filling the whole bamboo, the hollow body, and going out from the head. Five minutes of that, and then go to sleep.\nThis will synchronize the positive and negative energy inside your body. It will synchronize your man and woman inside the body, your yin and yang, your day and night, your life and death. First life, the golden light, then death, the darkness... and enjoy both, because both are beautiful. This for five and the first part for five minutes, and seven minutes first to have the body absolutely dead so it creates no hindrance.\nThis passing of the golden light and the darkness will help tremendously. Every day you will feel those blocks are disappearing for no other work is needed on them. And one meditation every day.\n[The previous year a sannyasin, when he took sannyas, told Osho he felt negative about it. Now he says he will stay “as long as I can stand it”.]\nGood. Mm mm. (pause) Then it will not be very long! If it is a question of standing it, it is not going to be very long. But try – as long as you can stand. I was thinking that you would be a little less negative this time, but I don’t think.…\nThis is up to you.… But if it is too much torture, why bother? If it is like something that you have to stand, why bother at all? Unless it is a joy there is no need to be in it. So decide about it: if it is a joy to be here, be here! I am the last person in the world to make somebody miserable, and misery is written so large on your face. But only you are responsible for it, because I am not in favour of misery. If you create it that is your responsibility.…\nSo if you can do [groups], do. But if it becomes too much, unbearable, and you feel it difficult, then please forget all about it! Either be here in a joyous way.… Then only can you gain something, because it is only in joy that one gains; it is only in joy that one receives. My energy is not such that you can receive it when you are sad and serious and negative; you will not receive it at all. And it is not that I am not giving it to you – I may go on giving, but you will not be able to receive it.\nUnless you are positive, welcoming and cooperating, nothing can be done. I am utterly helpless with people like you. And you will think that I have not been doing something. I am ready to do everything but if the other person remains completely closed – not only closed but having some investment in remaining closed – then it will be an infringement on your freedom if I force myself upon you. That will be a kind of rape.\nI am available. Think for a few days: if you feel like being here playfully, joyously, then be here; otherwise be joyous anywhere else wherever you are! My work here is to help you to be happy. If you can be happy somewhere else, more happy than here, then with all my blessings, be there; don’t be here. And this time make a decision. Otherwise this is a sheer wasting of your energy –\ncoming and going. Last time you missed and this time if you remain in that state – the very words that you utter are ‘If I can stand it...’ – it makes things impossible.\n[Osho suggests he do the Vipassana group.]\n... If after Vipassana you can feel happy, then you can feel happy here, mm? because Vipassana is one of the most difficult processes...\n... Mm, it is a difficult process, and I have given it knowingly to you: if you can stand it, then you can stand everything else! If you cannot stand it then it is not worth bothering about. It is very deep-going and very penetrating, but the first few days – five, seven days – it is difficult. Not that it has difficult processes to be done, but just sitting silently, doing nothing is the most difficult thing in the world. If there is something to do, one can do it; that is not difficult. But if nothing is to be done – just sitting silently – then minutes appear as if they are hours, and hours appear as if they are weeks, and days appear as if they are years and it becomes so long. But I have deliberately given it to you...\n... I am determined – something has to be done for you, but if you are determined not to let me, then it is your decision...\n... You just have an old negative pattern... maybe from your upbringing in the childhood. Maybe you are still against your father, against your mother. Maybe you are seeing your father in me, maybe you have projected me as a father figure; something is there. So you want to say ‘no’ – that which you have not said to your own father you want to say to me. Once you understand it, it will relax. Once you see the point, that whatsoever you are thinking about me has nothing to do with me but has something to do with your childhood... I am completely out of it – I have not yet been a part of your life. You don’t allow me!\nBut this happens to a few people if their childhood has been such that they have been repressed deep down. They wanted to say ‘no’ to the parents, they wanted to shout at the parents, they wanted to find fault with the parents. They weren’t allowed. They were helpless and they had to say yes when they wanted to say no. They had to hug when they wanted to say no! with their whole heart. Those wounds have remained; they have become engrained in your personality. You are throwing all those projections on me, and I have nothing to do with them.\nIf you watch a little more, if you become a little more alert about what you are doing, you will see the point. Then you will relax and this whole commune can then be of immense value to you. By just passing through a few groups things will start becoming more and more clear.\n[A sannyasin who has just completed the primal group asks about his homosexuality. The primal therapist says that he is very young emotionally; like a little boy.]\nThe first thing: don’t make it a problem. If you really want to solve it, don’t make it a problem. Once you make it a problem then there is no solution to it. It will look paradoxical but what I am saying is: accept it – nothing is wrong in it. It is just a social idea that something is wrong in it, but nothing is wrong in it. It is good at least that you feel attracted to somebody. So the first thing is to accept it; don’t reject it, otherwise you will never be able to solve it. Through acceptance there is a possibility\nof its disappearance. The more you reject it, the more you will become attracted to boys, because whatsoever is rejected creates attraction. Live it out and it will disappear.\nHomosexuality is a necessary phase in the growth of a man or a woman.\n[Osho went on to explain the four states of sexual growth, from auto-sexuality in a child, to homosexuality which naturally precedes heterosexuality, and then the last phase of going beyond sex – brahmacharya.]\nDivya [the primal therapist] seems to be right: you got stuck in the second phase. Nothing is wrong in it. You can go beyond it but you can go only through it. So drop any attitudes about homosexuality; that is nothing but the propaganda of the ages. Nothing is wrong in it; it is not a sin. And if you can accept it, then naturally you will grow out of it and you will start being interested in women, but you have to pass through it.\nIt is possible that your mother was more dominating, as mothers are always. It is very rare to find a man who is not a henpecked husband – very rare. In fact, it doesn’t happen, and if sometimes you find one then the exception proves the rule and nothing else. There are reasons, psychological reasons for it.\nThe man continuously fights in the world so his male energy is exhausted. By the time he comes home, he wants to become feminine. He wants to rest from his male aggression. In the office, in the factory, in the marketplace, in the politics – everywhere he has been fighting and fighting. At home he does not want to fight; he wants to rest, because tomorrow again the world will start. So the moment he enters the house he becomes feminine. The whole day the woman has been feminine, not fighting at all; there was nobody to fight with. She is tired of being a woman... and the kitchen and everything and the children. She wants to enjoy a little bit of aggression and fight and nagging, and the poor husband is available. So she becomes male and the husband becomes female; that is the whole foundation of henpeckedness.\nBut children get into trouble: they see that the mother is dominating; they feel sorry for the father, and out of their feeling sympathy for the father they want to love him: But they cannot – they cannot go against the mother. Even the father cannot go against the mother; how can they? Deep down they resist the mother; the dominating mother becomes repulsive, and that is their first experience of womanhood. Later on, whenever they are with women they will be afraid; she is going to prove a mother again. She will dominate, she will nag, she will be powerful.\nThat is your fear, and you are still in sympathy with your father. The poor old man never had a say. Because of that sympathy with the father you are more attracted to boys. But this thing is nothing to be thought of as a problem. You can go through it. Start enjoying it and don’t feel guilty about it. Soon you will be surprised – a great desire for women will arise in you. Because being attracted to a man is one thing, but to be fulfilled by a man is not possible. Fulfillment needs the opposite, because the opposite complements. You may feel good with a man but to feel good is one thing and to be in deep, intimate love is another. You may feel happy, but to feel happy is one thing and to be ecstatic is totally another.\nEcstasy is possible only when male and female energy meet, but ecstasy always brings in its shadow, agony. That’s the fear: you have seen the agony too much and you are afraid. But the\necstasy is so beautiful that it is worth all the agony – the fight, the conflict. Men are better friends, remember; man and woman are never friends. Lovers are enemies but never friends; in fact lovers and enemies, never friends. Men are very good friends; women don’t know how to be friendly. It is very difficult for women to love other women; they know each other too well – in fact they know too much about each other. But men are very friendly and homosexuals are really gay people, because there is no agony... but there is no ecstasy either. One has to risk and pay.\nMy suggestion is: accept this and soon you will pass beyond it. Then you will start exploring the opposite polarity: the woman. It has to be explored; it is part of growth. The man has to explore the woman, the woman has to explore the man. And the deeper you go into that exploration, the more ecstasy will arise, and the more possibility of agony will be there too. They go together, they balance each other.\nA man-to-man relationship is more comfortable, convenient; more understanding is there. A man- woman relationship is always a turmoil, less understanding because they are such worlds apart. How can they understand each other? No man understands the woman, no woman understands the man, and that is the beauty of their being together. That creates mystery... misunderstanding too.\nBut first accept it. Drop your resistance, and soon you will be able to go beyond it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7241","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/hallelujah/part27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/hallelujah/>Hallelujah!</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">27 Meditation has to be a Love Affair</h1><div class=post-meta>34 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7241 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Hallelujah/part27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

indecision.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is on the right track. It is how trust arises. Trust arises out of
the dark night of doubt. One has to go deep into doubt to find trust.
Trust is not something that you can find by dropping the doubt. If you
drop the doubt forcibly your trust will always remain shaky. It will be
at the most a belief, not a true faith – and belief is impotent. It
appears to be like trust but it is not; deep down there is doubt. On the
surface, belief; at the centre, doubt. It is better to have the doubt on
the surface and trust at the centre – that is far better, and that’s
what your situation is. At the centre there is trust; you are not aware
of it because you are not aware of your centre either. On the
circumference there is doubt. You are aware only of doubt because you
are aware only of your personality, not of your essence. But I can see:
the trust is there, the seed is there. It is trying to come out. Soon it
will be available to your consciousness... just a little more
waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I am sending you back; otherwise I would have told you to
stay. I say to stay only when I see that your circumference and centre
have fallen in harmony, that you are one, because only then will being
here be of any value; then only can you really be with me. Otherwise
whether you are in England or in Poona will not make much
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I am sending you knowing that you will be sad, that you will be in a
kind of suffering and agony. You would have liked me to tell you to stay
but that will be against your own growth. One day you are going to be
here and forever, but that day we have to wait for, and we cannot force
it right now. A forced thing never works. A forced thing remains pseudo,
creates a kind of hypocrisy. And because I can see that the possibility
will soon become an actuality, I am ready to let you suffer a little
bit. This suffering is good.</p><p>If I say to you ‘Stay, don’t go,’ then too you will suffer, and that
suffering will be bad because half of you wants to go and half of you
wants to be here. If you are here, the other half that wants to go will
make all kinds of troubles for you, all kinds of interferences with your
being here. It will find all the negatives that are possible. It will
continuously argue with you: ‘Look what you have done and I have always
been saying to you “Go back home.”’ It will make you more and more shaky
and wavering. It will work on you with a vengeance. If you go back, just
the opposite will be the case.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the inner alchemy. This has to be understood: if you go back
then the part that wants to be here with me will suffer and will find
all the positives, will find all the negatives there, and sooner or
later will be able to defeat the negative part. And the positive
ultimately wins; we just have to give it a right situation, a right
space to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the surface it looks as if I am sending you; deep down this is
the only way for you to be here one day. This is the only way that you
will come closer and closer to me; far away there you will think more of
me. Far away you will see the utter uselessness of the part that says
‘Be in England.’ There is nothing.<span class=s4></span>You have lived
there, you have lived a certain kind of life – maybe it is convenient
and</p><p>comfortable, secure. Here life may not be so secure, may not be so
comfortable, but here life will be growing and there you will only be
dying. There you will be in a kind of stagnant stasis. You will live
with the past but you will not have any future. You will live in a
comfortable grave; that’s how people are living.</p><p><br></p><p>Here my whole work is to pull you out of your comfortable grave. To
come out of the grave is risky. To come out of the grave after a long
time, into the sun, in the wind, in the rains, looks insecure. But
that’s how life grows.</p><p><br></p><p>You can put a potted plant in the room: it may survive but it will
lose lustre, it will lose joy, it will lose life. It may survive and
comfortably – there will be no wind and no danger and no rain and no sun
burning hot and showering fire, no fear of animals or anybody destroying
it in a beautifully modern decorated drawing-room. The pot can be there,
the plant can be there, it can survive but it will survive at the
minimum.</p><p><br></p><p>Back in the garden, surrounded by all kinds of dangers, it is not
only a survival, it is a celebration. Then it will have the joy that
happens when you accept challenges and the growth that happens when you
fight with challenges, when you overcome them.</p><p><br></p><p>Life should be an adventure, and sannyas is nothing but an adventure
into your inner world. I know your longing and I trust your longing and
I will wait for the right moment when you can say with your total heart
that this is the only place where you would like to be, whatsoever the
cost. Then this is your home! But I will have to wait and you will have
to wait for the total mind to say it. And that day is not far away, so
don’t be worried.</p><p><br></p><p>[Her child asks: What is my meditation?.<span class=s4></span>I
don’t know what a meditation is.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good! Mm, but you want to know? Mm mm. Start dancing! Wild
dance is your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>[To the mother] Tell him to go to the music group in the night so he
can start dancing there, [to the child] and when you are back home for
at least twenty minutes, thirty minutes every night, dance. Put on any
music and dance, enjoy dancing, and that will be your meditation.</p><p>Anand means bliss, mandir means a temple – a temple of bliss. Man is
born to be blissful. To miss it is our own responsibility. You cannot
blame anybody else if you miss bliss in life. People go on blaming
others. That is just an effort to save their own face, but it is
foolish. And the more you blame others, the less is the possibility of
your becoming blissful. To blame others means that your bliss depends on
others; you have taken a very wrong standpoint from the very
beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss does not depend on anybody else; it is independent. It is your
self-nature: it is already there, just to be recognized, welcomed. It
has to be accepted, not produced, because it is already the case. To
blame others means you have moved in a wrong direction. Now you will
always think that others are preventing you from being blissful, and you
can always find a thousand and one causes for not being blissful. Not a
single cause is valid.</p><p><br></p><p>Misery comes from outside, misery has causes outside; bliss does not
come from outside. It is you, your very being. It is uncaused; it is not
an effect of some cause. Once this is understood the blaming mind stops.
And to stop the blaming mind is to take a tremendously significant turn.
Then you start looking in a different direction. If you are not feeling
blissful that means you are not being harmonious with your being, that’s
all; that you are not in tune with your being, that’s all; that your
mind is moving in a different way from your real nature; that there has
come a disparity between you and your mind; that the mind is dragging
you towards the south and your being is going towards the north – hence
the problem. When the mind follows like a shadow, when you are the
master and the mind is the slave and when it is always in tune with you,
there is always bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Respect the body because it is the temple. It is the most beautiful
thing that has happened in nature. But people condemn the body too;
those condemnors will find something or other. They will condemn the
society, they will condemn the economic structure, they will condemn
this and that – education, parents, family. And when they cannot find
anybody else to condemn, when they have moved alone into the forest,
they will condemn their own body; the old habit persists. They will say
‘It is because of the body, this wretched body, this enemy. It is
driving me crazy and because of it I cannot feel peace and blissful. Sol
have to get rid of the body.’ Then they start trying to get rid of the
body, and in the name of spirituality many schools of suicide continue
in the world; they are just suicidal. Then they start torturing the
body, fasting, beating the body, making everything as uncomfortable, as
inconvenient as possible. They devise new methods and means of
masochism. But this is not the way to be blissful. And when you destroy
the temple, you are hurting the deity within.</p><p><br></p><p>The temple is a beautiful shelter for the deity. Use it, love it, and
try to find out what is hidden in it. God is hidden in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means god, paro means transcendental. God is another name of the
beyond; god is not a person. God is the unknowableness of existence...
the mysteriousness of existence, the unfathomableness of existence. To
reduce god to a person is to destroy the whole beauty of the idea. Then
people start worshipping, because god becomes a person. What else is
there to do? – worship, praise, pray. This is how religion goes on the
wrong track.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment god becomes the mysteriousness of life there is no
question of worship but of enquiry, of adventure, of exploration. When
god becomes the unknowableness of life then religion need not become
worship. Then religion has to become wonder, awe... and then it is
tremendously alive.</p><p>Worship is dead, wonder is alive. So I say wonder is real worship. To
be in awe is to be in prayer. Whenever you are in awe your mind stops of
its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing a beautiful sunset the mind stops, maybe only for a few
seconds or just for a second, but in that very second there is prayer.
In that vibrant, alive moment you are transported into another world.
The beauty of the sunset has taken you into the mystery of mysteries,
into the holy of holies. For a moment you are not a mind but an expanded
consciousness, unbounded. You are no more confined in the body – you are
as vast as the sky itself. For a moment the observer becomes the
observed: you are not there separate from the sunset looking at it, you
are it... and that is the moment of prayer. Not a single word is uttered
and the prayer is complete. You have not even bowed down and you are
surrendered. You have not quoted the Bible or the Koran or the Geeta,
but in that moment is contained all the Bibles and all the Korans and
all the Geetas.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the meaning of the transcendental; and once you start
thinking of the transcendental, you will find god, any moment, anywhere.
A bud is becoming a flower and you will see the transcendental beauty of
it. Suddenly in the silence of the night a bird starts calling and the
silence becomes deepened... and there is the transcendental! Somebody
looks towards you with great love and in those eyes, in that moment, in
that contact, is the transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>Once god is not a person you will come across him here and there and
everywhere. Jesus says ‘Cut the wood and you will find me there. Turn
the stone, and look – I am there!’ Then each leaf has a beauty, each
stone has a divineness and each moment becomes suffused, luminous, with
the unknown and the unknowable.</p><p><br></p><p>To live in this utter grandeur of life is to be a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, hanso means a swan – it is a metaphor for the
soul: the divine swan. In India the swans live deep in the Himalayas.
They come only to the plains when it is too cold there; and when the
season is over, the winter is over, they go back. When they are on the
plains they suffer very much... nostalgia for the Himalayas, the virgin
beauty of the Himalayas, the silence. And the lake Mansarovar where they
live in the Himalayas has the purest water in the world. Man has not yet
reached there to pollute it. I think it will be the last place in the
world to be polluted. Rarely, once in a while, a traveller, a pilgrim,
reaches there... very rarely.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally the swans suffer very much because here they have to live
in dirty ponds – muddy, polluted, poisoned, and the noise, the people,
the ugliness – so they continuously dream of Mansarovar, of the lake in
the Himalayas. They continuously think about how to go back. Even to
wait for the few months of winter is too difficult; they feel
homesick.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this the metaphor arose that the human soul is a swan, a
white swan. Its home is in god, hence on the earth, in the world, it
suffers and it longs to go back to god. Religion is nothing but a return
journey. It is a search for the home, a search for the source, a search
for the original face.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember: man is an outsider in the world; hence the feeling of
alienation. One cannot feel at home here. We do everything to make
ourselves at home but still something deep down goes on saying ‘This is
not the place. Sooner or later we will have to leave; it is not more
than a caravanserai, just an overnight’s stay and in the morning we will
have to go.’ Deep down someone goes on saying</p><p>‘Remain detached. Don’t get too entangled because soon you will have
to leave and all those entanglements will become a very deep misery.
Remain unattached, aloof. Just be a passer-by, a pilgrim who passes
through many places but never makes any place his home.’</p><p><br></p><p>This world is a pilgrimage – don’t get lost in it. Even while you are
in it, go on remembering god. [Osho speaks in Hindi to an Indian
sannyasin and then in English:]</p><p>No, nobody can succeed by trying. Trying to forget means that you are
again remembering. Trying to forget means remembering and remembering.
The very effort to forget will not allow you to forget. That is not the
way. Just the opposite will be the result if you try to forget
something. Nobody can try to forget.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not heard the famous story...? A politician was continuously
going to see a saint and he was asking again and again ‘Give me a mantra
so that I can become the Prime Minister of the country. You are an
enlightened one and you know all the secrets of life. Why not give me a
little key? This is my only ambition.’</p><p><br></p><p>Tired of the politician, to be finished with him, the saint said one
day ‘Okay, now I will give you one – this is the mantra, just a small
mantra. Five minutes chanting of the mantra will do, but remember only
one thing: while you are chanting it, don’t think of the monkey.’</p><p><br></p><p>The politician said ‘This is so simple. I have never been thinking of
the monkey. For my whole life I have never thought about the monkey. Why
should I think about the monkey? What kind of condition is this?’</p><p><br></p><p>The saint said ‘Then you can go. Just take a good bath, sit silently,
repeat the mantra for five minutes, but remember: don’t remember the
monkey, that’s all. That is the only condition to be fulfilled.’</p><p><br></p><p>The politician was awake the whole night. He would take a bath again,
would sit for five minutes and would try, but the moment he tried,
monkeys and monkeys – not one but many! He tried and tried to forget the
monkeys and the more he tried to forget, the more they were there
mocking him and shouting at him and making faces at him. By the morning
he was almost mad!</p><p><br></p><p>He rushed to the saint and said ‘What have you done? If you had not
told me about this monkey I would have succeeded, but now it seems
impossible – in this life. This mantra won’t be of any use, because that
monkey I cannot forget. It is impossible and I have tried all that I can
do to forget it.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is a simple psychological process: if you want to forget
you will never forget. That is not the right way. One thing – this has
to be understood: never try to forget anything, otherwise you will never
forget.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: people think that because they have loved so much,
that’s why they cannot forget. That is wrong, utterly wrong. You may
feel hurt when I say that. People cannot forget because they have not
loved enough; hence there is a guilt feeling. If you have really loved
the woman then there is no problem. But the problem is that nobody loves
enough. It is not only a question of you: nobody loves enough. And when
the woman is there, who bothers? Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow – we</p><p>will love tomorrow. Today let us fight then tomorrow we will love.
And today there are small things, just small things and quarrels, and
everything... jealousies and possessiveness and domination. We hope that
tomorrow everything will settle. We will become wiser and she will
become wiser and then there will be great love.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the problem is that tomorrow will never come. The woman is dead,
so you are feeling guilty. It is not because of love. Love can forgive
and forget. Love has that capacity to forgive and forget. Love is
immensely powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is guilt. You are feeling guilty: you didn’t love the
woman as you should have and now there is no opportunity left. Now you
will not see her again, never meet her again; now that unfulfilled love
haunts you. You would like to cry and weep and ask forgiveness of her
and say ‘While you were here I couldn’t do anything for you. Now you are
gone and I cannot do anything because I don’t know where you are, or
whether you are or not.’</p><p><br></p><p>This creates the problem, so this is the second thing to understand.
If you go on thinking that you are remembering her because of your love,
then you will never forget, because that gives you a great joy – that it
is because of love. You are not like others: their woman dies and the
next day they are ready to marry again, you are not like those people.
You are taking a great ego interest in it, that you loved so much you
cannot forget. Now the very idea of love will be an ego gratification.
These are the tricks of the mind that have to be understood. It is
nothing to do with love.</p><p><br></p><p>If you loved the woman, it is over. She is gone and you loved her as
much as you could. What more could you have done? Even if she was alive
your love would have been just a repetition, and all repetitions are
boring, they are tedious. What else was there to do? All that you could
do you have done. It is not because of love. But the mind is very
cunning: it hides things behind beautiful names. Guilt is there; the
mind will label it love, and then it can protect it. Once you see it is
guilt you will not protect it, you will not feel any ego satisfaction in
it. The guilt has to be dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing to be understood is: our commitment is not towards
persons, our commitment is towards love itself. If you are really ready
to understand, that woman was only a personification of womanhood, one
form of womanhood, and there are millions of women in the world, all
forms of the same womanhood. Start loving again! My own understanding is
this, that if you have enjoyed a woman’s love, you owe it to her to
start loving somebody else. If love has been such a deep satisfaction
then you will be committed to love.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who never get married again because the woman died or the
man died go on bragging that because they loved so much they cannot get
he married. All nonsense! In fact their love has been such a failure
that they are afraid to go into it again. If love has really been a
success, they will immediately be ready to go into another love
experience, with another form of womanhood, with another form of
manhood.</p><p><br></p><p>The commitment is to be towards love – and there is no betrayal in
it; you are not betraying anybody. Those ideas have to be dropped. In
the Indian mind particularly those ideas are very deep – that if you get
married, if you love another woman, you are betraying. That is nonsense!
If you don’t go into love again, that is betrayal – betraying love,
betraying the woman. It is an insult to the woman who died, because she
could not make you so satisfied with love that you would like to have
the</p><p>experience again with somebody else. She made you so nauseated with
love that you have become afraid of moving into another relationship
again.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is totally different: if you really loved that woman,
love again; love again and again and again. And you will be surprised
that when you are again in love with another woman you will feel
tremendously grateful to the woman who has died. She has made you so in
tune with love. She has given you the taste of love so that now you can
love again, so that you can love somebody else too. And if you love the
other woman you will find the same energy again, because it is the same
energy; only forms are different. Man and woman – there are only two
lovers in the whole world. All else is just non-essential.</p><p><br></p><p>So become available to love again. Otherwise your love energy will
remain stuck, and with nowhere to flow it will start moving in a vicious
circle, remembering the woman again and again and making a wound inside.
It will become ill. It will be like a psychological cancer. And the
woman who has left you will not be happy; she will suffer because you
will be suffering. Wherever she is she will suffer. If she really loved
you, she will be happy when you are again flowing, loving, enjoying. In
those moments of enjoyment you will feel grateful to the woman, and that
will be true love.</p><p><br></p><p>So my suggestion is: find another woman, and this time don’t get
married. This time, fall in love and then get married. Let love be first
and marriage second; this will be the right approach. Otherwise you will
become pathological, unnecessarily ill and suffering. And there is no
point in it. We all have to go; sooner or later you will die. Before you
die, let your love flow; let somebody become happy through your love.
Share it!</p><p><br></p><p>You have come to the right person! If you go anywhere else in this
country you will find wrong suggestions given to you. This country
carries a very very morbid mind. And they will help you – they will say
‘You are great!’ They will say ‘This is how one should be. You are a
true Indian; you represent the true image of India.’ You simply
represent a kind of pathological tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all that nonsense!</p><p><br></p><p>Feel happy and start moving again. One should not be finished by so
small a thing. Love is greater than persons. Persons come and go – love
continues. And you are alive, you can breathe. Don’t feel any
betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>This country has even done that! In the past this country created the
idea in women’s minds that if their husband is dead they don’t have the
right to breathe, because that is betrayal. So they should jump in the
funeral pyre with him, become a ‘sati’, bury themselves alive. What
ugliness – supporting suicide! And poor women have been killing
themselves because the idea was planted in their minds ‘When your
husband is dead, how can you live? To live means you are betraying. Even
in living you are betraying!’ Now we know that was nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way sooner or later the country will have to understand
that when you are alive you have to love too. Love is a function of life
just as breathing is. If you can breathe, if you can eat, if you can
take a bath, if you can sleep, then why not love? To destroy your love
means to live half-heartedly, and then naturally you will think of the
past. You will remain past-oriented because there is no future. You know
now you are not going to love anybody, so all that you can do is to</p><p>go again into those memories and make them more and more painted and
colourful. They may not have been as beautiful as you are thinking, but
a hungry mind will paint them very colourful and very beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Never get too attached to the past, because the past is gone and gone
forever. Remain available to the present and to the future. That is the
meaning of being alive: if you are alive you have to breathe, you have
to love, you have to share. This has to be the change that you have to
bring... and with this sannyas, let the whole past disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I’ve been feeling, especially for the last week,
that I’ve had tastes and experiences of bliss, ecstasy and the divine.
In the last week I’ve been experiencing a lot of pain as I experience
all my blocks and how asleep I am and how much my mind distracts. It’s
very uncomfortable.]</p><p><br></p><p>I can feel everything. Mm mm.… It is something very meaningful – even
this pain. It happens only when your energy starts moving into new
spaces where it has never moved before. It is the beginning of something
tremendously important, but because it is new the body will have to go
through a few pains, because new paths have to be created for the
energy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you need not be worried: the energy will create the paths itself
because you have enough energy. The problem is when the energy is not
enough and the path has to be created. When the river has enough water,
no need to worry; the very amount of water creates its way. And so is
the case with energy: you have more than you need, so it is going to
break all those blocks in you. They are not to be removed, there is no
need to remove them. They have to be removed when the energy is not
enough to remove them; then outer processes have to be used.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Rolfing can be helpful but only when the energy is not
enough. Postural Integration is helpful but only when the energy is not
enough. But when the energy is like a flood, no Rolfing, no Postural
Integration is needed. The energy will come and take all the rocks away;
it will make its own path. And you are fortunate to have more than you
need. But it is clashing with the rocks so there will be pain, but
accept this pain as a growth pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think of it as a disease. Feel joyous about it, that your
energy is moving and creating new paths. And with those new paths you
will start finding new places of being. These days that you have been
here have been really significant. Something of immense value has
started moving. Just do two things.…</p><p><br></p><p>One is: continue to meditate every day – one meditation. But choose
one and then insist on the same; don’t change it. You can choose any one
that you like, but let it be something very active – Dynamic, Kundalini,
Nataraj – anything dynamic that will help the energy to move faster.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing that you have to do is: before you go to sleep
in the night, just lie down, turn the lights off, lie down under your
blanket, and feel your body is dying. Start from the toes and feel that
they are dying and move slowly upwards: the legs are dying, the thighs
are dying; go on moving upwards and let the whole body die. It will take
at least five to seven minutes; slowly slowly you come to the head and
all is dead. When you feel that all is dead, finished, that the body is
a corpse, then do a small meditation which will be of immense help.</p><p>Start feeling that great light is entering from the head, golden
light – as if suddenly a sun has risen and it is pouring all its gold
into you. It is going in, going in, going in... the whole body has
become a hollow bamboo and the light is falling in and passing through
like a flood, and it goes out from the toes. For five minutes let this
happen, then after five minutes – just approximately, you need not look
at the watch, just approximately – after five minutes change the whole
process. Now start thinking of a dark energy, negative – like a dark
night with not a single star in it, a dark energy flow entering from the
toes, moving upwards, filling the whole bamboo, the hollow body, and
going out from the head. Five minutes of that, and then go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>This will synchronize the positive and negative energy inside your
body. It will synchronize your man and woman inside the body, your yin
and yang, your day and night, your life and death. First life, the
golden light, then death, the darkness... and enjoy both, because both
are beautiful. This for five and the first part for five minutes, and
seven minutes first to have the body absolutely dead so it creates no
hindrance.</p><p><br></p><p>This passing of the golden light and the darkness will help
tremendously. Every day you will feel those blocks are disappearing for
no other work is needed on them. And one meditation every day.</p><p><br></p><p>[The previous year a sannyasin, when he took sannyas, told Osho he
felt negative about it. Now he says he will stay “as long as I can stand
it”.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good. Mm mm. (pause) Then it will not be very long! If it is a
question of standing it, it is not going to be very long. But try – as
long as you can stand. I was thinking that you would be a little less
negative this time, but I don’t think.…</p><p><br></p><p>This is up to you.… But if it is too much torture, why bother? If it
is like something that you have to stand, why bother at all? Unless it
is a joy there is no need to be in it. So decide about it: if it is a
joy to be here, be here! I am the last person in the world to make
somebody miserable, and misery is written so large on your face. But
only you are responsible for it, because I am not in favour of misery.
If you create it that is your responsibility.…</p><p><br></p><p>So if you can do [groups], do. But if it becomes too much,
unbearable, and you feel it difficult, then please forget all about it!
Either be here in a joyous way.… Then only can you gain something,
because it is only in joy that one gains; it is only in joy that one
receives. My energy is not such that you can receive it when you are sad
and serious and negative; you will not receive it at all. And it is not
that I am not giving it to you – I may go on giving, but you will not be
able to receive it.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you are positive, welcoming and cooperating, nothing can be
done. I am utterly helpless with people like you. And you will think
that I have not been doing something. I am ready to do everything but if
the other person remains completely closed – not only closed but having
some investment in remaining closed – then it will be an infringement on
your freedom if I force myself upon you. That will be a kind of
rape.</p><p><br></p><p>I am available. Think for a few days: if you feel like being here
playfully, joyously, then be here; otherwise be joyous anywhere else
wherever you are! My work here is to help you to be happy. If you can be
happy somewhere else, more happy than here, then with all my blessings,
be there; don’t be here. And this time make a decision. Otherwise this
is a sheer wasting of your energy –</p><p>coming and going. Last time you missed and this time if you remain in
that state – the very words that you utter are ‘If I can stand it...’ –
it makes things impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggests he do the Vipassana group.]</p><p><br></p><p>... If after Vipassana you can feel happy, then you can feel happy
here, mm? because Vipassana is one of the most difficult
processes...</p><p><br></p><p>... Mm, it is a difficult process, and I have given it knowingly to
you: if you can stand it, then you can stand everything else! If you
cannot stand it then it is not worth bothering about. It is very
deep-going and very penetrating, but the first few days – five, seven
days – it is difficult. Not that it has difficult processes to be done,
but just sitting silently, doing nothing is the most difficult thing in
the world. If there is something to do, one can do it; that is not
difficult. But if nothing is to be done – just sitting silently – then
minutes appear as if they are hours, and hours appear as if they are
weeks, and days appear as if they are years and it becomes so long. But
I have deliberately given it to you...</p><p><br></p><p>... I am determined – something has to be done for you, but if you
are determined not to let me, then it is your decision...</p><p><br></p><p>... You just have an old negative pattern... maybe from your
upbringing in the childhood. Maybe you are still against your father,
against your mother. Maybe you are seeing your father in me, maybe you
have projected me as a father figure; something is there. So you want to
say ‘no’ – that which you have not said to your own father you want to
say to me. Once you understand it, it will relax. Once you see the
point, that whatsoever you are thinking about me has nothing to do with
me but has something to do with your childhood... I am completely out of
it – I have not yet been a part of your life. You don’t allow me!</p><p><br></p><p>But this happens to a few people if their childhood has been such
that they have been repressed deep down. They wanted to say ‘no’ to the
parents, they wanted to shout at the parents, they wanted to find fault
with the parents. They weren’t allowed. They were helpless and they had
to say yes when they wanted to say no. They had to hug when they wanted
to say no! with their whole heart. Those wounds have remained; they have
become engrained in your personality. You are throwing all those
projections on me, and I have nothing to do with them.</p><p><br></p><p>If you watch a little more, if you become a little more alert about
what you are doing, you will see the point. Then you will relax and this
whole commune can then be of immense value to you. By just passing
through a few groups things will start becoming more and more clear.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who has just completed the primal group asks about his
homosexuality. The primal therapist says that he is very young
emotionally; like a little boy.]</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: don’t make it a problem. If you really want to solve
it, don’t make it a problem. Once you make it a problem then there is no
solution to it. It will look paradoxical but what I am saying is: accept
it – nothing is wrong in it. It is just a social idea that something is
wrong in it, but nothing is wrong in it. It is good at least that you
feel attracted to somebody. So the first thing is to accept it; don’t
reject it, otherwise you will never be able to solve it. Through
acceptance there is a possibility</p><p>of its disappearance. The more you reject it, the more you will
become attracted to boys, because whatsoever is rejected creates
attraction. Live it out and it will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Homosexuality is a necessary phase in the growth of a man or a
woman.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho went on to explain the four states of sexual growth, from
auto-sexuality in a child, to homosexuality which naturally precedes
heterosexuality, and then the last phase of going beyond sex –
brahmacharya.]</p><p><br></p><p>Divya [the primal therapist] seems to be right: you got stuck in the
second phase. Nothing is wrong in it. You can go beyond it but you can
go only through it. So drop any attitudes about homosexuality; that is
nothing but the propaganda of the ages. Nothing is wrong in it; it is
not a sin. And if you can accept it, then naturally you will grow out of
it and you will start being interested in women, but you have to pass
through it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that your mother was more dominating, as mothers are
always. It is very rare to find a man who is not a henpecked husband –
very rare. In fact, it doesn’t happen, and if sometimes you find one
then the exception proves the rule and nothing else. There are reasons,
psychological reasons for it.</p><p><br></p><p>The man continuously fights in the world so his male energy is
exhausted. By the time he comes home, he wants to become feminine. He
wants to rest from his male aggression. In the office, in the factory,
in the marketplace, in the politics – everywhere he has been fighting
and fighting. At home he does not want to fight; he wants to rest,
because tomorrow again the world will start. So the moment he enters the
house he becomes feminine. The whole day the woman has been feminine,
not fighting at all; there was nobody to fight with. She is tired of
being a woman... and the kitchen and everything and the children. She
wants to enjoy a little bit of aggression and fight and nagging, and the
poor husband is available. So she becomes male and the husband becomes
female; that is the whole foundation of henpeckedness.</p><p><br></p><p>But children get into trouble: they see that the mother is
dominating; they feel sorry for the father, and out of their feeling
sympathy for the father they want to love him: But they cannot – they
cannot go against the mother. Even the father cannot go against the
mother; how can they? Deep down they resist the mother; the dominating
mother becomes repulsive, and that is their first experience of
womanhood. Later on, whenever they are with women they will be afraid;
she is going to prove a mother again. She will dominate, she will nag,
she will be powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>That is your fear, and you are still in sympathy with your father.
The poor old man never had a say. Because of that sympathy with the
father you are more attracted to boys. But this thing is nothing to be
thought of as a problem. You can go through it. Start enjoying it and
don’t feel guilty about it. Soon you will be surprised – a great desire
for women will arise in you. Because being attracted to a man is one
thing, but to be fulfilled by a man is not possible. Fulfillment needs
the opposite, because the opposite complements. You may feel good with a
man but to feel good is one thing and to be in deep, intimate love is
another. You may feel happy, but to feel happy is one thing and to be
ecstatic is totally another.</p><p><br></p><p>Ecstasy is possible only when male and female energy meet, but
ecstasy always brings in its shadow, agony. That’s the fear: you have
seen the agony too much and you are afraid. But the</p><p>ecstasy is so beautiful that it is worth all the agony – the fight,
the conflict. Men are better friends, remember; man and woman are never
friends. Lovers are enemies but never friends; in fact lovers and
enemies, never friends. Men are very good friends; women don’t know how
to be friendly. It is very difficult for women to love other women; they
know each other too well – in fact they know too much about each other.
But men are very friendly and homosexuals are really gay people, because
there is no agony... but there is no ecstasy either. One has to risk and
pay.</p><p><br></p><p>My suggestion is: accept this and soon you will pass beyond it. Then
you will start exploring the opposite polarity: the woman. It has to be
explored; it is part of growth. The man has to explore the woman, the
woman has to explore the man. And the deeper you go into that
exploration, the more ecstasy will arise, and the more possibility of
agony will be there too. They go together, they balance each other.</p><p><br></p><p>A man-to-man relationship is more comfortable, convenient; more
understanding is there. A man- woman relationship is always a turmoil,
less understanding because they are such worlds apart. How can they
understand each other? No man understands the woman, no woman
understands the man, and that is the beauty of their being together.
That creates mystery... misunderstanding too.</p><p><br></p><p>But first accept it. Drop your resistance, and soon you will be able
to go beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

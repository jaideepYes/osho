It is only symbolic but it carries much meaning in it. If it is just a change of name it is not significant – then all names are the same; whether you have one name or another will not make any difference. If the old continues in the new name too, then you have only changed the label – the wine is old, the bottle is new – and that is not going to help at all.\nThe change of name has to be understood as being a discontinuity with the past. It has to be deeply felt as the old being dead and the new being born. Sannyas is significant only if it is a new birth. If it remains a horizontal continuity with the past it is utterly meaningless. It has to be a change of direction, dimension. From being horizontal it has to become vertical. One has to stop being the old. And this is one of the fundamentals to understand – that if you decide, it is immediately possible; all that is needed is a decisiveness.\nIt is not a question of time. Time never changes anything – it only gives the appearance of change; deep down things remain the same. Time only changes covers, clothes, but never the real essence. It changes the personality but the personality is not you. Your essence remains untouched by time. The essence changes only by a kind of absolute decision. It is a question of decision. If one decides, the change immediately happens. Because it is you who have decided to be identified with the personality, with the old name, with the old problems – misery, anger, sadness, and all that. It is you in the beginning who have decided to remain identified with all this continuity. It is you who can immediately break the cooperation.\nAnd this I call a real drop-out. Dropping out of the society does not help, because the society has penetrated you so deeply. Your personality is a given thing from the society. One can have long hair, one can have orange clothes, one can become a hippie, one can become anything, but the society has penetrated one very very deeply. You have been drinking it from the first day, you have been made by it; you are a structure created by it. How can you drop it? Where are you going to drop it? It will follow you like your shadow.\nSo deep down if you look into the hippie you will find the same man, the straight man. Nothing has happened – just on the surface new paint, a new whitewash, and sooner or later the hippie again becomes the straight man. Suddenly after thirty he disappears. You don’t find old hippies. Where do they go? It comes like a phase – underneath the same river flows. Sooner or later they go back to their old pattern.\nSannyas has to be a real break away. And all that is needed is your decisiveness – not a reaction against anything but a loving surrender to the new. Not that you are against the old;. if you are against the old you will react. I am not against the old – I am in love with the new. And the emphasis is very different. It is a search for the unknown. We have nothing to do – for or against – with the known. The known has been known, has been lived, we have e *cperienced it; now there is no point in going on repeating it. And there is no point in being against it either, because it has helped in its own way. It has brought you here; it has served its purpose.\nSo no need to feel angry about it. Never feel angry against the past; otherwise you will remain in a very hot relationship with the past. Anger is a hot, passionate relationship. Never be against the past, never feel guilty for it, never condemn it, because whatsoever it was, you have used it as a stepping-stone. Now it is no more relevant, that’s all, so you are searching for a new relevance.\nThat is the hidden meaning in changing the name. It is only symbolic, but if the symbol is understood well it goes really deep, cuts deep, like a sword. The old simply becomes history.\nDeva means divine, kavyo means poetry – divine poetry\nAnd that is my vision of religion. Religion is the ultimate in poetry. Poetry is just groping in darkness for religion. Religion is poetry arrived, poetry found, poetry realized. Poetry is religion on the way; religion is goal-arrived. Religion is the ultimate fragrance of poetry, and poetry is the beginning, the first step towards religion.\nPoets come very close to the mystics. In their real moments of poetry they are mystics, but no poet is capable of remaining a poet twenty-four hours a day. There are only moments when he opens up, when suddenly his ego disappears, when he finds a kind of unity with existence, when he knows god is – in a flower, in a tree, in a song, in music, in a sunset. Suddenly he becomes aware of the presence of the divine, but it is only for a moment, and once the moment is gone the ego comes back, and with a revenge. That’s why poets are very egoistic too, and there is a very deep psychological reason in it.\nAll artists are egoistic people. You may sometimes find even a politician humble, but you will not find an artist humble. This looks very absurd. Why is the artist so egoistic? He goes on beating his own drum, he goes on shouting against the world, as if only he knows and nobody else, as if he is the first painter or the first poet or the first musician, and there is nobody to be compared with him.\nI have heard about George Bernard Shaw that somebody asked him ‘How are things going in literature nowadays?’ He looked very serious, sad, and he said ‘You know, Dante is dead, Shakespeare is dead and I am also not feeling very well.’\nHe was joking, certainly, but that has been the approach, always the attitude of the artist. And the reason is that for a few moments he loses his ego, and the ego feels hurt, comes with a vengeance and claims him back, claims him too much in fact. The poetry is born when the artist disappears, but by the time the poetry is ready, the ego comes to claim it, to sign it, to make it a point that ‘This is my work.’\nThe ancient poets have not signed their works. Nobody knows who wrote the Upanishads – some of the greatest poetry, each single statement condensed poetry; out of each single statement great works can arise, but nobody knows who wrote them. Those poets were not only poets, they were mystics. They knew that god had written it through them – they were only instrumental. That’s why Mohammed says ‘It is not me who is writing the Koran; god has spoken into my ears. I am simply repeating it. If there are some faults, they are mine; if there is some beauty, it is his.’ This is the true form of a poet – he cannot claim – but in the true form, the poet becomes the mystic.\nIn the ordinary form for only a few moments, few and far between, does he take a jump, have an experience of the truth. Then he falls back on the ground into the valley and into the dark night, and claims ‘This is my experience, my words, my poetry, my painting, my sculpture...’ brags about it. And the reason is: the ego has to compensate for its hurt feeling. It cannot forgive the poet so easily, because there was a moment when he had left it. It jumps upon the poet, possesses his whole being... but still, the poet reaches very close to the mystic, although only for a few moments.\nIn Sanskrit we have two words for ‘poet’; no other language has two words for ‘poet’. One is ‘kavi’, out of which comes ‘kavyo’. ‘Kavi’ means the poet who is only in truth for moments and falls back. Yes, he has flights into the unknown, but again and again comes back to the earth. Another word is ‘rishi’; that too means poet, but a poet whose very state has become that of poetry. He never falls back from it. Buddha is a rishi, Mohammed is a rishi, so is Christ. They live poetry – they need not write it. They walk poetry. When they look there is poetry, when they listen too there is poetry, when they sleep there is poetry. Poetry is their very state. For the poet poetry is just an episode, but in the beginning one has to move that way. So move from being a poet towards being a mystic.\nDeva means divine, navyo means new. Truth is always new. Truth has no past – truth is always present. You cannot say ‘God was’; you cannot say ‘God will be’. You can only say ‘God is’. With god only one tense is possible: that is the present. And this is the beauty of existence – that it is continuously renewing itself. Each moment it dies to the past and is born again. And that has to be the way of a sannyasin: each moment die to the past. Drop it, let it disappear; don’t cling to its memory.\nRemain constantly in the present. This moment is all, and this moment contains eternity. If one can be only in this moment then meditation has happened. And that brings benediction, because then one is always virgin, so fresh, as the dewdrops in the morning sun or newly opening flowers or a lotus in the pond. In that freshness is fragrance. In that fragrance is joy, because in that fragrance is life, utterly alive, throbbing, breathing.\nMy sannyasin has to be utterly alive alive, spontaneous, responsive to the moment. My sannyasin has to forget both the past and the future, because one is no more and the other is not yet. Then you are left only with this moment and the rain falling on the trees, and the sounds... and you and meAnd then there is blessing.\nIt is impossible to be miserable in the present. People are always miserable because of the past or the future. People are worried because they have done something in the past or something has been done to them, or they are worried about whether they will be able to do something right in the future or not. The present moment is utterly free of worry. It has a taste of the divinethe door to\ngod opens through it.\nSmell the rose, but this rose. Drink the water, but this water. Live the moment, but this moment. And forget all. You will not miss anything in life. Life will go on showering a thousand and one joys on you. To be in the present is to be worthy, because to be in the present is to be receptive, open, unclouded.\nDeva means divine, bhavyo means splendour. Life is full of divine splendour – it is just far-out! It is so beautiful that one cannot imagine a more beautiful existence. It is impossible to dream a more beautiful life. But we go on missing because we can see only that for which we are ready. The blind man cannot see the light and the deaf man cannot hear the music. And if we don’t see the beauty in life, the grandeur, that simply shows that we don’t yet have a receptive heart.\nSannyas is an alchemical process of creating a receptive heart so that you can have eyes in the heart and ears in the heart, so that the heart can start seeing and can start hearing.so that you\ndon’t see only the outer form of life but you start penetrating into the inner core of it. It is such an immense gift to be alive, but people are very ungrateful; they have forgotten how to thank god. They never feel the awe of existence. They never feel so grateful that they need to bow down to the earth. They are utterly stonelike, unfeeling, unseeing. And because of these people – and they are the majority – the whole of life has become ugly. It is because of these people that life has lost its joys, celebrations.\nRemember: animals can play but only man can celebrate. It is man’s privilege and prerogative; no other animal can celebrate. Yes, they can play, but play is one thing and celebration is totally another. Celebration is a thankfulness; it is prayer out of gratitude. It is recognition of the gift that has been given to us... it is understanding. It is overflowing love for god who has done so much for us. Just to be alive is so festive. Even for a single moment to feel the rain and to see the sun and to be on the beach, even for a single moment to see the stars, is enough for a person to become religious.\nChurches are not needed, priests are not needed, because if people cannot see the beauty of the trees they will not be able to see the beauty of the cross, because the cross is just a dead tree. And if people cannot see the beauty in rose flowers they will not be able to see the beauty of the eyes of Jesus, because those eyes are also rose flowers. If they don’t feel the wonder of the sky and the clouds and the sun, they will not feel the wonder of the presence of a Buddha.\nThis is my message for you on your sannyas birthday: start seeing the splendour – it is tremendous. Feel more and more and love will arise of its own accord. One day suddenly you will be surprised –\nyou are praying. And then prayer has a beauty of its own when it has a surprise. A learned prayer is bogus. A learned prayer is Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan. It is parrotlike, it is mechanical; you repeat it from the head. It does not arise out of your being; it does not come as a surprise.\nReal prayer always comes as a surprise. Suddenly you feel one day an immense urge to bow down... not to anyone in particular but to this beautiful existence itself. And that’s how one bows down to god.\n[A yoga teacher asks: sometimes when I listen to you speaking about yoga I get the feeling that I want to be flowing and I want not to be too tight... ]\nMm mm. You can be flowing even with yoga. Don’t be very rigid, help people to be flowing, and then you will come closer to the real yoga spirit. These rigid yoga teachers are not really yogis; they are just gymnasts. They themselves are rigid and they are trying to impose their rigidity on others too.\nHelp people to be alive, not rigid. Help people to be more flexible, flowing, adapting, human. Don’t make them into machines. It is not only a question of doing certain yoga postures. Those postures can be learned by any idiot easily; in fact if a person is an idiot he will learn faster. The question is not only of yoga postures; those yoga postures have to be used only for a certain life source inside, as a provocation. It should not become like an army drill; it should be more like a dance. Just keep that in mind and there will be no problem, and you will be of immense help.\nLet yoga be a kind of dance; keep that quality in mind. Don’t be rigid and don’t try to force forms on people. Rather, help them to find their own dance. Each one has a different kind of body, and when you start forcing a certain form on everybody this is a regimentation. The form has to be used just as a jumping-board and then everybody has to find his own way to use it. Make your yoga more feminine and you will be of great help to people. That is a need that has to be fulfilled: yoga has to be taken from the rigid people.\nIn my new commune I am going to experiment with more flowing forms, with more freedom. Use Patanjali and his yoga postures as jumping-boards and then let everybody seek and search for his own form, his own being, for whatsoever he feels good with. The work of a yoga teacher is not to impose a certain discipline forcibly but to provoke the inner consciousness of the person so that he starts loving his body, so he starts playing with his body as if it is a musical instrument. It is!\nHelp the person to become aware of the mysteries of the body. There are infinite mysteries. Somewhere in your body a Buddha is hidden – he has to be discovered. From the lowest to the highest, all is hidden in the body; the body is a ladder. You can find hell in it and you can find heaven in it. Help people to search, to seek, become more aware and alert about their bodies, about their health, their well-being, their wholeness. This is true yoga. Form is immaterial... form is only a formality. Start teaching from the form but soon help them to go beyond form. And when they transcend form they will have infinite joy and freedom available to them. They will be grateful to you and you will also enjoy the work, because then it will not be just a dead routine; it will be more poetic. And you will also be able to explore new things.\nPatanjali has not exhausted yoga; nobody can exhaust anything ever. But the Indian mind is traditional. Since Patanjali they have not developed Yoga at all; they cling to the form. This is\nstupid. There is no need to cling to Patanjali. Pay homage to Patanjali, he is a great pioneer, but there is no need to remain stuck with him; we have to search further. Patanjali was never aware of these bodies that are available today. In Patanjali’s time a totally different body and a totally different body chemistry was available. Things have changed: man lives longer now, man has developed more capacities in these ages, more potential has become actual, man is more intelligent. Man is more loving, more aware, alert. Each new generation is more intelligent than the previous one. We have to take account of all these things. Patanjali is just a beginning and a rudimentary beginning; it has to be developed, it has to be constantly developed.\nJust think: if traditional people had stopped at Newton and they hadn’t allowed Einstein because they said ‘Enough is enough. Newton has done all’ – then what would the situation of physics be? But they did not. We are not going to stop at Einstein either – we are growing and growing. If after three, four, centuries Einstein comes, he will be surprised! So should be the case with yoga.\nI am very happy that yoga is getting out of this country, moving into new cultures. There it is bound to take new forms – less rigid, more exploratory. The West has much to contribute to yoga as yoga has much to contribute to the West. It is very good that many things that have remained stuck and dormant in India are moving out. It will be good, because new people will start trying new things. New postures can be developed, new body rhythms, new breathing processes.\nThink of it as an exploration. Don’t think in rigid terms. You are not just to be there like a school teacher. Then you will enjoy it. I will help you to be free of the rigidity and that will make you more and more in tune with truth.\n[A sannyasin asks if his energy is negative.]\nIt is neither negative nor positive. It is in a kind of limbo, just on the borderline... very ambiguous. It depends on you: you can choose to be negative very easily, you can choose to be positive very easily. You are sitting on the fence. So it depends on you – if you want to be positive you can immediately become positive.\nBut people who sit on the fence go on sitting on the fence; that becomes their habit. It seems to be less risky, and one can tolerate this kind of indifference...\n[A couple ask about sex and love]\nMm mm. One thing: the animal side is as beautiful as the human side of love. You have some condemnation for the word ‘animal’. And I can understand it because it has been taught again and again down the ages ‘Don’t be like an animal’, as if to be an animal is something bad, something like a sin. Animals are beautiful, innocent, and the animal side is not necessarily the hard side. When we think of animals we think of ferocity, killing each other, blood. That is not the only side of animals. They are very playful too and very loving too, and very soft, tender. Sex is bound to have something of the animal in it, but there is no condemnation. In fact the animal side makes it alive. The wilder the sex is, the more alive it is. You should be happy rather than creating a problem out of it. The softer side, the human side, is not against it. The animal side can become the foundation, and the love, the human love can become the temple on top of it.\nUse it rather than fighting with it. There is no antagonism; the problem is just your mind-created problem. Enjoy both, and slowly slowly you will see a deep harmony between them. There is no disparity, they are not against each other. In fact, if the animal side is missing your love will not have colour, will not have passion, will not have intensity, will not be aflame, will be dull, insipid, pale. The animal side brings blood to it! The blood gives it redness and vitality.\nSimply forget that it is a problem. Enjoy both, and soon they will start meeting and merging into each other and they will become complementaries; in fact, they are complementaries. But your interpretation is wrong. The animal has to play its part: it has to be absorbed by the human – not negated, not denied. And then both the human and the animal have to be absorbed into the divine. It is a pyramid: as you go higher, it becomes smaller, but the peak depends on the base; the base has to be very big. The animal is the base of life, the human the middle of it, and the divine the peak of it. They support each other. They are in perfect harmony.\nJust something that you have been told by the priests is disturbing you. Drop that – say goodbye to the priests and listen to your reality.\n[A sannyasin asks: As far as I know I will be the first sannyasin in the town that I go to, where I live, and there is great publicity now and I feel insecure about dealing with the situation.]\nI will make you capable – don’t be worried! All that bad publicity is going to help my work. Don’t be worried. (laughter) I am behind it – those people are doing my work! Just laugh and enjoy, and help people to understand me by your very being, your meditativeness, your love. My sannyasins will be enough to answer all that bad publicity. Seeing you they will see something of me, and that is the only proof that something beautiful is happening here. You will be the proof, so don’t be worried at all. Just be there and enjoy all that bad publicity about me!\n[A sannyasin says that she’s been alone for the past month, travelling in Ceylon and visiting Buddhist monasteries. She’s begun to feel a rather lovely centring within her but she wonders if it’s really real.]\nIt is true you need not be worried; it is not imagination. And many more things will be happening, so allow them and enjoy them and never for a single moment doubt. Now it is time – the doubt can be dropped. Trust! Things have started happening.\nIn the beginning when nothing is happening doubt is a very good instrument – it prepares you. When things have started happening doubt can be put aside. Then trust helps; now you need trust. The days of doubt are over, that dark night of the soul is finished.\nSo trust in the morning sun and just go with those experiences. They are true and if you trust them, much more will be happening. I am going to be there with you!\n[A sannyasin couple: the swami asks about jealousy and awareness]\nJust remain aware and it will go. Nothing else has to be done about it. Jealousy can remain only if you are unconscious of it. The moment you become alert, it starts going. Just remain watchful. Bring it completely to your awareness, and when it grips you just sit silently and see the whole cloud that surrounds. And don’t leave anything unseen. All the parts, the whole mechanism, has to be seen, and then it will disappear. Nothing to be worried about.\nIt is very human, mm? – because we have been made in such a way by the society that jealousy is the outcome of it. The whole life’s conditioning is to be jealous. The school, the college, the university, the parents, the society – everybody wants you to be jealous, because only out of jealousy can ambition be created, only out of jealousy can possessiveness be created, and only out of jealousy can you be made to become powerful, rich. If jealousy disappears this whole edifice of the society will fall. It is founded on jealousy; jealousy is the cornerstone of this society. It pervades everything, permeates everything.\nSo it is nothing to be worried about, mm? – this is just because you are born in a jealous society which depends on jealousy, lives on jealousy, so it has penetrated your blood, your bones. Just become aware and slowly slowly it will disappear.\n[To the female partner who says she is not sure what to do about it.]\nJust remain natural, as you feel. You need not think of changing yourself. Just be natural and relaxed, and whatsoever the moment brings, go into it. Sometimes it will bring suffering and agony and ecstasy – one has to pass through all those things.\nIt is too early for you to observe. It is good for Krishna Saraswati to observe. If you observe, it will become repression. For you it is better to get involved in things and suffer a little more...\n... Let him observe because he is an old sannyasin, a very ancient seeker! But you are very new and American – just remember it! And he is pure Indian: he can observe easily. You will not be able to right now; it will create trouble. And if you observe and try to control, then you will take revenge on him. You will be angry with him. Rather than being loving you will hate him, because it is because of him that you are doing all these things; your freedom is lost.\nAnd these words – freedom, love, awareness – have different connotations for different people. When an Indian thinks of freedom he means one thing and when an American listens to the word ‘freedom’ he thinks of something else. They are not the same words because they fall on different minds. And psychology is not growing because psychology goes on thinking as if there is only one mind in the world. It is not true – there are as many minds as there are conditioning systems; one psychology won’t do. There have to be as many psychologies as there are minds. You can do one experiment in psychology in America – it won’t be relevant when you work on an Indian mind.\nThat is my problem here, because so many people are here from so many different countries with different conditionings. It is really a great problem. In the new commune I will have to create different types of groups. All groups are not for all. For example, all the groups that are being run in the ashram are good for the Western mind. Japanese people come and the groups are irrelevant, absolutely irrelevant, because they have a totally different kind of psychology; they need a different kind of group.\nSo this is for him – he should observe – and for you, be involved in things and move moment to moment. Soon you will also become capable of observing, but a little more suffering is needed!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4941","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/hallelujah/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/hallelujah/>Hallelujah!</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">25 Bliss is Prayer</h1><div class=post-meta>24 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4941 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Hallelujah/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

not only a change of name but the getting out of the old, dropping out
of the old continuum. It is only symbolic but it carries much meaning in
it. If it is just a change of name it is not significant – then all
names are the same; whether you have one name or another will not make
any difference. If the old continues in the new name too, then you have
only changed the label – the wine is old, the bottle is new – and that
is not going to help at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The change of name has to be understood as being a discontinuity with
the past. It has to be deeply felt as the old being dead and the new
being born. Sannyas is significant only if it is a new birth. If it
remains a horizontal continuity with the past it is utterly meaningless.
It has to be a change of direction, dimension. From being horizontal it
has to become vertical. One has to stop being the old. And this is one
of the fundamentals to understand – that if you decide, it is
immediately possible; all that is needed is a decisiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of time. Time never changes anything – it only
gives the appearance of change; deep down things remain the same. Time
only changes covers, clothes, but never the real essence. It changes the
personality but the personality is not you. Your essence remains
untouched by time. The essence changes only by a kind of absolute
decision. It is a question of decision. If one decides, the change
immediately happens. Because it is you who have decided to be identified
with the personality, with the old name, with the old problems – misery,
anger, sadness, and all that. It is you in the beginning who have
decided to remain identified with all this continuity. It is you who can
immediately break the cooperation.</p><p>And this I call a real drop-out. Dropping out of the society does not
help, because the society has penetrated you so deeply. Your personality
is a given thing from the society. One can have long hair, one can have
orange clothes, one can become a hippie, one can become anything, but
the society has penetrated one very very deeply. You have been drinking
it from the first day, you have been made by it; you are a structure
created by it. How can you drop it? Where are you going to drop it? It
will follow you like your shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>So deep down if you look into the hippie you will find the same man,
the straight man. Nothing has happened – just on the surface new paint,
a new whitewash, and sooner or later the hippie again becomes the
straight man. Suddenly after thirty he disappears. You don’t find old
hippies. Where do they go? It comes like a phase – underneath the same
river flows. Sooner or later they go back to their old pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas has to be a real break away. And all that is needed is your
decisiveness – not a reaction against anything but a loving surrender to
the new. Not that you are against the old;. if you are against the old
you will react. I am not against the old – I am in love with the new.
And the emphasis is very different. It is a search for the unknown. We
have nothing to do – for or against – with the known. The known has been
known, has been lived, we have e *cperienced it; now there is no point
in going on repeating it. And there is no point in being against it
either, because it has helped in its own way. It has brought you here;
it has served its purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>So no need to feel angry about it. Never feel angry against the past;
otherwise you will remain in a very hot relationship with the past.
Anger is a hot, passionate relationship. Never be against the past,
never feel guilty for it, never condemn it, because whatsoever it was,
you have used it as a stepping-stone. Now it is no more relevant, that’s
all, so you are searching for a new relevance.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the hidden meaning in changing the name. It is only symbolic,
but if the symbol is understood well it goes really deep, cuts deep,
like a sword. The old simply becomes history.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, kavyo means poetry – divine poetry</p><p><br></p><p>And that is my vision of religion. Religion is the ultimate in
poetry. Poetry is just groping in darkness for religion. Religion is
poetry arrived, poetry found, poetry realized. Poetry is religion on the
way; religion is goal-arrived. Religion is the ultimate fragrance of
poetry, and poetry is the beginning, the first step towards
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Poets come very close to the mystics. In their real moments of poetry
they are mystics, but no poet is capable of remaining a poet twenty-four
hours a day. There are only moments when he opens up, when suddenly his
ego disappears, when he finds a kind of unity with existence, when he
knows god is – in a flower, in a tree, in a song, in music, in a sunset.
Suddenly he becomes aware of the presence of the divine, but it is only
for a moment, and once the moment is gone the ego comes back, and with a
revenge. That’s why poets are very egoistic too, and there is a very
deep psychological reason in it.</p><p><br></p><p>All artists are egoistic people. You may sometimes find even a
politician humble, but you will not find an artist humble. This looks
very absurd. Why is the artist so egoistic? He goes on beating his own
drum, he goes on shouting against the world, as if only he knows and
nobody else, as if he is the first painter or the first poet or the
first musician, and there is nobody to be compared with him.</p><p>I have heard about George Bernard Shaw that somebody asked him ‘How
are things going in literature nowadays?’ He looked very serious, sad,
and he said ‘You know, Dante is dead, Shakespeare is dead and I am also
not feeling very well.’</p><p><br></p><p>He was joking, certainly, but that has been the approach, always the
attitude of the artist. And the reason is that for a few moments he
loses his ego, and the ego feels hurt, comes with a vengeance and claims
him back, claims him too much in fact. The poetry is born when the
artist disappears, but by the time the poetry is ready, the ego comes to
claim it, to sign it, to make it a point that ‘This is my work.’</p><p><br></p><p>The ancient poets have not signed their works. Nobody knows who wrote
the Upanishads – some of the greatest poetry, each single statement
condensed poetry; out of each single statement great works can arise,
but nobody knows who wrote them. Those poets were not only poets, they
were mystics. They knew that god had written it through them – they were
only instrumental. That’s why Mohammed says ‘It is not me who is writing
the Koran; god has spoken into my ears. I am simply repeating it. If
there are some faults, they are mine; if there is some beauty, it is
his.’ This is the true form of a poet – he cannot claim – but in the
true form, the poet becomes the mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>In the ordinary form for only a few moments, few and far between,
does he take a jump, have an experience of the truth. Then he falls back
on the ground into the valley and into the dark night, and claims ‘This
is my experience, my words, my poetry, my painting, my sculpture...’
brags about it. And the reason is: the ego has to compensate for its
hurt feeling. It cannot forgive the poet so easily, because there was a
moment when he had left it. It jumps upon the poet, possesses his whole
being... but still, the poet reaches very close to the mystic, although
only for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>In Sanskrit we have two words for ‘poet’; no other language has two
words for ‘poet’. One is ‘kavi’, out of which comes ‘kavyo’. ‘Kavi’
means the poet who is only in truth for moments and falls back. Yes, he
has flights into the unknown, but again and again comes back to the
earth. Another word is ‘rishi’; that too means poet, but a poet whose
very state has become that of poetry. He never falls back from it.
Buddha is a rishi, Mohammed is a rishi, so is Christ. They live poetry –
they need not write it. They walk poetry. When they look there is
poetry, when they listen too there is poetry, when they sleep there is
poetry. Poetry is their very state. For the poet poetry is just an
episode, but in the beginning one has to move that way. So move from
being a poet towards being a mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, navyo means new. Truth is always new. Truth has no
past – truth is always present. You cannot say ‘God was’; you cannot say
‘God will be’. You can only say ‘God is’. With god only one tense is
possible: that is the present. And this is the beauty of existence –
that it is continuously renewing itself. Each moment it dies to the past
and is born again. And that has to be the way of a sannyasin: each
moment die to the past. Drop it, let it disappear; don’t cling to its
memory.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain constantly in the present. This moment is all, and this moment
contains eternity. If one can be only in this moment then meditation has
happened. And that brings benediction, because then one is always
virgin, so fresh, as the dewdrops in the morning sun or newly opening
flowers or a lotus in the pond. In that freshness is fragrance. In that
fragrance is joy, because in that fragrance is life, utterly alive,
throbbing, breathing.</p><p>My sannyasin has to be utterly alive alive, spontaneous, responsive
to the moment. My sannyasin has to forget both the past and the future,
because one is no more and the other is not yet. Then you are left only
with this moment and the rain falling on the trees, and the sounds...
and you and me<span class=s4></span>And then there is blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible to be miserable in the present. People are always
miserable because of the past or the future. People are worried because
they have done something in the past or something has been done to them,
or they are worried about whether they will be able to do something
right in the future or not. The present moment is utterly free of worry.
It has a taste of the divine<span class=s4></span>the door to</p><p>god opens through it.</p><p><br></p><p>Smell the rose, but this rose. Drink the water, but this water. Live
the moment, but this moment. And forget all. You will not miss anything
in life. Life will go on showering a thousand and one joys on you. To be
in the present is to be worthy, because to be in the present is to be
receptive, open, unclouded.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, bhavyo means splendour. Life is full of divine
splendour – it is just far-out! It is so beautiful that one cannot
imagine a more beautiful existence. It is impossible to dream a more
beautiful life. But we go on missing because we can see only that for
which we are ready. The blind man cannot see the light and the deaf man
cannot hear the music. And if we don’t see the beauty in life, the
grandeur, that simply shows that we don’t yet have a receptive
heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is an alchemical process of creating a receptive heart so
that you can have eyes in the heart and ears in the heart, so that the
heart can start seeing and can start hearing.<span class=s4></span>so
that you</p><p>don’t see only the outer form of life but you start penetrating into
the inner core of it. It is such an immense gift to be alive, but people
are very ungrateful; they have forgotten how to thank god. They never
feel the awe of existence. They never feel so grateful that they need to
bow down to the earth. They are utterly stonelike, unfeeling, unseeing.
And because of these people – and they are the majority – the whole of
life has become ugly. It is because of these people that life has lost
its joys, celebrations.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember: animals can play but only man can celebrate. It is man’s
privilege and prerogative; no other animal can celebrate. Yes, they can
play, but play is one thing and celebration is totally another.
Celebration is a thankfulness; it is prayer out of gratitude. It is
recognition of the gift that has been given to us... it is
understanding. It is overflowing love for god who has done so much for
us. Just to be alive is so festive. Even for a single moment to feel the
rain and to see the sun and to be on the beach, even for a single moment
to see the stars, is enough for a person to become religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Churches are not needed, priests are not needed, because if people
cannot see the beauty of the trees they will not be able to see the
beauty of the cross, because the cross is just a dead tree. And if
people cannot see the beauty in rose flowers they will not be able to
see the beauty of the eyes of Jesus, because those eyes are also rose
flowers. If they don’t feel the wonder of the sky and the clouds and the
sun, they will not feel the wonder of the presence of a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my message for you on your sannyas birthday: start seeing the
splendour – it is tremendous. Feel more and more and love will arise of
its own accord. One day suddenly you will be surprised –</p><p>you are praying. And then prayer has a beauty of its own when it has
a surprise. A learned prayer is bogus. A learned prayer is Hindu,
Christian, Mohammedan. It is parrotlike, it is mechanical; you repeat it
from the head. It does not arise out of your being; it does not come as
a surprise.</p><p><br></p><p>Real prayer always comes as a surprise. Suddenly you feel one day an
immense urge to bow down... not to anyone in particular but to this
beautiful existence itself. And that’s how one bows down to god.</p><p><br></p><p>[A yoga teacher asks: sometimes when I listen to you speaking about
yoga I get the feeling that I want to be flowing and I want not to be
too tight... ]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. You can be flowing even with yoga. Don’t be very rigid, help
people to be flowing, and then you will come closer to the real yoga
spirit. These rigid yoga teachers are not really yogis; they are just
gymnasts. They themselves are rigid and they are trying to impose their
rigidity on others too.</p><p><br></p><p>Help people to be alive, not rigid. Help people to be more flexible,
flowing, adapting, human. Don’t make them into machines. It is not only
a question of doing certain yoga postures. Those postures can be learned
by any idiot easily; in fact if a person is an idiot he will learn
faster. The question is not only of yoga postures; those yoga postures
have to be used only for a certain life source inside, as a provocation.
It should not become like an army drill; it should be more like a dance.
Just keep that in mind and there will be no problem, and you will be of
immense help.</p><p><br></p><p>Let yoga be a kind of dance; keep that quality in mind. Don’t be
rigid and don’t try to force forms on people. Rather, help them to find
their own dance. Each one has a different kind of body, and when you
start forcing a certain form on everybody this is a regimentation. The
form has to be used just as a jumping-board and then everybody has to
find his own way to use it. Make your yoga more feminine and you will be
of great help to people. That is a need that has to be fulfilled: yoga
has to be taken from the rigid people.</p><p><br></p><p>In my new commune I am going to experiment with more flowing forms,
with more freedom. Use Patanjali and his yoga postures as jumping-boards
and then let everybody seek and search for his own form, his own being,
for whatsoever he feels good with. The work of a yoga teacher is not to
impose a certain discipline forcibly but to provoke the inner
consciousness of the person so that he starts loving his body, so he
starts playing with his body as if it is a musical instrument. It
is!</p><p><br></p><p>Help the person to become aware of the mysteries of the body. There
are infinite mysteries. Somewhere in your body a Buddha is hidden – he
has to be discovered. From the lowest to the highest, all is hidden in
the body; the body is a ladder. You can find hell in it and you can find
heaven in it. Help people to search, to seek, become more aware and
alert about their bodies, about their health, their well-being, their
wholeness. This is true yoga. Form is immaterial... form is only a
formality. Start teaching from the form but soon help them to go beyond
form. And when they transcend form they will have infinite joy and
freedom available to them. They will be grateful to you and you will
also enjoy the work, because then it will not be just a dead routine; it
will be more poetic. And you will also be able to explore new
things.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali has not exhausted yoga; nobody can exhaust anything ever.
But the Indian mind is traditional. Since Patanjali they have not
developed Yoga at all; they cling to the form. This is</p><p>stupid. There is no need to cling to Patanjali. Pay homage to
Patanjali, he is a great pioneer, but there is no need to remain stuck
with him; we have to search further. Patanjali was never aware of these
bodies that are available today. In Patanjali’s time a totally different
body and a totally different body chemistry was available. Things have
changed: man lives longer now, man has developed more capacities in
these ages, more potential has become actual, man is more intelligent.
Man is more loving, more aware, alert. Each new generation is more
intelligent than the previous one. We have to take account of all these
things. Patanjali is just a beginning and a rudimentary beginning; it
has to be developed, it has to be constantly developed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think: if traditional people had stopped at Newton and they
hadn’t allowed Einstein because they said ‘Enough is enough. Newton has
done all’ – then what would the situation of physics be? But they did
not. We are not going to stop at Einstein either – we are growing and
growing. If after three, four, centuries Einstein comes, he will be
surprised! So should be the case with yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>I am very happy that yoga is getting out of this country, moving into
new cultures. There it is bound to take new forms – less rigid, more
exploratory. The West has much to contribute to yoga as yoga has much to
contribute to the West. It is very good that many things that have
remained stuck and dormant in India are moving out. It will be good,
because new people will start trying new things. New postures can be
developed, new body rhythms, new breathing processes.</p><p><br></p><p>Think of it as an exploration. Don’t think in rigid terms. You are
not just to be there like a school teacher. Then you will enjoy it. I
will help you to be free of the rigidity and that will make you more and
more in tune with truth.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asks if his energy is negative.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is neither negative nor positive. It is in a kind of limbo, just
on the borderline... very ambiguous. It depends on you: you can choose
to be negative very easily, you can choose to be positive very easily.
You are sitting on the fence. So it depends on you – if you want to be
positive you can immediately become positive.</p><p><br></p><p>But people who sit on the fence go on sitting on the fence; that
becomes their habit. It seems to be less risky, and one can tolerate
this kind of indifference...</p><p><br></p><p>[A couple ask about sex and love]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm. One thing: the animal side is as beautiful as the human side
of love. You have some condemnation for the word ‘animal’. And I can
understand it because it has been taught again and again down the ages
‘Don’t be like an animal’, as if to be an animal is something bad,
something like a sin. Animals are beautiful, innocent, and the animal
side is not necessarily the hard side. When we think of animals we think
of ferocity, killing each other, blood. That is not the only side of
animals. They are very playful too and very loving too, and very soft,
tender. Sex is bound to have something of the animal in it, but there is
no condemnation. In fact the animal side makes it alive. The wilder the
sex is, the more alive it is. You should be happy rather than creating a
problem out of it. The softer side, the human side, is not against it.
The animal side can become the foundation, and the love, the human love
can become the temple on top of it.</p><p>Use it rather than fighting with it. There is no antagonism; the
problem is just your mind-created problem. Enjoy both, and slowly slowly
you will see a deep harmony between them. There is no disparity, they
are not against each other. In fact, if the animal side is missing your
love will not have colour, will not have passion, will not have
intensity, will not be aflame, will be dull, insipid, pale. The animal
side brings blood to it! The blood gives it redness and vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>Simply forget that it is a problem. Enjoy both, and soon they will
start meeting and merging into each other and they will become
complementaries; in fact, they are complementaries. But your
interpretation is wrong. The animal has to play its part: it has to be
absorbed by the human – not negated, not denied. And then both the human
and the animal have to be absorbed into the divine. It is a pyramid: as
you go higher, it becomes smaller, but the peak depends on the base; the
base has to be very big. The animal is the base of life, the human the
middle of it, and the divine the peak of it. They support each other.
They are in perfect harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>Just something that you have been told by the priests is disturbing
you. Drop that – say goodbye to the priests and listen to your
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asks: As far as I know I will be the first sannyasin in
the town that I go to, where I live, and there is great publicity now
and I feel insecure about dealing with the situation.]</p><p><br></p><p>I will make you capable – don’t be worried! All that bad publicity is
going to help my work. Don’t be worried. (laughter) I am behind it –
those people are doing my work! Just laugh and enjoy, and help people to
understand me by your very being, your meditativeness, your love. My
sannyasins will be enough to answer all that bad publicity. Seeing you
they will see something of me, and that is the only proof that something
beautiful is happening here. You will be the proof, so don’t be worried
at all. Just be there and enjoy all that bad publicity about me!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says that she’s been alone for the past month,
travelling in Ceylon and visiting Buddhist monasteries. She’s begun to
feel a rather lovely centring within her but she wonders if it’s really
real.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is true you need not be worried; it is not imagination. And many
more things will be happening, so allow them and enjoy them and never
for a single moment doubt. Now it is time – the doubt can be dropped.
Trust! Things have started happening.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning when nothing is happening doubt is a very good
instrument – it prepares you. When things have started happening doubt
can be put aside. Then trust helps; now you need trust. The days of
doubt are over, that dark night of the soul is finished.</p><p><br></p><p>So trust in the morning sun and just go with those experiences. They
are true and if you trust them, much more will be happening. I am going
to be there with you!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin couple: the swami asks about jealousy and awareness]</p><p><br></p><p>Just remain aware and it will go. Nothing else has to be done about
it. Jealousy can remain only if you are unconscious of it. The moment
you become alert, it starts going. Just remain watchful. Bring it
completely to your awareness, and when it grips you just sit silently
and see the whole cloud that surrounds. And don’t leave anything unseen.
All the parts, the whole mechanism, has to be seen, and then it will
disappear. Nothing to be worried about.</p><p>It is very human, mm? – because we have been made in such a way by
the society that jealousy is the outcome of it. The whole life’s
conditioning is to be jealous. The school, the college, the university,
the parents, the society – everybody wants you to be jealous, because
only out of jealousy can ambition be created, only out of jealousy can
possessiveness be created, and only out of jealousy can you be made to
become powerful, rich. If jealousy disappears this whole edifice of the
society will fall. It is founded on jealousy; jealousy is the
cornerstone of this society. It pervades everything, permeates
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is nothing to be worried about, mm? – this is just because you
are born in a jealous society which depends on jealousy, lives on
jealousy, so it has penetrated your blood, your bones. Just become aware
and slowly slowly it will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>[To the female partner who says she is not sure what to do about
it.]</p><p><br></p><p>Just remain natural, as you feel. You need not think of changing
yourself. Just be natural and relaxed, and whatsoever the moment brings,
go into it. Sometimes it will bring suffering and agony and ecstasy –
one has to pass through all those things.</p><p><br></p><p>It is too early for you to observe. It is good for Krishna Saraswati
to observe. If you observe, it will become repression. For you it is
better to get involved in things and suffer a little more...</p><p><br></p><p>... Let him observe because he is an old sannyasin, a very ancient
seeker! But you are very new and American – just remember it! And he is
pure Indian: he can observe easily. You will not be able to right now;
it will create trouble. And if you observe and try to control, then you
will take revenge on him. You will be angry with him. Rather than being
loving you will hate him, because it is because of him that you are
doing all these things; your freedom is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>And these words – freedom, love, awareness – have different
connotations for different people. When an Indian thinks of freedom he
means one thing and when an American listens to the word ‘freedom’ he
thinks of something else. They are not the same words because they fall
on different minds. And psychology is not growing because psychology
goes on thinking as if there is only one mind in the world. It is not
true – there are as many minds as there are conditioning systems; one
psychology won’t do. There have to be as many psychologies as there are
minds. You can do one experiment in psychology in America – it won’t be
relevant when you work on an Indian mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That is my problem here, because so many people are here from so many
different countries with different conditionings. It is really a great
problem. In the new commune I will have to create different types of
groups. All groups are not for all. For example, all the groups that are
being run in the ashram are good for the Western mind. Japanese people
come and the groups are irrelevant, absolutely irrelevant, because they
have a totally different kind of psychology; they need a different kind
of group.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is for him – he should observe – and for you, be involved in
things and move moment to moment. Soon you will also become capable of
observing, but a little more suffering is needed!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

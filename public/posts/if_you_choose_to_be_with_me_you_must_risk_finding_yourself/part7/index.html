Your heights are higher than the Himalayas, and your depths are deeper than the Pacific. God has given you so much, he has made you so rich, so inexhaustibly rich -- and we are living like beggars.\nMy sannyas means a declaration that you are no more a beggar but an emperor, an empress.\nWe are never born and we never die. Birth and death are both episodes in an eternal life. Life does not begin with birth and does not end with death. It is before death, it is after death; it continues. birth and death are ordinary episodes,\nincidents, nothing of much importance. Millions of times you have been born and millions of times you have died, and still you are, nothing has happened to you. No birth, no death has left even a trace upon your being. It is as clean, as pure as ever, unpolluted, fresh, young, but we don't know how to find it, where to find it.\nWe are so identified with the body and the mind -- that's the only problem. That has to be resolved. If you think you are the body-mind, then you will never find your immortality. This is a fallacy which has to be dropped. You are a witness. You can see your body, you can see your mind, so you are the seer not the seen, you are the observer not the object of observation. Because mind can be observed it is an object; the body can be observed, it is an object. You are the observer, always the observer and never anything else.\nBecome more and more centred in your observation, in your witnessing, in your awareness. And that will give you the key, that will unlock the door of immortality in you. Unless one knows that one is immortal, fear never disappears. And it is fear that destroys all your energies. It is fear that does not allow us to love. How can you love when you are afraid. It is fear that never allows us to live totally, whole-heartedly. If you are afraid, how can you live totally and whole-heartedly? -- you are always holding back. You go only so far and then you stop.\nWhen fear disappears life becomes love, when fear is no more, life becomes a beautiful adventure. Then it is from one peak to another peak, a constant rising upwards -- and there is no end to that eternal journey.\nMind is man. When you go beyond mind you go beyond humanity. The animal is below mind, the Buddhas are beyond mind, and between the animals and the Buddhas are all human beings. Human beings are in a kind of limbo-half animal, half god. the past is animal, and the future and the potential are divine; hence man is in more anguish than any animal on the earth. All animals are at ease, at peace with themselves. They are in a way complete, nothing is missing. A dog is a dog and a cat is a cat.\nMan is not complete, he is incomplete. Something is missing. He is on the way. He has left the past and he has not reached the goal yet. He is on the way, he is a traveller. That creates anxiety as to whether or not he will be able to make it. And that creates many problems, many times. One problem is the desire to go\nback, to be an animal again. So in many moments you become animal again. When you are angry, when you become sexual, when you are full of lust, when you are greedy, when you lose all awareness and you start functioning mechanically you fall below humanity.\nIt is because of this that drugs have so much appeal: drugs help people to fall below the mind. You forget all the problems and all the anxieties when you are under the impact of a drug, alcohol or anything else. But sooner or later you have to come back to your senses and all your problems are there. In fact they have grown meanwhile. Nothing is gained, you have simply wasted time.\nBut the desire to go back arises for the simple reason that the future seems to be unknown, uncertain; the past seems to be certain, you have known it, your body knows it, you every cell is created by the past, you mind is created by the past. So the past has a great pull over you, but nobody can go to the past again -- that is a problem. Once the child is born he cannot go back into the womb again. Once you have become a young person, howsoever beautiful the childhood was you cannot be a child again, there is no going back.\nOne can enjoy the idea of going back, one can imagine also that one is back again, but there is no possible way of going back. You cannot move backwards in time, time has no reverse gear in it. You have to go ahead, either dancingly or reluctantly -- that is up to you. If you go dancingly you go joyously. If you go reluctantly you go in misery, in suffering.\nMan has to go beyond himself, man has to surpass himself, only then does man become complete. That is a paradox. Only by going beyond himself does he becomes complete, entire. Then he again knows the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeauty of being. The becoming is over, the travelling is finished, one has arrived. That's the state of a buddha, the enlightened person.\nGo beyond mind so that you can go beyond humanity, so that you can surpass humanity. That is the greatest challenge, and only the greatest can accept it. In\nthe acceptance of the challenge something great is born in you. Sannyas is a challenge, the challenge of surpassing yourself.\nMind is never silent. It is constantly chattering. It is constantly crowded with many thoughts, desires. It goes on dreaming and dreaming. It is never still even for a single moment. And we have become identified with the mind, we think that we are our mind. That is creating the whole misery.\nGet out of the mind and you will come back to your senses. Get out of the mind because the mind is a kind of madness. But one can get out of the mind in two ways. One is falling below it -- then you will have to be put in a mental asylum. The other is going beyond it -- then you become a Buddha or a Jesus. So please choose this way, the second.\nThere is a fear of going out of the mind. The fear is because mad people are also out of the mind. But they have fallen below, and one has to rise above. When you rise above the mind great silence descends.\nYou see the mind deep down in the valley chattering still, but the distance becomes bigger and bigger every day and one day you cannot hear all that chattering at all. That day one becomes enlightened.\nMind lives either in the past or in the future. If you are young then the mind lives in the past. The old man has no future. He knows that there is death so he is afraid to look at the future. He goes on reminiscing about the past, all that has been and is no more. He enjoys those golden days. Much of it is just imagination, it has never been there; much of it is just invention to remain occupied.\nThe moment a person starts living in the past is the moment when he starts becoming old.\nPsychologically, that is the point from where one becomes old. Physiologically, it may not coincide, that that is the psychological old age, when you start thinking about the past and the beauties of the past and those golden experiences and those nice days, and how everything was just great. The future is so dark that you are afraid to look at it and you want to remain occupied with the past.\nBut that is not so with the young person. The young person looks at the future.\nDeath is far away, in fact the young person never thinks of death. It is so far away, it is beyond his scope to think about it; he does not have that much insight. So he lives in the future, he makes castles in the air:\"I will do this and I will get that and I will be this and tomorrow it is going to happen; if not tomorrow then the day after tomorrow.\"\nThe old man wastes his present in the past, the young man wastes his present engaged in the future.\nBoth exercises are absolutely futile. Not only futile but very harmful, because the present which is, is being wasted for that which is not.\nDon't think of the future. Live in the present. That's my message to you. Be in the present moment. And if you can be present to the moment you escape from all kinds of stupidities of the old people. If you can be in the present you transcend time. Time consists of past and future, eternity consists only of the present.\nEternity is now, always now and never then, always here and never there. And to enter into the now and the here is to enter into God.\nThis has to become your meditation, to come more and more close to the present moment. I am not saying not tp prepare for a journey. If you are going somewhere you will have to purchase the ticket ahead of time, you will have to plan it. I'm not saying not to do that. That has nothing to do with the future. What I mean is a psychological hope, desire, because the present seems to be unfulfilling you escape into the future and you start hoping that there will be fulfilment.\nStop going into the psychological future. The factual future is okay, it is not a disturbance at all. The factual past is also okay, it is not a disturbance at all. You have to remember your name and your address and when you meet your father you have to recognise him. You can't say to him \"The past is the past and I don't know who your are!\"(laughter) These are factual things, they are perfectly okay. But deep inside, the past should not possess you and the future should not be your occupation. Relax into the moment. And then one is entitled to all kinds of miracles.\nMan can live his life in two ways. One is out of the past; then life is not a response but a reaction. You live through ready-made conclusions, you don't\nrespond to the moment. To the situation that is confronting you. You already have an answer, even before the question is raised. Your answer will never fit the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nquestion, because life goes on changing. Every moment it is different, every moment it is new. It is always novel, it is always a surprise. It never loses that quality of surprise. but if you are carrying too many ready-made answers in your mind you will miss the newness of life.\nThe other way to live is not to live through the past but to live directly, immediately, to live without the mind, to respond like a mirror, to reflect that which is. and the life of response has tremendous beauty, grace, truth and sincerity, because whatsoever you do is adequate. You never repent for it. It always fits the situation. It comes out of your consciousness, it does not come out of the cultivated character.\nLet it be a key for you. Live naturally, spontaneously, responsively, meditatively, in the present, here and now, and then you will know the significance of your life. Millions of mysteries will open their doors for you.\nThe whole of humanity can be divided into two categories: the fools and the wise. The fools are those who live in a false world, a world of their own imagination. They live in dreams, they believe in their dreams, and obviously they are doomed because dreams are dreams and they can never become real.\nThe wise ones are those who have dropped all dreams, all sleep, who have become aware, who don't project anything onto existence, who are just mirrors that don't project anything; they simply reflect. And when one becomes a mirror life is a sheer joy. Each moment is so precious, so ecstatic, that one could not have imagined it. Each people on the seashore suddenly turns into a diamond and each flower has the face of God. The whole existence starts overflowing with godliness. One is born anew.\nEverybody is born as a fool because everybody is born asleep, dreaming.\nEverybody has the capacity to wake up but very few people use their capacity to wake up. By becoming a sannyasin you are taking a vow to wake up. That's what sannyas is all about: a decision to wake up. And if you are really intent, it is bound to happen. It is inevitable.\nMan is a seed of divine glory, but only a seed -- remember it. It is not yet a flower, it has not even started growing. It is a potentiality.\nAt birth we are only potential beings. Life is an opportunity to actualise the potential. But very few people work upon themselves. They pay much attention to money, power, prestige, and they don't pay any attention to their own growth, which is the most essential thing because everything else will be taken away.\nDeath will destroy all your sandcastles, but it cannot destroy your growth, it cannot destroy whatsoever you have made actual in your inner being. That is beyond the grasp of death. And that which is beyond the grasp of death is the real treasure.\nIn the world people think that they are gaining, earning, being successful; they are simply living in illusion. The only people who are gaining something are the people who are moving inwards, who are becoming more and more alert to their immense potential, who are trying to transform it into a reality.\nWhen one realises one's potential in its totality one is a god. God is not some person somewhere, it is the ultimate state of consciousness. Everybody is capable of becoming a god -- and if we miss we miss because of ourselves, nobody else can be held responsible.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are taking the whole responsibility upon yourself. It is a commitment to growth, a commitment towards self-actualisation, with a deep understanding that this is our responsibility towards ourselves, all other responsibilities are secondary.\nAnd if the primary is not fulfilled you will not be able to fulfil the secondary responsibilities. If the primary is fulfilled the secondary responsibilities are easily fulfilled.\nBecome what you can become.\nMan is a seed. If you cut the seed there is no fragrance, but if you sow the seed,\nif you give it the right soil, the right climate, the right amount of fertiliser and water and sun and air, the seed disappears and a sprout arises. Soon there are many many leaves and great foliage, and then flowers appear. And then the miracle -- the miracle of fragrance. It was hidden in the seed but it needed a certain process to become manifest.\nGod is hidden in us like fragrance in a seed. It needs a certain progress to become manifest. Right now it is hidden but it can become manifest.\nSannyas means initiation into a certain mystery, in a certain mystic path which can help you go through the great transformation from the seed to the fragrance.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWe are seeds but it would be unfortunate to die as a seed. We have to become flowers and we have to release our fragrance, only then is there contentment. A tree is fulfilled when it blooms, when the spring comes and the tree has released, poured its heart into colours, into fragrance, into joy. When the tree is dancing in the wind, in the sun, it is fulfilled.\nExactly is the case with man too. A Buddha is a tree which has bloomed, a Jesus is a tree which has come to release its fragrance. We are all carrying the same kind of seeds in us. Everyone is a Buddha unmanifest, a Christ ready to be born at any moment.\nMy work here is to make you aware of your great potential, of your infinite possibility, of the heights that you can reach, of the depth that you can penetrate. Your heights are higher than the Himalayas, and your depths are deeper than the Pacific. And once you know your heights and your depths, life becomes nothing but gratitude. God has given you so much. He has poured all his creativity into your being, he has made you so rich, so inexhaustibly rich -- and we are living like beggars.\nMy sannyas means a declaration that you are no more a beggar, but an emperor,\nan empress.\nOne can exist in two ways: either by fighting on the outside for money, for power, for prestige... To conquer the world -- that is one way of life. It is a futile way. It is for the stupid and the mediocre, but it is very attractive, for the simple reason that everybody is running for it. And man is a great imitator: seeing everybody rushing for something he also starts rushing. He starts thinking that there must be something there, otherwise why are so many people going? And there is every possibility that others are going for the same reason -- because others are going. Everybody may be going for the same reason.\nNobody knows why people are running towards money, power and prestige, but they are running. It is a kind of madness, but it gives something, it feeds your ego.\nThe fight is futile, the ego is false and when you die you have to leave everything that you have conquered. That's why everybody dies crying and weeping, in deep pain and suffering. The pain and suffering is not because of death, remember. The pain is basically that \"I lived my life in a futile way; the time is gone and I am finished and my hands are empty.\" That is the pain not the pain of death.\nDeath is not painful, death is very soothing, like deep sleep. The pain is that \"The whole of life has passed and I was just making castles in the air and I am going empty-handed. I came empty-handed and I am going empty-handed. My whole life has been a sheer wastage.\"\nBut there is another way to live too. One can be an inner warrior. One can conquer one's unconsciousness, one can conquer one's greed, anger, sexuality. One can transform all these energies into something tremendously beautiful. and when one has known the secret of transforming one's inner being, there is great joy. Every fibre of your being dances with joy because now you know that death cannot take anything away from you. Now you know that you have attained the real treasure.\nSo be a warrior in the second sense. The real fight is in, not there on the outside, and the real fight is not with others. The real fight is with your own unconsciousness, with your own unawareness.\nOur desires are dreams, all our thoughts are dreams. And we go on continuously\nliving in dreams because we are asleep. Dreams can exist only if we are asleep, and dreams disappear the moment we awake.\nGoing beyond dreams means awaking.\nIt is time! Enough you have sleep... for many many lives. Don't miss this opportunity to wake up because rare is the opportunity, and to miss it is very easy. So put your whole energy into waking up.\nIn the beginning it seems almost impossible -- how to do it? But if one goes on trying... In sleep one tosses and turns but if one goes on tossing and turning, it is bound to disrupt the sleep. And just a moment's glimpse of being awake is enough to trigger a new process in your being. Then more and more moments of awakening happen. And the day that one becomes fully awakened, twenty-four hours a day, even while one is asleep one remains alert, aware, when the body sleeps but the soul never sleeps, when one is capable of being awake twenty-four hours a day even when the body is resting -- then one should feel contented. One has arrived. Before that, make every possible effort that you can. Don't leave any stone unturned.\nWe live in desire. Desire means discontentment. Desire means that whatsoever is, is not right, not enough, more is needed. And desire is never fulfilled. It is unfulfillable by its very nature.\nYou can have as much as you desire, but the moment you have it desire goes on jumping ahead of you, it starts asking for more. Its greed knows no limits, it is unlimited greed. It is like the horizon: it looks so close -- you can reach it within an hour if you run. But you cannot reach it, you can never reach it. The 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndistance between you and the horizon will remain the same, constantly the same, because there is no horizon; it is an illusion. The earth is not meeting with the sky anywhere, it only appears to be.\nSo is the case with desire. It only appears that if I could reach to that point, if I\ncould attain to this or that, there would be contentment. I would be happy, I would be fulfilled. But it never happens.\nOne has to understand desiring and its futility. In that very understanding desire disappears and one is left at home in deep peace. When there is no desire, there is no disturbance. Desire is the only disturbance.\nWhen all desires have gone there is tremendous silence inside. In that silence you become aware of the presence of God, and that is fulfilling. That fulfils because it brings joy, infinite joy. It fulfils because it brings something of the beyond, something which cannot be taken away from you, something which is inexhaustible, something deathless. It opens the doors of the kingdom of God. It is your kingdom, because you are not separate from God and God is not separate from you.\nSo your work has to be to understand desiring; and in that very understanding it drops. You are not to renounce it, you are not to repress it, because if you repress it, it will come up again, if you renounce it, it will follow you. It is only through deep understanding that it disappears.\nMan lives in bondage, and the bondage is not imposed by others, it is self- created. It is created because we are afraid of the insecure. In the name of security we create a bondage around ourselves. Yes, it gives a feeling of cosiness, warmth, safety, but it is all false because sooner or later death will take it all away.\nBecause of this we never explore, we never go beyond the boundaries of the familiar. The familiar is very small and we go on moving in the familiar, in circles. Our life knows no growth, because growth can only happen if we move not in circles but in a line. If we are linear then there is growth. If we go around in circles we go on repeating the same thing again and again.\nFreedom is possible because we have made our own prison. We can get out of it any moment that we decide to. It is only a question of decision, of courage, of guts.\nFreedom is the ultimate value in life. Nothing is more important than that, because out of it comes everything else that is valuable. Love arises as a fragrance, joy arises, meaning arises; for the first time life becomes significant, tremendously significant. And one is constantly moving beyond the known,\ngoing into the unknown. Life becomes a thrill, an adventure. But we have made life just a dragging affair. It seems safe, it appears secure, but there is no security, no safety anywhere. They are impossible.\nLife in its intrinsicalness is insecure. Only death is secure. You cannot take anything away from a dead man -- or can you? even death cannot do any harm to him, he is already dead. In his grave he is so absolutely secure.\nBecause we are so obsessed with security we have made our houses our graves. We don't live in them, we only die in them slowly slowly; it is a gradual kind of suicide.\nSannyas means freedom, freedom from all self-created securities, safeties. In the beginning one feels afraid, scared, that is natural, but once you become attuned to the insecure and you know the joy of insecurity then you never look back to those old toys that you used to think were keeping you life secure.\nAnd they were not securities, they were simply prisons, chains around your being.\nOne need not be a Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, Catholic or communist -- these are all self-created prisons. One need not live in an ideology. One should be free from all ideologies, all dogmas, creeds, scriptures. Only then is life an exploration, because when you don't have any conclusion you can explore.\nWe are brought up in such a way that we are reduced to slaves. And the slavery is so subtle that very rarely do we become aware of it. We go on living life as a slave thinking that this is all that there is to live.\nThis is not all, this is nothing. This is not even the beginning.\nLife begins only when you become free from all kinds of bondages: the bondage of nation, the bondage of race, the bondage of church -- ideological, social, political, religious. When you become free from all these imprisonments, when you simply drop all that you have been told is important, when you simply drop all that you have been told to believe in; when you neither believe nor disbelieve a great freedom arises in your being. That freedom is sannyas; and that freedom then takes you higher and higher towards the ultimate.\nOnly a free person can know what truth is, and only a free person can know what\ngod is, what love is.\nFreedom is very essential because it is the foundation of all that is beautiful and great.\nLight is the stuff that existence is made of. Mystics have been saying so for centuries, now physicists 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalso agree with it in their own way. It is the only point on which mystics and the physicists agree, that existence is made of light. Mystics have come to it through the experience of their own being. The deeper you go, the lighter it becomes.\nIn the beginning, when you start entering into yourself, it is very dark, very very dark, unimaginably dark. You cannot believe that darkness can be so thick and so dense. that's why many people escape immediately. It is frightening, it looks like death. But if you persist, and great perseverance is needed, if you go on digging deeper and deeper, the darkness becomes less and less dark, a little light starts arising. At the innermost core of your being there is nothing but light.\nNow start moving inwards, and don't be afraid of the darkness that you will encounter, which is bound to be encountered. When you encounter darkness it is a good sign, you are moving in. and if darkness is encountered than light is not far away. When the night is very dark, the dawn is very close.\nWe are born of light, we are part of infinite light, and one day we have to disappear into that infinity again. We are just rays of a faraway sun. We have forgotten our home, we have forgotten our source.\nTo be a sannyasin means that now you are getting ready to remember it. Sannyas is a gesture that \"I am available to be reminded of my home, of my real home, of my real source.\"\nWe are rays of light. We are not gross, nothing is gross. Because existence is a manifestation of god, everything is very subtle. Even matter is not material, even\nmatter is just pure light, condensed light.\nEverything is a different manifestation of light, a tremendously mysterious wave in the ocean of light.\nTo see it, to feel it, to recognize it, is meditation. Watch inside, watch outside. In the beginning it is difficult to see walls as pure light, but even physicists agree that they are pure light, nothing but electrons, condensed electricity. And walls are not static, rocks are not static; electrons are continuously in a tremendous dance. The whole existence is a dance.\nWhen you start seeing it all around you it is a transformed world. And the day you see it inside too, the division between the inside and the outside disappears, then it is all one, it is the same phenomenon. One loses one's ego, one loses one's identity as a separate being. One becomes part of the whole. And to be part of the whole is to be holy. That is true holiness.\nThose phony holy people you meet in the churches, in the mosque and in the temples are not holy at all.\nThey have no idea of the whole. They are very egoistic. Of course they have very pious egos, holier-than-thou, but a pious ego is the most egoistic phenomenon in the world. It is the most poisonous, because it is so subtle.\nEnlightenment is a forgotten language, it has to be remembered. Sannyas is just the beginning of turning in, looking in.\nFollowing Christ does not mean following Jesus. When Jesus disappears Christ is born in him. When Gautam Siddhartha disappears Buddha is born in him. They are totally different phenomena, but people have got them mixed-up. They think that to follow Christ means to follow Jesus. Nobody can follow Jesus because nobody can be like Jesus; God never creates the same person again. But Christ can be followed because Christ is a state of consciousness. It has nothing to do with the person, Jesus. He is one of the Christs, that is true, but there have been many other Christs and there will be many more.\nAnyone who attains to the ultimate flowering is a Christ. To be enlightened is to be a Christ. To know who you are is to be a Christ. But Christianity has taken a very wrong route. It became too focussed on Jesus, the person, they completely forgot about the flowering, the fragrance which really makes him valuable.\nWithout that fragrance he is nobody, just an ordinary carpenter.\nChristhood means that meditation has come to its peak. One has gone beyond misery, beyond ego, beyond mind, beyond time. One has become one with the whole.\nBlissfully follow the subtle path of being a Christ. Never be a Christian, be a Christ. When one can be a Christ why settle for being a Christian? When one can be a Buddha why be a Buddhist? That's my basic message here, that you are carrying within you the ultimate. There is no need to settle for less than that.\n[ page missing? 241/190]\n... that the person cannot even see that it is there. and it works from the back door, it is never there in front of you. It works from the depth of your being. Your saints, your mahatmas, are nothing but egos painted in a religious way.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut the real sage is one who is no more. He has drowned himself in the totality, he has merged with the source. That source is light and that source is God.\nWe are made of light; hence when you enter into deep meditation you start feeling more and more light inside. When you reach to the very central core all is light, pure light. That experience is called enlightenment for the simple reason that you become light again.\nEach being is born enlightened. Each being is born a Buddha, a Christ. These are not states which have to be achieved, these are states which have to be only recognised, which we only have to discover within our own being. One has not to go anywhere, one has not to do anything. It is not a process of becoming, enlightenment is a state of being.\nBecoming means desire. Becoming means that it will happen in the future.\nBecoming means that you will have to strive for it. You may succeed, you may not succeed. Who knows? Becoming means that you will remain tense until it happens -- and enlightenment cannot happen if you are tense. Enlightenment cannot happen if you live in desires, in the future. Enlightenment is possible only when you are desireless, relaxed, utterly herenow. So it cannot be made an object of desire. To make it an object of desire is to miss the point from the very beginning. It is pure understanding that we are already in that space, we just don't look in. We have not lost it, we have only forgotten it.\nThe early Christians used to call themselves bearers of the Christ, carriers of Christ in the heart. The ordinary, so-called Christian also carries Christ -- but in the head, not in the heart. to understand it is of great significance.\nCarrying Christ in your head is absolutely meaningless. And that's what Christians are doing, and others are doing the same: Hindus carrying Krishna in the head, Buddhists carrying Buddha in the head. And these are not things of the head, these are not thoughts. These are deep, deep experiences, profound feelings. They can happen only in the heart. And when they happen in the heart you don't become a Christian, you become a Christ. You don't become a Buddhist, you become a Buddha.\nIt is ugly to be a Buddhist or a Christian. When you can be a Buddha or a Christ, why settle for being a Christian or a Buddhist? That is settling for something plastic, something pseudo.\nChrist is a state of consciousness, just as Buddha is a state of consciousness. Really, the state of consciousness that in the East is called Buddha, in the West is called Christ. It is not different, only the language differs, but both words indicate the same flowering. Your heart becomes a flower, a lotus, and a great fragrance is released. That fragrance is bliss.\nSo remember, don't allow sannyas to become part of your head. Let it go down deep into your heart. The relationship with me has to be of the heart, not of the head. The heady people are going to miss me totally.\nThey may think that they understand me but they understand only words. They don't understand me.\nOnly the people of the heart are going to be my people, because only they will be able to understand that which cannot be understood. Only they will be able to\ncomprehend that which is incomprehensible.\nThe mysteries can only be revealed to those who have chopped off their heads completely, who are no more heads but just pure hearts.\nMan is not as small as he appears. He is vast, he is tremendously vast. He is oceanic. Even the ocean has boundaries, and man has no boundaries. Even the ocean is not so vast. Man's vastness is the only proof that God is. God is another name for man's vastness. We are not confined to the body and we are not confined to the mind either. We are beyond both.\nThe whole process of sannyas is that of peeling an onion. There are many layers of identification, and we have to drop all the layers slowly slowly slowly. Finally nothing is left -- that nothing is you.\nOnly nothing can be vast. Something is bound to be infinite. Only nothingness is infinite; hence God is ultimate nothingness. God is not a being but the ultimate non-being. He is not somebody, he is absolute nobodiness. He is only a presence, infinite, unbounded. and so are we. we are not different from god. We are part of that infinity.\nEveryone is a god. Nobody can be anything else because only God exists. God is synonymous with existence. To be means to be a god. But we don't remember it, we are absolutely oblivious to it. So the question is not how to achieve godhood, the question is how to remember it. It is a forgotten language.\nMy effort here is to help you to remember something that is already there. Nothing has to be achieved.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou have only to discover yourself, to discover who you are, and you will know that you are God. And the moment you know you are God the whole existence becomes divine, then everybody is god. And that day is of tremendous joy, when\nthe whole existence looks divine to you. You are surrounded by gods. Naturally, great rejoicing arises in your heart.\nFrom the very beginning we are that which we have been seeking all along. We are already that for which we are looking everywhere. It is our self-nature. Truth, bliss, freedom, God - they are different names of our self-nature.\nOne need not go anywhere, one has only to dig within oneself. On the outside one will find only frustration, failure. You cannot find that which can fulfill you. Yes, one can have as much money as one wants, one can have a great kingdom like Alexander, Napoleon, but one still remains a beggar, still seeking and searching. There seems to be no fulfillment through power, prestige, money. And the reason is not that fulfillment is not possible.\nSigmund Freud says that it is not possible because he never looked within. He says that man is destined to remain miserable, so all that we can do is to help him to be a little less miserable. We can help him to understand his misery, to accept it, and live with it and not to make much fuss about it. It is how things are.\nThat is the whole understanding of modern psychology. It is pessimistic for the simple reason, that it has not yet been able to penetrate into the inner world of man.\nThat's where religion differs. Religion says that it is true that there is no contentment on the outside, that is never possible. But there is an inner world too. There is no need to overlook it, there is no need to ignore it. To ignore it is only ignorance.\nSannyas means not ignoring the inner. On the contrary, it is giving it more and more attention, more and more awareness, more and more exploration. And when you start getting deeper into your own interiority you are surprised, because you discover an inexhaustible treasure. Your life becomes a joy, a benediction, a blessing, not only to yourself but to others too.\nWhite has always symbolised the ultimate flowering of spirituality because white is the synthesis of all the colours. It is all the colours in deep harmony dancing together, merging, melting, meeting in each other so deeply that they disappear as separate colours and an new colour arises -- that is white.\nBlack is the absence of all colours, white is presence of all colours. Black represents the devil because it is absence; hence in all the mythologies the evil force, the devil, satan, is depicted as black, dark, absolutely dark.\nGod is white for the simple reason that God is the ultimate harmony. Light is white, but passing through a prism it becomes seven colours; the prism divides it. That's how the rainbow is created. In the rainy season small drops of water hang in the air and the sunrays passing through those small drops of rainwater create the rainbow.\nMix all the seven colours in the right proportion and white arises. The number seven is also significant.\nThere are seven planes of consciousness. The lowest is sex and the highest is samadhi. In the lowest centre, at the lowest plane, there is only sexuality, nothing else. On the second plane there are two things, on the third there are three, and so on, so forth. On the seventh plane all the seven energies meet together and merge together and a white lotus opens in your being. These are all metaphors.\nThe white lotus is worshipped in the East. You must have seen pictures of Buddha sitting on a white lotus. When you have reached the ultimate peak, when all your energies have come to a harmony great beauty descends, great silence descends, a new kind of dance enters into your being, a new celebration, because it is a new birth.\nKeep remembering that the white lotus is our ultimate goal, that we have to become white lotuses in which all energies have been consumed, absorbed into one synthesis, when all the seven notes of music have created the ultimate melody.\nKent is a beautiful name. It means that you disappear as many and you become one, you become integrated, centred. You put the prism of the mind aside and you are white.\nWhite symbolises freedom, freedom from division, from split. white also symbolises wholeness. Red is only one colour, blue is one colour, green is another. Green is not the whole, blue is not the whole; no colour is whole except white.\nGod is whole, god is another name for totality; hence those who have\nexperienced god have experienced 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhim as a tremendous whiteness arising in themselves. They become lost in that dazzling white. The mystics say that it is as if thousands of suns have risen suddenly. It is all light and all white.\nThe journey of sannyas is from mind to no-mind. Mind means many, no-mind means one, and to be one is to be whole, healthy, sane. to be one is to be blissful. It is with the many that conflict and misery arises.\nFor centuries manliness has been praised. It is time to drop that whole nonsense. It is because of that praise that humanity has suffered much.\nManly qualities are aggressive, violent. We should start praising feminine qualities. The most feminine quality is receptivity, openness, vulnerability. Man has dominated long enough and that domination has been destructive of all that is fragile, beautiful, of all that is flowerlike. Only rocks have remained, flowers have disappeared.\nMy whole effort here is to praise the feminine qualities. The world needs them. If I love Buddha, Jesus, Krishna, the most fundamental reason for my love is that they are all feminine, they are not masculine.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has condemned Buddha and Christ for the same reason -- they are not manly enough. I praise them for the same reason -- they are not manly enough. That is good; they have a grace, the feminine grace.\nWe have to change the whole gestalt of human consciousness. we have to make it more surrendering, more receptive, we have to teach it how to relax and how things can happen in a deep let-go. all that is great\n-- truth, love, bliss, god, freedom -- happens in a state of let-go. You cannot force them to happen. that is not possible, that is not i the nature of things at all.\nYou can only be a host, you can only be pregnant with those qualities, you can allow then to happen.\nDon't hinder, that's all that you can do. Keep the doors open, keep the heart open, and you become a song.\nGod starts singing through you. You become a joyous spirit, you become a celebration.\nA strong spirit is always a gift of God, the most precious gift. He gives a strong spirit to everybody. God is absolutely generous, he gives more than you will ever need. He gives courage, he gives strength.\nBut the society turns every possibility into its opposite. Rather than making you more and more courageous, helping your courage, strengthening your courage, it destroys it, it makes you cowardly. The same energy that can become courage can become fear. All that is needed is a headstand: put everything upside down. The society has learned the art of creating cowardliness in people because only cowards can be dominated. The society destroys the individual in every possible way, because the society is afraid of the individual.\nThe individual cannot always be obedient, he will be obedient when he feels that it is right to be obedient. But you cannot rely on him. Sometimes he may feel that this is not right, then he will defy all your orders, he will say no. He will live through his own inner light. He cannot be commanded, he cannot be reduced to a soldier, he cannot function like a machine. He will say yes when he feels that it is right, it will come from his own heart. But he will never be a yea-sayer, nor will he be a no-sayer. He will not cling to no or yes, he will remain free. Every moment he will choose whether to say yes or no. He will not function out of a conditioned mind -- conditioned for yes or conditioned for no.\nThe society does not want individuals. The society lives on the death of individuals. So the more a society becomes organised, the more and more individuals disappear. For example, in Adolf Hitler's Germany, individuals completely disappeared because the society was too organised. The whole society was turned into a military camp. That has happened many times. In ancient days in Japan, the whole society was turned into a military camp. That was the highest value, to be obedient.\nAll the churches also teach obedience because the priest is afraid of\nindividuality, because the individual raises awkward questions which nobody else can answer. The individual creates restlessness in the status quo. The individual creates embarrassing situations for the people who are in power, who are in authority.\nThey may be popes or kings or presidents or prime ministers, it doesn't matter. Religious heads or political heads, it doesn't matter. Every establishment is afraid of individuals. And the only way to destroy the individual is to turn the gift of God into a curse.\nMy effort here is to remind you that you can still change your whole pattern, you can still put things as they should be. You can still be courageous, adventurous. You can still be strong in spirit, because it is only those who are strong in spirit who can travel the path to God.\nKatja means purity -- the purity that you see in the stars, the purity that you see in the flowers, the purity 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthat you see in the song of the birds... that purity. and man can become all. He can be a flower full of fragrance. He can be a star full of light. And he can be a bird singing in praise of God, in praise of sunrise.\nMan has multi-dimensional potential. He can be the whole universe.\nMan is capable of so much but he is not aware of it. He is capable of flying but he goes on just crawling on the earth. He is capable of becoming pure love but he remains only animal, lust. He is capable of becoming pure spirit but he remains just dust. We are not aware of our own potential. We don't know how much we are carrying within ourselves which can be realised any moment that we decide to realise it. But it will not be realised unless we decide to realise it.\nMany people die without knowing that they were carrying a treasure within themselves. they die like beggars and they were meant to be emperors.\nOut ultimate expression is divine love, and out of that is all creativity, all service, all compassion. Out of that much happens, but we have to be alert to create the right space in which our potential can become actual.\nSannyas is only a methodology to create a space, a certain space within you, to prepare the ground so that your seeds starts sprouting. It is just a process of inner gardening. And each sannyasin has to become a garden with many flowers, much perfume. It is possible, I am not talking about the impossible. It is within our reach, we just have to start groping for it. And my function here is to help you to grope in the right direction.\nOnce you are on the right track then miracles start happening.\n[There follows an interview with Ma Deva Tanmayo, which is not included here.]\nIf You Choose To Be With Me, You Must Risk Finding Yourself Chapter #9 \u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8418","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/if_you_choose_to_be_with_me_you_must_risk_finding_yourself/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/if_you_choose_to_be_with_me_you_must_risk_finding_yourself/>If You Choose To Be With Me You Must Risk Finding Yourself</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Man\'s Nature</h1><div class=post-meta>40 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8418 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/If_You_Choose_To_Be_With_Me_You_Must_Risk_Finding_Yourself/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

infinite possibility, of the heights that you can reach, of the depths
that you can penetrate. Your heights are higher than the Himalayas, and
your depths are deeper than the Pacific. God has given you so much, he
has made you so rich, so inexhaustibly rich -- and we are living like
beggars.</p><p>My sannyas means a declaration that you are no more a beggar but an
emperor, an empress.</p><p>We are never born and we never die. Birth and death are both episodes
in an eternal life. Life does not begin with birth and does not end with
death. It is before death, it is after death; it continues. birth and
death are ordinary episodes,</p><p>incidents, nothing of much importance. Millions of times you have
been born and millions of times you have died, and still you are,
nothing has happened to you. No birth, no death has left even a trace
upon your being. It is as clean, as pure as ever, unpolluted, fresh,
young, but we don't know how to find it, where to find it.</p><p>We are so identified with the body and the mind -- that's the only
problem. That has to be resolved. If you think you are the body-mind,
then you will never find your immortality. This is a fallacy which has
to be dropped. You are a witness. You can see your body, you can see
your mind, so you are the seer not the seen, you are the observer not
the object of observation. Because mind can be observed it is an object;
the body can be observed, it is an object. You are the observer, always
the observer and never anything else.</p><p>Become more and more centred in your observation, in your witnessing,
in your awareness. And that will give you the key, that will unlock the
door of immortality in you. Unless one knows that one is immortal, fear
never disappears. And it is fear that destroys all your energies. It is
fear that does not allow us to love. How can you love when you are
afraid. It is fear that never allows us to live totally,
whole-heartedly. If you are afraid, how can you live totally and
whole-heartedly? -- you are always holding back. You go only so far and
then you stop.</p><p>When fear disappears life becomes love, when fear is no more, life
becomes a beautiful adventure. Then it is from one peak to another peak,
a constant rising upwards -- and there is no end to that eternal
journey.</p><p>Mind is man. When you go beyond mind you go beyond humanity. The
animal is below mind, the Buddhas are beyond mind, and between the
animals and the Buddhas are all human beings. Human beings are in a kind
of limbo-half animal, half god. the past is animal, and the future and
the potential are divine; hence man is in more anguish than any animal
on the earth. All animals are at ease, at peace with themselves. They
are in a way complete, nothing is missing. A dog is a dog and a cat is a
cat.</p><p>Man is not complete, he is incomplete. Something is missing. He is on
the way. He has left the past and he has not reached the goal yet. He is
on the way, he is a traveller. That creates anxiety as to whether or not
he will be able to make it. And that creates many problems, many times.
One problem is the desire to go</p><p>back, to be an animal again. So in many moments you become animal
again. When you are angry, when you become sexual, when you are full of
lust, when you are greedy, when you lose all awareness and you start
functioning mechanically you fall below humanity.</p><p>It is because of this that drugs have so much appeal: drugs help
people to fall below the mind. You forget all the problems and all the
anxieties when you are under the impact of a drug, alcohol or anything
else. But sooner or later you have to come back to your senses and all
your problems are there. In fact they have grown meanwhile. Nothing is
gained, you have simply wasted time.</p><p>But the desire to go back arises for the simple reason that the
future seems to be unknown, uncertain; the past seems to be certain, you
have known it, your body knows it, you every cell is created by the
past, you mind is created by the past. So the past has a great pull over
you, but nobody can go to the past again -- that is a problem. Once the
child is born he cannot go back into the womb again. Once you have
become a young person, howsoever beautiful the childhood was you cannot
be a child again, there is no going back.</p><p>One can enjoy the idea of going back, one can imagine also that one
is back again, but there is no possible way of going back. You cannot
move backwards in time, time has no reverse gear in it. You have to go
ahead, either dancingly or reluctantly -- that is up to you. If you go
dancingly you go joyously. If you go reluctantly you go in misery, in
suffering.</p><p>Man has to go beyond himself, man has to surpass himself, only then
does man become complete. That is a paradox. Only by going beyond
himself does he becomes complete, entire. Then he again knows the

one has arrived. That's the state of a buddha, the enlightened
person.</p><p>Go beyond mind so that you can go beyond humanity, so that you can
surpass humanity. That is the greatest challenge, and only the greatest
can accept it. In</p><p>the acceptance of the challenge something great is born in you.
Sannyas is a challenge, the challenge of surpassing yourself.</p><p>Mind is never silent. It is constantly chattering. It is constantly
crowded with many thoughts, desires. It goes on dreaming and dreaming.
It is never still even for a single moment. And we have become
identified with the mind, we think that we are our mind. That is
creating the whole misery.</p><p>Get out of the mind and you will come back to your senses. Get out of
the mind because the mind is a kind of madness. But one can get out of
the mind in two ways. One is falling below it -- then you will have to
be put in a mental asylum. The other is going beyond it -- then you
become a Buddha or a Jesus. So please choose this way, the second.</p><p>There is a fear of going out of the mind. The fear is because mad
people are also out of the mind. But they have fallen below, and one has
to rise above. When you rise above the mind great silence descends.</p><p>You see the mind deep down in the valley chattering still, but the
distance becomes bigger and bigger every day and one day you cannot hear
all that chattering at all. That day one becomes enlightened.</p><p>Mind lives either in the past or in the future. If you are young then
the mind lives in the past. The old man has no future. He knows that
there is death so he is afraid to look at the future. He goes on
reminiscing about the past, all that has been and is no more. He enjoys
those golden days. Much of it is just imagination, it has never been
there; much of it is just invention to remain occupied.</p><p>The moment a person starts living in the past is the moment when he
starts becoming old.</p><p>Psychologically, that is the point from where one becomes old.
Physiologically, it may not coincide, that that is the psychological old
age, when you start thinking about the past and the beauties of the past
and those golden experiences and those nice days, and how everything was
just great. The future is so dark that you are afraid to look at it and
you want to remain occupied with the past.</p><p>But that is not so with the young person. The young person looks at
the future.</p><p>Death is far away, in fact the young person never thinks of death. It
is so far away, it is beyond his scope to think about it; he does not
have that much insight. So he lives in the future, he makes castles in
the air:"I will do this and I will get that and I will be this and
tomorrow it is going to happen; if not tomorrow then the day after
tomorrow."</p><p>The old man wastes his present in the past, the young man wastes his
present engaged in the future.</p><p>Both exercises are absolutely futile. Not only futile but very
harmful, because the present which is, is being wasted for that which is
not.</p><p>Don't think of the future. Live in the present. That's my message to
you. Be in the present moment. And if you can be present to the moment
you escape from all kinds of stupidities of the old people. If you can
be in the present you transcend time. Time consists of past and future,
eternity consists only of the present.</p><p>Eternity is now, always now and never then, always here and never
there. And to enter into the now and the here is to enter into God.</p><p>This has to become your meditation, to come more and more close to
the present moment. I am not saying not tp prepare for a journey. If you
are going somewhere you will have to purchase the ticket ahead of time,
you will have to plan it. I'm not saying not to do that. That has
nothing to do with the future. What I mean is a psychological hope,
desire, because the present seems to be unfulfilling you escape into the
future and you start hoping that there will be fulfilment.</p><p>Stop going into the psychological future. The factual future is okay,
it is not a disturbance at all. The factual past is also okay, it is not
a disturbance at all. You have to remember your name and your address
and when you meet your father you have to recognise him. You can't say
to him "The past is the past and I don't know who your are!"(laughter)
These are factual things, they are perfectly okay. But deep inside, the
past should not possess you and the future should not be your
occupation. Relax into the moment. And then one is entitled to all kinds
of miracles.</p><p>Man can live his life in two ways. One is out of the past; then life
is not a response but a reaction. You live through ready-made
conclusions, you don't</p><p>respond to the moment. To the situation that is confronting you. You
already have an answer, even before the question is raised. Your answer
will never fit the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

different, every moment it is new. It is always novel, it is always a
surprise. It never loses that quality of surprise. but if you are
carrying too many ready-made answers in your mind you will miss the
newness of life.</p><p>The other way to live is not to live through the past but to live
directly, immediately, to live without the mind, to respond like a
mirror, to reflect that which is. and the life of response has
tremendous beauty, grace, truth and sincerity, because whatsoever you do
is adequate. You never repent for it. It always fits the situation. It
comes out of your consciousness, it does not come out of the cultivated
character.</p><p>Let it be a key for you. Live naturally, spontaneously, responsively,
meditatively, in the present, here and now, and then you will know the
significance of your life. Millions of mysteries will open their doors
for you.</p><p>The whole of humanity can be divided into two categories: the fools
and the wise. The fools are those who live in a false world, a world of
their own imagination. They live in dreams, they believe in their
dreams, and obviously they are doomed because dreams are dreams and they
can never become real.</p><p>The wise ones are those who have dropped all dreams, all sleep, who
have become aware, who don't project anything onto existence, who are
just mirrors that don't project anything; they simply reflect. And when
one becomes a mirror life is a sheer joy. Each moment is so precious, so
ecstatic, that one could not have imagined it. Each people on the
seashore suddenly turns into a diamond and each flower has the face of
God. The whole existence starts overflowing with godliness. One is born
anew.</p><p>Everybody is born as a fool because everybody is born asleep,
dreaming.</p><p>Everybody has the capacity to wake up but very few people use their
capacity to wake up. By becoming a sannyasin you are taking a vow to
wake up. That's what sannyas is all about: a decision to wake up. And if
you are really intent, it is bound to happen. It is inevitable.</p><p>Man is a seed of divine glory, but only a seed -- remember it. It is
not yet a flower, it has not even started growing. It is a
potentiality.</p><p>At birth we are only potential beings. Life is an opportunity to
actualise the potential. But very few people work upon themselves. They
pay much attention to money, power, prestige, and they don't pay any
attention to their own growth, which is the most essential thing because
everything else will be taken away.</p><p>Death will destroy all your sandcastles, but it cannot destroy your
growth, it cannot destroy whatsoever you have made actual in your inner
being. That is beyond the grasp of death. And that which is beyond the
grasp of death is the real treasure.</p><p>In the world people think that they are gaining, earning, being
successful; they are simply living in illusion. The only people who are
gaining something are the people who are moving inwards, who are
becoming more and more alert to their immense potential, who are trying
to transform it into a reality.</p><p>When one realises one's potential in its totality one is a god. God
is not some person somewhere, it is the ultimate state of consciousness.
Everybody is capable of becoming a god -- and if we miss we miss because
of ourselves, nobody else can be held responsible.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are taking the whole responsibility upon
yourself. It is a commitment to growth, a commitment towards
self-actualisation, with a deep understanding that this is our
responsibility towards ourselves, all other responsibilities are
secondary.</p><p>And if the primary is not fulfilled you will not be able to fulfil
the secondary responsibilities. If the primary is fulfilled the
secondary responsibilities are easily fulfilled.</p><p>Become what you can become.</p><p>Man is a seed. If you cut the seed there is no fragrance, but if you
sow the seed,</p><p>if you give it the right soil, the right climate, the right amount of
fertiliser and water and sun and air, the seed disappears and a sprout
arises. Soon there are many many leaves and great foliage, and then
flowers appear. And then the miracle -- the miracle of fragrance. It was
hidden in the seed but it needed a certain process to become
manifest.</p><p>God is hidden in us like fragrance in a seed. It needs a certain
progress to become manifest. Right now it is hidden but it can become
manifest.</p><p>Sannyas means initiation into a certain mystery, in a certain mystic
path which can help you go through the great transformation from the
seed to the fragrance.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>We are seeds but it would be unfortunate to die as a seed. We have to
become flowers and we have to release our fragrance, only then is there
contentment. A tree is fulfilled when it blooms, when the spring comes
and the tree has released, poured its heart into colours, into
fragrance, into joy. When the tree is dancing in the wind, in the sun,
it is fulfilled.</p><p>Exactly is the case with man too. A Buddha is a tree which has
bloomed, a Jesus is a tree which has come to release its fragrance. We
are all carrying the same kind of seeds in us. Everyone is a Buddha
unmanifest, a Christ ready to be born at any moment.</p><p>My work here is to make you aware of your great potential, of your
infinite possibility, of the heights that you can reach, of the depth
that you can penetrate. Your heights are higher than the Himalayas, and
your depths are deeper than the Pacific. And once you know your heights
and your depths, life becomes nothing but gratitude. God has given you
so much. He has poured all his creativity into your being, he has made
you so rich, so inexhaustibly rich -- and we are living like
beggars.</p><p>My sannyas means a declaration that you are no more a beggar, but an
emperor,</p><p>an empress.</p><p>One can exist in two ways: either by fighting on the outside for
money, for power, for prestige... To conquer the world -- that is one
way of life. It is a futile way. It is for the stupid and the mediocre,
but it is very attractive, for the simple reason that everybody is
running for it. And man is a great imitator: seeing everybody rushing
for something he also starts rushing. He starts thinking that there must
be something there, otherwise why are so many people going? And there is
every possibility that others are going for the same reason -- because
others are going. Everybody may be going for the same reason.</p><p>Nobody knows why people are running towards money, power and
prestige, but they are running. It is a kind of madness, but it gives
something, it feeds your ego.</p><p>The fight is futile, the ego is false and when you die you have to
leave everything that you have conquered. That's why everybody dies
crying and weeping, in deep pain and suffering. The pain and suffering
is not because of death, remember. The pain is basically that "I lived
my life in a futile way; the time is gone and I am finished and my hands
are empty." That is the pain not the pain of death.</p><p>Death is not painful, death is very soothing, like deep sleep. The
pain is that "The whole of life has passed and I was just making castles
in the air and I am going empty-handed. I came empty-handed and I am
going empty-handed. My whole life has been a sheer wastage."</p><p>But there is another way to live too. One can be an inner warrior.
One can conquer one's unconsciousness, one can conquer one's greed,
anger, sexuality. One can transform all these energies into something
tremendously beautiful. and when one has known the secret of
transforming one's inner being, there is great joy. Every fibre of your
being dances with joy because now you know that death cannot take
anything away from you. Now you know that you have attained the real
treasure.</p><p>So be a warrior in the second sense. The real fight is in, not there
on the outside, and the real fight is not with others. The real fight is
with your own unconsciousness, with your own unawareness.</p><p>Our desires are dreams, all our thoughts are dreams. And we go on
continuously</p><p>living in dreams because we are asleep. Dreams can exist only if we
are asleep, and dreams disappear the moment we awake.</p><p>Going beyond dreams means awaking.</p><p>It is time! Enough you have sleep... for many many lives. Don't miss
this opportunity to wake up because rare is the opportunity, and to miss
it is very easy. So put your whole energy into waking up.</p><p>In the beginning it seems almost impossible -- how to do it? But if
one goes on trying... In sleep one tosses and turns but if one goes on
tossing and turning, it is bound to disrupt the sleep. And just a
moment's glimpse of being awake is enough to trigger a new process in
your being. Then more and more moments of awakening happen. And the day
that one becomes fully awakened, twenty-four hours a day, even while one
is asleep one remains alert, aware, when the body sleeps but the soul
never sleeps, when one is capable of being awake twenty-four hours a day
even when the body is resting -- then one should feel contented. One has
arrived. Before that, make every possible effort that you can. Don't
leave any stone unturned.</p><p>We live in desire. Desire means discontentment. Desire means that
whatsoever is, is not right, not enough, more is needed. And desire is
never fulfilled. It is unfulfillable by its very nature.</p><p>You can have as much as you desire, but the moment you have it desire
goes on jumping ahead of you, it starts asking for more. Its greed knows
no limits, it is unlimited greed. It is like the horizon: it looks so
close -- you can reach it within an hour if you run. But you cannot
reach it, you can never reach it. The 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

the same, because there is no horizon; it is an illusion. The earth is
not meeting with the sky anywhere, it only appears to be.</p><p>So is the case with desire. It only appears that if I could reach to
that point, if I</p><p>could attain to this or that, there would be contentment. I would be
happy, I would be fulfilled. But it never happens.</p><p>One has to understand desiring and its futility. In that very
understanding desire disappears and one is left at home in deep peace.
When there is no desire, there is no disturbance. Desire is the only
disturbance.</p><p>When all desires have gone there is tremendous silence inside. In
that silence you become aware of the presence of God, and that is
fulfilling. That fulfils because it brings joy, infinite joy. It fulfils
because it brings something of the beyond, something which cannot be
taken away from you, something which is inexhaustible, something
deathless. It opens the doors of the kingdom of God. It is your kingdom,
because you are not separate from God and God is not separate from
you.</p><p>So your work has to be to understand desiring; and in that very
understanding it drops. You are not to renounce it, you are not to
repress it, because if you repress it, it will come up again, if you
renounce it, it will follow you. It is only through deep understanding
that it disappears.</p><p>Man lives in bondage, and the bondage is not imposed by others, it is
self- created. It is created because we are afraid of the insecure. In
the name of security we create a bondage around ourselves. Yes, it gives
a feeling of cosiness, warmth, safety, but it is all false because
sooner or later death will take it all away.</p><p>Because of this we never explore, we never go beyond the boundaries
of the familiar. The familiar is very small and we go on moving in the
familiar, in circles. Our life knows no growth, because growth can only
happen if we move not in circles but in a line. If we are linear then
there is growth. If we go around in circles we go on repeating the same
thing again and again.</p><p>Freedom is possible because we have made our own prison. We can get
out of it any moment that we decide to. It is only a question of
decision, of courage, of guts.</p><p>Freedom is the ultimate value in life. Nothing is more important than
that, because out of it comes everything else that is valuable. Love
arises as a fragrance, joy arises, meaning arises; for the first time
life becomes significant, tremendously significant. And one is
constantly moving beyond the known,</p><p>going into the unknown. Life becomes a thrill, an adventure. But we
have made life just a dragging affair. It seems safe, it appears secure,
but there is no security, no safety anywhere. They are impossible.</p><p>Life in its intrinsicalness is insecure. Only death is secure. You
cannot take anything away from a dead man -- or can you? even death
cannot do any harm to him, he is already dead. In his grave he is so
absolutely secure.</p><p>Because we are so obsessed with security we have made our houses our
graves. We don't live in them, we only die in them slowly slowly; it is
a gradual kind of suicide.</p><p>Sannyas means freedom, freedom from all self-created securities,
safeties. In the beginning one feels afraid, scared, that is natural,
but once you become attuned to the insecure and you know the joy of
insecurity then you never look back to those old toys that you used to
think were keeping you life secure.</p><p>And they were not securities, they were simply prisons, chains around
your being.</p><p>One need not be a Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan, Catholic or communist
-- these are all self-created prisons. One need not live in an ideology.
One should be free from all ideologies, all dogmas, creeds, scriptures.
Only then is life an exploration, because when you don't have any
conclusion you can explore.</p><p>We are brought up in such a way that we are reduced to slaves. And
the slavery is so subtle that very rarely do we become aware of it. We
go on living life as a slave thinking that this is all that there is to
live.</p><p>This is not all, this is nothing. This is not even the beginning.</p><p>Life begins only when you become free from all kinds of bondages: the
bondage of nation, the bondage of race, the bondage of church --
ideological, social, political, religious. When you become free from all
these imprisonments, when you simply drop all that you have been told is
important, when you simply drop all that you have been told to believe
in; when you neither believe nor disbelieve a great freedom arises in
your being. That freedom is sannyas; and that freedom then takes you
higher and higher towards the ultimate.</p><p>Only a free person can know what truth is, and only a free person can
know what</p><p>god is, what love is.</p><p>Freedom is very essential because it is the foundation of all that is
beautiful and great.</p><p>Light is the stuff that existence is made of. Mystics have been
saying so for centuries, now physicists 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>also agree with it in their own way. It is the only point on which
mystics and the physicists agree, that existence is made of light.
Mystics have come to it through the experience of their own being. The
deeper you go, the lighter it becomes.</p><p>In the beginning, when you start entering into yourself, it is very
dark, very very dark, unimaginably dark. You cannot believe that
darkness can be so thick and so dense. that's why many people escape
immediately. It is frightening, it looks like death. But if you persist,
and great perseverance is needed, if you go on digging deeper and
deeper, the darkness becomes less and less dark, a little light starts
arising. At the innermost core of your being there is nothing but
light.</p><p>Now start moving inwards, and don't be afraid of the darkness that
you will encounter, which is bound to be encountered. When you encounter
darkness it is a good sign, you are moving in. and if darkness is
encountered than light is not far away. When the night is very dark, the
dawn is very close.</p><p>We are born of light, we are part of infinite light, and one day we
have to disappear into that infinity again. We are just rays of a
faraway sun. We have forgotten our home, we have forgotten our
source.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means that now you are getting ready to remember
it. Sannyas is a gesture that "I am available to be reminded of my home,
of my real home, of my real source."</p><p>We are rays of light. We are not gross, nothing is gross. Because
existence is a manifestation of god, everything is very subtle. Even
matter is not material, even</p><p>matter is just pure light, condensed light.</p><p>Everything is a different manifestation of light, a tremendously
mysterious wave in the ocean of light.</p><p>To see it, to feel it, to recognize it, is meditation. Watch inside,
watch outside. In the beginning it is difficult to see walls as pure
light, but even physicists agree that they are pure light, nothing but
electrons, condensed electricity. And walls are not static, rocks are
not static; electrons are continuously in a tremendous dance. The whole
existence is a dance.</p><p>When you start seeing it all around you it is a transformed world.
And the day you see it inside too, the division between the inside and
the outside disappears, then it is all one, it is the same phenomenon.
One loses one's ego, one loses one's identity as a separate being. One
becomes part of the whole. And to be part of the whole is to be holy.
That is true holiness.</p><p>Those phony holy people you meet in the churches, in the mosque and
in the temples are not holy at all.</p><p>They have no idea of the whole. They are very egoistic. Of course
they have very pious egos, holier-than-thou, but a pious ego is the most
egoistic phenomenon in the world. It is the most poisonous, because it
is so subtle.</p><p>Enlightenment is a forgotten language, it has to be remembered.
Sannyas is just the beginning of turning in, looking in.</p><p>Following Christ does not mean following Jesus. When Jesus disappears
Christ is born in him. When Gautam Siddhartha disappears Buddha is born
in him. They are totally different phenomena, but people have got them
mixed-up. They think that to follow Christ means to follow Jesus. Nobody
can follow Jesus because nobody can be like Jesus; God never creates the
same person again. But Christ can be followed because Christ is a state
of consciousness. It has nothing to do with the person, Jesus. He is one
of the Christs, that is true, but there have been many other Christs and
there will be many more.</p><p>Anyone who attains to the ultimate flowering is a Christ. To be
enlightened is to be a Christ. To know who you are is to be a Christ.
But Christianity has taken a very wrong route. It became too focussed on
Jesus, the person, they completely forgot about the flowering, the
fragrance which really makes him valuable.</p><p>Without that fragrance he is nobody, just an ordinary carpenter.</p><p>Christhood means that meditation has come to its peak. One has gone
beyond misery, beyond ego, beyond mind, beyond time. One has become one
with the whole.</p><p>Blissfully follow the subtle path of being a Christ. Never be a
Christian, be a Christ. When one can be a Christ why settle for being a
Christian? When one can be a Buddha why be a Buddhist? That's my basic
message here, that you are carrying within you the ultimate. There is no
need to settle for less than that.</p><p>[ page missing? 241/190]</p><p>... that the person cannot even see that it is there. and it works
from the back door, it is never there in front of you. It works from the
depth of your being. Your saints, your mahatmas, are nothing but egos

the totality, he has merged with the source. That source is light and
that source is God.</p><p>We are made of light; hence when you enter into deep meditation you
start feeling more and more light inside. When you reach to the very
central core all is light, pure light. That experience is called
enlightenment for the simple reason that you become light again.</p><p>Each being is born enlightened. Each being is born a Buddha, a
Christ. These are not states which have to be achieved, these are states
which have to be only recognised, which we only have to discover within
our own being. One has not to go anywhere, one has not to do anything.
It is not a process of becoming, enlightenment is a state of being.</p><p>Becoming means desire. Becoming means that it will happen in the
future.</p><p>Becoming means that you will have to strive for it. You may succeed,
you may not succeed. Who knows? Becoming means that you will remain
tense until it happens -- and enlightenment cannot happen if you are
tense. Enlightenment cannot happen if you live in desires, in the
future. Enlightenment is possible only when you are desireless, relaxed,
utterly herenow. So it cannot be made an object of desire. To make it an
object of desire is to miss the point from the very beginning. It is
pure understanding that we are already in that space, we just don't look
in. We have not lost it, we have only forgotten it.</p><p>The early Christians used to call themselves bearers of the Christ,
carriers of Christ in the heart. The ordinary, so-called Christian also
carries Christ -- but in the head, not in the heart. to understand it is
of great significance.</p><p>Carrying Christ in your head is absolutely meaningless. And that's
what Christians are doing, and others are doing the same: Hindus
carrying Krishna in the head, Buddhists carrying Buddha in the head. And
these are not things of the head, these are not thoughts. These are
deep, deep experiences, profound feelings. They can happen only in the
heart. And when they happen in the heart you don't become a Christian,
you become a Christ. You don't become a Buddhist, you become a
Buddha.</p><p>It is ugly to be a Buddhist or a Christian. When you can be a Buddha
or a Christ, why settle for being a Christian or a Buddhist? That is
settling for something plastic, something pseudo.</p><p>Christ is a state of consciousness, just as Buddha is a state of
consciousness. Really, the state of consciousness that in the East is
called Buddha, in the West is called Christ. It is not different, only
the language differs, but both words indicate the same flowering. Your
heart becomes a flower, a lotus, and a great fragrance is released. That
fragrance is bliss.</p><p>So remember, don't allow sannyas to become part of your head. Let it
go down deep into your heart. The relationship with me has to be of the
heart, not of the head. The heady people are going to miss me
totally.</p><p>They may think that they understand me but they understand only
words. They don't understand me.</p><p>Only the people of the heart are going to be my people, because only
they will be able to understand that which cannot be understood. Only
they will be able to</p><p>comprehend that which is incomprehensible.</p><p>The mysteries can only be revealed to those who have chopped off
their heads completely, who are no more heads but just pure hearts.</p><p>Man is not as small as he appears. He is vast, he is tremendously
vast. He is oceanic. Even the ocean has boundaries, and man has no
boundaries. Even the ocean is not so vast. Man's vastness is the only
proof that God is. God is another name for man's vastness. We are not
confined to the body and we are not confined to the mind either. We are
beyond both.</p><p>The whole process of sannyas is that of peeling an onion. There are
many layers of identification, and we have to drop all the layers slowly
slowly slowly. Finally nothing is left -- that nothing is you.</p><p>Only nothing can be vast. Something is bound to be infinite. Only
nothingness is infinite; hence God is ultimate nothingness. God is not a
being but the ultimate non-being. He is not somebody, he is absolute
nobodiness. He is only a presence, infinite, unbounded. and so are we.
we are not different from god. We are part of that infinity.</p><p>Everyone is a god. Nobody can be anything else because only God
exists. God is synonymous with existence. To be means to be a god. But
we don't remember it, we are absolutely oblivious to it. So the question
is not how to achieve godhood, the question is how to remember it. It is
a forgotten language.</p><p>My effort here is to help you to remember something that is already
there. Nothing has to be achieved.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-7>Osho's books on

will know that you are God. And the moment you know you are God the
whole existence becomes divine, then everybody is god. And that day is
of tremendous joy, when</p><p>the whole existence looks divine to you. You are surrounded by gods.
Naturally, great rejoicing arises in your heart.</p><p>From the very beginning we are that which we have been seeking all
along. We are already that for which we are looking everywhere. It is
our self-nature. Truth, bliss, freedom, God - they are different names
of our self-nature.</p><p>One need not go anywhere, one has only to dig within oneself. On the
outside one will find only frustration, failure. You cannot find that
which can fulfill you. Yes, one can have as much money as one wants, one
can have a great kingdom like Alexander, Napoleon, but one still remains
a beggar, still seeking and searching. There seems to be no fulfillment
through power, prestige, money. And the reason is not that fulfillment
is not possible.</p><p>Sigmund Freud says that it is not possible because he never looked
within. He says that man is destined to remain miserable, so all that we
can do is to help him to be a little less miserable. We can help him to
understand his misery, to accept it, and live with it and not to make
much fuss about it. It is how things are.</p><p>That is the whole understanding of modern psychology. It is
pessimistic for the simple reason, that it has not yet been able to
penetrate into the inner world of man.</p><p>That's where religion differs. Religion says that it is true that
there is no contentment on the outside, that is never possible. But
there is an inner world too. There is no need to overlook it, there is
no need to ignore it. To ignore it is only ignorance.</p><p>Sannyas means not ignoring the inner. On the contrary, it is giving
it more and more attention, more and more awareness, more and more
exploration. And when you start getting deeper into your own interiority
you are surprised, because you discover an inexhaustible treasure. Your
life becomes a joy, a benediction, a blessing, not only to yourself but
to others too.</p><p>White has always symbolised the ultimate flowering of spirituality
because white is the synthesis of all the colours. It is all the colours
in deep harmony dancing together, merging, melting, meeting in each
other so deeply that they disappear as separate colours and an new
colour arises -- that is white.</p><p>Black is the absence of all colours, white is presence of all
colours. Black represents the devil because it is absence; hence in all
the mythologies the evil force, the devil, satan, is depicted as black,
dark, absolutely dark.</p><p>God is white for the simple reason that God is the ultimate harmony.
Light is white, but passing through a prism it becomes seven colours;
the prism divides it. That's how the rainbow is created. In the rainy
season small drops of water hang in the air and the sunrays passing
through those small drops of rainwater create the rainbow.</p><p>Mix all the seven colours in the right proportion and white arises.
The number seven is also significant.</p><p>There are seven planes of consciousness. The lowest is sex and the
highest is samadhi. In the lowest centre, at the lowest plane, there is
only sexuality, nothing else. On the second plane there are two things,
on the third there are three, and so on, so forth. On the seventh plane
all the seven energies meet together and merge together and a white
lotus opens in your being. These are all metaphors.</p><p>The white lotus is worshipped in the East. You must have seen
pictures of Buddha sitting on a white lotus. When you have reached the
ultimate peak, when all your energies have come to a harmony great
beauty descends, great silence descends, a new kind of dance enters into
your being, a new celebration, because it is a new birth.</p><p>Keep remembering that the white lotus is our ultimate goal, that we
have to become white lotuses in which all energies have been consumed,
absorbed into one synthesis, when all the seven notes of music have
created the ultimate melody.</p><p>Kent is a beautiful name. It means that you disappear as many and you
become one, you become integrated, centred. You put the prism of the
mind aside and you are white.</p><p>White symbolises freedom, freedom from division, from split. white
also symbolises wholeness. Red is only one colour, blue is one colour,
green is another. Green is not the whole, blue is not the whole; no
colour is whole except white.</p><p>God is whole, god is another name for totality; hence those who

in that dazzling white. The mystics say that it is as if thousands of
suns have risen suddenly. It is all light and all white.</p><p>The journey of sannyas is from mind to no-mind. Mind means many,
no-mind means one, and to be one is to be whole, healthy, sane. to be
one is to be blissful. It is with the many that conflict and misery
arises.</p><p>For centuries manliness has been praised. It is time to drop that
whole nonsense. It is because of that praise that humanity has suffered
much.</p><p>Manly qualities are aggressive, violent. We should start praising
feminine qualities. The most feminine quality is receptivity, openness,
vulnerability. Man has dominated long enough and that domination has
been destructive of all that is fragile, beautiful, of all that is
flowerlike. Only rocks have remained, flowers have disappeared.</p><p>My whole effort here is to praise the feminine qualities. The world
needs them. If I love Buddha, Jesus, Krishna, the most fundamental
reason for my love is that they are all feminine, they are not
masculine.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has condemned Buddha and Christ for the same
reason -- they are not manly enough. I praise them for the same reason
-- they are not manly enough. That is good; they have a grace, the
feminine grace.</p><p>We have to change the whole gestalt of human consciousness. we have
to make it more surrendering, more receptive, we have to teach it how to
relax and how things can happen in a deep let-go. all that is great</p><p>-- truth, love, bliss, god, freedom -- happens in a state of let-go.
You cannot force them to happen. that is not possible, that is not i the
nature of things at all.</p><p>You can only be a host, you can only be pregnant with those
qualities, you can allow then to happen.</p><p>Don't hinder, that's all that you can do. Keep the doors open, keep
the heart open, and you become a song.</p><p>God starts singing through you. You become a joyous spirit, you
become a celebration.</p><p>A strong spirit is always a gift of God, the most precious gift. He
gives a strong spirit to everybody. God is absolutely generous, he gives
more than you will ever need. He gives courage, he gives strength.</p><p>But the society turns every possibility into its opposite. Rather
than making you more and more courageous, helping your courage,
strengthening your courage, it destroys it, it makes you cowardly. The
same energy that can become courage can become fear. All that is needed
is a headstand: put everything upside down. The society has learned the
art of creating cowardliness in people because only cowards can be
dominated. The society destroys the individual in every possible way,
because the society is afraid of the individual.</p><p>The individual cannot always be obedient, he will be obedient when he
feels that it is right to be obedient. But you cannot rely on him.
Sometimes he may feel that this is not right, then he will defy all your
orders, he will say no. He will live through his own inner light. He
cannot be commanded, he cannot be reduced to a soldier, he cannot
function like a machine. He will say yes when he feels that it is right,
it will come from his own heart. But he will never be a yea-sayer, nor
will he be a no-sayer. He will not cling to no or yes, he will remain
free. Every moment he will choose whether to say yes or no. He will not
function out of a conditioned mind -- conditioned for yes or conditioned
for no.</p><p>The society does not want individuals. The society lives on the death
of individuals. So the more a society becomes organised, the more and
more individuals disappear. For example, in Adolf Hitler's Germany,
individuals completely disappeared because the society was too
organised. The whole society was turned into a military camp. That has
happened many times. In ancient days in Japan, the whole society was
turned into a military camp. That was the highest value, to be
obedient.</p><p>All the churches also teach obedience because the priest is afraid
of</p><p>individuality, because the individual raises awkward questions which
nobody else can answer. The individual creates restlessness in the
status quo. The individual creates embarrassing situations for the
people who are in power, who are in authority.</p><p>They may be popes or kings or presidents or prime ministers, it
doesn't matter. Religious heads or political heads, it doesn't matter.
Every establishment is afraid of individuals. And the only way to
destroy the individual is to turn the gift of God into a curse.</p><p>My effort here is to remind you that you can still change your whole
pattern, you can still put things as they should be. You can still be
courageous, adventurous. You can still be strong in spirit, because it
is only those who are strong in spirit who can travel the path to
God.</p><p>Katja means purity -- the purity that you see in the stars, the
purity that you see in the flowers, the purity 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-9>Osho's books on

become all. He can be a flower full of fragrance. He can be a star full
of light. And he can be a bird singing in praise of God, in praise of
sunrise.</p><p>Man has multi-dimensional potential. He can be the whole
universe.</p><p>Man is capable of so much but he is not aware of it. He is capable of
flying but he goes on just crawling on the earth. He is capable of
becoming pure love but he remains only animal, lust. He is capable of
becoming pure spirit but he remains just dust. We are not aware of our
own potential. We don't know how much we are carrying within ourselves
which can be realised any moment that we decide to realise it. But it
will not be realised unless we decide to realise it.</p><p>Many people die without knowing that they were carrying a treasure
within themselves. they die like beggars and they were meant to be
emperors.</p><p>Out ultimate expression is divine love, and out of that is all
creativity, all service, all compassion. Out of that much happens, but
we have to be alert to create the right space in which our potential can
become actual.</p><p>Sannyas is only a methodology to create a space, a certain space
within you, to prepare the ground so that your seeds starts sprouting.
It is just a process of inner gardening. And each sannyasin has to
become a garden with many flowers, much perfume. It is possible, I am
not talking about the impossible. It is within our reach, we just have
to start groping for it. And my function here is to help you to grope in
the right direction.</p><p>Once you are on the right track then miracles start happening.</p><p>[There follows an interview with Ma Deva Tanmayo, which is not

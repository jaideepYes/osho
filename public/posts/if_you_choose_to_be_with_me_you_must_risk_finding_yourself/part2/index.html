Then all your fragments start melting into each other and they create a centre, they create integrity, they create individuality. And that's what religion is all about.\nReligion has nothing to do with god or heaven and hell and all kinds of theories and philosophies. The basic concern of religion is truth.\nAnd one has to live it, only then can one know it. Truth is god.\nTruth does not mean a conclusion arrived at by thinking. It means experience arrived at through living.\nTruth is not a hypothesis; hence philosophy has no truth in it. Philosophy goes round and round, it moves in circles, but it never reaches the target. It is only through experience, not through thinking, that one arrives home.\nSannyas is a change of gestalt. From mind you have to move to the heart, from thinking to living, from speculating to experiencing. Ordinarily religious people say \"God is truth,\" but I would like to say that that is not right. Truth is God. If you say \"God is truth,\" you have already come to a conclusion. But truth is God. That means a great enquiry is needed, you have to explore from within and without.\nAnd sannyas is exploration of truth. It is not belief, it is discovery.\nTruth is not something which has to be achieved. It is already inside us. We are it, the seeker is the sought. But we go on rushing hither and thither searching for the truth. We will never find it anywhere else; hence the only way to find it is to stop seeking it outside. The only way to find it is to sit silently and look within. It is not a question of doing something, it is more a question of not doing anything. When you are in a state of non-doing, utterly relaxed, it happens, it wells up. It has always been there but you have never been there. The meeting happens when you are also inside.\nTruth or God is waiting there in your very heart; don't go on knocking on other's doors. There is no need to go to any church, any temple, any mosque. There is no need to search in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Vedas.\nStop all seeking and searching and find it. In fact immediately one finds it. It is such a joy to see that which we have been searching for lives together and over which we were always being frustrated because every effort was doomed to fail.\nWhen truth is, we are not. We are the only barrier. The ego is like a wall surrounding you, it is your imprisonment. So truth can never be an achievement, because all achievements are through the ego. The ego thinks in terms of achievement.\nTruth comes to you not as an achievement but as a gift. Neither is it a reward. It is not that you are worthy, pious, virtuous, so you will be rewarded by truth. It comes to those who are ready to receive it, welcome it. It does not matter whether you are a saint or a sinner, it knocks on everybody's doors. It makes no distinctions between sinners and saints. The guest comes to anybody who is\nready to open the door and welcome it.\nThe whole art of allowing the truth to take possession of you is of being vulnerable, of being open, of being in a let-go. Or in other words, the whole art consists of one word, \"surrender'.\nAnd that's what sannyas is, that's my definition of a sannyasin: a man who is surrendered to existence so totally that he never thinks in terms of achievement any more, because he is no more. Who is there to achieve? -- he has disappeared totally, he has not left even a trace behind. In that very moment, when you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare just a pure nothingness, truth arrives. It is a gift of God.\nEarnestness, sincerity, authenticity -- these are the foundations of sannyas.\nThey are not different things but different aspects of the same phenomenon. One has to be utterly truthful about oneself. One need not hide, only cowards hide. The courageous person remains as he is, naked. He is ready to accept whatsoever the consequences, but he is not ready to compromise his truth. This is the only way to become an individual, this is the only way to have integrity.\nThe world teaches people to be pseudo, to be compromising. The world makes people deceptive, false.\nAll your so-called morality, character, respectability, is nothing but an effort to create a facade so you can hide your reality, you can hide and you can go on showing a false face to the world. Whatsoever is expected from you, you can show it to the world. But a man who hides his reality and shows his falseness to the world becomes split, he becomes two. In fact he becomes many, because in each situation he has to use a different face.\nYou can't use the same face with your wife that you use with your girlfriend. You can't use the same face with the boss that you use with your servant. You have to\ncarry many faces so that whatsoever the requirement of the situation, you wear a mask. Slowly slowly it becomes automatic. You need not change, they change of their own accord. To be in such a state means to be miserable, mad, divided in thousands of pieces. Life will be a chaos and a misery and a hell.\nBut one can drop the facade, one can drop all the masks. That's what sannyas is: to be true, to be your original face. And then suddenly you start feeling a kind of strength which was never there before, because you start becoming one. All your fragments start melting into each other and they create a centre, they create integrity, they create individuality. Then one is earnest, sincere, authentic.\nAnd that's what religion is all about. Religion has nothing to do with God or heaven or hell and all kinds of theories and philosophies. The basic concern of religion is truth. And one has to live it, only then can one know it, there is no other way. It is not a belief, it has to be your own existential experience. You have to experience it in the innermost core of your very being. And that liberates. That brings freedom to you, bliss to you, benediction to you.\nKnowledge is human, wisdom is always divine. Knowledge comes through our efforts, wisdom comes from god -- it is a revelation. We have only to be receptive. We have not to do anything, we have just to be open and available. It is not like science -- so much work, experiments, and then finally you arrive after many experiments at a certain hypotheses. Then too it is only a hypothesis. It may be proved wrong tomorrow, some new facts may crop up. It is never absolute, it is never certain. It is temporary, it is for the time-being.\nWisdom is absolute. When you know, you know. It never changes. What Buddha knew, what Jesus knew, what Zarathustra knew is the same, it is not different. It is not that after twenty-five centuries of Buddha you will discover something else, no. It will be the same revelation, absolute the same. Truth never changes.\nThrough human effort we can never reach the truth, we can only reach a certain hypothesis. And because it is human we can never be absolutely certain about it. We can use it, it is useful, but it is not wisdom. Albert Einstein knows much, maybe much more than Buddha, but he is not a Buddha, he is not awakened. He has not received the truth from the beyond, it has not descended in him. His is human effort: through great human effort he has come to certain conclusions. But human conclusions are human; they have a certain limitation.\nThe search for truth is not like a scientific search. It is totally different. Scientific enquiry is aggressive, religious enquiry is receptive. Scientific enquiry is more masculine, religious enquiry is more feminine.\nSo be open, available, silent, listening, so that God can reveal something to you. It always comes as a revelation.\nWe are keeping truth at our backs. All that is needed is a little turning in.\nWe are all extroverts. Our education makes us extroverts. Society needs extroverts, it has no use for introverts. The introverts cannot be made into soldiers, the introverts are almost as useless as rose flowers.\nYou can appreciate a rose flower but what else can you do with it? It has no utility. It has tremendous poetry but not utility.\nSo is the case with truth: it has great poetry, great joy, great ecstasy, but is absolutely unmarketable.\nYou cannot reduce it to a commodity, you cannot sell it -- and the world believes in selling and purchasing.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe world is a marketplace, and to be an introvert is to be out of the marketplace. Hence we turn every child into an extrovert, we try in every possible way to make sure that he does not have any idea that there is something inside him. We make him forget any desire to go in. And of course if you teach every child for twenty-five years continuously, if you condition him, hypotise him, he becomes paralaysed. He cannot turn his neck, it won't move; he can only look outwards, truth is inside you. You brought it with your birth.\nMy work here is just to help you, to de-hypnotise you, to uncondition you, to undo what the society has done to you. It is anti-social work. Hence the society\nwas perfectly right in crucifying Jesus: he was an antisocial element. So was Socrates, so is every awakened person. He has to sabotage, he has to destroy the structure that society creates around you. He has to bring you to your inner reality.\nThat does not mean that you cannot work outside. Being an introvert does not mean that you become fixated. One should be flexible. One should be able to come in, to come out easily, without any difficulty.\nSo whatsoever is needed... if you are needed on the outside you can be available, if you are needed inside you can be available. Then you know both prose and poetry, then you know both logic and love, then you can be in the marketplace and yet be in yourself.\nThe seeker of truth has to go beyond doubt, has to drop doubting, because doubt keeps you tethered to the mind, doubt is the method of the mind. If you doubt you can never go beyond mind. It is through trust that one goes beyond mind. It is through trust that one goes beyond mind. And truth is beyond mind.\nNobody has ever discovered truth through mind -- not a single individual in the whole history of humanity. Many have discovered truth but they have all discovered through trust, not through doubt.\nSo one has to go beyond doubt and one has to learn the language of trust. Doubt is the language of logic, trust is the language of love. We all live in doubt, we are all doubting Thomases because we all live in the mind. The society perpetuates the mind, all the educational systems strengthen the mind. And the more stronger the mind becomes, the less is the possibility of love growing in you. You start doubting even the existence of love. You start doubting even the existence of truth, so the question of discovering truth does not arise at all.\nDoubt creates such confusion in you that you don't know what to do and what not to do. You go on asking the same mind and it goes on giving you all kinds of answers, which are all contradictory to each other. Mind is a [past ?] master in creating chaos.\nLearn the way of love, learn the way of trust. Even a coward can doubt; only a courageous person can trust. Trust needs some guts. It means that you are taking risks, it means that you are moving into the unknown. Who knows? -- there is no guarantee. But there is tremendous joy in exploring. With a loving heart one can\ngo dancing into the unknown.\nGo beyond your doubt, your doubting mind, and then you will really be a seeker of truth. A seeker of truth neither believes nor doubts. He is simply available, ready, open, vulnerable. He is ready to go with the universe wherever it leads. And the universe is always leading you, guiding you towards the ultimate expression of your being.\nIf you can surrender to existence, if you can allow yourself to be overwhelmed by it, then the transformation happens so easily, without any bloodshed and without any damage. Not even scars are left in you. One changes so silently, so noiselessly, as if nothing has happened. On the outside everything remains the same and on the inside nothing is the same.\nOne can seek truth either out of misery or out of bliss. Both people are seekers, but the first one is going to miss, he will never reach. His very first step is wrong. Only the second one arrives.\nOn the surface both seek truth, but you can find only if you seek rightly, in the right mood, with the right method; if you travel on the right path, if you enter through the right door. Otherwise you can go on and on searching and seeking for millions of lives and you will not find. the truth.\nThe most important thing is the first step: what is the motive? That is very essential to understand. Why does one want to seek truth? Is it out of misery? -- then truth is an escape, an escape from your misery. You want to become occupied with something so far away ,so impossible that you can remain occupied forever and need not look at your misery; so that you can avoid your anxiety, anguish, so that you avoid channeling your energies towards truth.\nBut one who is trying to escape from himself in any way will never reach truth, because truth is within you. Truth is not out there somewhere. Truth is now, truth is here, truth is within you. And the person who starts seeking and searching for truth because life is miserable has already taken an attitude. He has 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nconcluded that life is miserable. His mind has already become prejudiced.\nThe real seeker has to be without conclusions, unprejudiced. He has to function out of a state of not-knowing, he has to be an agnostic, neither atheist nor theist. He has to accept his ignorance, he has to be sincere about his ignorance. He has to say to himself and to others. \"I don't know. And because I don't know, how can I be a Christian and how can I be a Mohammedan or a Hindu? Because I don't know, how can I be a Catholic or a Communist? Because I don't know, how can I believe in god or disbelieve in God?\"\nDisbelief is also a belief -- a negative kind of belief. The Catholic believes, so does the Communist, he also believes. The seeker of truth has to start dropping all beliefs, disbeliefs and is not to have any conclusion. He has to start moving towards truth with a cheerful heart, because only when the heart is cheerful do you become available to existence. Just look at the trees, clouds, stars... The whole universe is in an eternal dance. It is an orgy of joy, a non-ending carnival. It goes on and on. It is sheer festivity.\nSo unless you move through cheerfulness, blissfulness, you will not be moving in the right direction, you will not fall in tune with existence. And the moment you fall in tune with existence you know who you are. When the within and the without are meeting, merging, melting into each other, they create such an explosion of light that everything becomes clear, nothing remains unclear. That's the moment of truth.\nMany have sought, very few have found because their search was wrong from the very beginning. They were tired of life, they were antagonistic to life, they were failures in life, they were miserable people -- and they started seeking and searching for truth.\nMy effort here is first to teach you how to sing, how to dance, how to love and how to be cheerful. Once that has started happening in you, once the process is triggered and you become like a child -- innocent, excited, ecstatic about small things... A butterfly is enough for the child to be in awe. When you are so innocent and so cheerful and so full of wonder then the first step has been taken, and taken rightly. Then you can ride on the wave of bliss and it will take you to the other shore.\nThe seeker of truth is on a very negative journey. Truth cannot be sought\ndirectly, you cannot make a goal out of it. In the first place you don't know what it is, where it is, so how can you make a goal out of it?\nYour journey will remain a groping. So those who think that truth can be attained directly start from the very beginning in a wrong way. Their truth simply means something that they have learned from others.\nThey have already concluded what is true; the search is bogus. They are simply trying to prove themselves right. They are not on a real journey of discovery.\nThe real journey has to be negative, not positive. And by negative I mean that you have to see your lies.\nYou don't know truth, so nothing can be done for the moment about the truth. You cannot seek it, you cannot search for it -- the question does not arise. But you know many lies in which you are living, in which everybody is living. Our society teaches us so many lies.\nThe god that has been taught about by the priest is a lie. The heaven, the hell, the theory of karma, rebirth -- anything that has been taught by others is a lie. Truth cannot be taught. There is no way to transfer it. One can experience it on one's own. No education is possible about truth, but you can be he helped to be aware of what kind of lies you are living in. And as you see a certain lie, it drops. The moment you see it, it drops, you cannot hold it any more. In your seeing that it is a lie, it becomes impossible to go on living through it.\nSlowly slowly more and more lies will start falling like dead leaves from a tree. And when all the dead leaves have fallen, new leaves will arrive of their own accord. That's how truth arrives: you destroy the lies and truth comes, you negate the lies and truth comes. It comes as a gift of god. You simply prepare the ground, you simply empty yourself of all kins of false notion, of all philosophies, ideologies, religions. You simply go on emptying yourself. The moment you are totally empty, truth descends in you. It is not your achievement, it is god's gift.\n(To an elderly Dutchwoman):\nThe truth is present in our being, but only as a seed, only as a potentiality. It has to be actualised, it has to be released. It is not somewhere else, one need not go anywhere, but one has to help the seed to become a sprout and the sprout to become a tree and the tree to come to flowers and fruits. Then life is a\ntremendous experience, so full of joy and so full of God and so full of eternity. Ordinarily we live without actualising our potential.\nThey say that ordinary people actualise only five to seven per cent of their potential. What a wastage!\nNinety-five per cent of your life was available to you but you never lived it. It is as if somebody was given a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npalace but he lived only in the porch and never entered the palace.\nWe are living like beggars for the simple reason that we don't move deeper into our beings to actualise all that has been given to us as a gift by god. But we don't even recognise it, we don't even feel that there is something more to life than we are living. Even the greatest geniuses, people like Albert Einstein, Rutherford, Newton, Edison, even they don't actualise more than fifteen per cent of their potential. Only once in a while is there a Jesus or a Buddha who actualises one hundred per cent of his potential. And these are the people who become the proofs that God is.\nYou can also become the proof because you have the same potential. The difference is not in potential at all, the difference is that they have actualised their potential and our potential is lying dormant.\nMy function here is to help you make the dormant dynamic, to make the static flowing, to make the dead alive. It is possible. And it is not as difficult as it appears in the beginning. In the beginning it appears difficult only because we have never tried it. So even small things... swimming is difficult because you have never tried. Even seeing a person riding a bicycle... it looks impossible to the person who does not know how to ride a bicycle. It is a miracle.\nOnce you know it is so simple, just a few efforts are needed. Maybe you will fall once or twice, you may be hurt here and there... a few bruises here and there, but that doesn't matter. That happens to every meditator: a few hurts, a few bruises --\nand sometimes a few fractures too. But that doesn't matter. Once you have learned, you gain so much that the price you pay for it is negligible.\nAnd it is never too late, remember. The idea is prevalent all over the world that in old age you can't do much. That is absolute nonsense. You can transform you potential any time. Even on one's deathbed, if one decides to change, the transformation is possible. Even in the very evening of our life it is possible to come back home.\n[There follows an interview with Ma Satya Bharti, which is not included here.]\nOne comes to discover both victory and immortality through meditation. Without meditation we are part of time, we are mortals, death is awaiting us at the end. And all that we are doing will be undone by death; hence we are simply making sandcastles. It is absolutely certain that death will come and destroy everything. It will destroy the poor man's hut and it will destroy the king's palace\n- they are all the same. It will destroy the beggar and it will destroy the emperor. It makes no distinctions.\nWithout meditation we live in time and we are mortal. As you move into meditation you start moving beyond time. You start entering a totally new kind of space which has no time element in it. It simply is. It never comes, it never goes. Time comes and goes. It is a movement, a procession of moments.\nBut there is a space within you which has always been there, is there right now, will be always there. It knows no change. It is beyond change. That which is beyond change is beyond time. This means change.\nNo change means no-time. And to experience that no-time is to experience immortality.\nThen all fears fall away, because all fears are rooted deep down in the fear of death. Then all anxiety disappears, because there is really only one anxiety. All other anxieties can be reduced to a single anxiety, that we are going to die, that everything we are doing is futile, that death is there and it can come at any moment. And it comes without informing you, there is no way to protect oneself against it - hence great anxiety, trembling, fear.\nBut once you know that something in you is beyond time, is beyond change, then you know that something in you that is beyond death too. You are immortal,\nyou were never born and you will never die.\nThe moment you pass from mind to meditation, you pass from the world of mortals into the world of the immortals. And that is victory - not the victory of Alexander, not the victory of Napoleon, but the victory of Jesus, the victory of Buddha. That is true victory.\nIt is only through meditation that life becomes meaningful. Without meditation life is utterly meaningless. One only vegetates, one does not really live. One hopes to live, but that hope is never fulfilled.\nOne goes on postponing life for tomorrow - and tomorrow never comes.\nYou can see that meaninglessness written on people's faces everywhere. People are trying to create some kind of meaning in their lives, but a created meaning is going to be arbitrary and you know all the time that it is just your creation, it is not worth much, and deep down you remain hollow. Afraid of that hollowness, people keep themselves occupied with every kind of activity. All the time that they are awake, they are engaged. They are afraid that if they are not engaged in something they may have to face their own 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmeaninglessness, their own emptiness, and futility. And that is frightening, it scares them; hence they never look in. For the whole day they are occupied, and then they fall asleep and still they remain occupied in their dreams.\nMeditation means facing your inner emptiness. Howsoever it hurts in the beginning it has to be encountered, because in encountering it you will be surprised that it is just a curtain.

diary, which has been copy-typed. It is for reference purposes
only.]</p><p>Sannyas is to be true to your original face. Then all your fragments
start melting into each other and they create a centre, they create
integrity, they create individuality. And that's what religion is all
about.</p><p>Religion has nothing to do with god or heaven and hell and all kinds
of theories and philosophies. The basic concern of religion is
truth.</p><p>And one has to live it, only then can one know it. Truth is god.</p><p>Truth does not mean a conclusion arrived at by thinking. It means
experience arrived at through living.</p><p>Truth is not a hypothesis; hence philosophy has no truth in it.
Philosophy goes round and round, it moves in circles, but it never
reaches the target. It is only through experience, not through thinking,
that one arrives home.</p><p>Sannyas is a change of gestalt. From mind you have to move to the
heart, from thinking to living, from speculating to experiencing.
Ordinarily religious people say "God is truth," but I would like to say
that that is not right. Truth is God. If you say "God is truth," you
have already come to a conclusion. But truth is God. That means a great
enquiry is needed, you have to explore from within and without.</p><p>And sannyas is exploration of truth. It is not belief, it is
discovery.</p><p>Truth is not something which has to be achieved. It is already inside
us. We are it, the seeker is the sought. But we go on rushing hither and
thither searching for the truth. We will never find it anywhere else;
hence the only way to find it is to stop seeking it outside. The only
way to find it is to sit silently and look within. It is not a question
of doing something, it is more a question of not doing anything. When
you are in a state of non-doing, utterly relaxed, it happens, it wells
up. It has always been there but you have never been there. The meeting
happens when you are also inside.</p><p>Truth or God is waiting there in your very heart; don't go on
knocking on other's doors. There is no need to go to any church, any
temple, any mosque. There is no need to search in the Bible, in the
Koran, in the Vedas.</p><p>Stop all seeking and searching and find it. In fact immediately one
finds it. It is such a joy to see that which we have been searching for
lives together and over which we were always being frustrated because
every effort was doomed to fail.</p><p>When truth is, we are not. We are the only barrier. The ego is like a
wall surrounding you, it is your imprisonment. So truth can never be an
achievement, because all achievements are through the ego. The ego
thinks in terms of achievement.</p><p>Truth comes to you not as an achievement but as a gift. Neither is it
a reward. It is not that you are worthy, pious, virtuous, so you will be
rewarded by truth. It comes to those who are ready to receive it,
welcome it. It does not matter whether you are a saint or a sinner, it
knocks on everybody's doors. It makes no distinctions between sinners
and saints. The guest comes to anybody who is</p><p>ready to open the door and welcome it.</p><p>The whole art of allowing the truth to take possession of you is of
being vulnerable, of being open, of being in a let-go. Or in other
words, the whole art consists of one word, "surrender'.</p><p>And that's what sannyas is, that's my definition of a sannyasin: a
man who is surrendered to existence so totally that he never thinks in
terms of achievement any more, because <em>he</em> is no more. Who is
there to achieve? -- he has disappeared totally, he has not left even a
trace behind. In that very moment, when you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>are just a pure nothingness, truth arrives. It is a gift of God.</p><p>Earnestness, sincerity, authenticity -- these are the foundations of
sannyas.</p><p>They are not different things but different aspects of the same
phenomenon. One has to be utterly truthful about oneself. One need not
hide, only cowards hide. The courageous person remains as he is, naked.
He is ready to accept whatsoever the consequences, but he is not ready
to compromise his truth. This is the only way to become an individual,
this is the only way to have integrity.</p><p>The world teaches people to be pseudo, to be compromising. The world
makes people deceptive, false.</p><p>All your so-called morality, character, respectability, is nothing
but an effort to create a facade so you can hide your reality, you can
hide and you can go on showing a false face to the world. Whatsoever is
expected from you, you can show it to the world. But a man who hides his
reality and shows his falseness to the world becomes split, he becomes
two. In fact he becomes many, because in each situation he has to use a
different face.</p><p>You can't use the same face with your wife that you use with your
girlfriend. You can't use the same face with the boss that you use with
your servant. You have to</p><p>carry many faces so that whatsoever the requirement of the situation,
you wear a mask. Slowly slowly it becomes automatic. You need not
change, they change of their own accord. To be in such a state means to
be miserable, mad, divided in thousands of pieces. Life will be a chaos
and a misery and a hell.</p><p>But one can drop the facade, one can drop all the masks. That's what
sannyas is: to be true, to be your original face. And then suddenly you
start feeling a kind of strength which was never there before, because
you start becoming one. All your fragments start melting into each other
and they create a centre, they create integrity, they create
individuality. Then one is earnest, sincere, authentic.</p><p>And that's what religion is all about. Religion has nothing to do
with God or heaven or hell and all kinds of theories and philosophies.
The basic concern of religion is truth. And one has to live it, only
then can one know it, there is no other way. It is not a belief, it has
to be your own existential experience. You have to experience it in the
innermost core of your very being. And that liberates. That brings
freedom to you, bliss to you, benediction to you.</p><p>Knowledge is human, wisdom is always divine. Knowledge comes through
our efforts, wisdom comes from god -- it is a revelation. We have only
to be receptive. We have not to do anything, we have just to be open and
available. It is not like science -- so much work, experiments, and then
finally you arrive after many experiments at a certain hypotheses. Then
too it is only a hypothesis. It may be proved wrong tomorrow, some new
facts may crop up. It is never absolute, it is never certain. It is
temporary, it is for the time-being.</p><p>Wisdom is absolute. When you know, you know. It never changes. What
Buddha knew, what Jesus knew, what Zarathustra knew is the same, it is
not different. It is not that after twenty-five centuries of Buddha you
will discover something else, no. It will be the same revelation,
absolute the same. Truth never changes.</p><p>Through human effort we can never reach the truth, we can only reach
a certain hypothesis. And because it is human we can never be absolutely
certain about it. We can use it, it is useful, but it is not wisdom.
Albert Einstein knows much, maybe much more than Buddha, but he is not a
Buddha, he is not awakened. He has not received the truth from the
beyond, it has not descended in him. His is human effort: through great
human effort he has come to certain conclusions. But human conclusions
<em>are</em> human; they have a certain limitation.</p><p>The search for truth is not like a scientific search. It is totally
different. Scientific enquiry is aggressive, religious enquiry is
receptive. Scientific enquiry is more masculine, religious enquiry is
more feminine.</p><p>So be open, available, silent, listening, so that God can reveal
something to you. It always comes as a revelation.</p><p>We are keeping truth at our backs. All that is needed is a little
turning in.</p><p>We are all extroverts. Our education makes us extroverts. Society
needs extroverts, it has no use for introverts. The introverts cannot be
made into soldiers, the introverts are almost as useless as rose
flowers.</p><p>You can appreciate a rose flower but what else can you do with it? It
has no utility. It has tremendous poetry but not utility.</p><p>So is the case with truth: it has great poetry, great joy, great
ecstasy, but is absolutely unmarketable.</p><p>You cannot reduce it to a commodity, you cannot sell it -- and the
world believes in selling and purchasing.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The world is a marketplace, and to be an introvert is to be out of
the marketplace. Hence we turn every child into an extrovert, we try in
every possible way to make sure that he does not have any idea that
there is something inside him. We make him forget any desire to go in.
And of course if you teach every child for twenty-five years
continuously, if you condition him, hypotise him, he becomes paralaysed.
He cannot turn his neck, it won't move; he can only look outwards, truth
is inside you. You brought it with your birth.</p><p>My work here is just to help you, to de-hypnotise you, to uncondition
you, to undo what the society has done to you. It is anti-social work.
Hence the society</p><p>was perfectly right in crucifying Jesus: he was an antisocial
element. So was Socrates, so is every awakened person. He has to
sabotage, he has to destroy the structure that society creates around
you. He has to bring you to your inner reality.</p><p>That does not mean that you cannot work outside. Being an introvert
does not mean that you become fixated. One should be flexible. One
should be able to come in, to come out easily, without any
difficulty.</p><p>So whatsoever is needed... if you are needed on the outside you can
be available, if you are needed inside you can be available. Then you
know both prose and poetry, then you know both logic and love, then you
can be in the marketplace and yet be in yourself.</p><p>The seeker of truth has to go beyond doubt, has to drop doubting,
because doubt keeps you tethered to the mind, doubt is the method of the
mind. If you doubt you can never go beyond mind. It is through trust
that one goes beyond mind. It is through trust that one goes beyond
mind. And truth is beyond mind.</p><p>Nobody has ever discovered truth through mind -- not a single
individual in the whole history of humanity. Many have discovered truth
but they have all discovered through trust, not through doubt.</p><p>So one has to go beyond doubt and one has to learn the language of
trust. Doubt is the language of logic, trust is the language of love. We
all live in doubt, we are all doubting Thomases because we all live in
the mind. The society perpetuates the mind, all the educational systems
strengthen the mind. And the more stronger the mind becomes, the less is
the possibility of love growing in you. You start doubting even the
existence of love. You start doubting even the existence of truth, so
the question of discovering truth does not arise at all.</p><p>Doubt creates such confusion in you that you don't know what to do
and what not to do. You go on asking the same mind and it goes on giving
you all kinds of answers, which are all contradictory to each other.
Mind is a [past ?] master in creating chaos.</p><p>Learn the way of love, learn the way of trust. Even a coward can
doubt; only a courageous person can trust. Trust needs some guts. It
means that you are taking risks, it means that you are moving into the
unknown. Who knows? -- there is no guarantee. But there is tremendous
joy in exploring. With a loving heart one can</p><p>go dancing into the unknown.</p><p>Go beyond your doubt, your doubting mind, and then you will really be
a seeker of truth. A seeker of truth neither believes nor doubts. He is
simply available, ready, open, vulnerable. He is ready to go with the
universe wherever it leads. And the universe is always leading you,
guiding you towards the ultimate expression of your being.</p><p>If you can surrender to existence, if you can allow yourself to be
overwhelmed by it, then the transformation happens so easily, without
any bloodshed and without any damage. Not even scars are left in you.
One changes so silently, so noiselessly, as if nothing has happened. On
the outside everything remains the same and on the inside nothing is the
same.</p><p>One can seek truth either out of misery or out of bliss. Both people
are seekers, but the first one is going to miss, he will never reach.
His very first step is wrong. Only the second one arrives.</p><p>On the surface both seek truth, but you can find only if you seek
rightly, in the right mood, with the right method; if you travel on the
right path, if you enter through the right door. Otherwise you can go on
and on searching and seeking for millions of lives and you will not
find. the truth.</p><p>The most important thing is the first step: what is the motive? That
is very essential to understand. Why does one want to seek truth? Is it
out of misery? -- then truth is an escape, an escape from your misery.
You want to become occupied with something so far away ,so impossible
that you can remain occupied forever and need not look at your misery;
so that you can avoid your anxiety, anguish, so that you avoid
channeling your energies towards truth.</p><p>But one who is trying to escape from himself in any way will never
reach truth, because truth is within you. Truth is not out there
somewhere. Truth is now, truth is here, truth is within you. And the
person who starts seeking and searching for truth because life is
miserable has already taken an attitude. He has 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>concluded that life is miserable. His mind has already become
prejudiced.</p><p>The real seeker has to be without conclusions, unprejudiced. He has
to function out of a state of not-knowing, he has to be an agnostic,
neither atheist nor theist. He has to accept his ignorance, he has to be
sincere about his ignorance. He has to say to himself and to others. "I
don't know. And because I don't know, how can I be a Christian and how
can I be a Mohammedan or a Hindu? Because I don't know, how can I be a
Catholic or a Communist? Because I don't know, how can I believe in god
or disbelieve in God?"</p><p>Disbelief is also a belief -- a negative kind of belief. The Catholic
believes, so does the Communist, he also believes. The seeker of truth
has to start dropping all beliefs, disbeliefs and is not to have any
conclusion. He has to start moving towards truth with a cheerful heart,
because only when the heart is cheerful do you become available to
existence. Just look at the trees, clouds, stars... The whole universe
is in an eternal dance. It is an orgy of joy, a non-ending carnival. It
goes on and on. It is sheer festivity.</p><p>So unless you move through cheerfulness, blissfulness, you will not
be moving in the right direction, you will not fall in tune with
existence. And the moment you fall in tune with existence you know who
you are. When the within and the without are meeting, merging, melting
into each other, they create such an explosion of light that everything
becomes clear, nothing remains unclear. That's the moment of truth.</p><p>Many have sought, very few have found because their search was wrong
from the very beginning. They were tired of life, they were antagonistic
to life, they were failures in life, they were miserable people -- and
they started seeking and searching for truth.</p><p>My effort here is first to teach you how to sing, how to dance, how
to love and how to be cheerful. Once that has started happening in you,
once the process is triggered and you become like a child -- innocent,
excited, ecstatic about small things... A butterfly is enough for the
child to be in awe. When you are so innocent and so cheerful and so full
of wonder then the first step has been taken, and taken rightly. Then
you can ride on the wave of bliss and it will take you to the other
shore.</p><p>The seeker of truth is on a very negative journey. Truth cannot be
sought</p><p>directly, you cannot make a goal out of it. In the first place you
don't know what it is, where it is, so how can you make a goal out of
it?</p><p>Your journey will remain a groping. So those who think that truth can
be attained directly start from the very beginning in a wrong way. Their
truth simply means something that they have learned from others.</p><p>They have already concluded what is true; the search is bogus. They
are simply trying to prove themselves right. They are not on a real
journey of discovery.</p><p>The real journey has to be negative, not positive. And by negative I
mean that you have to see your lies.</p><p>You don't know truth, so nothing can be done for the moment about the
truth. You cannot seek it, you cannot search for it -- the question does
not arise. But you know many lies in which you are living, in which
everybody is living. Our society teaches us so many lies.</p><p>The god that has been taught about by the priest is a lie. The
heaven, the hell, the theory of karma, rebirth -- anything that has been
taught by others is a lie. Truth cannot be taught. There is no way to
transfer it. One can experience it on one's own. No education is
possible about truth, but you can be he helped to be aware of what kind
of lies you are living in. And as you see a certain lie, it drops. The
moment you see it, it drops, you cannot hold it any more. In your seeing
that it is a lie, it becomes impossible to go on living through it.</p><p>Slowly slowly more and more lies will start falling like dead leaves
from a tree. And when all the dead leaves have fallen, new leaves will
arrive of their own accord. That's how truth arrives: you destroy the
lies and truth comes, you negate the lies and truth comes. It comes as a
gift of god. You simply prepare the ground, you simply empty yourself of
all kins of false notion, of all philosophies, ideologies, religions.
You simply go on emptying yourself. The moment you are totally empty,
truth descends in you. It is not your achievement, it is god's gift.</p><p>(To an elderly Dutchwoman):</p><p>The truth is present in our being, but only as a seed, only as a
potentiality. It has to be actualised, it has to be released. It is not
somewhere else, one need not go anywhere, but one has to help the seed
to become a sprout and the sprout to become a tree and the tree to come
to flowers and fruits. Then life is a</p><p>tremendous experience, so full of joy and so full of God and so full
of eternity. Ordinarily we live without actualising our potential.</p><p>They say that ordinary people actualise only five to seven per cent
of their potential. What a wastage!</p><p>Ninety-five per cent of your life was available to you but you never
lived it. It is as if somebody was given a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>palace but he lived only in the porch and never entered the
palace.</p><p>We are living like beggars for the simple reason that we don't move
deeper into our beings to actualise all that has been given to us as a
gift by god. But we don't even recognise it, we don't even feel that
there is something more to life than we are living. Even the greatest
geniuses, people like Albert Einstein, Rutherford, Newton, Edison, even
they don't actualise more than fifteen per cent of their potential. Only
once in a while is there a Jesus or a Buddha who actualises one hundred
per cent of his potential. And these are the people who become the
proofs that God is.</p><p>You can also become the proof because you have the same potential.
The difference is not in potential at all, the difference is that they
have actualised their potential and our potential is lying dormant.</p><p>My function here is to help you make the dormant dynamic, to make the
static flowing, to make the dead alive. It is possible. And it is not as
difficult as it appears in the beginning. In the beginning it appears
difficult only because we have never tried it. So even small things...
swimming is difficult because you have never tried. Even seeing a person
riding a bicycle... it looks impossible to the person who does not know
how to ride a bicycle. It is a miracle.</p><p>Once you know it is so simple, just a few efforts are needed. Maybe
you will fall once or twice, you may be hurt here and there... a few
bruises here and there, but that doesn't matter. That happens to every
meditator: a few hurts, a few bruises --</p><p>and sometimes a few fractures too. But that doesn't matter. Once you
have learned, you gain so much that the price you pay for it is
negligible.</p><p>And it is never too late, remember. The idea is prevalent all over
the world that in old age you can't do much. That is absolute nonsense.
You can transform you potential <em>any</em> time. Even on one's
deathbed, if one decides to change, the transformation is possible. Even
in the very evening of our life it is possible to come back home.</p><p>[There follows an interview with Ma Satya Bharti, which is not
included here.]</p><p>One comes to discover both victory and immortality through
meditation. Without meditation we are part of time, we are mortals,
death is awaiting us at the end. And all that we are doing will be
undone by death; hence we are simply making sandcastles. It is
absolutely certain that death will come and destroy everything. It will
destroy the poor man's hut and it will destroy the king's palace</p><p>- they are all the same. It will destroy the beggar and it will
destroy the emperor. It makes no distinctions.</p><p>Without meditation we live in time and we are mortal. As you move
into meditation you start moving beyond time. You start entering a
totally new kind of space which has no time element in it. It simply is.
It never comes, it never goes. Time comes and goes. It is a movement, a
procession of moments.</p><p>But there is a space within you which has always been there, is there
right now, will be always there. It knows no change. It is beyond
change. That which is beyond change is beyond time. This means
change.</p><p>No change means no-time. And to experience that no-time is to
experience immortality.</p><p>Then all fears fall away, because all fears are rooted deep down in
the fear of death. Then all anxiety disappears, because there is really
only one anxiety. All other anxieties can be reduced to a single
anxiety, that we are going to die, that everything we are doing is
futile, that death is there and it can come at any moment. And it comes
without informing you, there is no way to protect oneself against it -
hence great anxiety, trembling, fear.</p><p>But once you know that something in you is beyond time, is beyond
change, then you know that something in you that is beyond death too.
You are immortal,</p><p>you were never born and you will never die.</p><p>The moment you pass from mind to meditation, you pass from the world
of mortals into the world of the immortals. And that is victory - not
the victory of Alexander, not the victory of Napoleon, but the victory
of Jesus, the victory of Buddha. That is true victory.</p><p>It is only through meditation that life becomes meaningful. Without
meditation life is utterly meaningless. One only vegetates, one does not
really live. One hopes to live, but that hope is never fulfilled.</p><p>One goes on postponing life for tomorrow - and tomorrow never
comes.</p><p>You can see that meaninglessness written on people's faces
everywhere. People are trying to create some kind of meaning in their
lives, but a created meaning is going to be arbitrary and you know all
the time that it is just your creation, it is not worth much, and deep

frightening, it scares them; hence they never look in. For the whole day
they are occupied, and then they fall asleep and still they remain
occupied in their dreams.</p><p>Meditation means facing your inner emptiness. Howsoever it hurts in
the beginning it has to be encountered, because in encountering it you
will be surprised that it is just a curtain. Behind it is very dark when
you go in, but that darkness is only on the circumference. At the very
center of it there is light, eternal light.</p><p>And once a person has experienced his own light, his own being, his
own eternity, all meaninglessness disappears. One becomes
praiseworthy.</p><p>It is only through meditation that one becomes praise-worthy.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=if-you-choose-to-be-with-me-you-must-risk-finding-yourself-chapter-4>If

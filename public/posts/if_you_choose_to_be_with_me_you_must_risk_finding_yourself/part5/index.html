When he risks, time stops for him, mind stops for him, his heart misses a beat. that is his joy. In that suspense he unknowingly tastes something of meditation.\nWe are doing it here very knowingly, deliberately. I am teaching you to be gamblers. I am asking you to risk your life, and to risk it for the unknown. Worship means risking all that you have in the search.\n[There is an interview with Ma Anand Savita which is not included here.]\nPrayer does not mean talking to God, because God understand no language, or, he understand only the language of silence.\nTo me utterly in silence is prayer, not repeating certain formulas, The Lord's Prayer and this and that and all that nonsense. Prayer cannot be reduced to words, all words falsify prayer. And that's what all the religions have been teaching people: words and words.\nTrue prayer is the art of silence. One is simply silent, with no motive, because if there is a motive silence cannot be true. The motive will remain there, lurking around. If one is silent for the sheer joy of being silent then it is prayer.\nAnd the second thing to remember.… The first is, no word is needed, the second is, coming with God means listening to him, not saying something to him. Be silent and listen. The chirping of the birds and the wind passing through the trees and the sound of running water -- listen to it all. This is how God is speaking, giving his messages. He will not come like an Old Testament prophet and shout at you. He is not a person, he is a presence. And if you are silent you can feel the presence. There is nothing to say but much to feel, nothing to say but much to listen to. And the beautiful things about silence is, it is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan.\nWhen you are listening you are receptive, vulnerable, open. That vulnerability, that openness, creates great joy in you because for the first time you drop all bondages. At least for the moment you are out of the prison, in the open, under the sun, under the moon. for the first time you feel the wind, the sun. these are all ways of contacting god.\nHe comes through the heart, but he can come only when the heart is utterly silent, absolutely still.\nGod need not be advised, and your advice cannot be of any meaning; the very effort is stupid. People are hiding their desires behind their prayers. Their prayers are only a facade; they want to snatch something from god. There is desire, and whenever there is desire, prayer disappears.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPrayer means a total acceptance of whatsoever is. Desire means that something else is needed, this is not enough, more is needed. And when there is the desire for more, how can you be silent? There will be turmoil within. There are millions of desires, so you will be crowded, suffocated. You cannot be at ease\nand you cannot be at rest. And prayer is a deep rest, a rest in existence, a relaxation so deep that you disappear totally.\nTo be in prayer means to be available to god, to his creativity, to be open, to be utterly silent, relaxed, to be a non-being, so that he can possess you. You are so empty of yourself that he is bound to possess you.\nPrayer is a gesture from your side that \"I am ready to be possessed. I am ready to be overwhelmed --\ncome to me!\" And that too has not to be said, that is just a feeling in every fibre of your body, mind, soul.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- A year.\n-- That's very good! Do many groups. And those who come for one year never go back! (laughter)\n-- I don't want to go away.\n-- There is no need to go -- you have come home!\nMediation is the only true prayer. All else that goes on in the name of prayer is mind stuff. It is utterly useless. You can go on talking to God for lives together, but you will never be heard.\nReal prayer is not verbal. It has to be out of silence. Silence is simply silence, it does not belong to any religion. It certainly belongs to the religious heart. It is the very center of the religious heart but it is not part of any dogma, doctrine, church.\nA really religious person is free of all Christianity, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism. Because \"isms\" as such are something in the mind. They are ideology, philosophy, thinking. And thinking is never silent, thinking is a always a turmoil. Silence means a thought-less stillness. When there is no thought in you, when nothing stirs, you are in prayer.\nBecause meditation is difficult, priests all over the world invented prayers,\nprayers which can be done by anybody. Even a small child can be taught so that he repeats them like a parrot every night -- out of fear, because the mother and the father, all are after him: \"Have you said your prayers or not?\" So he has to do it, and then it becomes a habit: when you are grown up you continue saying the same prayer every night. If you don't do it, it will be difficult for you to sleep because a routine is missing. If you say it, you gain nothing.\nIt is just like a habit. A few people like to have a cup of coffee before they go to sleep, a few people like to have a little smoke before they go to sleep, and a few religious people like to do some praying -- but it is all the same! (laughter) There is no qualitative difference, just a routine. sleep needs a certain ritual: make love, smoke a cigarette or jog or do something else!(laughter) Even if you enter your bed from the wrong side you will find it difficult to go to sleep. In a new room it is difficult to sleep. It takes at least three days to settle into a new room, into a new house.\nPrayer also can become part of ritual. That's what it has become all over the world. It is not prayer. It is an invention of the cunning priest, a toy to play with.\nReal prayer is meditation. Meditation is hard work. You have to transform much in your being, you have to drop much rubbish. You have to empty your head, you have to move more and more close to the heart.\nYou have to become more silent and still. And when you are utterly silent God speaks, not in a certain language -- he has no language. But through silence there is a communion. It is a totally different way of giving a message. You start hearing the message; not only that, you start living the message. Once you have heard from God in you deep silence, you have to follow it -- you cannot do otherwise, and not out of any sense of duty but out of sheer joy. The more you follow those subtle guidelines that happen in you silence, the more and more your silence deepens, the more and more you become available to God. He can communicate more. Then meditation becomes your very being. Then it is not something special to do, it becomes your ordinary life.\nCooking, you are meditatively cooking, taking a shower, you are meditatively taking a shower. Even while sleeping you are meditatively sleeping. When meditation has become just like breathing or the heart beating, then you have come home.\nPraise is the very essence of prayer. If you can praise life and all its gift you are bound to encounter god.\nPeople only condemn, their very being is negative. They are very vocal in negating, in saying no, in condemning. And not only the ordinary people but the so-called religious people are also condemnors, they 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nare great poisoners. They don't teach people how to praise life and its blessings, they teach people how to condemn life, how to negate life. Their idea of God is that he is an enemy of life. On one hand they go on saying that God created life, on the other hand they go on teaching people to renounce life. This is such an absurdity, but it has been perpetuated for so long that nobody sees its contradiction.\nIf God created life then it can't be renounced. To renounce it will be to renounce God himself. It is because of this that George Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples that all the saints are against God. His statement has tremendous significance. The saints teach people to go away from life. That can't be God's intention. If he creates life and he goes on creating it, that means that he wants you to live it in its totality.\nHe wants you to live it with gusto, with fervour, with joy. He wants you to transform life into a love affair.\nand that's what praise is.\nLook at the stars, at the sun, at the trees, at the people. We are living in such a wonderful world but we are so blind and so deaf that we don't hear the music that surrounds us and we don't see the beauty that is constantly showering on us. And when we start seeing it, praise arises, silent praise. Nothing has to be said in particular. What can be said? -- all words are inadequate. But one bows down in silence, in gratitude.\nThat is prayer.\nPrayer is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. How can it be Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian? It is just the silent, singing heart, full of joy, full of thankfulness.\nPraise is the very foundation of prayer. One who can praise has a heart ready to jump into prayer.\nIt is difficult to praise, it is easy to condemn. It is easy to condemn because through condemnation the ego feels nourished. Through condemnation you reduce people to being lower than you, you become higher, holier, superior. That's how the ego exists, it always reduces everybody to a lower status.\nPraise means raising the other higher than you. It is poison for the ego. When you praise each and everything, when the whole universe becomes an object of your praise, the ego disappears. And the disappearance of the ego makes you available to god. Only when the ego has completely gone can God descend in you. The ego has to vacate the heart, only then can God enter in.\nGod simply means the whole. Ego means you are trying...... [page missing? 195]\n.… is in gambling. When he risks, time stops for him, mind stops for him, his heart misses a beat. For a moment it is as if the whole world stops, everything is in a suspense. That is his joy. In that suspense he unknowingly tastes something of meditation.\nWe are doing it here very knowingly, deliberately. I am teaching you to be gamblers.… not in the ordinary sense, I am not asking you to risk your money. I am asking you to risk your life and to risk it for the unknown. There is no guarantee, there can never be any guarantee for it, because if there is a guarantee it is business. It is no more gambling.\nWorship means risking all that you have for the search of what it is all about. This mysterious universe, this infinite existence, this beginningless, endless life -\n- what is it all about?\nGod is only a name for all this, for this totality. If it is only curiosity one becomes a philosopher. If it is only a ritual one becomes a Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan. But if it is a deep love affair then one becomes a sannyasin.\nWorship can be out of fear or out of greed but then it is not worship at all. That is what is know to people as worship. In the temples, in the mosques, in the churches, in the synagogues you will find people who are either afraid or greedy.\nIt is very rare to come to the third category because the third category rarely exists. The third category consists of those people who worship just out of gratitude, because god has given so much. They don't desire any more, they are not greedy. They are not afraid. How can they be afraid when god exists? How can there be hell when God is? It is impossible, God and hell don't fit. All those tortures of hell simply prove that there is no god. If hell is a reality then God must be unreal. Then devil is a reality. The devil fits perfectly well with hell. If God is, then there is no hell. That is enough proof that hell does not exist.\nBut this is strange, a very strange phenomenon, that people have been arguing against God but nobody has argues against hell. I have come across thousands of books which argue against God saying that there is no God. but I have not come across a single book which argues that there is no hell or which argues that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthere is no devil. It appears very strange but when you give it a second thought it has a certain logic: we are so miserable that we can accept hell easily. We are already in hell, how can we disprove it? And we are surrounded by all kinds of evil forces. We have created them, we have released them. Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse Tung are enough proof that the devil exists. Our world is enough proof that there is hell, and certainly hell will need somebody to control, to dominate, to rule over it; hence nobody says that there is no hell, nobody says that there is no devil, but thousands of people have argues against God.\nThe real worshipper is one who looks at the beauty of existence. Although we have contaminated everything, still it is beautiful; we have not been successful although we have destroyed much we cannot destroy the whole. Still the beauty lingers, still trees dance and birds sing and stars go on showering light, life. And the celebration continues, only man has been lagging behind. He has become\nheavy and he is no more part of the celebration of existence.\nThe real worshipper is one who becomes part of this celebration. He dances with the trees, he sings with the birds. He is blissful and grateful; out of his bliss he is bound to be grateful.\nSo I don't teach you God, I teach you bliss, because this is my observation: if you are blissful then you are bound to be grateful to God, then you are bound to find God. You cannot avoid it, it is inevitable. To the blissful heart God simply happens.\nSo worship has neither to be out of fear nor out of greed, but out of bliss. Then it is true and it has a tremendous beauty of its own. It brings freedom.\nReligion has to be a conscious decision because it is going to be a commitment. For example, you are entering into sannyas, this is religion, this is your decision. This is not out of any conditioning. This is falling in love!\nNow worship becomes possible. And when I say worship I don't mean that you have to worship a certain statue with certain prayers. By worship I simply mean looking at existence with worshipful eyes, eyes full of wonder and awe, with a heart full of praise. To look at existence with wonder and awe is worship, because through that wonder and awe one starts feeling the presence of God.\nAnd once you start feeling the presence of God then nothing can take it away from you. No argument, no proofs, no logic can take it away from you. It becomes your authentic experience, nobody can destroy it.\nIt becomes your very foundation. And for the first time you know that you are not an accident, that you are intrinsically related to existence, that existence needs you as much as you need existence, that you are not really separate but interdependent.\nTo feel that is to be blissful. To feel that is to rejoice.\nDaso means servant -- servant of God, one who is ready to serve existence, one who is ready to worship God through service. All other worship is mere ritual. Real worship is service. Service is pouring your love wherever it is needed -- on the trees, on the rocks, on animals, on human beings. Everybody has an inexhaustible source of love -- and love is a healing force. So wherever you find\nany suffering, pour your love, shower you love. You will be surprised, love heals. And love heals not only the person you shower it upon, it heals you too, simultaneously.\nWhen you see somebody becoming whole a great joy arises in you. Even in seeing the seeds that you have sown in the soil growing up, and becoming plants something inside you also starts growing with them.\nThat's the beauty of creativity: it creates something on the outside about which the whole world knows, it creates something in the inside of which only you are aware. And the inner is the real, the more precious.\nThe outer is only a spin-off, a by-product.\nService is creativity. and by serving existence one comes closer to God, otherwise there is no way to come close to him. Love, be compassionate, share whatsoever you have. Share your very being and don't be a miser. That's the way of sannyas. You may not go to the church and you may not go to the temple but God is bound to happen to you. He is going to come to you, you need not worry. He always comes to the person who has fulfilled the basic requirement, and the basic requirement is unconditional love. That's what I mean by service.\nTo be blissful is the only true prayer. there is no need to ask anything from god, he already knows. all that is needed on our part is a blissful surrender. Joyously we should surrender ourselves to god. and that is enough, then god starts taking care. He is very caring but we don't allow him to take care of us.\nSannyas means leaving everything to God, and whatsoever happens -- good or bad, pain or pleasure --\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalways feeling grateful for it.\nThere is no other prayer than love. All other prayers are false substitutes. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- all prayers are just toys. Man has been deprived of love so he has been supplied by the society, the church, the state with some false toys.\nIt is just like when a child is deprived of the mother's breast we give him something false, a rubber breast. And the child is deceived, he goes on sucking on the rubber thing. But a child can be forgiven, a child is after all a child; he is not aware of the cunningness of grown-up people.\nBut as far as reality is concerned we are all deceived. Prayer has been given to us just as a substitute because love has been taken away. Something is needed, because love is a basic need: so don't love human beings; love God, love humanity. Now where is humanity? You will never come across humanity.\nWhenever you meet it you will meet a human being. Don't love human beings; love humanity, an abstraction. Don't love the world, the concrete world; love God, an abstraction. And we call this love for abstractions, prayer.\nMy effort here is to bring prayer back to its reality, back to the earth, back to the concrete. the abstract has exploited man too long and too much. we have to get rid of great abstract words -- humanity, freedom, communism, God, Christianity\n-- just words.\nLove the concrete: human beings, animals, trees, birds. Love the real that is prayer. The whole universe is his temple. Love more and more and you will become more and more religious. You will not become a Christian and you will not become a Hindu; you will become more and more religious.\nReligion has nothing to do with all these isms. Religion is a quality of the heart. A heart which is overflowing with love, that is what true religiousness is.\n[An interview follows with Ma Prem Divya, ms pg 200-202, about prayer, in verses, which is not included here.]\nMeditation is the greatest adventure in life, because it is easier to go out -- all our senses are out-going --\nit is difficult to come in. To come in means transcending nature, transcending the ordinary laws of nature. It is the greatest conquest. One has to be a masterful\nwarrior.\nThe fight is with one's own consciousness, with one's own darkness, with one's own lethargy, sleep, inattentiveness -- in short, with one's own mind.\nIt is easy to fight with somebody else because you can see the enemy there, outside, you can define the enemy. The mind is so close to you that you feel almost one with it; hence the difficulty. The first step is to create a distance between you and your mind so that your mind is also separate from you. Then the fight starts.\nIt is a very non-violent fight. It is more of a transformation than a fight, because we are not going to destroy the mind, we are going to use the mind as a stepping stone towards the state of no-mind. But still in the beginning it looks like a fight, and one has to be very very alert, intelligent. Only then is there a possibility of winning over it, of becoming victorious.\nSannyas is the beginning of a great adventure, the greatest in life.\nBliss happens only to those who know what loyalty is. Bliss happens only in the heart, never in the head.\nThe head is like a desert: nothing grows there. It is only in the heart that everything that is of any value grows -- love, meditation, God, bliss, peace, silence. Anything that has any value, any eternal value, grows in the heart. But the functioning of the heart and the head are totally opposed to each other. And we are trained for the head -- that becomes a problem.\nThe head is based on doubt and the heart is based on trust. Our whole training is of doubting, thinking, suspecting, questioning. And that is not the way of the heart; hence we remain hung-up in the head. There are very few people on the earth who know that the heart exists. For others it is only a metaphor, poetry, fiction, not fact; at the most just a pumping mechanism for the blood. But that is not the heart that mystics have been talking about.\nThere is a center deep down inside you, but that center can only be known through trust. Sannyas is a jump into trust. It is getting involved in a love affair, a love affair with God himself. Less than that is of no use.

only.]</p><p>God is for gamblers who can risk all for the unknown. The gambler is
not really interested in winning.</p><p>His whole interest is in gambling. When he risks, time stops for him,
mind stops for him, his heart misses a beat. that is his joy. In that
suspense he unknowingly tastes something of meditation.</p><p>We are doing it here very knowingly, deliberately. I am teaching you
to be gamblers. I am asking you to risk your life, and to risk it for
the unknown. Worship means risking all that you have in the search.</p><p>[There is an interview with Ma Anand Savita which is not included
here.]</p><p>Prayer does not mean talking to God, because God understand no
language, or, he understand only the language of silence.</p><p>To me utterly in silence is prayer, not repeating certain formulas,
The Lord's Prayer and this and that and all that nonsense. Prayer cannot
be reduced to words, all words falsify prayer. And that's what all the
religions have been teaching people: words and words.</p><p>True prayer is the art of silence. One is simply silent, with no
motive, because if there is a motive silence cannot be true. The motive
will remain there, lurking around. If one is silent for the sheer joy of
being silent then it is prayer.</p><p>And the second thing to remember.… The first is, no word is needed,
the second is, coming with God means listening to him, not saying
something to him. Be silent and listen. The chirping of the birds and
the wind passing through the trees and the sound of running water --
listen to it all. This is how God is speaking, giving his messages. He
will not come like an Old Testament prophet and shout at you. He is not
a person, he is a presence. And if you are silent you can feel the
presence. There is nothing to say but much to feel, nothing to say but
much to listen to. And the beautiful things about silence is, it is
neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan.</p><p>When you are listening you are receptive, vulnerable, open. That
vulnerability, that openness, creates great joy in you because for the
first time you drop all bondages. At least for the moment you are out of
the prison, in the open, under the sun, under the moon. for the first
time you feel the wind, the sun. these are all ways of contacting
god.</p><p>He comes through the heart, but he can come only when the heart is
utterly silent, absolutely still.</p><p>God need not be advised, and your advice cannot be of any meaning;
the very effort is stupid. People are hiding their desires behind their
prayers. Their prayers are only a facade; they want to snatch something
from god. There is desire, and whenever there is desire, prayer
disappears.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Prayer means a total acceptance of whatsoever is. Desire means that
something else is needed, this is not enough, more is needed. And when
there is the desire for more, how can you be silent? There will be
turmoil within. There are millions of desires, so you will be crowded,
suffocated. You cannot be at ease</p><p>and you cannot be at rest. And prayer is a deep rest, a rest in
existence, a relaxation so deep that you disappear totally.</p><p>To be in prayer means to be available to god, to his creativity, to
be open, to be utterly silent, relaxed, to be a non-being, so that he
can possess you. You are so empty of yourself that he is bound to
possess you.</p><p>Prayer is a gesture from your side that "I am ready to be possessed.
I am ready to be overwhelmed --</p><p>come to me!" And that too has not to be said, that is just a feeling
in every fibre of your body, mind, soul.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- A year.</p><p>-- That's very good! Do many groups. And those who come for one year
never go back! (laughter)</p><p>-- I don't want to go away.</p><p>-- There is no need to go -- you have come home!</p><p>Mediation is the only true prayer. All else that goes on in the name
of prayer is mind stuff. It is utterly useless. You can go on talking to
God for lives together, but you will never be heard.</p><p>Real prayer is not verbal. It has to be out of silence. Silence is
simply silence, it does not belong to any religion. It certainly belongs
to the religious heart. It is the very center of the religious heart but
it is not part of any dogma, doctrine, church.</p><p>A really religious person is free of all Christianity, Judaism,
Jainism, Buddhism. Because "isms" as such are something in the mind.
They are ideology, philosophy, thinking. And thinking is never silent,
thinking is a always a turmoil. Silence means a thought-less stillness.
When there is no thought in you, when nothing stirs, you are in
prayer.</p><p>Because meditation is difficult, priests all over the world invented
prayers,</p><p>prayers which can be done by anybody. Even a small child can be
taught so that he repeats them like a parrot every night -- out of fear,
because the mother and the father, all are after him: "Have you said
your prayers or not?" So he has to do it, and then it becomes a habit:
when you are grown up you continue saying the same prayer every night.
If you don't do it, it will be difficult for you to sleep because a
routine is missing. If you say it, you gain nothing.</p><p>It is just like a habit. A few people like to have a cup of coffee
before they go to sleep, a few people like to have a little smoke before
they go to sleep, and a few religious people like to do some praying --
but it is all the same! (laughter) There is no qualitative difference,
just a routine. sleep needs a certain ritual: make love, smoke a
cigarette or jog or do something else!(laughter) Even if you enter your
bed from the wrong side you will find it difficult to go to sleep. In a
new room it is difficult to sleep. It takes at least three days to
settle into a new room, into a new house.</p><p>Prayer also can become part of ritual. That's what it has become all
over the world. It is not prayer. It is an invention of the cunning
priest, a toy to play with.</p><p>Real prayer is meditation. Meditation is hard work. You have to
transform much in your being, you have to drop much rubbish. You have to
empty your head, you have to move more and more close to the heart.</p><p>You have to become more silent and still. And when you are utterly
silent God speaks, not in a certain language -- he has no language. But
through silence there is a communion. It is a totally different way of
giving a message. You start hearing the message; not only that, you
start living the message. Once you have heard from God in you deep
silence, you have to follow it -- you cannot do otherwise, and not out
of any sense of duty but out of sheer joy. The more you follow those
subtle guidelines that happen in you silence, the more and more your
silence deepens, the more and more you become available to God. He can
communicate more. Then meditation becomes your very being. Then it is
not something special to do, it becomes your ordinary life.</p><p>Cooking, you are meditatively cooking, taking a shower, you are
meditatively taking a shower. Even while sleeping you are meditatively
sleeping. When meditation has become just like breathing or the heart
beating, then you have come home.</p><p>Praise is the very essence of prayer. If you can praise life and all
its gift you are bound to encounter god.</p><p>People only condemn, their very being is negative. They are very
vocal in negating, in saying no, in condemning. And not only the
ordinary people but the so-called religious people are also condemnors,
they 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

its blessings, they teach people how to condemn life, how to negate
life. Their idea of God is that he is an enemy of life. On one hand they
go on saying that God created life, on the other hand they go on
teaching people to renounce life. This is such an absurdity, but it has
been perpetuated for so long that nobody sees its contradiction.</p><p>If God created life then it can't be renounced. To renounce it will
be to renounce God himself. It is because of this that George Gurdjieff
used to say to his disciples that all the saints are against God. His
statement has tremendous significance. The saints teach people to go
away from life. That can't be God's intention. If he creates life and he
goes on creating it, that means that he wants you to live it in its
totality.</p><p>He wants you to live it with gusto, with fervour, with joy. He wants
you to transform life into a love affair.</p><p>and that's what praise is.</p><p>Look at the stars, at the sun, at the trees, at the people. We are
living in such a wonderful world but we are so blind and so deaf that we
don't hear the music that surrounds us and we don't see the beauty that
is constantly showering on us. And when we start seeing it, praise
arises, silent praise. Nothing has to be said in particular. What can be
said? -- all words are inadequate. But one bows down in silence, in
gratitude.</p><p>That is prayer.</p><p>Prayer is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. How can it be
Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian? It is just the silent, singing heart, full
of joy, full of thankfulness.</p><p>Praise is the very foundation of prayer. One who can praise has a
heart ready to jump into prayer.</p><p>It is difficult to praise, it is easy to condemn. It is easy to
condemn because through condemnation the ego feels nourished. Through
condemnation you reduce people to being lower than you, you become
higher, holier, superior. That's how the ego exists, it always reduces
everybody to a lower status.</p><p>Praise means raising the other higher than you. It is poison for the
ego. When you praise each and everything, when the whole universe
becomes an object of your praise, the ego disappears. And the
disappearance of the ego makes you available to god. Only when the ego
has completely gone can God descend in you. The ego has to vacate the
heart, only then can God enter in.</p><p>God simply means the whole. Ego means you are trying...... [page

him, his heart misses a beat. For a moment it is as if the whole world
stops, everything is in a suspense. That is his joy. In that suspense he
unknowingly tastes something of meditation.</p><p>We are doing it here very knowingly, deliberately. I am teaching you
to be gamblers.… not in the ordinary sense, I am not asking you to risk
your money. I am asking you to risk your life and to risk it for the
unknown. There is no guarantee, there can never be any guarantee for it,
because if there is a guarantee it is business. It is no more
gambling.</p><p>Worship means risking all that you have for the search of what it is
all about. This mysterious universe, this infinite existence, this
beginningless, endless life -</p><p>- what is it all about?</p><p>God is only a name for all this, for this totality. If it is only
curiosity one becomes a philosopher. If it is only a ritual one becomes
a Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan. But if it is a deep love affair then one
becomes a sannyasin.</p><p>Worship can be out of fear or out of greed but then it is not worship
at all. That is what is know to people as worship. In the temples, in
the mosques, in the churches, in the synagogues you will find people who
are either afraid or greedy.</p><p>It is very rare to come to the third category because the third
category rarely exists. The third category consists of those people who
worship just out of gratitude, because god has given so much. They don't
desire any more, they are not greedy. They are not afraid. How can they
be afraid when god exists? How can there be hell when God is? It is
impossible, God and hell don't fit. All those tortures of hell simply
prove that there is no god. If hell is a reality then God must be
unreal. Then devil is a reality. The devil fits perfectly well with
hell. If God is, then there is no hell. That is enough proof that hell
does not exist.</p><p>But this is strange, a very strange phenomenon, that people have been
arguing against God but nobody has argues against hell. I have come
across thousands of books which argue against God saying that there is
no God. but I have not come across a single book which argues that there
is no hell or which argues that 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>there is no devil. It appears very strange but when you give it a
second thought it has a certain logic: we are so miserable that we can
accept hell easily. We are already in hell, how can we disprove it? And
we are surrounded by all kinds of evil forces. We have created them, we
have released them. Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse Tung are
enough proof that the devil exists. Our world is enough proof that there
is hell, and certainly hell will need somebody to control, to dominate,
to rule over it; hence nobody says that there is no hell, nobody says
that there is no devil, but thousands of people have argues against
God.</p><p>The real worshipper is one who looks at the beauty of existence.
Although we have contaminated everything, still it is beautiful; we have
not been successful although we have destroyed much we cannot destroy
the whole. Still the beauty lingers, still trees dance and birds sing
and stars go on showering light, life. And the celebration continues,
only man has been lagging behind. He has become</p><p>heavy and he is no more part of the celebration of existence.</p><p>The real worshipper is one who becomes part of this celebration. He
dances with the trees, he sings with the birds. He is blissful and
grateful; out of his bliss he is bound to be grateful.</p><p>So I don't teach you God, I teach you bliss, because this is my
observation: if you are blissful then you are bound to be grateful to
God, then you are bound to find God. You cannot avoid it, it is
inevitable. To the blissful heart God simply happens.</p><p>So worship has neither to be out of fear nor out of greed, but out of
bliss. Then it is true and it has a tremendous beauty of its own. It
brings freedom.</p><p>Religion has to be a conscious decision because it is going to be a
commitment. For example, you are entering into sannyas, this is
religion, this is your decision. This is not out of any conditioning.
This is falling in love!</p><p>Now worship becomes possible. And when I say worship I don't mean
that you have to worship a certain statue with certain prayers. By
worship I simply mean looking at existence with worshipful eyes, eyes
full of wonder and awe, with a heart full of praise. To look at
existence with wonder and awe is worship, because through that wonder
and awe one starts feeling the presence of God.</p><p>And once you start feeling the presence of God then nothing can take
it away from you. No argument, no proofs, no logic can take it away from
you. It becomes your authentic experience, nobody can destroy it.</p><p>It becomes your very foundation. And for the first time you know that
you are not an accident, that you are intrinsically related to
existence, that existence needs you as much as you need existence, that
you are not really separate but interdependent.</p><p>To feel that is to be blissful. To feel that is to rejoice.</p><p>Daso means servant -- servant of God, one who is ready to serve
existence, one who is ready to worship God through service. All other
worship is mere ritual. Real worship is service. Service is pouring your
love wherever it is needed -- on the trees, on the rocks, on animals, on
human beings. Everybody has an inexhaustible source of love -- and love
is a healing force. So wherever you find</p><p>any suffering, pour your love, shower you love. You will be
surprised, love heals. And love heals not only the person you shower it
upon, it heals you too, simultaneously.</p><p>When you see somebody becoming whole a great joy arises in you. Even
in seeing the seeds that you have sown in the soil growing up, and
becoming plants something inside you also starts growing with them.</p><p>That's the beauty of creativity: it creates something on the outside
about which the whole world knows, it creates something in the inside of
which only you are aware. And the inner is the real, the more
precious.</p><p>The outer is only a spin-off, a by-product.</p><p>Service is creativity. and by serving existence one comes closer to
God, otherwise there is no way to come close to him. Love, be
compassionate, share whatsoever you have. Share your very being and
don't be a miser. That's the way of sannyas. You may not go to the
church and you may not go to the temple but God is bound to happen to
you. He is going to come to you, you need not worry. He always comes to
the person who has fulfilled the basic requirement, and the basic
requirement is unconditional love. That's what I mean by service.</p><p>To be blissful is the only true prayer. there is no need to ask
anything from god, he already knows. all that is needed on our part is a
blissful surrender. Joyously we should surrender ourselves to god. and
that is enough, then god starts taking care. He is very caring but we
don't allow him to take care of us.</p><p>Sannyas means leaving everything to God, and whatsoever happens --
good or bad, pain or pleasure --</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>always feeling grateful for it.</p><p>There is no other prayer than love. All other prayers are false
substitutes. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- all prayers are just toys.
Man has been deprived of love so he has been supplied by the society,
the church, the state with some false toys.</p><p>It is just like when a child is deprived of the mother's breast we
give him something false, a rubber breast. And the child is deceived, he
goes on sucking on the rubber thing. But a child can be forgiven, a
child is after all a child; he is not aware of the cunningness of
grown-up people.</p><p>But as far as reality is concerned we are all deceived. Prayer has
been given to us just as a substitute because love has been taken away.
Something is needed, because love is a basic need: so don't love human
beings; love God, love humanity. Now where is humanity? You will never
come across humanity.</p><p>Whenever you meet it you will meet a human being. Don't love human
beings; love humanity, an abstraction. Don't love the world, the
concrete world; love God, an abstraction. And we call this love for
abstractions, prayer.</p><p>My effort here is to bring prayer back to its reality, back to the
earth, back to the concrete. the abstract has exploited man too long and
too much. we have to get rid of great abstract words -- humanity,
freedom, communism, God, Christianity</p><p>-- just words.</p><p>Love the concrete: human beings, animals, trees, birds. Love the real
that is prayer. The whole universe is his temple. Love more and more and
you will become more and more religious. You will not become a Christian
and you will not become a Hindu; you will become more and more
religious.</p><p>Religion has nothing to do with all these isms. Religion is a quality
of the heart. A heart which is overflowing with love, that is what true
religiousness is.</p><p>[An interview follows with Ma Prem Divya, ms pg 200-202, about
prayer, in verses, which is not included here.]</p><p>Meditation is the greatest adventure in life, because it is easier to
go out -- all our senses are out-going --</p><p>it is difficult to come in. To come in means transcending nature,
transcending the ordinary laws of nature. It is the greatest conquest.
One has to be a masterful</p><p>warrior.</p><p>The fight is with one's own consciousness, with one's own darkness,
with one's own lethargy, sleep, inattentiveness -- in short, with one's
own mind.</p><p>It is easy to fight with somebody else because you can see the enemy
there, outside, you can define the enemy. The mind is so close to you
that you feel almost one with it; hence the difficulty. The first step
is to create a distance between you and your mind so that your mind is
also separate from you. Then the fight starts.</p><p>It is a very non-violent fight. It is more of a transformation than a
fight, because we are not going to destroy the mind, we are going to use
the mind as a stepping stone towards the state of no-mind. But still in
the beginning it looks like a fight, and one has to be very very alert,
intelligent. Only then is there a possibility of winning over it, of
becoming victorious.</p><p>Sannyas is the beginning of a great adventure, the greatest in
life.</p><p>Bliss happens only to those who know what loyalty is. Bliss happens
only in the heart, never in the head.</p><p>The head is like a desert: nothing grows there. It is only in the
heart that everything that is of any value grows -- love, meditation,
God, bliss, peace, silence. Anything that has any value, any eternal
value, grows in the heart. But the functioning of the heart and the head
are totally opposed to each other. And we are trained for the head --
that becomes a problem.</p><p>The head is based on doubt and the heart is based on trust. Our whole
training is of doubting, thinking, suspecting, questioning. And that is
not the way of the heart; hence we remain hung-up in the head. There are
very few people on the earth who know that the heart exists. For others
it is only a metaphor, poetry, fiction, not fact; at the most just a
pumping mechanism for the blood. But that is not the heart that mystics
have been talking about.</p><p>There is a center deep down inside you, but that center can only be
known through trust. Sannyas is a jump into trust. It is getting
involved in a love affair, a love affair with God himself. Less than
that is of no use. Only a love affair can help.</p><p>The head will say that this is blind trust and it will condemn it in
every possible way. But don't listen to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

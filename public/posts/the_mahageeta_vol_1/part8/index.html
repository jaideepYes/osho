It is for reference use only.] The first question\nQuestion 1\nIT FEELS TO ME THAT MY BODY IS LIKE A CAGE OR BOTTLE, IN WHICH A VERY POWERFUL LION IS IMPRISONED AND HE HAS BEEN SLEEPING THERE FOR MANY LIVES, BUT NOW HE HAS BEEN AWAKENED BY YOUR HARASSMENT. HE IS HUNGRY AND VERY IMPATIENT TO BE FREED FROM THE CAGE. MANY TIMES DURING THE DAY HE BECOMES ENRAGED AND ROARS, HE LEAPS UP ROARING. EVERY CELL OF MY BODY TREMBLES FROM THIS ROARING AND LEAPING UP, AND THE FOREHEAD AND UPPER PART OF THE HEAD BEGIN TO BURST WITH ENERGY. AFTER THIS I FALL DEEP INTO AN EXTRAORDINARY INTOXICATION AND ECSTASY. THEN THE LION BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET, SHAKES, WALKS SLOWLY AND GOES ON GROWLING. AND THEN IN KIRTAN OR IN REMEMBERING YOU HE DANCES ECSTATICALLY. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON?\nYoga Chinmaya has asked.\n... what is happening is good. It is happening just as it should. Don’t be frightened by it. Let it happen. Help it in every way. A unique process has begun, whose final crescendo is liberation.\nWe are certainly imprisoned in the body – a lion locked up in a cage. Confined for such a long time that the lion has forgotten his own roar. Confined for such a long time that the lion has started thinking the cage is his home. No only this, he has started thinking, “I am the cage. I am the body!”\nA hit is needed. That’s why you are with me, so I can hit – and you wake up.\nThese words that I say to you are not mere words. Think of them as arrows. They will pierce you. Sometimes you will be angry with me too. Because everything was moving along peacefully, comfortably and suddenly there is confusion. But there is no other way to wake you up, you will have to pass through pain.\nWhen energy rises within, the body will not be able to bear it. The body has not been made to endure it. The capacity of the body is very small. The energy is vast. As if one wants to enclose the whole sky in a small courtyard... so when the energy awakens many disturbances will arise in the body. The head will be splitting with pain.\nAnd sometimes it happens that even after enlightenment disturbances continue in the body. It is completely natural before enlightenment, because the body is not ready. It is as if you put one thousand candles of electricity into an electric line that has the capacity to carry one hundred candles – it will rattle and catch fire! It is just the same when the energy which had been sound asleep within you awakens – it manifests and your body is not ready for it. Your body is ready to accept your being a beggar, it cannot accept your being an emperor. The body has limits, you have no limits.\n... it will be jolted, storms will arise. Before enlightenment happens, before samadhi, these shocks are completely natural. And sometimes it happens that samadhi happens and the shocks continue coming, the storms continue, because the body was not able to get ready.\nThis is what happened in Krishnamurti’s case. The process continued forty years after attaining the ultimate. The body could not absorb the shock. Krishnamurti will wake up in the middle of the night shouting and screaming. He starts to growl – really growling. And for forty years he has had a headache that doesn’t go away, it comes and goes but it never totally leaves him. Sometimes the pain is so strong that it feels his head will burst.\nFrom the standpoint of the body, these last forty years have been years of great difficulty for Krishnamurti. Sometimes it happens this way. But usually the body becomes ready as samadhi happens. But with Krishnamurti the body could not adjust because samadhi had been forced. The thinkers that brought Krishnamurti up, those Theosophists worked hard, made untiring efforts to bring on samadhi. Their aspiration was to give birth to a world teacher. The world needs it – if a Buddha can be incarnated.…\nIf Krishnamurti had worked only by his own efforts, perhaps he would have needed one or two more births. But then this problem would not have arisen. The worked was forced: what needed two lifetimes to happen, happened instantly. It happened but the body could not get ready. It happened suddenly when the body was not ready. So there have been forty years of physical suffering. Even now Krishnamurti growls at night and wakes up again and again from his sleep. The energy won’t let him sleep. He screams!\nIt seems amazing that a person who has achieved the ultimate should scream at night. But the cause is clear. An enlightenment that should have taken two lifetimes to happen, was forced too quickly. Because of this the body was not ready and the process continues. It has happened but this process continues. He has reached home but the body remains behind, still being dragged along. The being has reached home, the body has not reached. The pain and suffering of this dragging continues.\nDon’t be frightened by what’s happening. These are the first indications of samadhi, the first steps of samadhi. Take them as auspicious, accept them happily. If you are ready to accept them as blessings, then very soon they will slowly become quiet. And as soon as the body begins to accept, begins to cooperate, the readiness and capacity of the body increase.\nYou have called out to the infinite, so you will have to become infinite. You have challenged the vastness, so you will have to become vast.\nThere is a very unique story in the Old Testament – the story of Jacob. Jacob was seeking god. He distributed all his wealth. He sent all his beloved friends, his wife, his children, his servants – he sent them all far away. He was waiting for god on the deserted bank of a river. God arrived.\nBut it was very strange – Jacob started wrestling with god. Does anyone wrestle with god? But Jacob started struggling with god. It is said that they fought the whole night. As morning approached, as dawn was about to come Jacob was defeated. When god was about to leave him, Jacob fell at god’s feet and said, “Please give me your blessing.”\nGod said, “What is your name?” Jacob told him his name.\nGod said, “Today you have become Israel” – the name that the Jews are known by – “From today on you are Israel. Now you are no longer Jacob, Jacob has died.” – just as I change your name when I give you sannyas initiation. The old is gone.\nGod told Jacob: “Jacob has died, from now on you are Israel.”\nThis story is from the Old Testament. There is no other story of someone fighting with god. But there is a great truth in this story. When that ultimate energy descends, what happens is almost like a fight. And when the ultimate experience happens and you are defeated by the divine and the body is vanquished and you accept defeat – then your final initiation happens. In that moment divine blessings shower on you. Then you are new. That is when you taste the nectar of the eternal for the first time.\nYoga Chinmaya is almost there where Jacob must have been. It is difficult to say how long the night may be. It is hard to say how long the struggle will last. No prediction can be made. But this struggle is auspicious.\nCooperate with this energy. This lion inside that wants freedom – it is you. This energy that wants to rise towards the head, that wants to go from the sex center to the crown chakra, that wants to create a path – it is you. For many lives it has been subdued and lying coiled up, now it is starting to raise its hood. You are fortunate, you are lucky. With this you are approaching the final blessing. Your real transformation will happen.\nKrishnamurti has written in his notebook, whenever my head is splitting, when at night I cannot sleep and the screaming and shouting come and something inside me growls – after all this is over a unique experience comes. After this a great peace descends. Blessings shower in every direction. Everywhere lotuses and more lotuses are blooming.\nExactly this is starting to happen to Chinmaya. It is good.\nAFTER THIS I FALL DEEP INTO AN EXTRAORDINARY INTOXICATION AND ECSTASY.\nWhen the energy arises after it has had its struggle, and the body becomes a little ready, then a new ecstasy will come: there is growth. You have come up a little. You have transcended a little. You have come out of the prison a little, you have found open sky. You will be fulfilled. You will dance, you will dance for joy.\nTHEN THE LION BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET, SHAKES, WALKS SLOWLY AND GOES ON GROWLING. AND THEN IN KIRTAN OR IN REMEMBERING YOU HE DANCES ECSTATICALLY.\nThe lion wants to dance. There isn’t room enough to dance in the body. More space is needed for dancing – what space is available in the body? Dance can only happen outside of the body. This is why if you dance totally you will find you no longer remain a body. In the ultimate grace of dance, at the ultimate height, you are out of the body. The body goes on turning, goes on moving rhythmically but you are outside, you are no longer inside.\nThis is why I have invariably included dance in my methods of meditation, because there is nothing more miraculous for meditation than dancing. If you dance fully, it you dance totally, then in that dance your being comes out of the body. The body will go on moving in rhythm but you will experience that you are out of the body. And then your real dance begins: below, the body will go on dancing; above, you will dance. The body on the earth, you in the sky! The body in the earthly, you in the celestial. The body will dance the dance of matter, you will dance the dance of consciousness. You will become nataraj, the king of the dance.\nYou ask, “PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON?\nThe unprecedented is happening, the wondrous is happening, the rare is happening! What is happening is not to be explained, it is to be experienced. Whatever I say will not help you understand this experience, at the most it can help you become capable of accepting it more easily. Accept it with joy. Do not repress it.\nNaturally the idea will come to suppress it thinking, “What madness is this, I am growling like a lion? What is this roaring? People will think I am mad!”\nSo naturally the idea will come to suppress it, to hide it – don’t let anyone know. What will they say?\nDon’t worry. Don’t bother about what anyone says. If people say you are mad, then go mad! Has anyone become enlightened without going mad? Give your attention to your interiority. If bliss is coming from this, if ecstasy is coming, if wine is raining then don’t worry. This world has nothing so valuable as this to give to you. So don’t make any compromise with the world. Don’t sell an inch of your being, even if in exchange you will get the whole universe as your kingdom.\nJesus has said, what use is it if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? If you save your soul, even if you lose the whole world you have everything.\nHave courage, be daring. Let your trust, your faith in yourself grow. Soon your body will start gradually accepting it. Then the roaring will disappear. Then only dance will remain. Then the lion will not suffer, because the lion will have found a path: when he wants to go out he can go out, when he wants to come in he can come in. Then this body is no longer a jail, then this body becomes a place to relax. When you want to come in, come inside; when you want to go out, go outside.\nWhen you can go out and in as easily as you come and go from your house... it is cool, you feel cold, you go outside and sit in the sunshine. Then the sunshine increases, the sun climbs high, it starts getting hot, you start sweating – you get up and come in. Just as you come and go from your house, then the house is not a prison – if you are sitting in prison you don’t have the possibility to come out or go in whenever your heart feels like it. In jail you are a prisoner, at home you are a master. When your lion can dance outside, can fly in the sky, can play with the moon and stars – then there is no problem. Then there is no fight with the body. Then the body is a place for relaxation. When you get tired you can return inside and rest. Then there is no enmity with the body either. Then the body is a temple.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nYESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH US, AND WHEN WE TAKE SANNYAS WE ALSO START BEING WITH YOU. I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY MOMENT WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS: NEITHER WHEN, NOR WHERE. YOU JUST GAVE IT. EVEN NOW HAVE I COME NEAR YOU? I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SANNYAS THEN, NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING NOW. MASTER, HOW CAN I BECOME A REAL SANNYASIN? HOW CAN I COME CLOSER TO YOU? WHAT WORTHINESS DO I HAVE? WHAT TRUST AND SURRENDER HAVE I GOT?\nIt has happened many times that I have given initiation to people who have no idea about sannyas. I have given sannyas to those who have not come to take sannyas. I have initiated those who have never thought of sannyas even in their wildest dreams. Because I don’t look only at your mind, I look at the many things repressed in your unconscious.\nLast night a young woman came. I didn’t even ask her. I said to her, “Close your eyes and take sannyas.” I didn’t even ask if she wants to take sannyas. She closed her eyes and accepted initiation. Ordinarily one would be surprised if asked to take sannyas and want to think it over. Some people think of taking sannyas for months, for years. Some have kept on thinking about it and died before taking it. She graciously received it. On a conscious level she doesn’t know anything about it.\nBut we are not new here – we are very ancient! This girl has been seeking for many lives. She carries treasures of meditation. Just seeing this treasure I said, “Close your eyes and go inside.” I told her, “I am not going to ask you whether you want to take sannyas or not. There is no need to ask.”\nI gave Dayal sannyas in the same way. This question is from Dayal. I didn’t ask Dayal, Dayal also didn’t know.\nWhat do you know about yourself! You don’t know where you came from. You don’t know about the treasures you have gathered. You don’t know what you have been doing these many many lives.\nYou don’t know what you have found in your search and what remains incomplete. Every time death has come and rubbed out everything that you have done. There are many among you who have taken sannyas many times – every time death came and erased everything. And you don’t have the ability to recall it.\nUnderstand it like this, you had been creating something... you had been painting a picture, when death came and it remained incomplete. Death came and you forgot. You were born again. Then even if you get a message about that incomplete painting – even if that incomplete painting is put in front of you, you won’t remember. Because in this life you had never even thought of yourself as a painter And if I tell you, “Finish the painting, it has been left incomplete, you had made it with great hopes, you had created it with a very deep thirst – now just go ahead and finish it. Death had come in between and it was left incomplete.”\nYou will say, “I don’t know anything, you can have me take up the brush but I don’t even know how to hold it. You can put the colors in front of me and I will paint but I don’t know anything about how to paint.” Still, I tell you to start, and just by starting the memory will come. Just take the brush in your hand and perhaps you will be reminded.\nIt happened in the Second World War, a soldier was wounded and fell. He lost his memory. He had received a blow to the head. His memory cells got messed up. He forgot. He forgot – even his own name. He forgot who he was. And he was unconscious when he was taken from the battlefield. His identification had fallen off somewhere, his number too had fallen. It was a great problem. When he came to his senses he didn’t know his number, he didn’t know his name, he didn’t know his rank. The psychologists worked hard. They tried in every way to remind him but couldn’t find out anything. The man had gone completely blank. As if all connection with his memory had suddenly broken off. Someone suggested that now there was only one way: have him taken all around England. He was a soldier in the British army. If he was taken around England, perhaps when he came near his own village he would remember.\nSo he was taken around England on the trains. Two men took him around. The train stopped at every station and they brought him down. He stood and stared. They got tired. England is a small country, so it wasn’t very difficult to take him everywhere. In the end at a very small station where the train didn’t usually stop, but for some reason it did this time, the man got off, read the sign on the station and said, “This is my village!” He began to run. He forgot that there were two men with him. The two men began running after him. He ran out of the station and into the villagehe\nremembered everything. He remembered the lanes and paths. He didn’t even ask anyone. Passing through the lanes and bypaths he arrived in front of his house. He said, “Oh! This is my house, this is my name. This is my name plate hanging here.” He remembered everything. Just one hit and his whole memory came back again. Forgetfulness disappeared, the memory cells came back together again.\nSo sometimes I give sannyas as I gave it to Dayal in the hope that if I send you around in orange clothes, perhaps you will remember that you have previously moved in orange clothes too. If I say: “Dance!” Perhaps while you are dancing, one day you will arrive at that psychological space, where you will remember your dancing of past lives. I say, “Meditate.” While you are meditating perhaps some door in the unconscious will open and a flood of memories will come.\nThis is why I go on speaking – sometimes on the Geeta, sometimes on Ashtavakra, sometimes\non Zarathustra, sometimes on Buddha, sometimes on Jesus, sometimes on Krishna – who knows which words will stir your heart. Who knows which words will become a key to your inner depths. Who knows which words will awaken you from your slumber. I go on trying everything. My effort is simply to create a continuity, a harmony, a connectivity with what deaths have broken and scattered. With this continuity your destiny will start unfolding in front of you. Many times you have made the house, it was abandoned again and again.\nHence Dayal is right, I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY MOMENT WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS... He didn’t take it, I gave it.\n... NEITHER WHEN NOR WHERE. YOU JUST GAVE IT. EVEN NOW HAVE I COME NEAR YOU?\nYou will come near me, when you reach yourself. There is no other way to come near me. Reach yourself and you have reached me. Know yourself and you have known me. You don’t need to make any outer pilgrimage towards me – descend deeper and deeper within.\nI DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SANNYAS THEN, NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING NOW.\n... it will happen, soon you will know. I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ... THEN, NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING NOW. – this is true. But this attitude is good where you think, where you know, that you don’t know. Unfortunate are they who don’t know but think they know. You are in the right state. This is the attitude of the innocent mind, “I don’t know.” You are empty, you can be filled. There are some who don’t know anything – and their number is vast – but they think they know. Through this wrong idea, they miss even what they could have known.\nKnowledge prevents – prevents you from real knowing. If you know that you are ignorant, then you are moving in the right direction. The ultimate happens only in such innocence of mind. To know that I don’t know, is the first step towards knowing.\nWHAT WORTHINESS DO I HAVE? WHAT TRUST AND SURRENDER HAVE I GOT?\nThis feeling arises in a worthy person’s heart, “What worthiness do I have?” The unworthy think, “Who is as worthy as I am?”\nThis feeling of humility itself is worthiness, that what do I deserve, what surrender, what trust do I have? This is the indication of trust. The seed is present, one just needs to wait: at the appropriate time, in the appropriate season, it will sprout, the transformation will happen.\nAnd this journey is a rare journey. This journey is a journey of the unknown, of the unknowable.\nThis hiding behind the veils of continuing silence. It is in vain that now I have become one who knows the secret.\nIn the madness of you I lost my peace. In your pain I have become a flame filled with joy.\nIn the hands of time I have been so bent that I who was once an arrow, have now become a bow. No companion, no guide for this journey. What path is this I have set out on?\nI have found great joy in self-oblivion. Being lost, I have become the very beacon of the goal.\nThis goal is such that it is reached by losing yourself. As long as you exist, you will not arrive, when you disappear you reach.\nI have found great joy in self-oblivion.\n... when you are not, when your ego has gone, when self-forgetfulness comes...\nI have found great joy in self-oblivion. Being lost, I have become the very beacon of the goal. As I have disappeared, I have arrived.\nThis path is the path of obliteration.\nSo if you feel, ‘Where is my worthiness to surrender,’ you have started to be effaced, self-oblivion is arising. If you feel that WHAT TRUST... HAVE I GOT? then self-effacement starts coming, you start being obliterated.\nSannyas means to be obliterated, so existence can be. No companion, no guide for this journey.\nThis is a journey of great aloneness.\nNo companion, no guide for this journey.\nThere isn’t any companion, no one to guide the path. Finally, the master too has to be dropped, because there is no space. Kabir says, “The path of love is very narrow, there two can never pass!” Where is space enough that three can exist? Not even two can exist. The disciple, the master, the divine; they are three! There, not even two can exist. There, the master is dropped, you also are dropped. There, only the divine remains.\nNo companion, no guide for this journey. What is this path I have set out on?\nSannyas is a very unknown journey. A journey of great courage, of great daring! Those who are ready to accept the risk of going into the unknown – it is for them. It is not for the clever, those who calculate everything. It is not mathematics, it is a leap of love.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nYOU SAID THAT, “YOU ARE LIBERATED HERE AND NOW, THIS VERY MOMENT.” BUT HOW CAN I GET FREE OF THIS “I”?\nIf you ask ‘how’ you have missed. You didn’t get it. This is Ashtavakra’s whole message: practicing... ‘How’ means practicing. ‘How’ means by what method, by which rites and rituals. If you ask ‘how’\nyou have missed. Then you cannot understand Ashtavakra. Then you should go knock on Patanjali’s door: he will tell you ‘how.’ If you are insistent upon this ‘how,’ then Patanjali will be your path. He will tell you to do outer discipline, inner discipline, control, breath control, turning inwards, concentration, meditation, samadhi. He will make it so extensive that even you will say: “O Maharaj, make it a little less. Tell me some easy method. This is too long, it will take many lives.”\nMost yogis are only practicing outer discipline. They never reach even to inner discipline. Most yogis die still trying to master asanas – yoga postures. Where is concentration, where is meditation? There are so many yoga postures it seems impossible to ever complete the training in them. At the very most those who seek deeply reach to concentration. And the real happening can occur only in samadhi. And even samadhi Patanjali divides in two: samadhi with distinctions and samadhi without differentiation. He goes on dividing, he goes on making more and more steps. He makes steps all the way from the earth to the sky.\nIf ‘how’, if practicing, appeals to you, then ask Patanjali. Even though in the end Patanjali also says drop everything, enough of this ‘doing’. But there are some people that cannot stop doing, so they will have to do.\nThink of it like this: there is a child in the house making noise and causing mischief. You tell him, “Sit quietly,” but even if he sits, he will be bubbling over. His hands and feet will wriggle, his head will shake – he wants to do something, he is bursting with energy. This is no way to get him to sit still. It is dangerous. There can be an explosion. This way he is going to do something or other. It is better you tell him, “Go and run around the house seven times.” Then he will come back huffing and puffing and sit quietly on his own. You won’t even have to say be quiet. He will sit quietly on the very chair that he could not sit quietly on before.\nPatanjali is for those who cannot become quiet directly. He says, “Run seven rounds. Run long and hard. Distort and twist your body, stand on your head, do this, do that.”\nDoing these practices finally you will ask one day, “O Maharaj, I am tired of this doing!”\nHe will say, “You should have said so in the very beginning, then both of us would have been saved from all this botheration. Now go and sit quietly!”\nMan wants to do. Because without doing – it just doesn’t fit your logic that anything can happen without doing. Ashtavakra is beyond your logic. Ashtavakra says you are liberated! But you still misunderstand. You say, ...”YOU ARE LIBERATED HERE AND NOW, THIS VERY MOMENT.” BUT HOW CAN I GET FREE OF THIS “I”?\nAshtavakra says that ‘how’ exists when one thinks he is unfree. First you have accepted that you are bound: “Now how can I get free?” Ashtavakra says there are no chains – only the illusion of chains. But you will still say, “How can I get free of this illusion?” You still don’t get it. Illusion means that which is not: free of what? Just watching, just being wakeful – you are free.\nIf you get involved in methods, you will be in great difficulty. Every method proves false, and finally life itself proves too short.\nIf you get stuck in methods you will find that not just this life but many lives are not enough. Methods are many. Life after life you have gone on practicing them. You put faith in doing because doing inflates your ego.\nAshtavakra is saying don’t do anything. The whole is the only doer. What is happening is happening, just become one with it. Don’t even ask: “How to get free of this I?” If this ‘I’ is happening let it happen, who are you to try to get free of it? You can also accept it: good, if this is happening, then this is what is happening. You didn’t create it. Do you remember having created it? You didn’t cast its mould. You didn’t bring it. How will you drop what you didn’t bring? How will you destroy what you didn’t cast? You ask, “What can we do?” You have two eyes and a nose, you also have an ego. You have received all of these. Nothing is in your hands.\nWhatever exists is good. If ‘I’ exists, that too is good. Don’t complain even a little about it. In this attitude of no complaint, in this total acceptance, you will suddenly find the ‘I’ is gone! Because the ‘I’ is created from doing. When you do something the ‘I’ is created.\nNow you are asking something new, “How can I destroy this ‘I’?” The one who destroys will become the ‘I’. You will not be able to escape. This is why a humble man also has an ego – and sometimes it is bigger than in an egoist.\nHave you seen the ego of the humble? He says. “I am just the dust at your feet.” But look into his eyes – what is it he is saying? If you say, “You are absolutely right, I knew already that you are just the dust at my feet,” then he will start fighting. He is not saying it for you to agree with it. He is saying it so you will say, “You are such a humble man... you are very kind to give us your darshan.” He is saying it so you will refute it saying, “You and dust at my feet? No, you are pure gold. You are the very spire of the temple.” The more you say high, he will say no, just the dust. But when he says he is the dust, if you agree, “You are absolutely right, everyone thinks that you are just the dust at their feet,” then he will never even look at you again. It was not humility – it was ego in a new color, ego dressed in new clothes, ego dressed in humility.\nSo if you try to drop the ‘I’, the one who is dropping it will create a new ‘I’. Man goes on changing costumes. The clothes change but you remain the same.\nTry to understand what Ashtavakra is saying. Don’t be too quick to ask what to do, how to get rid of this ego. Don’t be in a hurry to do. Relax and take a little time to understand. Ashtavakra is saying, “Understand how this ‘I’ is created – it is created by doing, it is created from striving and effort, it is created from success. So wherever you make efforts, it will be created. Then one thing becomes clear that if you want to be free of ego, then don’t make efforts, don’t try. Accept whatever is, just like it is. In this acceptance you will find the ego has disappeared as if it had never existed, because the element that was giving it energy has slipped out, the foundation has fallen down so the house cannot stand long.\nAnd if the feeling of being the doer falls away, then all of life’s diseases fall away. Otherwise there are many traps in life. Running after money is also the running of the doer. Running after power is also the running of the doer. Running after fame is also the running of the doer. You want to show something to the world.\nMany people come to me saying, “Tell us a way to show something to this world.” What is it you want to show? They say, “No, it’s just we want to make a name for ourselves. We will be going but our name should remain behind!” What’s the use of your name remaining? No one else is interested in your name. When you yourself are gone who is going to bother? When you couldn’t be saved from death, will your name be saved from dying? You cannot be kept alive, how can this name which is only an indication be saved? Who bothers about your name? And so what if your name does remain? It will be hidden away in some old books, it will be grieving there. Alexander’s name, Napoleon’s name – so what?\nBut no, we have been taught these diseases since childhood. Since childhood we have been told, “Do something before you die. Don’t die without doing anything. If you can, do something good, if not, do something bad, but make a name for yourself.” People say, “So what if you get a bad name, at least your name is known. If you don’t find the right way, then do something crazy, but make a name for yourself!”\nPeople are so crazy that they go to the mountains and inscribe their names in stone. They go visit an ancient castle and scribble their name on the walls. And the man writing his name doesn’t see that he is rubbing out another name to write his: someone else will come and rub his out and write over it. You have erased someone else’s, you are writing over the top of others writing – and in big letters. If someone else comes they will write in even bigger letters. What madness have you fallen into?\nMany are the frivolous longings woven by snares of dream, many are the trampled down passions arisen with a brilliance.\nThe joy of beauty, love’s drunkenness, the greatness of name, the pride of wealth, for man on this earth many are the spread out snares of illusion.\nEach to his own destiny and each to his own nature, many are those trampled by happiness, many are those made rich by sorrow.\nMany are the famines that have passed, but when have such hard times come?.\nTreasure of the heart is found little, though treasure is found aplenty. Many are the wealthy I saw whose hearts were paupers.\nHow many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness? The world of consciousness is one, the nether worlds of unconsciousness are many.\n“How many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness?” This is our unconscious, in it so many scenes are hidden – scene after scene, curtains behind curtains, stories within stories! This is our unconscious, there are so many hells hidden in it – of wealth, of power, of fame, of dreams – the snares are set!\nHow many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness? The world of consciousness is one, the nether worlds of unconsciousness are many.\nBut one who becomes aware, his world is one, his nature is one, his being is one, his flavor is one!\nBuddha has said, “Wherever you taste the ocean it is salty – likewise if you taste me I am everywhere fully conscious. I have only one flavor: consciousness.”\nThis same is the flavor of Ashtavakra. Not the doer, not the one who enjoys and suffers – the witness.\nSo don’t ask ‘how’? Because with how the doer comes in, the enjoyer comes in – then you miss, you miss Ashtavakra’s message. Ashtavakra is saying, “Whatever is, observe it. Be a witness. Just watch. If there is ego then watch ego. What else to do? Only watch – and by watching the transformation happens.”\nDo you understand? It is a little subtle, but not so subtle that you can’t understand it. It is straight forward also. Ashtavakra is saying just observe and when you observe the doer disappears, only the witness remains. With the doer gone everything that got energy from the doer, got strength from it will fall away. Without the doer how can one run after money, run after power? Without the doer where is the ego? These will all fall away by themselves.\nMaster just one thing – the witness. There is nothing else to be done. Everything else happens by itself. Everything else goes on and on, always. Why should you uselessly get in the way?\nI have heard, an elephant was crossing over a bridge. The bridge started shaking under his weight. A fly was sitting on his trunk. When they both got to the other side, the fly said, “Son! We really shook that bridge.”\nThe elephant said, “Sweetie, until you spoke I didn’t even know you existed.”\nYou think you are shaking the bridge but it is not you who is shaking the bridge, it is life energy. You are like a fly that sits on top of life energy and says, “Son! Look how I have shaken it!”\nThis ego is just sitting on top of you. Everything is happening from your limitless energy. It is the energy of existence, you don’t have anything to do with it. This same breathes in you, awakens in you, sleeps in you. You stand proudly in between. This much is certain, it doesn’t take objection to your pride. At least the elephant objected. The elephant said, “Sweetie, I didn’t even know you were sitting on top of me.” At least the elephant said this much. Existence doesn’t even say this much. Existence is silent. If you stand proudly, it lets you. If you lay claim to its work, it lets you. If you say you are doing what you have not done, then too it doesn’t intrude and say, “No, I am doing it.” It has no I, how can it tell you I am doing it? So illusion goes on and on.\nBut look closely, open your eyes a little and see: you are not doing anything. Everything is happening by itself!\nThis is the incomparable concept of destiny, the unparalleled concept of fate: everything is happening by itself. Wrong people have given it incorrect meanings. Otherwise fate means merely... If you understand the idea of fate rightly, you will remain a witness and there will be nothing else to do. But people don’t become a witness of fate, they become lazy. They don’t become non-doers, they become idlers.\nThere is a difference between non-doing and idleness. Idleness is lazy, indolent, dead. Non-doing is full of energy – one doesn’t think I am doing: “... existence is doing! I am only watching. This play is going on, I am observing.”\nMan is very tricky. He uses even the most beautiful truths in the ugliest way. Fate is a very beautiful truth. It means that everything goes on by itself, you are not doing anything. All is destined. What will be, will be. What is to be, is. What was to happen, has happened. You can sit quietly on the bank and watch the play. There is no need for you to jump into the middle of it. Your running back and forth doesn’t make any difference. What is to happen is happening. What will be, will be. Then you become a witness.\nThe idea of fate was devised to take you towards witnessing. People have not gone towards witnessing. People sit idling. They say, “When what is to be is happening, then good, why should we do anything? Fate means we have no power to do, why should we do?” Before they said they will show the world, now they say, there is nothing in doing! But the feeling of the doer hasn’t gone, it remains standing in the same place.\nIf you understand Ashtavakra, then there is no method, there is no practice: Ashtavakra says practice is bondage, methods are bondage, doing itself is bondage.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nTHROUGH YOUR GRACE I CAN SEE THE SKY. I EXPERIENCE LIGHT AND BECOME ONE WITH THE INNER CURRENT ALSO. BUT WHEN SEX OVERTAKES ME, I WANT TO DROWN IN THAT JUST AS MUCH AS IN MEDITATION. PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS CONDITION OF MINE?\nThe first thing: be a witness of sex too. Don’t be the controller of it. Don’t try to forcibly bring it under control, remain a witness of it too. Just as you are a witness of everything else, remain a witness of sex too.\nIt is difficult, because you have been taught for centuries that sex is sin. That concept of sin has been fixed in your mind.\nSin does not exist in this universe – there is only godliness. Drop that idea. In this universe there is only one – it pervades all – it is godliness. It is in the tiniest of the tiny, in the most vast of the vast. It is in the lowest, in the highest. It is in sex, it is in samadhi too. There is no sin here.\nThis does not mean that I am suggesting that you remain stuck in sex. I am only saying: understand it too as a form of godliness. There are other forms. Perhaps the first level of his forms is sex. And there is a small taste of samadhi reflected in sexual experience, hence so much attraction. When greater samadhis start to happen, the attraction will disappear by itself.\nThe friend has asked that getting absorbed in meditation, I... BECOME ONE WITH THE FLOW WITHIN. BUT WHEN SEX OVERTAKES ME, I WANT TO DROWN IN THAT JUST AS MUCH...\nDrown! There is no need to stop. Just remain a witness as you go on drowning. Go on observing\nthat you are going under. Go on observing that sex has encircled you. In fact the word sex brings condemnation into the mind. Think of it this way: a kind of godliness has encircled, this divine energy has encircled, this divine nature has encircled, the divine maya has encircled. But don’t use the word sex – the old associations connected with the word are wrong – they make it appear like sin. Then it will be difficult to remain a witness – either you will become unconscious or you will control. To be a witness is neither to go unconscious nor to control – it is to stand firm between these two. On this side you fall in a ditch, on the other you fall in the well – remain in between, master this, then samadhi.\nBoth are easy: it is perfectly easy to go unconscious in sex, to completely forget what is going on, to get intoxicated is easy. To control sex, to force it to stop, to prevent yourself is also easy. But in both you miss. The one who indulges misses, the celibate misses too. The real brahmacharya happens when you stand in the middle between these two, then you are only watching. Then you will find that sex arises in the body and reverberates in the body; in the mind a shadow briefly falls and departs. You remain standing far away. How can sexual desire be in you? How can any desire be in you? You are nothing but the observer.\nAnd it usually happens that when meditation starts going well, sexual desire becomes stronger. Understand this because it happens to most people. When meditation is going well, when you start relaxing into the rhythm of your life, tension is less, then the suppression you have been forcing on sex for many lives will be gone. Then the repressed desire will arise like a volcano. Hence if sexual desire increases with meditation, don’t worry, it is a good sign, indicating that meditation is progressing well. Meditation is doing good work. Meditation is getting rid of your tensions, removing your control, getting rid of your repressions. Meditation is taking you towards your naturalness.\nFirst meditation will make you natural and then it will bring you to godliness. Because it is impossible to bring what is not yet natural, to its deeper nature. What is not yet natural, cannot reach the divine. So meditation first brings you to nature, then brings you to the divine. Nature is god’s outer covering. If you are not in tune with it, how can you be in tune with the innermost godliness? Nature is the steps of the temple. If you don’t climb the steps, then how will you enter into the inner sanctum of the temple?\nIf you can understand what I am saying then don’t suppress any more. Now quietly accept it. What this existence shows to you will be good. Existence is presenting it, so it must be good. Neither control, nor become the one who decides, nor stand back saying this is good and that is bad – I want to do this and don’t want to do that. You simply observe.\nA life is descending like the sun, the candle of desires too is melting down, slowly slowly the fire is burning itself out. Longings are settling down, the floods are ebbing to a stop, passion is ebbing to a stop, the reign of silence is deepening, the fire is burning itself out.\nIt is going well. But before the fire goes out it will flare up one last time. You can ask the physicians – before dying a man becomes completely healthy for a little while. All symptoms disappear. One who was lying on the bed like a corpse sits up, opens his eyes and looks fresh. A little before dying all symptoms disappear because life is making its last leap, life energy comes up once again.\nYou have seen how an earthen lamp when it is going out flares up one last time. As the last oil burns\nout, it drinks the last drop of oil and flares up. It is its last burst of flame. Before the dawn you have seen how dark the night is. It is the last burst of darkness.\nIt is the same when you go deep in meditation, you will find when the fire is about to go out, then the last burst of flameSex energy arises.\nA life is descending like the sun, the candle of desires too is melting down...\n... the lamp of desires is melting, life is going out.\n... slowly slowly the fire is burning itself out. Longings are cooling down, the floods are ebbing to a stopthe flow of life is stopping.\n... passion is ebbing to a stop, the reign of silence is deepening.the juiciness of meditation is\nincreasing. – the juiciness of silence is deepening.\nthe reign of silence is deepening, the fire is burning itself out.\nIn this state a burst of flame will flare up at any moment. Such a blaze is flaring up in you. Observe it. Do not suppress it, otherwise it will move into you again. You are very close to getting free of it, don’t suppress it, otherwise the bondage will start again. What has been suppressed will flare up again and again. Whatever you have forced down will come again and again. Let it go, let it come out, let it flow out.\nHowever high it flares up, you go on watching peacefully. It will not interfere with your meditation.\nYou continue witnessing. The fifth question Question 5\n:YOU SAID DON’T FALL INTO ANY BONDAGE, BE AT PEACE AND HAPPY. IS NOT SANNYAS ALSO BONDAGE? AND ARE NOT METHODS, DEVICES AND PRACTICE ALSO BONDAGE? PLEASE EXPLAIN.\nIf you have understood, then don’t ask. If you ask then you have not understood. If you have understood not to get into any bondage and to be at peace and happy, then just by understanding you will become happy and at peace. Then where did this question come from? Do serene and happy people ask questions? All questions arise from discomfort, from suffering, from misery. If you are still asking questions, then you are not yet at peace, you will need sannyas initiation. If you become serene then what need is there of sannyas? You have become a sannyasin! But don’t deceive yourself. If you don’t have the courage to take sannyas, don’t use Ashtavakra as an excuse. Yes, if you have attained peace there is no need for sannyas. It is in search of peace that one takes sannyas.\nIf you have become happy, if you think you have become happy, if you have become as worthy as Janak, then the matter is finished. But then this question would not have arisen. Janak did not ask questions, Janak said, “Amazing, master! Then I am liberated! It is surprising how I had fallen under the spell of maya until right now!” If you are ready like Janak you would say, “I am blessed! Then I am liberated! How had I fallen under the spell of maya until right now!” You wouldn’t be asking this question.\nThe truth is, you have the desire to take sannyas in your mind, but not the courage. Listening to Ashtavakra you thought, it is good to know that sannyas is bondage, now there is no need to get into it. Will you drop your other bondages or only the bondage of sannyas? And you are not yet a sannyasi – there is no way to drop what you don’t even have. What other enslavements will you drop? Will you leave your wife? Your home? Your money? Your power? Your mind? The doer? Will you drop your ego? What else will you drop from what you actually have? Certainly it is possible for you to drop what you have. Let sannyasins ask this question, those that have become sannyasins. You have not yet taken sannyas. It would be understandable if a sannyasin asked if now he should drop sannyas. He has sannyas, you don’t have sannyas. How will you drop what you don’t have? Ask about what you do have. Ask whether you should renounce your house and home.\nHearing everything that Ashtavakra is saying, is this all you could understand, that sannyas initiation is bondage? Is nothing else is bondage?\nMan is cunning. The mind is deceptive. The mind is very calculative. It says, “If I can extract the meaning I want it is very good, then I can avoid trouble. I was very hesitant about taking it, it is good I have met Ashtavakra on the way. He has explained well, he has put me right, now there is no need to make the mistake of taking sannyas.”\nWill you learn anything else from Ashtavakra?\nPeople come to me saying, “Shall we drop meditation now? – because Ashtavakra says there is bondage in meditation.” Will you drop wealth, will you drop power? Or only meditation...! And meditation hasn’t happened yet, but you will drop it? If meditation has happened and you ask, shall I drop it, I will say drop it. But one who is meditating will never ask about dropping, he is beyond dropping and holding onto. He will understand Ashtavakra, he will be blissful, filled with joy. He will say, “Great, it is absolutely true. In meditation meditation itself is dropping away. In sannyas bondages are dropping by themselves. Sannyas is no bondage. It is only a device for dropping all bondage. In the end it too will drop.”\nUnderstand it like this. You get a thorn in your foot, then you use another thorn as a needle to take the first one out. The second thorn is also a thorn, but it is useful in removing the first thorn. Then you throw both of them away. You don’t keep the second thorn thinking it has done a great kindness in removing the first thorn. Or thinking how very loving it is, you don’t put the second thorn back into the same place where the first thorn was stuck!\nSannyas is a needle. The thorn of the world is stuck in you, this is a way to take it out. If you can pull it out without a needle, that’s even better. What could be more auspicious than your understanding Ashtavakra? Then there would be no need for sannyas. But make sure you aren’t deceiving yourself! If it is deception, then be courageous and jump into sannyas. And that moment will also come, when you will be worthy of dropping sannyas too.\nBut what is there to drop? When you understand, then there is nothing to drop – everything has fallen away. This is what Janak has said, “O Lord, this body has also dropped.” Janak is still in the body, the body hasn’t fallen away, but Janak says, “This body has also dropped! This whole world has dropped! Everything has dropped! I am completely unattached, beyond emotions! What great skill in your teaching! What an art! Nothing has happened, I have not left the palace, not left the world, not left the body – and I have left everything!”\nThe day you understand it, there is nothing to drop – not the world and not sannyas. The very idea of dropping comes only to the man who thinks there is something to hold onto.\nRenunciation is just a shadow of indulgence. The renunciate is a worldly person standing on his head. When the world goes, renunciation also goes. These two live together and leave together. This is why you see the worldly at the feet of the renunciates! They are together. The renunciate does half the job, the worldly does the other half – they are joined together. The worldly cannot live without the renunciate, the renunciate cannot live without the worldly. Have you seen this conspiracy!\nA man came to me, saying I want to learn to meditate. He was a sannyasi – an old fashioned sannyasi. So I said, “Good, come to the morning meditation.”\nHe said, “That is a little difficult.”\nI said, “Why, what’s difficult in that?”\nHe said, “The difficulty is, I cannot come without this man who has come with me, because he keeps the money, I don’t touch money. He has to go somewhere else in the morning, so I won’t be able to come tomorrow morning.”\nThis is just hilarious! If you need money, what difference does it make whether it is in your pocket or in someone else’s? And this becomes another bondage – the one who keeps the money in his pocket is better off than you, at least he can go wherever he wants. It is a peculiar situation: unless this man comes along, you cannot come because you need to have money for the taxi – but you don’t touch money! So you are having this man sin for you? Commit your own sins. This is great fun – you will ride in the taxi and he will go to hell for it! Have a little compassion on him. This is the great connection of the worldly and the yogi!\nAll your renunciates live bound to worldly people. And your worldly people also live bound to renunciates, because they touch the feet of the renunciates thinking, “Today I am not a renunciate, but at least I touch the feet of one. I get some satisfaction of having done something! If not today, then tomorrow I too will become a renunciate. But right now I worship him.”\nIf you ask Jainas where they are going they say they are going to serve the sadhu. Serving him they think, it is gain – earning some merit. There the sadhu sits, looking down the road to see when the worldly is coming. Here the worldly are looking, when will the sadhu come to town. Worldly and sadhus, two sides of the same coin.\nThink a little. If the worldly quit going to the sadhus, how many sadhus will there be? They will all start running away. Who will organize, who will make arrangements? They will all go. But the worldly go on taking care of the sadhus, the sadhus go on taking care of the worldly. It is mutual.\nThe real wise man can be neither a renunciate nor indulgent. He knows only that I am the witness. Now what difference does it make whether the money is in his pocket or in someone else’s pocket? He is the witness. ... if it is, he is a witness; if it is not, he is a witness. Poor, he is a witness; rich he is a witness. In witnessing what difference is there between poverty and wealth? Do you think that if a beggar becomes a witness, that his witnessing will be a little less, and an emperor becomes a witness, his witnessing will be a little more? Can witnessing ever be less or more? Poor or rich, healthy or unhealthy, well-read or illiterate, beautiful or ugly, famous or infamous – it makes no difference. Witnessing is a treasure that is equal inside everyone, there is no less or more to it.\nWe can be a witness of every circumstance – success, failure; respect, disrespect.\nBe a witness, this is all Ashtavakra is saying. But if you find it is difficult to be a witness and you want to use some method, then use a method, don’t be afraid. Continuing to use the method will help you become capable of becoming the witness of the method too. This is why I say, meditate, and don’t worry about it. Because I know, not meditating you will never come to witnessing, not meditating you will only continue thinking. So the choice is not between meditation and witnessing, the choice is between thinking and meditation.\nDo you understand what I am saying? If you don’t meditate – you have heard Ashtavakra – Ashtavakra said that meditation and methods are bondage (and he is absolutely right, one hundred percent correct!) so you quit meditating. What will you do? Will you become a witness now? You will go on repeating the same old rotten thoughts. It is so hilarious: because of Ashtavakra you have fallen deeper into the world. This ladder is for you to climb up. You have started using it to descend. The same steps!\nI tell you to meditate. Because the alternatives before you are meditation and thinking: right now witnessing is not an alternative for you. Yes, if you continue to meditate your thoughts will be finished, a new choice will present itself. Now you can choose: witnessing or meditation? Then you can choose witnessing, and meditation can be dropped.\nBut if you decide not to take sannyas now you will remain indulgent. The choice is between sannyas and the world now. I say take sannyas now. And one day the moment will come when the choice is no longer between the world and sannyas. The world is gone, sannyas remains. Then the choice is between ultimate sannyas and sannyas. Then I will tell you, forget about sannyas, now merge yourself into ultimate sannyas. Yes, if you can go immediately, like Janak, then I am not going to object! Be joyous! Be happy! If you can’t then no one else can decide. If you are not able to be happy, you will have to decide what you need to do.\nYou can turn truth into untruth, and you can even turn flowers into thorns – it all depends on you.\nDon’t run eyes closed in the sunlight, my naive heart! The routes are all unknown. On the way you meet thorns and rocks. Just smelling a delicate fragrance, don’t believe there are only flowers.\nRemember, take your steps carefully. The step you take shouldn’t be chosen just by the sweetness of a delicate fragrance.\nOn the way you meet thorns and rocks. Just smelling a delicate fragrance, don’t believe there are only flowers.\nWhen a delicate fragrance comes to you, be careful that it is not just your projection. That it is not just your greed. That it is not just your fear. That it is not just your weakness that your are projecting. And don’t be led astray by that sweet soft smell.\nIt appears very easy – not to do anything. It seems easy when you hear it, but when you come to doing ‘not doing anything’, then there is nothing harder. Hearing about witnessing it seems so simple, that there is nothing to do, you only have to watch. When you come to do it you will find, “Oh! This is tremendously hard!”\nTry this: sit down with your watch in front of you. The second hand makes its round in one minute. Look at the second hand, witness it’s movement and try to go on witnessing it. You will find it moves two to four seconds – and the witness is gone! Some other thought has come. You forgot. You will be shocked that the second hand has slipped on ahead. Then you will be a witness for two to four seconds, and forget again. In completing one minute you will lose it two, four or ten times. You cannot remain a witness for even one minute, so there is no question now of the witness. Now you can choose thinking or meditation. Then eventually choosing between meditation and witnessing will become possible.\nYou ask about sannyas, sannyas is only feeling that you want to be with me. It is not a commitment. You are not bound to me. I do not give you any discipline. I give no rules of conduct. I don’t tell you when to get up, what to eat, what to drink; what to do, what not to do. I only tell you to be a witness. I only tell you my hand is available, take my hand in yours. Perhaps taking a few steps with me, you will also catch my disease. This disease is contagious. Move a little distance with Buddha and you will be dyed a little by his color. You won’t be able to prevent it. A little of his fragrance will begin to emanate from you too. If you pass through a garden, the fragrance of the flowers gets into your clothes – even if you didn’t touch the flowers!\nSannyas is showing a little courage to move with me, having a feeling to be with me. It is falling in love with me. The whole idea behind this love is that I am making arrangements for you to be free. Move with me, I want to give you the fragrance of liberation.\nI am a puppet of breath. I am tied to old age. And to death I am given over. But there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I have been liberated. The club of time eternal, a weight impossible to bear, is balanced by one fun-filled childlike moment.\nWhat are you?\nI am a puppet of breath. I am tied to old age. And to death I am given over.\nBirth and death, this is all that you are. Breath comes in and goes out and in between there is a brief tale, a short drama. If there is anything here that can take you beyond death and birth –\nBut there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I have been liberated. If love happens between life and death...\nSannyas means to fall in love with me, nothing more than this. This is enough, this is the definition. If you are in love with me and are ready to move with me a little way, then moving that little way will take you a great distance.\nAnd everything else is superficial: changing the color of your clothes, wearing the mala. These are only to awaken courage and to help you remember your being. These are only outer beginnings, then much happens inside. Those you see dyed in these orange clothes, don’t look only at their clothes, take a look into their hearts too – there you will find a new stream of love beginning to arise.\nBut there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I have been liberated.\nLet me rain over you. Even if you are stone right now, don’t worry, this stream of water will cut through your rock.\nWhen the ray of light showered on me, I said, “I am as hard as diamond, a stone eternal.”\nThe ray said, “Is it so? You are the very one I have been searching for. I will create a temple out of you. From your interiority I will carve a statue of light.” Dumbfounded. The ray cuddled me in her deep love.\nWhen the ray of light showered on me, I said, “I am as hard as diamond, a stone eternal.”\nYou also say this to me, “No, you cannot change us, we are stone, very ancient, we have taken a vow not to be transformed.”\nBut I say unto you:\nThe ray said, “Is it so? You are the very one I have been searching for. I will create a temple out of you. From your interiority I will carve a statue of light.” Dumbfounded. The ray cuddled me in her deep love.\nThese orange clothes are only an indication of my love – of your love towards me, of my love towards you. This is a love tie.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 6\nO SWEET BELOVED, ACCEPT MY GRATITUDE. GIVE THESE TEARS THEIR DESTINATION. YOU HAVE FILLED THIS BEGGING BOWL, BUT STILL I AM AS EMPTY AS EVER, BLANK UNWRITTEN. OH SWEET BELOVED – OUR FRIEND – THIS HEAD, LIKE THE FRUIT FOR OFFERING, IS AT YOUR FEET.\nJaya has asked.\nJaya has been close to me for many years. She has a heart exactly like that of Meera. In her heart a song just like Meera’s is waiting. In her heart a dance just like Meera’s is hidden. When it appears, she will manifest her greatness, then another Meera will appear: an awaiting for the right moment, any time the ray of light will descend and chase away the darkness. And she is courageous – this is why a prediction can be made that it will happen.\nBut is it not this very mist the ongoing gift in which your cloudlike compassion is showering day and night. Once in a while a shadow glanced. The ultimate language. Possible name. Abode of compassion. This seed mantra, this basic thread, this the only measure of depth, this our grateful bowing down. How deep is thy mist covered cistern – how tiny are our hands.\nFacing the divine our hands always appear small! The cup of our palms is so small. How deep is thy mist covered cistern – how tiny are our hands.\nWhoever has love in their heart, always feels how small his hands are. Jaya has asked:\nQuestion 7\nO SWEET BELOVED, ACCEPT MY GRATITUDE. GIVE THESE TEARS THEIR DESTINATION. YOU HAVE FILLED THIS BEGGING BOWL, BUT STILL I AM AS EMPTY AS EVER, BLANK UNWRITTEN.\nThis is a filling such that one becomes more and more empty. This is a filling of emptiness. This is filling up with emptiness. My effort is to make you blank. If you have become blank then I have succeeded. If you remain full then I have failed. When you become absolutely blank and nothing more remains inside of you – no trace, no word, no rubbish – in this emptiness the divine manifests.\nI want to say to Jaya:\nGo, o soul go, virgin girl, become a bride, His companion. Now that great void is thy only path and destination. Protector of grains and water, lord of light and religion. He alone will make you joyous, thrilled. O, soul! You are chosen. O united one. O wedded one thy wedding with the great void is celebrated.\n“... thy wedding with the great void is celebrated.” This being empty, this being blank – is to celebrate your wedding with the great silence. Dancing, letting that ecstasy manifest, singing, ecstatic – you have to lose yourself!\nThere is only one way of being – disappearing. The moment you become totally empty, immediately the divine descends in its totality. You are the only barrier. So don’t be afraid! When you become blank, you have achieved all.\nA story from Maharashtra: once Eknath wrote a letter to Nivrittinath. He sent blank paper, nothing written on it. Nivrittinath read it very thoroughly – a blank sheet of paper with nothing to read on it. He really got into it, reading it again, and again, and again! Muktibai was sitting nearby, he gave it to her and she read it. Her tears started flowing! She was completely gone! Other people were present, they started saying, “This is sheer madness! First, Eknath is mad sending a blank sheet of paper. A letter means to write something! Then this Nivrittinath is mad that he is reading it, not just once but time and again. Then strangest of all, this Muktibai, she is completely gone and her tears start flowing!”\nAll scriptures are blank paper! And if you learn how to read blank paper, then you know how to read all scriptures – Vedas, Koran, Guru Granth, Gita, Upanishads, Bible, Dhammapada. One who can read blank paper achieves everything.\nMy whole effort here, is that you become like blank sheets. I am trying to obliterate you, because you are the only barrier.\nO beloved soul, young girl naive and virgin thy wedding with the great void is celebrated.

publication. It is for reference use only.] The first question</p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>IT FEELS TO ME THAT MY BODY IS LIKE A CAGE OR BOTTLE, IN WHICH A VERY
POWERFUL LION IS IMPRISONED AND HE HAS BEEN SLEEPING THERE FOR MANY
LIVES, BUT NOW HE HAS BEEN AWAKENED BY YOUR HARASSMENT. HE IS HUNGRY AND
VERY IMPATIENT TO BE FREED FROM THE CAGE. MANY TIMES DURING THE DAY HE
BECOMES ENRAGED AND ROARS, HE LEAPS UP ROARING. EVERY CELL OF MY BODY
TREMBLES FROM THIS ROARING AND LEAPING UP, AND THE FOREHEAD AND UPPER
PART OF THE HEAD BEGIN TO BURST WITH ENERGY. AFTER THIS I FALL DEEP INTO
AN EXTRAORDINARY INTOXICATION AND ECSTASY. THEN THE LION BECOMES A
LITTLE QUIET, SHAKES, WALKS SLOWLY AND GOES ON GROWLING. AND THEN IN
KIRTAN OR IN REMEMBERING YOU HE DANCES ECSTATICALLY. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT
IS GOING ON?</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga Chinmaya has asked.</p><p><br></p><p>... what is happening is good. It is happening just as it should.
Don’t be frightened by it. Let it happen. Help it in every way. A unique
process has begun, whose final crescendo is liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>We are certainly imprisoned in the body – a lion locked up in a cage.
Confined for such a long time that the lion has forgotten his own roar.
Confined for such a long time that the lion has started thinking the
cage is his home. No only this, he has started thinking, “I am the cage.
I am the body!”</p><p><br></p><p>A hit is needed. That’s why you are with me, so I can hit – and you
wake up.</p><p>These words that I say to you are not mere words. Think of them as
arrows. They will pierce you. Sometimes you will be angry with me too.
Because everything was moving along peacefully, comfortably and suddenly
there is confusion. But there is no other way to wake you up, you will
have to pass through pain.</p><p><br></p><p>When energy rises within, the body will not be able to bear it. The
body has not been made to endure it. The capacity of the body is very
small. The energy is vast. As if one wants to enclose the whole sky in a
small courtyard... so when the energy awakens many disturbances will
arise in the body. The head will be splitting with pain.</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes it happens that even after enlightenment disturbances
continue in the body. It is completely natural before enlightenment,
because the body is not ready. It is as if you put one thousand candles
of electricity into an electric line that has the capacity to carry one
hundred candles – it will rattle and catch fire! It is just the same
when the energy which had been sound asleep within you awakens – it
manifests and your body is not ready for it. Your body is ready to
accept your being a beggar, it cannot accept your being an emperor. The
body has limits, you have no limits.</p><p>... it will be jolted, storms will arise. Before enlightenment
happens, before samadhi, these shocks are completely natural. And
sometimes it happens that samadhi happens and the shocks continue
coming, the storms continue, because the body was not able to get
ready.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what happened in Krishnamurti’s case. The process continued
forty years after attaining the ultimate. The body could not absorb the
shock. Krishnamurti will wake up in the middle of the night shouting and
screaming. He starts to growl – really growling. And for forty years he
has had a headache that doesn’t go away, it comes and goes but it never
totally leaves him. Sometimes the pain is so strong that it feels his
head will burst.</p><p><br></p><p>From the standpoint of the body, these last forty years have been
years of great difficulty for Krishnamurti. Sometimes it happens this
way. But usually the body becomes ready as samadhi happens. But with
Krishnamurti the body could not adjust because samadhi had been forced.
The thinkers that brought Krishnamurti up, those Theosophists worked
hard, made untiring efforts to bring on samadhi. Their aspiration was to
give birth to a world teacher. The world needs it – if a Buddha can be
incarnated.…</p><p><br></p><p>If Krishnamurti had worked only by his own efforts, perhaps he would
have needed one or two more births. But then this problem would not have
arisen. The worked was forced: what needed two lifetimes to happen,
happened instantly. It happened but the body could not get ready. It
happened suddenly when the body was not ready. So there have been forty
years of physical suffering. Even now Krishnamurti growls at night and
wakes up again and again from his sleep. The energy won’t let him sleep.
He screams!</p><p><br></p><p>It seems amazing that a person who has achieved the ultimate should
scream at night. But the cause is clear. An enlightenment that should
have taken two lifetimes to happen, was forced too quickly. Because of
this the body was not ready and the process continues. It has happened
but this process continues. He has reached home but the body remains
behind, still being dragged along. The being has reached home, the body
has not reached. The pain and suffering of this dragging continues.</p><p>Don’t be frightened by what’s happening. These are the first
indications of samadhi, the first steps of samadhi. Take them as
auspicious, accept them happily. If you are ready to accept them as
blessings, then very soon they will slowly become quiet. And as soon as
the body begins to accept, begins to cooperate, the readiness and
capacity of the body increase.</p><p><br></p><p>You have called out to the infinite, so you will have to become
infinite. You have challenged the vastness, so you will have to become
vast.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very unique story in the Old Testament – the story of
Jacob. Jacob was seeking god. He distributed all his wealth. He sent all
his beloved friends, his wife, his children, his servants – he sent them
all far away. He was waiting for god on the deserted bank of a river.
God arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was very strange – Jacob started wrestling with god. Does
anyone wrestle with god? But Jacob started struggling with god. It is
said that they fought the whole night. As morning approached, as dawn
was about to come Jacob was defeated. When god was about to leave him,
Jacob fell at god’s feet and said, “Please give me your blessing.”</p><p><br></p><p>God said, “What is your name?” Jacob told him his name.</p><p>God said, “Today you have become Israel” – the name that the Jews are
known by – “From today on you are Israel. Now you are no longer Jacob,
Jacob has died.” – just as I change your name when I give you sannyas
initiation. The old is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>God told Jacob: “Jacob has died, from now on you are Israel.”</p><p><br></p><p>This story is from the Old Testament. There is no other story of
someone fighting with god. But there is a great truth in this story.
When that ultimate energy descends, what happens is almost like a fight.
And when the ultimate experience happens and you are defeated by the
divine and the body is vanquished and you accept defeat – then your
final initiation happens. In that moment divine blessings shower on you.
Then you are new. That is when you taste the nectar of the eternal for
the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga Chinmaya is almost there where Jacob must have been. It is
difficult to say how long the night may be. It is hard to say how long
the struggle will last. No prediction can be made. But this struggle is
auspicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Cooperate with this energy. This lion inside that wants freedom – it
is you. This energy that wants to rise towards the head, that wants to
go from the sex center to the crown chakra, that wants to create a path
– it is you. For many lives it has been subdued and lying coiled up, now
it is starting to raise its hood. You are fortunate, you are lucky. With
this you are approaching the final blessing. Your real transformation
will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti has written in his notebook, whenever my head is
splitting, when at night I cannot sleep and the screaming and shouting
come and something inside me growls – after all this is over a unique
experience comes. After this a great peace descends. Blessings shower in
every direction. Everywhere lotuses and more lotuses are blooming.</p><p>Exactly this is starting to happen to Chinmaya. It is good.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER THIS I FALL DEEP INTO AN EXTRAORDINARY INTOXICATION AND
ECSTASY.</p><p><br></p><p>When the energy arises after it has had its struggle, and the body
becomes a little ready, then a new ecstasy will come: there is growth.
You have come up a little. You have transcended a little. You have come
out of the prison a little, you have found open sky. You will be
fulfilled. You will dance, you will dance for joy.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE LION BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET, SHAKES, WALKS SLOWLY AND GOES
ON GROWLING. AND THEN IN KIRTAN OR IN REMEMBERING YOU HE DANCES
ECSTATICALLY.</p><p><br></p><p>The lion wants to dance. There isn’t room enough to dance in the
body. More space is needed for dancing – what space is available in the
body? Dance can only happen outside of the body. This is why if you
dance totally you will find you no longer remain a body. In the ultimate
grace of dance, at the ultimate height, you are out of the body. The
body goes on turning, goes on moving rhythmically but you are outside,
you are no longer inside.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I have invariably included dance in my methods of
meditation, because there is nothing more miraculous for meditation than
dancing. If you dance fully, it you dance totally, then in that dance
your being comes out of the body. The body will go on moving in rhythm
but you will experience that you are out of the body. And then your real
dance begins: below, the body will go on dancing; above, you will dance.
The body on the earth, you in the sky! The body in the earthly, you in
the celestial. The body will dance the dance of matter, you will dance
the dance of consciousness. You will become nataraj, the king of the
dance.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask, “PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON?</p><p><br></p><p>The unprecedented is happening, the wondrous is happening, the rare
is happening! What is happening is not to be explained, it is to be
experienced. Whatever I say will not help you understand this
experience, at the most it can help you become capable of accepting it
more easily. Accept it with joy. Do not repress it.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally the idea will come to suppress it thinking, “What madness
is this, I am growling like a lion? What is this roaring? People will
think I am mad!”</p><p><br></p><p>So naturally the idea will come to suppress it, to hide it – don’t
let anyone know. What will they say?</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t worry. Don’t bother about what anyone says. If people say you
are mad, then go mad! Has anyone become enlightened without going mad?
Give your attention to your interiority. If bliss is coming from this,
if ecstasy is coming, if wine is raining then don’t worry. This world
has nothing so valuable as this to give to you. So don’t make any
compromise with the world. Don’t sell an inch of your being, even if in
exchange you will get the whole universe as your kingdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has said, what use is it if you gain the whole world but lose
your own soul? If you save your soul, even if you lose the whole world
you have everything.</p><p>Have courage, be daring. Let your trust, your faith in yourself grow.
Soon your body will start gradually accepting it. Then the roaring will
disappear. Then only dance will remain. Then the lion will not suffer,
because the lion will have found a path: when he wants to go out he can
go out, when he wants to come in he can come in. Then this body is no
longer a jail, then this body becomes a place to relax. When you want to
come in, come inside; when you want to go out, go outside.</p><p><br></p><p>When you can go out and in as easily as you come and go from your
house... it is cool, you feel cold, you go outside and sit in the
sunshine. Then the sunshine increases, the sun climbs high, it starts
getting hot, you start sweating – you get up and come in. Just as you
come and go from your house, then the house is not a prison – if you are
sitting in prison you don’t have the possibility to come out or go in
whenever your heart feels like it. In jail you are a prisoner, at home
you are a master. When your lion can dance outside, can fly in the sky,
can play with the moon and stars – then there is no problem. Then there
is no fight with the body. Then the body is a place for relaxation. When
you get tired you can return inside and rest. Then there is no enmity
with the body either. Then the body is a temple.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH US, AND WHEN WE TAKE
SANNYAS WE ALSO START BEING WITH YOU. I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY MOMENT WHEN
I TOOK SANNYAS: NEITHER WHEN, NOR WHERE. YOU JUST GAVE IT. EVEN NOW HAVE
I COME NEAR YOU? I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SANNYAS THEN, NOR DO I
KNOW ANYTHING NOW. MASTER, HOW CAN I BECOME A REAL SANNYASIN? HOW CAN I
COME CLOSER TO YOU? WHAT WORTHINESS DO I HAVE? WHAT TRUST AND SURRENDER
HAVE I GOT?</p><p><br></p><p>It has happened many times that I have given initiation to people who
have no idea about sannyas. I have given sannyas to those who have not
come to take sannyas. I have initiated those who have never thought of
sannyas even in their wildest dreams. Because I don’t look only at your
mind, I look at the many things repressed in your unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Last night a young woman came. I didn’t even ask her. I said to her,
“Close your eyes and take sannyas.” I didn’t even ask if she wants to
take sannyas. She closed her eyes and accepted initiation. Ordinarily
one would be surprised if asked to take sannyas and want to think it
over. Some people think of taking sannyas for months, for years. Some
have kept on thinking about it and died before taking it. She graciously
received it. On a conscious level she doesn’t know anything about
it.</p><p><br></p><p>But we are not new here – we are very ancient! This girl has been
seeking for many lives. She carries treasures of meditation. Just seeing
this treasure I said, “Close your eyes and go inside.” I told her, “I am
not going to ask you whether you want to take sannyas or not. There is
no need to ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave Dayal sannyas in the same way. This question is from Dayal. I
didn’t ask Dayal, Dayal also didn’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you know about yourself! You don’t know where you came from.
You don’t know about the treasures you have gathered. You don’t know
what you have been doing these many many lives.</p><p>You don’t know what you have found in your search and what remains
incomplete. Every time death has come and rubbed out everything that you
have done. There are many among you who have taken sannyas many times –
every time death came and erased everything. And you don’t have the
ability to recall it.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand it like this, you had been creating something... you had
been painting a picture, when death came and it remained incomplete.
Death came and you forgot. You were born again. Then even if you get a
message about that incomplete painting – even if that incomplete
painting is put in front of you, you won’t remember. Because in this
life you had never even thought of yourself as a painter And if I tell
you, “Finish the painting, it has been left incomplete, you had made it
with great hopes, you had created it with a very deep thirst – now just
go ahead and finish it. Death had come in between and it was left
incomplete.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will say, “I don’t know anything, you can have me take up the
brush but I don’t even know how to hold it. You can put the colors in
front of me and I will paint but I don’t know anything about how to
paint.” Still, I tell you to start, and just by starting the memory will
come. Just take the brush in your hand and perhaps you will be
reminded.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the Second World War, a soldier was wounded and fell.
He lost his memory. He had received a blow to the head. His memory cells
got messed up. He forgot. He forgot – even his own name. He forgot who
he was. And he was unconscious when he was taken from the battlefield.
His identification had fallen off somewhere, his number too had fallen.
It was a great problem. When he came to his senses he didn’t know his
number, he didn’t know his name, he didn’t know his rank. The
psychologists worked hard. They tried in every way to remind him but
couldn’t find out anything. The man had gone completely blank. As if all
connection with his memory had suddenly broken off. Someone suggested
that now there was only one way: have him taken all around England. He
was a soldier in the British army. If he was taken around England,
perhaps when he came near his own village he would remember.</p><p>So he was taken around England on the trains. Two men took him
around. The train stopped at every station and they brought him down. He
stood and stared. They got tired. England is a small country, so it
wasn’t very difficult to take him everywhere. In the end at a very small
station where the train didn’t usually stop, but for some reason it did
this time, the man got off, read the sign on the station and said, “This
is my village!” He began to run. He forgot that there were two men with
him. The two men began running after him. He ran out of the station and
into the village<span class=s4></span>he</p><p>remembered everything. He remembered the lanes and paths. He didn’t
even ask anyone. Passing through the lanes and bypaths he arrived in
front of his house. He said, “Oh! This is my house, this is my name.
This is my name plate hanging here.” He remembered everything. Just one
hit and his whole memory came back again. Forgetfulness disappeared, the
memory cells came back together again.</p><p>So sometimes I give sannyas as I gave it to Dayal in the hope that if
I send you around in orange clothes, perhaps you will remember that you
have previously moved in orange clothes too. If I say: “Dance!” Perhaps
while you are dancing, one day you will arrive at that psychological
space, where you will remember your dancing of past lives. I say,
“Meditate.” While you are meditating perhaps some door in the
unconscious will open and a flood of memories will come.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I go on speaking – sometimes on the Geeta, sometimes on
Ashtavakra, sometimes</p><p>on Zarathustra, sometimes on Buddha, sometimes on Jesus, sometimes on
Krishna – who knows which words will stir your heart. Who knows which
words will become a key to your inner depths. Who knows which words will
awaken you from your slumber. I go on trying everything. My effort is
simply to create a continuity, a harmony, a connectivity with what
deaths have broken and scattered. With this continuity your destiny will
start unfolding in front of you. Many times you have made the house, it
was abandoned again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Dayal is right, I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY MOMENT WHEN I TOOK
SANNYAS... He didn’t take it, I gave it.</p><p><br></p><p>... NEITHER WHEN NOR WHERE. YOU JUST GAVE IT. EVEN NOW HAVE I COME
NEAR YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>You will come near me, when you reach yourself. There is no other way
to come near me. Reach yourself and you have reached me. Know yourself
and you have known me. You don’t need to make any outer pilgrimage
towards me – descend deeper and deeper within.</p><p><br></p><p>I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SANNYAS THEN, NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING
NOW.</p><p><br></p><p>... it will happen, soon you will know. I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ...
THEN, NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING NOW. – this is true. But this attitude is
good where you think, where you know, that you don’t know. Unfortunate
are they who don’t know but think they know. You are in the right state.
This is the attitude of the innocent mind, “I don’t know.” You are
empty, you can be filled. There are some who don’t know anything – and
their number is vast – but they think they know. Through this wrong
idea, they miss even what they could have known.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge prevents – prevents you from real knowing. If you know that
you are ignorant, then you are moving in the right direction. The
ultimate happens only in such innocence of mind. To know that I don’t
know, is the first step towards knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT WORTHINESS DO I HAVE? WHAT TRUST AND SURRENDER HAVE I GOT?</p><p><br></p><p>This feeling arises in a worthy person’s heart, “What worthiness do I
have?” The unworthy think, “Who is as worthy as I am?”</p><p><br></p><p>This feeling of humility itself is worthiness, that what do I
deserve, what surrender, what trust do I have? This is the indication of
trust. The seed is present, one just needs to wait: at the appropriate
time, in the appropriate season, it will sprout, the transformation will
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>And this journey is a rare journey. This journey is a journey of the
unknown, of the unknowable.</p><p><br></p><p>This hiding behind the veils of continuing silence. It is in vain
that now I have become one who knows the secret.</p><p><br></p><p>In the madness of you I lost my peace. In your pain I have become a
flame filled with joy.</p><p>In the hands of time I have been so bent that I who was once an
arrow, have now become a bow. No companion, no guide for this journey.
What path is this I have set out on?</p><p>I have found great joy in self-oblivion. Being lost, I have become
the very beacon of the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>This goal is such that it is reached by losing yourself. As long as
you exist, you will not arrive, when you disappear you reach.</p><p><br></p><p>I have found great joy in self-oblivion.</p><p><br></p><p>... when you are not, when your ego has gone, when self-forgetfulness
comes...</p><p><br></p><p>I have found great joy in self-oblivion. Being lost, I have become
the very beacon of the goal. As I have disappeared, I have arrived.</p><p>This path is the path of obliteration.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you feel, ‘Where is my worthiness to surrender,’ you have
started to be effaced, self-oblivion is arising. If you feel that WHAT
TRUST... HAVE I GOT? then self-effacement starts coming, you start being
obliterated.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas means to be obliterated, so existence can be. No companion,
no guide for this journey.</p><p>This is a journey of great aloneness.</p><p><br></p><p>No companion, no guide for this journey.</p><p><br></p><p>There isn’t any companion, no one to guide the path. Finally, the
master too has to be dropped, because there is no space. Kabir says,
“The path of love is very narrow, there two can never pass!” Where is
space enough that three can exist? Not even two can exist. The disciple,
the master, the divine; they are three! There, not even two can exist.
There, the master is dropped, you also are dropped. There, only the
divine remains.</p><p><br></p><p>No companion, no guide for this journey. What is this path I have set
out on?</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is a very unknown journey. A journey of great courage, of
great daring! Those who are ready to accept the risk of going into the
unknown – it is for them. It is not for the clever, those who calculate
everything. It is not mathematics, it is a leap of love.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID THAT, “YOU ARE LIBERATED HERE AND NOW, THIS VERY MOMENT.”
BUT HOW CAN I GET FREE OF THIS “I”?</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask ‘how’ you have missed. You didn’t get it. This is
Ashtavakra’s whole message: practicing... ‘How’ means practicing. ‘How’
means by what method, by which rites and rituals. If you ask ‘how’</p><p>you have missed. Then you cannot understand Ashtavakra. Then you
should go knock on Patanjali’s door: he will tell you ‘how.’ If you are
insistent upon this ‘how,’ then Patanjali will be your path. He will
tell you to do outer discipline, inner discipline, control, breath
control, turning inwards, concentration, meditation, samadhi. He will
make it so extensive that even you will say: “O Maharaj, make it a
little less. Tell me some easy method. This is too long, it will take
many lives.”</p><p><br></p><p>Most yogis are only practicing outer discipline. They never reach
even to inner discipline. Most yogis die still trying to master asanas –
yoga postures. Where is concentration, where is meditation? There are so
many yoga postures it seems impossible to ever complete the training in
them. At the very most those who seek deeply reach to concentration. And
the real happening can occur only in samadhi. And even samadhi Patanjali
divides in two: samadhi with distinctions and samadhi without
differentiation. He goes on dividing, he goes on making more and more
steps. He makes steps all the way from the earth to the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>If ‘how’, if practicing, appeals to you, then ask Patanjali. Even
though in the end Patanjali also says drop everything, enough of this
‘doing’. But there are some people that cannot stop doing, so they will
have to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Think of it like this: there is a child in the house making noise and
causing mischief. You tell him, “Sit quietly,” but even if he sits, he
will be bubbling over. His hands and feet will wriggle, his head will
shake – he wants to do something, he is bursting with energy. This is no
way to get him to sit still. It is dangerous. There can be an explosion.
This way he is going to do something or other. It is better you tell
him, “Go and run around the house seven times.” Then he will come back
huffing and puffing and sit quietly on his own. You won’t even have to
say be quiet. He will sit quietly on the very chair that he could not
sit quietly on before.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali is for those who cannot become quiet directly. He says,
“Run seven rounds. Run long and hard. Distort and twist your body, stand
on your head, do this, do that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Doing these practices finally you will ask one day, “O Maharaj, I am
tired of this doing!”</p><p><br></p><p>He will say, “You should have said so in the very beginning, then
both of us would have been saved from all this botheration. Now go and
sit quietly!”</p><p><br></p><p>Man wants to do. Because without doing – it just doesn’t fit your
logic that anything can happen without doing. Ashtavakra is beyond your
logic. Ashtavakra says you are liberated! But you still misunderstand.
You say, ...”YOU ARE LIBERATED HERE AND NOW, THIS VERY MOMENT.” BUT HOW
CAN I GET FREE OF THIS “I”?</p><p><br></p><p>Ashtavakra says that ‘how’ exists when one thinks he is unfree. First
you have accepted that you are bound: “Now how can I get free?”
Ashtavakra says there are no chains – only the illusion of chains. But
you will still say, “How can I get free of this illusion?” You still
don’t get it. Illusion means that which is not: free of what? Just
watching, just being wakeful – you are free.</p><p><br></p><p>If you get involved in methods, you will be in great difficulty.
Every method proves false, and finally life itself proves too short.</p><p>If you get stuck in methods you will find that not just this life but
many lives are not enough. Methods are many. Life after life you have
gone on practicing them. You put faith in doing because doing inflates
your ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Ashtavakra is saying don’t do anything. The whole is the only doer.
What is happening is happening, just become one with it. Don’t even ask:
“How to get free of this I?” If this ‘I’ is happening let it happen, who
are you to try to get free of it? You can also accept it: good, if this
is happening, then this is what is happening. You didn’t create it. Do
you remember having created it? You didn’t cast its mould. You didn’t
bring it. How will you drop what you didn’t bring? How will you destroy
what you didn’t cast? You ask, “What can we do?” You have two eyes and a
nose, you also have an ego. You have received all of these. Nothing is
in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever exists is good. If ‘I’ exists, that too is good. Don’t
complain even a little about it. In this attitude of no complaint, in
this total acceptance, you will suddenly find the ‘I’ is gone! Because
the ‘I’ is created from doing. When you do something the ‘I’ is
created.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are asking something new, “How can I destroy this ‘I’?” The
one who destroys will become the ‘I’. You will not be able to escape.
This is why a humble man also has an ego – and sometimes it is bigger
than in an egoist.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen the ego of the humble? He says. “I am just the dust at
your feet.” But look into his eyes – what is it he is saying? If you
say, “You are absolutely right, I knew already that you are just the
dust at my feet,” then he will start fighting. He is not saying it for
you to agree with it. He is saying it so you will say, “You are such a
humble man... you are very kind to give us your darshan.” He is saying
it so you will refute it saying, “You and dust at my feet? No, you are
pure gold. You are the very spire of the temple.” The more you say high,
he will say no, just the dust. But when he says he is the dust, if you
agree, “You are absolutely right, everyone thinks that you are just the
dust at their feet,” then he will never even look at you again. It was
not humility – it was ego in a new color, ego dressed in new clothes,
ego dressed in humility.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you try to drop the ‘I’, the one who is dropping it will create
a new ‘I’. Man goes on changing costumes. The clothes change but you
remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand what Ashtavakra is saying. Don’t be too quick to
ask what to do, how to get rid of this ego. Don’t be in a hurry to do.
Relax and take a little time to understand. Ashtavakra is saying,
“Understand how this ‘I’ is created – it is created by doing, it is
created from striving and effort, it is created from success. So
wherever you make efforts, it will be created. Then one thing becomes
clear that if you want to be free of ego, then don’t make efforts, don’t
try. Accept whatever is, just like it is. In this acceptance you will
find the ego has disappeared as if it had never existed, because the
element that was giving it energy has slipped out, the foundation has
fallen down so the house cannot stand long.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the feeling of being the doer falls away, then all of life’s
diseases fall away. Otherwise there are many traps in life. Running
after money is also the running of the doer. Running after power is also
the running of the doer. Running after fame is also the running of the
doer. You want to show something to the world.</p><p>Many people come to me saying, “Tell us a way to show something to
this world.” What is it you want to show? They say, “No, it’s just we
want to make a name for ourselves. We will be going but our name should
remain behind!” What’s the use of your name remaining? No one else is
interested in your name. When you yourself are gone who is going to
bother? When you couldn’t be saved from death, will your name be saved
from dying? You cannot be kept alive, how can this name which is only an
indication be saved? Who bothers about your name? And so what if your
name does remain? It will be hidden away in some old books, it will be
grieving there. Alexander’s name, Napoleon’s name – so what?</p><p><br></p><p>But no, we have been taught these diseases since childhood. Since
childhood we have been told, “Do something before you die. Don’t die
without doing anything. If you can, do something good, if not, do
something bad, but make a name for yourself.” People say, “So what if
you get a bad name, at least your name is known. If you don’t find the
right way, then do something crazy, but make a name for yourself!”</p><p><br></p><p>People are so crazy that they go to the mountains and inscribe their
names in stone. They go visit an ancient castle and scribble their name
on the walls. And the man writing his name doesn’t see that he is
rubbing out another name to write his: someone else will come and rub
his out and write over it. You have erased someone else’s, you are
writing over the top of others writing – and in big letters. If someone
else comes they will write in even bigger letters. What madness have you
fallen into?</p><p><br></p><p>Many are the frivolous longings woven by snares of dream, many are
the trampled down passions arisen with a brilliance.</p><p><br></p><p>The joy of beauty, love’s drunkenness, the greatness of name, the
pride of wealth, for man on this earth many are the spread out snares of
illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Each to his own destiny and each to his own nature, many are those
trampled by happiness, many are those made rich by sorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Many are the famines that have passed, but when have such hard times
come?.</p><p><br></p><p>Treasure of the heart is found little, though treasure is found
aplenty. Many are the wealthy I saw whose hearts were paupers.</p><p><br></p><p>How many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness? The
world of consciousness is one, the nether worlds of unconsciousness are
many.</p><p><br></p><p>“How many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness?” This
is our unconscious, in it so many scenes are hidden – scene after scene,
curtains behind curtains, stories within stories! This is our
unconscious, there are so many hells hidden in it – of wealth, of power,
of fame, of dreams – the snares are set!</p><p><br></p><p>How many scenes are latent in the depths of unconsciousness? The
world of consciousness is one, the nether worlds of unconsciousness are
many.</p><p><br></p><p>But one who becomes aware, his world is one, his nature is one, his
being is one, his flavor is one!</p><p>Buddha has said, “Wherever you taste the ocean it is salty – likewise
if you taste me I am everywhere fully conscious. I have only one flavor:
consciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>This same is the flavor of Ashtavakra. Not the doer, not the one who
enjoys and suffers – the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t ask ‘how’? Because with how the doer comes in, the enjoyer
comes in – then you miss, you miss Ashtavakra’s message. Ashtavakra is
saying, “Whatever is, observe it. Be a witness. Just watch. If there is
ego then watch ego. What else to do? Only watch – and by watching the
transformation happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>Do you understand? It is a little subtle, but not so subtle that you
can’t understand it. It is straight forward also. Ashtavakra is saying
just observe and when you observe the doer disappears, only the witness
remains. With the doer gone everything that got energy from the doer,
got strength from it will fall away. Without the doer how can one run
after money, run after power? Without the doer where is the ego? These
will all fall away by themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Master just one thing – the witness. There is nothing else to be
done. Everything else happens by itself. Everything else goes on and on,
always. Why should you uselessly get in the way?</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, an elephant was crossing over a bridge. The bridge
started shaking under his weight. A fly was sitting on his trunk. When
they both got to the other side, the fly said, “Son! We really shook
that bridge.”</p><p><br></p><p>The elephant said, “Sweetie, until you spoke I didn’t even know you
existed.”</p><p><br></p><p>You think you are shaking the bridge but it is not you who is shaking
the bridge, it is life energy. You are like a fly that sits on top of
life energy and says, “Son! Look how I have shaken it!”</p><p><br></p><p>This ego is just sitting on top of you. Everything is happening from
your limitless energy. It is the energy of existence, you don’t have
anything to do with it. This same breathes in you, awakens in you,
sleeps in you. You stand proudly in between. This much is certain, it
doesn’t take objection to your pride. At least the elephant objected.
The elephant said, “Sweetie, I didn’t even know you were sitting on top
of me.” At least the elephant said this much. Existence doesn’t even say
this much. Existence is silent. If you stand proudly, it lets you. If
you lay claim to its work, it lets you. If you say you are doing what
you have not done, then too it doesn’t intrude and say, “No, I am doing
it.” It has no I, how can it tell you I am doing it? So illusion goes on
and on.</p><p><br></p><p>But look closely, open your eyes a little and see: you are not doing
anything. Everything is happening by itself!</p><p><br></p><p>This is the incomparable concept of destiny, the unparalleled concept
of fate: everything is happening by itself. Wrong people have given it
incorrect meanings. Otherwise fate means merely... If you understand the
idea of fate rightly, you will remain a witness and there will be
nothing else to do. But people don’t become a witness of fate, they
become lazy. They don’t become non-doers, they become idlers.</p><p>There is a difference between non-doing and idleness. Idleness is
lazy, indolent, dead. Non-doing is full of energy – one doesn’t think I
am doing: “... existence is doing! I am only watching. This play is
going on, I am observing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is very tricky. He uses even the most beautiful truths in the
ugliest way. Fate is a very beautiful truth. It means that everything
goes on by itself, you are not doing anything. All is destined. What
will be, will be. What is to be, is. What was to happen, has happened.
You can sit quietly on the bank and watch the play. There is no need for
you to jump into the middle of it. Your running back and forth doesn’t
make any difference. What is to happen is happening. What will be, will
be. Then you become a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of fate was devised to take you towards witnessing. People
have not gone towards witnessing. People sit idling. They say, “When
what is to be is happening, then good, why should we do anything? Fate
means we have no power to do, why should we do?” Before they said they
will show the world, now they say, there is nothing in doing! But the
feeling of the doer hasn’t gone, it remains standing in the same
place.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand Ashtavakra, then there is no method, there is no
practice: Ashtavakra says practice is bondage, methods are bondage,
doing itself is bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>THROUGH YOUR GRACE I CAN SEE THE SKY. I EXPERIENCE LIGHT AND BECOME
ONE WITH THE INNER CURRENT ALSO. BUT WHEN SEX OVERTAKES ME, I WANT TO
DROWN IN THAT JUST AS MUCH AS IN MEDITATION. PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS
CONDITION OF MINE?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: be a witness of sex too. Don’t be the controller of
it. Don’t try to forcibly bring it under control, remain a witness of it
too. Just as you are a witness of everything else, remain a witness of
sex too.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult, because you have been taught for centuries that sex
is sin. That concept of sin has been fixed in your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Sin does not exist in this universe – there is only godliness. Drop
that idea. In this universe there is only one – it pervades all – it is
godliness. It is in the tiniest of the tiny, in the most vast of the
vast. It is in the lowest, in the highest. It is in sex, it is in
samadhi too. There is no sin here.</p><p><br></p><p>This does not mean that I am suggesting that you remain stuck in sex.
I am only saying: understand it too as a form of godliness. There are
other forms. Perhaps the first level of his forms is sex. And there is a
small taste of samadhi reflected in sexual experience, hence so much
attraction. When greater samadhis start to happen, the attraction will
disappear by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>The friend has asked that getting absorbed in meditation, I... BECOME
ONE WITH THE FLOW WITHIN. BUT WHEN SEX OVERTAKES ME, I WANT TO DROWN IN
THAT JUST AS MUCH...</p><p>Drown! There is no need to stop. Just remain a witness as you go on
drowning. Go on observing</p><p>that you are going under. Go on observing that sex has encircled you.
In fact the word sex brings condemnation into the mind. Think of it this
way: a kind of godliness has encircled, this divine energy has
encircled, this divine nature has encircled, the divine maya has
encircled. But don’t use the word sex – the old associations connected
with the word are wrong – they make it appear like sin. Then it will be
difficult to remain a witness – either you will become unconscious or
you will control. To be a witness is neither to go unconscious nor to
control – it is to stand firm between these two. On this side you fall
in a ditch, on the other you fall in the well – remain in between,
master this, then samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>Both are easy: it is perfectly easy to go unconscious in sex, to
completely forget what is going on, to get intoxicated is easy. To
control sex, to force it to stop, to prevent yourself is also easy. But
in both you miss. The one who indulges misses, the celibate misses too.
The real brahmacharya happens when you stand in the middle between these
two, then you are only watching. Then you will find that sex arises in
the body and reverberates in the body; in the mind a shadow briefly
falls and departs. You remain standing far away. How can sexual desire
be in you? How can any desire be in you? You are nothing but the
observer.</p><p><br></p><p>And it usually happens that when meditation starts going well, sexual
desire becomes stronger. Understand this because it happens to most
people. When meditation is going well, when you start relaxing into the
rhythm of your life, tension is less, then the suppression you have been
forcing on sex for many lives will be gone. Then the repressed desire
will arise like a volcano. Hence if sexual desire increases with
meditation, don’t worry, it is a good sign, indicating that meditation
is progressing well. Meditation is doing good work. Meditation is
getting rid of your tensions, removing your control, getting rid of your
repressions. Meditation is taking you towards your naturalness.</p><p><br></p><p>First meditation will make you natural and then it will bring you to
godliness. Because it is impossible to bring what is not yet natural, to
its deeper nature. What is not yet natural, cannot reach the divine. So
meditation first brings you to nature, then brings you to the divine.
Nature is god’s outer covering. If you are not in tune with it, how can
you be in tune with the innermost godliness? Nature is the steps of the
temple. If you don’t climb the steps, then how will you enter into the
inner sanctum of the temple?</p><p><br></p><p>If you can understand what I am saying then don’t suppress any more.
Now quietly accept it. What this existence shows to you will be good.
Existence is presenting it, so it must be good. Neither control, nor
become the one who decides, nor stand back saying this is good and that
is bad – I want to do this and don’t want to do that. You simply
observe.</p><p><br></p><p>A life is descending like the sun, the candle of desires too is
melting down, slowly slowly the fire is burning itself out. Longings are
settling down, the floods are ebbing to a stop, passion is ebbing to a
stop, the reign of silence is deepening, the fire is burning itself
out.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going well. But before the fire goes out it will flare up one
last time. You can ask the physicians – before dying a man becomes
completely healthy for a little while. All symptoms disappear. One who
was lying on the bed like a corpse sits up, opens his eyes and looks
fresh. A little before dying all symptoms disappear because life is
making its last leap, life energy comes up once again.</p><p><br></p><p>You have seen how an earthen lamp when it is going out flares up one
last time. As the last oil burns</p><p>out, it drinks the last drop of oil and flares up. It is its last
burst of flame. Before the dawn you have seen how dark the night is. It
is the last burst of darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same when you go deep in meditation, you will find when the
fire is about to go out, then the last burst of flame<span class=s4></span>Sex energy arises.</p><p><br></p><p>A life is descending like the sun, the candle of desires too is
melting down...</p><p><br></p><p>... the lamp of desires is melting, life is going out.</p><p><br></p><p>... slowly slowly the fire is burning itself out. Longings are
cooling down, the floods are ebbing to a stop<span class=s4></span>the
flow of life is stopping.</p><p><br></p><p>... passion is ebbing to a stop, the reign of silence is
deepening.<span class=s4></span>the juiciness of meditation is</p><p>increasing. – the juiciness of silence is deepening.</p><p><br></p><p>the reign of silence is deepening, the fire is burning itself
out.</p><p><br></p><p>In this state a burst of flame will flare up at any moment. Such a
blaze is flaring up in you. Observe it. Do not suppress it, otherwise it
will move into you again. You are very close to getting free of it,
don’t suppress it, otherwise the bondage will start again. What has been
suppressed will flare up again and again. Whatever you have forced down
will come again and again. Let it go, let it come out, let it flow
out.</p><p><br></p><p>However high it flares up, you go on watching peacefully. It will not
interfere with your meditation.</p><p>You continue witnessing. The fifth question Question 5</p><p>:YOU SAID DON’T FALL INTO ANY BONDAGE, BE AT PEACE AND HAPPY. IS NOT
SANNYAS ALSO BONDAGE? AND ARE NOT METHODS, DEVICES AND PRACTICE ALSO
BONDAGE? PLEASE EXPLAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have understood, then don’t ask. If you ask then you have not
understood. If you have understood not to get into any bondage and to be
at peace and happy, then just by understanding you will become happy and
at peace. Then where did this question come from? Do serene and happy
people ask questions? All questions arise from discomfort, from
suffering, from misery. If you are still asking questions, then you are
not yet at peace, you will need sannyas initiation. If you become serene
then what need is there of sannyas? You have become a sannyasin! But
don’t deceive yourself. If you don’t have the courage to take sannyas,
don’t use Ashtavakra as an excuse. Yes, if you have attained peace there
is no need for sannyas. It is in search of peace that one takes
sannyas.</p><p>If you have become happy, if you think you have become happy, if you
have become as worthy as Janak, then the matter is finished. But then
this question would not have arisen. Janak did not ask questions, Janak
said, “Amazing, master! Then I am liberated! It is surprising how I had
fallen under the spell of maya until right now!” If you are ready like
Janak you would say, “I am blessed! Then I am liberated! How had I
fallen under the spell of maya until right now!” You wouldn’t be asking
this question.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is, you have the desire to take sannyas in your mind, but
not the courage. Listening to Ashtavakra you thought, it is good to know
that sannyas is bondage, now there is no need to get into it. Will you
drop your other bondages or only the bondage of sannyas? And you are not
yet a sannyasi – there is no way to drop what you don’t even have. What
other enslavements will you drop? Will you leave your wife? Your home?
Your money? Your power? Your mind? The doer? Will you drop your ego?
What else will you drop from what you actually have? Certainly it is
possible for you to drop what you have. Let sannyasins ask this
question, those that have become sannyasins. You have not yet taken
sannyas. It would be understandable if a sannyasin asked if now he
should drop sannyas. He has sannyas, you don’t have sannyas. How will
you drop what you don’t have? Ask about what you do have. Ask whether
you should renounce your house and home.</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing everything that Ashtavakra is saying, is this all you could
understand, that sannyas initiation is bondage? Is nothing else is
bondage?</p><p><br></p><p>Man is cunning. The mind is deceptive. The mind is very calculative.
It says, “If I can extract the meaning I want it is very good, then I
can avoid trouble. I was very hesitant about taking it, it is good I
have met Ashtavakra on the way. He has explained well, he has put me
right, now there is no need to make the mistake of taking sannyas.”</p><p><br></p><p>Will you learn anything else from Ashtavakra?</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me saying, “Shall we drop meditation now? – because
Ashtavakra says there is bondage in meditation.” Will you drop wealth,
will you drop power? Or only meditation...! And meditation hasn’t
happened yet, but you will drop it? If meditation has happened and you
ask, shall I drop it, I will say drop it. But one who is meditating will
never ask about dropping, he is beyond dropping and holding onto. He
will understand Ashtavakra, he will be blissful, filled with joy. He
will say, “Great, it is absolutely true. In meditation meditation itself
is dropping away. In sannyas bondages are dropping by themselves.
Sannyas is no bondage. It is only a device for dropping all bondage. In
the end it too will drop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Understand it like this. You get a thorn in your foot, then you use
another thorn as a needle to take the first one out. The second thorn is
also a thorn, but it is useful in removing the first thorn. Then you
throw both of them away. You don’t keep the second thorn thinking it has
done a great kindness in removing the first thorn. Or thinking how very
loving it is, you don’t put the second thorn back into the same place
where the first thorn was stuck!</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is a needle. The thorn of the world is stuck in you, this is
a way to take it out. If you can pull it out without a needle, that’s
even better. What could be more auspicious than your understanding
Ashtavakra? Then there would be no need for sannyas. But make sure you
aren’t deceiving yourself! If it is deception, then be courageous and
jump into sannyas. And that moment will also come, when you will be
worthy of dropping sannyas too.</p><p>But what is there to drop? When you understand, then there is nothing
to drop – everything has fallen away. This is what Janak has said, “O
Lord, this body has also dropped.” Janak is still in the body, the body
hasn’t fallen away, but Janak says, “This body has also dropped! This
whole world has dropped! Everything has dropped! I am completely
unattached, beyond emotions! What great skill in your teaching! What an
art! Nothing has happened, I have not left the palace, not left the
world, not left the body – and I have left everything!”</p><p><br></p><p>The day you understand it, there is nothing to drop – not the world
and not sannyas. The very idea of dropping comes only to the man who
thinks there is something to hold onto.</p><p><br></p><p>Renunciation is just a shadow of indulgence. The renunciate is a
worldly person standing on his head. When the world goes, renunciation
also goes. These two live together and leave together. This is why you
see the worldly at the feet of the renunciates! They are together. The
renunciate does half the job, the worldly does the other half – they are
joined together. The worldly cannot live without the renunciate, the
renunciate cannot live without the worldly. Have you seen this
conspiracy!</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to me, saying I want to learn to meditate. He was a
sannyasi – an old fashioned sannyasi. So I said, “Good, come to the
morning meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is a little difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Why, what’s difficult in that?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The difficulty is, I cannot come without this man who has
come with me, because he keeps the money, I don’t touch money. He has to
go somewhere else in the morning, so I won’t be able to come tomorrow
morning.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is just hilarious! If you need money, what difference does it
make whether it is in your pocket or in someone else’s? And this becomes
another bondage – the one who keeps the money in his pocket is better
off than you, at least he can go wherever he wants. It is a peculiar
situation: unless this man comes along, you cannot come because you need
to have money for the taxi – but you don’t touch money! So you are
having this man sin for you? Commit your own sins. This is great fun –
you will ride in the taxi and he will go to hell for it! Have a little
compassion on him. This is the great connection of the worldly and the
yogi!</p><p><br></p><p>All your renunciates live bound to worldly people. And your worldly
people also live bound to renunciates, because they touch the feet of
the renunciates thinking, “Today I am not a renunciate, but at least I
touch the feet of one. I get some satisfaction of having done something!
If not today, then tomorrow I too will become a renunciate. But right
now I worship him.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask Jainas where they are going they say they are going to
serve the sadhu. Serving him they think, it is gain – earning some
merit. There the sadhu sits, looking down the road to see when the
worldly is coming. Here the worldly are looking, when will the sadhu
come to town. Worldly and sadhus, two sides of the same coin.</p><p><br></p><p>Think a little. If the worldly quit going to the sadhus, how many
sadhus will there be? They will all start running away. Who will
organize, who will make arrangements? They will all go. But the worldly
go on taking care of the sadhus, the sadhus go on taking care of the
worldly. It is mutual.</p><p>The real wise man can be neither a renunciate nor indulgent. He knows
only that I am the witness. Now what difference does it make whether the
money is in his pocket or in someone else’s pocket? He is the witness.
... if it is, he is a witness; if it is not, he is a witness. Poor, he
is a witness; rich he is a witness. In witnessing what difference is
there between poverty and wealth? Do you think that if a beggar becomes
a witness, that his witnessing will be a little less, and an emperor
becomes a witness, his witnessing will be a little more? Can witnessing
ever be less or more? Poor or rich, healthy or unhealthy, well-read or
illiterate, beautiful or ugly, famous or infamous – it makes no
difference. Witnessing is a treasure that is equal inside everyone,
there is no less or more to it.</p><p><br></p><p>We can be a witness of every circumstance – success, failure;
respect, disrespect.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a witness, this is all Ashtavakra is saying. But if you find it is
difficult to be a witness and you want to use some method, then use a
method, don’t be afraid. Continuing to use the method will help you
become capable of becoming the witness of the method too. This is why I
say, meditate, and don’t worry about it. Because I know, not meditating
you will never come to witnessing, not meditating you will only continue
thinking. So the choice is not between meditation and witnessing, the
choice is between thinking and meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you understand what I am saying? If you don’t meditate – you have
heard Ashtavakra – Ashtavakra said that meditation and methods are
bondage (and he is absolutely right, one hundred percent correct!) so
you quit meditating. What will you do? Will you become a witness now?
You will go on repeating the same old rotten thoughts. It is so
hilarious: because of Ashtavakra you have fallen deeper into the world.
This ladder is for you to climb up. You have started using it to
descend. The same steps!</p><p><br></p><p>I tell you to meditate. Because the alternatives before you are
meditation and thinking: right now witnessing is not an alternative for
you. Yes, if you continue to meditate your thoughts will be finished, a
new choice will present itself. Now you can choose: witnessing or
meditation? Then you can choose witnessing, and meditation can be
dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you decide not to take sannyas now you will remain indulgent.
The choice is between sannyas and the world now. I say take sannyas now.
And one day the moment will come when the choice is no longer between
the world and sannyas. The world is gone, sannyas remains. Then the
choice is between ultimate sannyas and sannyas. Then I will tell you,
forget about sannyas, now merge yourself into ultimate sannyas. Yes, if
you can go immediately, like Janak, then I am not going to object! Be
joyous! Be happy! If you can’t then no one else can decide. If you are
not able to be happy, you will have to decide what you need to do.</p><p><br></p><p>You can turn truth into untruth, and you can even turn flowers into
thorns – it all depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t run eyes closed in the sunlight, my naive heart! The routes are
all unknown. On the way you meet thorns and rocks. Just smelling a
delicate fragrance, don’t believe there are only flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, take your steps carefully. The step you take shouldn’t be
chosen just by the sweetness of a delicate fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way you meet thorns and rocks. Just smelling a delicate
fragrance, don’t believe there are only flowers.</p><p>When a delicate fragrance comes to you, be careful that it is not
just your projection. That it is not just your greed. That it is not
just your fear. That it is not just your weakness that your are
projecting. And don’t be led astray by that sweet soft smell.</p><p>It appears very easy – not to do anything. It seems easy when you
hear it, but when you come to doing ‘not doing anything’, then there is
nothing harder. Hearing about witnessing it seems so simple, that there
is nothing to do, you only have to watch. When you come to do it you
will find, “Oh! This is tremendously hard!”</p><p>Try this: sit down with your watch in front of you. The second hand
makes its round in one minute. Look at the second hand, witness it’s
movement and try to go on witnessing it. You will find it moves two to
four seconds – and the witness is gone! Some other thought has come. You
forgot. You will be shocked that the second hand has slipped on ahead.
Then you will be a witness for two to four seconds, and forget again. In
completing one minute you will lose it two, four or ten times. You
cannot remain a witness for even one minute, so there is no question now
of the witness. Now you can choose thinking or meditation. Then
eventually choosing between meditation and witnessing will become
possible.</p><p>You ask about sannyas, sannyas is only feeling that you want to be
with me. It is not a commitment. You are not bound to me. I do not give
you any discipline. I give no rules of conduct. I don’t tell you when to
get up, what to eat, what to drink; what to do, what not to do. I only
tell you to be a witness. I only tell you my hand is available, take my
hand in yours. Perhaps taking a few steps with me, you will also catch
my disease. This disease is contagious. Move a little distance with
Buddha and you will be dyed a little by his color. You won’t be able to
prevent it. A little of his fragrance will begin to emanate from you
too. If you pass through a garden, the fragrance of the flowers gets
into your clothes – even if you didn’t touch the flowers!</p><p>Sannyas is showing a little courage to move with me, having a feeling
to be with me. It is falling in love with me. The whole idea behind this
love is that I am making arrangements for you to be free. Move with me,
I want to give you the fragrance of liberation.</p><p>I am a puppet of breath. I am tied to old age. And to death I am
given over. But there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I
have been liberated. The club of time eternal, a weight impossible to
bear, is balanced by one fun-filled childlike moment.</p><p>What are you?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a puppet of breath. I am tied to old age. And to death I am
given over.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth and death, this is all that you are. Breath comes in and goes
out and in between there is a brief tale, a short drama. If there is
anything here that can take you beyond death and birth –</p><p>But there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I have been
liberated. If love happens between life and death...</p><p>Sannyas means to fall in love with me, nothing more than this. This
is enough, this is the definition. If you are in love with me and are
ready to move with me a little way, then moving that little way will
take you a great distance.</p><p>And everything else is superficial: changing the color of your
clothes, wearing the mala. These are only to awaken courage and to help
you remember your being. These are only outer beginnings, then much
happens inside. Those you see dyed in these orange clothes, don’t look
only at their clothes, take a look into their hearts too – there you
will find a new stream of love beginning to arise.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is this thing called love, you know! By him, I have been
liberated.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me rain over you. Even if you are stone right now, don’t worry,
this stream of water will cut through your rock.</p><p><br></p><p>When the ray of light showered on me, I said, “I am as hard as
diamond, a stone eternal.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ray said, “Is it so? You are the very one I have been searching
for. I will create a temple out of you. From your interiority I will
carve a statue of light.” Dumbfounded. The ray cuddled me in her deep
love.</p><p><br></p><p>When the ray of light showered on me, I said, “I am as hard as
diamond, a stone eternal.”</p><p><br></p><p>You also say this to me, “No, you cannot change us, we are stone,
very ancient, we have taken a vow not to be transformed.”</p><p><br></p><p>But I say unto you:</p><p><br></p><p>The ray said, “Is it so? You are the very one I have been searching
for. I will create a temple out of you. From your interiority I will
carve a statue of light.” Dumbfounded. The ray cuddled me in her deep
love.</p><p><br></p><p>These orange clothes are only an indication of my love – of your love
towards me, of my love towards you. This is a love tie.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>O SWEET BELOVED, ACCEPT MY GRATITUDE. GIVE THESE TEARS THEIR
DESTINATION. YOU HAVE FILLED THIS BEGGING BOWL, BUT STILL I AM AS EMPTY
AS EVER, BLANK UNWRITTEN. OH SWEET BELOVED – OUR FRIEND – THIS HEAD,
LIKE THE FRUIT FOR OFFERING, IS AT YOUR FEET.</p><p><br></p><p>Jaya has asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Jaya has been close to me for many years. She has a heart exactly
like that of Meera. In her heart a song just like Meera’s is waiting. In
her heart a dance just like Meera’s is hidden. When it appears, she will
manifest her greatness, then another Meera will appear: an awaiting for
the right moment, any time the ray of light will descend and chase away
the darkness. And she is courageous – this is why a prediction can be
made that it will happen.</p><p>But is it not this very mist the ongoing gift in which your cloudlike
compassion is showering day and night. Once in a while a shadow glanced.
The ultimate language. Possible name. Abode of compassion. This seed
mantra, this basic thread, this the only measure of depth, this our
grateful bowing down. How deep is thy mist covered cistern – how tiny
are our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Facing the divine our hands always appear small! The cup of our palms
is so small. How deep is thy mist covered cistern – how tiny are our
hands.</p><p>Whoever has love in their heart, always feels how small his hands
are. Jaya has asked:</p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>O SWEET BELOVED, ACCEPT MY GRATITUDE. GIVE THESE TEARS THEIR
DESTINATION. YOU HAVE FILLED THIS BEGGING BOWL, BUT STILL I AM AS EMPTY
AS EVER, BLANK UNWRITTEN.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a filling such that one becomes more and more empty. This is
a filling of emptiness. This is filling up with emptiness. My effort is
to make you blank. If you have become blank then I have succeeded. If
you remain full then I have failed. When you become absolutely blank and
nothing more remains inside of you – no trace, no word, no rubbish – in
this emptiness the divine manifests.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to say to Jaya:</p><p><br></p><p>Go, o soul go, virgin girl, become a bride, His companion. Now that
great void is thy only path and destination. Protector of grains and
water, lord of light and religion. He alone will make you joyous,
thrilled. O, soul! You are chosen. O united one. O wedded one thy
wedding with the great void is celebrated.</p><p><br></p><p>“... thy wedding with the great void is celebrated.” This being
empty, this being blank – is to celebrate your wedding with the great
silence. Dancing, letting that ecstasy manifest, singing, ecstatic – you
have to lose yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one way of being – disappearing. The moment you become
totally empty, immediately the divine descends in its totality. You are
the only barrier. So don’t be afraid! When you become blank, you have
achieved all.</p><p><br></p><p>A story from Maharashtra: once Eknath wrote a letter to Nivrittinath.
He sent blank paper, nothing written on it. Nivrittinath read it very
thoroughly – a blank sheet of paper with nothing to read on it. He
really got into it, reading it again, and again, and again! Muktibai was
sitting nearby, he gave it to her and she read it. Her tears started
flowing! She was completely gone! Other people were present, they
started saying, “This is sheer madness! First, Eknath is mad sending a
blank sheet of paper. A letter means to write something! Then this
Nivrittinath is mad that he is reading it, not just once but time and
again. Then strangest of all, this Muktibai, she is completely gone and
her tears start flowing!”</p><p>All scriptures are blank paper! And if you learn how to read blank
paper, then you know how to read all scriptures – Vedas, Koran, Guru
Granth, Gita, Upanishads, Bible, Dhammapada. One who can read blank
paper achieves everything.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort here, is that you become like blank sheets. I am
trying to obliterate you, because you are the only barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>O beloved soul, young girl naive and virgin thy wedding with the
great void is celebrated. Hari Om Tat Sat</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

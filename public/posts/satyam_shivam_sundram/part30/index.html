MY WANTING AND NEED FOR RECOGNITION ARE GONE ALONG WITH THE DOING. EVEN THOUGH DEEP INSIDE I AM TREMENDOUSLY THANKFUL AND HAPPY, I FIND PART OF MYSELF FEELING GUILTY. I SEE AS WELL THAT LAZINESS IS NOT ONE OF MY QUALITIES.\nBELOVED OSHO, I CAN’T FIND THE NEW WAY FOR ME TO BE TOTAL IN MY WORK. IT IS BECOMING VERY PAINFUL. CAN YOU PLEASE BRING SOME LIGHT AND GUIDANCE TO ME?\nAnand Candida, the new is always scary, for the simple reason that it is new; you don’t know how to face it. All your knowledge is suddenly found to be absolutely meaningless, because there is no answer in your experience and knowledge that can be an authentic response to the new.\nYou suddenly find yourself ignorant, helpless, not knowing what to do; hence the scariness. Otherwise, instead of being afraid you would have a totally different experience with the new. You will explode with joy. If you are an explorer, an adventurer, then the new will fill you with tremendous ecstasy, and you will see in this new a possibility for your intelligence to function.\nWith the old, the intelligence has no need to function. Your memory functions. You know the answer already; the answer is part of your memory system. But memory is not intelligence, remember.\nIntelligence is the capacity to rejoice in the new with openhearted welcome, with intense clarity. Just by watching the new, from your very innermost core will arise the response. That is the way of the meditator. The meditator is continuously confronted with the new. In fact, he is in search of the ultimate new, which will never become old, which will always be fresh.\nThat is the quality of satyam, shivam, sundram. Truth is never old; neither is the godliness that surrounds you from all dimensions, nor the experience of beauty. The roses may come and go, the expressions of beauty may come and disappear, but the experience of beauty is always there exactly the same.\nYou are asking, Candida, “Why is the new so scary?” ... Because you are still in the mind and you don’t know what meditation is.\nMind loves the old. With the old the mind is very at ease because it knows all the answers. It does not feel helpless, it does not feel that it has to choose this way or that way. It knows exactly what is the right answer. The mind never wants you to come in contact with the new; it keeps you going round and round with the old.\nMeditation is just the opposite of mind. As mind is confined to the old, meditation is an exploration of the expansion of the whole universe. The meditator wants to come each moment to the new, because only with the new does his intelligence become more sharp; only with the new does he himself become new. Only with the new is the way towards the ultimate.\nThe old is dead. Of course the old seems to be very comfortable. It seems comfortable because you don’t have to do anything. You don’t even have to be intelligent. You can remain retarded and yet pretend to the world that you are a great intellectual because your memory is filled with all kinds of information.\nThe memory is not part of your consciousness; the memory is part of your body. The memory is just a mechanism like any computer: you feed it with information and whatever you feed it, it is perfectly comfortable with. It knows it. And knowledge gives you a certain power. You are within the territory where you are the ruler, you know everything.\nThe unknown, the new, suddenly exposes your ignorance, and that hurts. You don’t want to know your ignorance; that’s why the new is scary. But your ignorance is enormous, your knowledge is just a dewdrop. If you don’t want to remain a dewdrop, closed, absolutely nonreceptive and insensitive to the tremendous existence that is available to be yours any moment, gather courage and come out of your smallness. The moment the dewdrop takes a jump into the ocean... that’s exactly the situation of a man who takes a jump from the mind into meditation.\nMind is so small. Existence, life, is so vast, so infinite that unless you come out of the mind you will live the life of a prisoner and a slave. A slave cannot know what dance is, a slave cannot know what freedom is and the joy of freedom and the blissfulness and the ecstasy of being vast, oceanic.\nMy work with you is to persuade you to come out of your caves, which are dark, although they look very cozy to you because you are acquainted with them.\nIt happened in the French Revolution... France had the greatest prison, the Bastille, where only prisoners were sent who were going to be there for their whole life. They could only enter there, they could never come out. Once a person entered there... it had only a door to enter, it had no exit.\nThere are only two places like this in the world, and strangely, both are prisons. One is a Catholic monastery in Europe where whoever enters, enters forever. There are still almost ten thousand monks in that monastery. They cannot come out again – at least not while they are alive. Dead, they are free to go out; in fact others will throw them out.\nAnd the other place, where prisoners were thrown in, was the Bastille. The Bastille had small caves for prisoners, thousands of caves, dark caves with no light. The prisoners were handcuffed, chained, and the keys of their chains and handcuffs were thrown into a well that was in the middle of the prison. They were never going to be opened, so what was the point of collecting thousands of keys unnecessarily? There was no point; those people would die, then their chains would be cut, not opened, so there was no need.\nIn the French Revolution, the revolutionaries immediately thought as a priority, to open the doors of the Bastille and allow thousands of prisoners their freedom. They were thinking that they were doing something great. They could not have expected the response of the prisoners – the prisoners refused. They said, “We have lived here, somebody twenty years, somebody else thirty years”\nThere were a few people who had lived there fifty, sixty, seventy years.\nNow a man who has lived there for seventy years must be nearabout a hundred years old. His whole life experience is confined to a small cave. He cannot come out of it; he is chained and tethered to the cave wall. He cannot even move out of the cave just to see the sky or the stars or the moon. Naturally, such a person will be afraid to go back into the world after seventy years.\nAlmost everybody he used to know must either be dead by nowor else, where is he going to find\nthem? Their names have faded away, their faces have faded away; a faraway seventy long years... And who knows if they will recognize him? If he cannot remember them, who is going to recognize him? – a man condemned to be in prison for life. And what will he do? From where will he get his food and his clothes, and where will he be sleeping? He will need a shelter too.\nNow it is almost a forgotten language to work, to earn, and at this age, old, sick, tattered, who is going to give him work or employment? Anyway, even ordinary prisoners who have been in prison for a few months don’t easily get any employment; who is going to trust a man who has been in jail seventy years? It is too risky.\nHere everything is comfortable. It may look uncomfortable to an outsider, but for the man who has lived in the cave for seventy yearsIt may have been uncomfortable in the beginning for a few days,\na few months, but man has a tremendous capacity of adaptability. In any situation, if you force him, he will start adapting to the situation.\nAnd seventy years – or even fifty years is a long time, half a century. Now he has started feeling perfectly cozy, comfortable, no worry about bread, no worry about tomorrow, no worry about anything. He has forgotten the names of his children, he has forgotten who used to be his wife, and what happened to all those people. No, he does not want to go out.\nThe revolutionaries could not believe it. “We are giving you freedom and you are as scared as if we are going to kill you.”\nAnd those prisoners said, “That’s exactly what we are feeling – that you are going to kill us. We are perfectly happy here. Just excuse us; we cannot fulfill your expectations, it is too late.”\nBut revolutionaries are stubborn people. They did not listen to the prisoners; they cut their chains, they cut their handcuffs, they forced them out with the same violence with which they had one day been forced in. Against their will they had been brought in; against their will they were brought out.\nMany of them could not even open their eyes because the light was too much. Their eyes had become too weak, too delicate, living in darkness; their eyes were no longer capable of opening in the sunlight. Many of them had forgotten how to walk. But the revolutionaries were adamant; they did not listen to their cries, their tears. Revolutionaries are revolutionaries; they forced them – almost three thousand prisoners – out of the Bastille.\nThere was nobody to receive them, and they moved around the city like dead people, almost like ghosts. They could not recognize anything. Seventy years before, things had been totally different. Nor they could see anybody who was contemporary to them. By the evening almost all of them had returned back to the prison. They fought the revolutionaries who were preventing them from getting into the prison.\nThey said, “We cannot live outside. Who is going to give us food? And who is going to take care of us, medical care, shelter, clothes? Who is going to be responsible for all this? – you?”\nAnd the most amazing thing they said was, “We cannot sleep without chains and without handcuffs. We have become so accustomed to them, it feels that something is missing. We cannot sleep – we tried in the day under some trees, but unless we feel the load, the weight of the chains on the feet, on the hands, we cannot sleep. So please don’t harass us. Life has harassed us enough; now at the end we don’t want to change our lifestyle.”\nFinally the revolutionaries also recognized their problem. They had not thought about this, that man becomes adapted to a certain situation, and then it is his territory. In that territory he is perfectly comfortable and cozy.\nMy own experience is... I have talked with beggars who had bank balances. I don’t have a bank balance; I never did. It just happened by chance that because I was continuously traveling I used to come to the railway station in Jabalpur at least ten or fifteen times a month, either going or coming.\nThere used to be an old beggar outside the railway station. Because the first day I had given him one rupee, he would not accept less than that, and he never asked more than that. So he had become adapted, I had become adapted; that one rupee I had to give him. In fact, if sometimes I came and I did not find the beggar, I would miss him. I would enquire, “Where is the old man?” We had become very friendly, and if sometimes I could not find him the next time I would give him two rupees – one for the time when I missed him, because it had been very heavy on me.\nOne day just as I was passing the station I saw him. I was not going out of town, but I was just driving by the railway station, going to meet the doctor of the railway employees at the railway\nhospital. There I suddenly saw in the corner the old man talking to a young boy, and that young boy was my student. I stopped my car and waited. When they were finished they were both shocked. The father was shocked... but I could not understand why. I said, “Why do you look so shocked?”\nThe father said, “I have been hiding it from everybody, but I cannot hide it from you. He is my son and he is your student, and I am preparing him to become at least a doctor.”\nI asked the boy, “You never told me that you are the son of a beggar.”\nHe said, “My father never allows me. He never meets me anywhere where people can see, because if people come to know I am the son of a beggar it will be difficult – difficult in the college, difficult for getting further admission into new colleges. It will become impossible, and my father will be exposed: he can educate his son to become a medical doctor and still he is continuing to beg. He brings me the best of clothes.…” I used to see him: of the whole class, he had the best clothes, the best shoes, everything the best.\nThat day I asked the old man, “How much bank balance do you have?”\nHe said, “Now I cannot hide it from you, and I trust that you will not expose the fact that he is my son. I have thirty thousand rupees in the bank.”\nI said, “With thirty thousand rupees you can start a shop, a small factory. Why do you go on begging in your old age?” He said, “Begging is so comfortable. Everything else can make me bankrupt, but begging can never make me bankrupt. And my earning is more than any shopkeeper or small factory owner. I earn nearabout fifty rupees per day” – even a doctor in India does not earn that much, nor a professor. And he said, “I have my customers, and why should I unnecessarily go into something new about which I don’t know anything? Begging is my heritage; my father was a beggar, my father’s father was a beggar, and they were all rich men.”\nFor the first time I became aware of a new dimension of human mind: it does not matter what condition you are in; slowly, slowly you settle down. And once you have settled down you don’t want even to budge, because then again you will have to start from ABC. Again you will have to start learning, again you will have to start facing problems. Right now there are no problems: you know all the answers to all the questions that can arise in a certain situation in which you have become completely enclosed.\nIt is cozy and it is comfortable to live in the old, but it will not bring the flowers of freedom and it will not open the whole sky for you to open your wings and fly. It will not allow you to have aspirations for the stars; it will not allow you to move in any direction or dimension. You will remain just like a dead grave where nothing moves.\nCandida, the new is scary, but the new is what I teach you. You will have to drop your fears, you will have to drop your ugly coziness, you will have to drop your small comforts. These are the things you have to pay for the greater joys, the higher realms of being, tremendous possibilities of ecstasies. You will not be a loser, but in the beginning you have to risk something.\nIt is good you are aware that the new makes you scared. For centuries man, animals, everybody has been living with the old. Only man has risen once in a while to have a glimpse of the new. Think\nabout buffaloes... can you conceive that at any time in the millions of years of evolution, buffaloes have eaten any other grass than they eat today? The same grass... can you conceive that one day buffaloes will be different? They are so settled, so utterly settled and so contented.\nYou cannot make a buffalo a buddha. They are perfectly at ease.\nWhy should they bother?\nThe whole animal kingdom is lower than man only for one reason, which is that man is an explorer; he has somewhere hidden in him the adventurer. His mind may be afraid, scared, but his consciousness wants to have communion with the universe, to touch the stars, to open up to all the beauties and the truth and the godliness of existence.\nYou will have to shift your emphasis from mind to meditation, and all fear will disappear. You will have to shift your attention from your comfortable, cozy, but old and dirty and rotten state towards something new, fresh, young – from the body to the consciousness, from mind to no-mind. Then every moment you are confronting the new.\nAnd one is thrilled with the new. Once you have learned that the new is not your enemy the fear simply disappears; on the contrary, you start searching for the new. The day you start searching for the new with joy and a dancing heart, you have become a sannyasin.\nThat is my definition of a sannyasin.\nI define my sannyasins from many dimensions; I want to give you the idea of sannyas from as many aspects as possible. The search for the new is one of the aspects of a seeker.\nYou are saying, “My wanting and need for recognition are gone, along with the doing. Even though deep inside I am tremendously thankful and happy, I find part of myself feeling guilty. I see as well that laziness is not one of my qualities. I can’t find the new way for me to be total in my work. It is becoming very painful.”\nCandida, all your problems are your creations. First, you should be immensely happy that the need for recognition is gone. That is a great achievement. You are no more dependent on others’ opinions; for the first time you are just yourself and you don’t need anybody to approve.\nThis is the beginning of the birth of individuality. Otherwise people are only cogs in the wheel; whatever others say they believe, even about themselves. All that they know about themselves is what others have said. They go on collecting all kinds of opinions and that’s what their self- knowledge consists of. It is a great experience that the need for recognition is gone. You should be happy with it rather than making some problem out of it.\nMind is very clever and very cunning. Even if you are feeling very ecstatic, mind will say beware, you may be just having a hallucination. And it will destroy your blissfulness – “My God! It is possible it may be just a hallucination!” When you are having pain the mind never says that – not in the whole history of mankind. When you are having a migraine the mind never says that it may be just illusory.\nBut if you are having a beautiful space within you, as if a rose is flowering, the mind is going to jump on it immediately: “You are daydreaming, this is all hallucination, illusion. You are being hypnotized.” And you immediately listen to the mind, because you have listened to it for centuries. It is just a habit.\nAlong with the recognition, you are saying, your doing has also gone. That’s an even greater achievement than the first. If the doing is gone, the doer must have gone also – but I suspect that’s where the problem is. Doing is gone but the doer is there: that is creating the tension. That is making you feel a part of yourself as guilty.\nWho is this part?\nIf doing is gone, nothing is wrong. In fact it is one of the basic fundamentals for enlightenment to happen that your doing should go. That does not mean that you will not do things; you will do things but they will not be fulfillments of your ego or projections of your mind. They will be spontaneous and you will rejoice in doing them, or vice versa: because you rejoice you do them.\nBut it seems the doer is still hiding somewhere within you. So a part has disappeared, but the other part is still there creating a feeling of guilt: to be lazy, not to do anything – this is not good. You should do something, you should not become a parasite. That doer goes on creating problems for you, anxiety for you.\nIf you have been able to let the recognition go, the doing go, release the doer also. But remember, that does not mean that you will become lazy. That is a wrong interpretation by the mind. Mind always interprets wrongly anything that is going to become a step leading beyond mind. When you feel let-go, mind will say, “This is laziness.” Mind is a great condemnor. It enjoys condemning others, it enjoys condemning you; its only joy is to condemn.\nYou are saying, “Even though deep inside I am tremendously thankful and happy, I find part of myself feeling guilty.” That part you have to become aware of and drop it.\nIf you can just drop so much, why carry this small part of being guilty? You have not done any wrong to anyone. You are just feeling guilty because the society brings you up with the idea to do something, be somebody; don’t remain a nobody, don’t become a good-for-nothing. Leave your footprints on the pages of history.\nWhat kind of stupidity is this? Why should I leave my footprints on the pages of history? – to torture the future children? And why should I be somebody special? Those are ego trips.\nMuch has disappeared, but something of the ego has remained which is making you guilty and which is calling you lazy. But this is not laziness; this is relaxation, let-go. And out of this let-go, out of this relaxation will grow new flowers. The difference is that laziness is barren, nothing grows out of it, it is a desert. So soon you will see the difference; just don’t cling to the word laziness. Drop it, it is a very negative and destructive word.\nI have never done anything in the eyes of the world. My family from the very beginning used to say to me, “You are going to be good for nothing” – and they proved right. I am good only for nothing. They were very much concerned, “How are you going to live your life? How are you going to manage?”\nAnd I always told them, “Don’t you be worried. If I am not worried, why should you be worried? Something or other will happen, don’t be worried.”\nBut they remained concerned, and they continually told me, “This is laziness, this is not good.”\nAnd I told them, “This is not laziness, it is my meditativeness. I am just simply being silent. And you will see: if it is laziness, you will find my life a desert where nothing grows. And if I am right and it is a let-go, then you will see that although it may not be visible to ordinary people, those who have eyes can see. Those who have ears can hear that my life has become a song, a dance, a celebration, so many flowers, and that I am so contented and so fulfilled.”\nI have not known for a single moment any feeling of guilt. Just learn the right language on the path of meditation. Your language belongs to the mind; when you change the track from mind to meditation you will have to change many words which mind uses but which are not applicable in the world of meditation. Call it let-go and suddenly you will feel a tremendous relaxation. Call it laziness and immediately some condemnation, some anxiety, something painful... Learn the new language, because you have chosen to be on the path in search of the new and the unknown.\nI am also against laziness. Laziness is simply dullness, it is stupidity. But let-go is the greatest quality a man can achieve. Relaxation is one of the most beautiful experiences, which can bring you so many gifts from the beyond that you are absolutely unaware of. Change the language.\nIf laziness is not one of your qualities, good. Let relaxation be one of your qualities. Relaxation, non- doing don’t disturb at all; just your life becomes more creative, rather than being more productive. Again, those two words make the difference.\nMind calls productivity activeness, and creativity is not counted. It takes time for authentic creativity to be realized. Just the other day, one of van Gogh’s paintings was sold for forty million dollars. A few months before, one of his paintings was sold for fourteen million dollars, and at that time it was said that was is the most one could imagine; no painting had fetched fourteen million – now what to say about forty?\nThis man lived in poverty, hungry, starving, because he could not sell a single painting. And he was not demanding forty million dollars; sometimes he was ready to give one painting just for one meal. Sometimes just for one cup of tea he was ready to give one of his paintings. But people were not willing, even for just a cup of tea: “We don’t have space, where will we put it? You just find someone else.” To them it was a problem, “Where to put it? – we don’t have space.”\nIt was when he was no more there, one hundred years after his death, that slowly, slowly the time for his recognition came. This is the case with almost every genius. Every genius comes, for absolutely unknown reasons, before his time. Why can’t these people wait a little? It is just that they arrive when their contemporaries are not here; by the time their contemporaries are here, they are gone, so they never know.\nDo you think Jesus will ever know how many Christians there are in the world now? Do you think Socrates will ever know that now his name is something for Greece to be proud of? – otherwise, without his name, Greece is nothing. It is his teachings and his disciples, Plato and Aristotle, that\nkept Greece at a peak of intelligence, because I don’t think anybody else in the whole of Europe has been able to transcend the sharpness of intelligence that Socrates had. Perhaps his contemporaries have not yet arrived, although twenty-five centuries have passed.\nWhen van Gogh’s paintings were recognized people started searching them out. He must have painted thousands of paintings and just went on giving them away – to friends, as gifts, or for a cup of tea or for a meal. People accepted his paintings just not to look crude, not to look uncivilized. They thought, “Once he is gone then we can put the painting in the basement. Nobody was hanging his paintings in their sitting rooms, because anybody looking at the paintings would think that this man had gone crazy: why is he putting up this painting?\nVan Gogh’s ideas looked crazy at the time, but his time came later. His whole family condemned him, saying, “You have not done a single thing and you are a parasite on your younger brother” – because his younger brother went on supporting him just enough so that he could survive.\nVan Gogh could not eat every day of the week; four days he was eating and three days he was fasting – one day eating, one day fasting, one day eating, one day fasting – because with whatever he could save from those three days, he would purchase colors, paints, canvasses, brushes for his painting. There was no other way.\nNobody has painted with such love and with such joy, with his own life and his own blood. He destroyed himself in painting. Now there is so much search going on in the basements of Holland and Italy where he lived; his paintings have been found in people’s basements, and now the prices of those paintings are unbelievable.\nThe last one was sold the day before yesterday for forty million dollars. When the painting was sold a few months ago the critics were saying, “This is the end; nobody can purchase any painting for a higher price than this.” He had set a record – fourteen million dollars. Before this, the record had been only three million dollars for somebody else’s painting. But this was a big jump, to fourteen million, and within three or four months another of his paintings went for forty million dollars – and I can conceive that the price of his paintings may go still higher.\nJust now two hundred more paintings have been found and those, too, not in good condition. Now, this man was one of the greatest creators the world has known, but he was not a doer, he was not a producer. If he had even had any skill – carpentry or shoemaking or tailoring – he would have earned enough and everybody would have respected him as a man who earns his living. But he was continuously condemned for being absolutely lazy, and nobody knew what he was doing.\nThe whole day would pass and he would forget completely about eating or even drinking water, he was so absorbed in his painting. Only when the night would descend and it would become difficult to see, then he would recognize that the day was gone. He was so poor he could not even manage to purchase a few candles; he used to paint outside his house sometimes in the night under the street lamp.\nHis brother must have been sensitive. He was young and certainly he understood something about paintings because he was working as a salesman in a shop where paintings and other pieces of art were sold. So he had a certain understanding, and he loved his brother, but what could he do? He himself was a poor man, somehow surviving, and more than that was not possible for him.\nBut one gift certainly he wanted to give to his brother – that he should not die before seeing at least one of his paintings sold. So somehow he collected some money and asked a friend, “Go and purchase a painting from my brother. I just want to give him the consolation that his life has not been absolutely futile; at least he sold one painting.”\nBut the man he had chosen had no sensitivity for paintings, so he simply went to van Gogh and said, “I would like to purchase a painting.”\nSo joyful, van Gogh said, “Come! I don’t have a big place, but I have many paintings.” The man said, “Any will do” – and that hurt van Gogh very much.\nHe said, “Any will do? You don’t want to see my paintings? You don’t want to choose?” He said, “It doesn’t matter, don’t waste my time. Any will do.”\nHe said, “Then I am not going to sell, and it is absolutely certain you have been sent by my brother. Just get out and get lost! – and tell my brother that this is not the way to console me. Now I am feeling more hurt and wounded than ever.”\nThen even his brother never tried again.\nCreativity happens in a state of let-go; productivity needs tension, anxiety, a doer, ego, recognition. Creativity needs no recognition, no ego, no doer – just the sheer joy of creating it.\nAt least van Gogh could show his paintings. I cannot even show my paintings. But you are my paintings.\nI have been creating in my own way something very invisible and subtle which cannot be shown and which cannot be sold, and nobody will ever know about it. It will not be recorded anywhere how many people were transformed, how many people changed their lives from the lowest to the highest peak of illumination. But nobody can say that I have been uncreative. Day and night I am working – but I am not a doer.\nOne of my friends had come from the Soviet Union and he shook hands with me and he said, “You should never go to the Soviet Union.”\nI said, “Why?”\n“Because anybody touching your hands will immediately shrink back.” I said, “But why?”\nHe said, “Because your hands are bourgeois, you have never done anything, and in the Soviet Union to be bourgeois is the worst condemnation. You need the proletariat’s hand, the laborer’s hand, rough.”\nI said, “My God, then first I will try – if I have to go to the Soviet Union – to make my hands as rough as I can.”\nThis is true that I have never done anything. But I am not lazy; I have never thought for a moment that I am lazy, although I have never done anything. Even if I am thirsty I trust somebody is going to appear; and somebody always has appeared, so there is no need to distrust in the future.\nIn America, when my bail was set at five hundred thousand dollars – that’s near about seventy-five lakh rupees – even the jailer who was taking me back to jail was worried. He said, “From where will it come? The figure is too big. In my whole life I have never seen or heard of anybody’s bail being set at five hundred thousand dollars. How are you going to manage? – and you look so relaxed and so cool.”\nI said, “I don’t bother about such things. Something will happen.” He said, “But how will it happen?”\nI said, “That I don’t know. How is not part of my language. It will happen!”\nHe looked surprised; he could not believe it. But within ten minutes it happened, and he came running to me and said, “You were right, your bail has been deposited!” He said, “It is unprecedented that for a person against whom no crime has yet been proved, there is no evidence against him – and yet such a large amount for bail. But you are stranger than the judge, because you remain so cool and so silent.”\nWhen I went into the jail I had gone immediately to take my shower, because it was my shower time. The jailer was standing there and he said, “You cannot miss your shower even today? If nobody pays your bail, then you will be in jail for at least twenty years.”\nI said, “That is not the concern right now; right now the concern is to take a good shower. I have always trusted. After my shower you come to see me.”\nAnd after my shower he was standing outside the bathroom. He said, “Somebody has given the bail” – he could not believe it. “How are you managing things?\nI said, “I have never managed. In my whole life I have never done anything deliberately – but things go on happening.”\nOnce you are in a let-go existence takes care of you. Then you are relaxed. If existence wants you to be in jail for twenty years, that’s perfectly good; if it wants you to be out to prepare other people for jail, that too is good. It depends on existence, whether it is satisfied with one or many.\nNow I am out, preparing many; sooner or later, in every country my people will be in jails – and that too, to convert the prisoners into sannyasins. I have new sannyasins in almost every jail, and they go on asking for guidance. Now I have to send a few sannyasins to them.\nFrom here, it is difficult for me to guide people all over the world. They are in jails and they want guidance for meditation, and they have problems. The best way will be for my people to start visiting just once in a while, as a holiday.\nAnd finally you are asking, Candida, for some guidance from me. That is a very dangerous thing. I rarely give guidance, and whenever I give guidance something goes wrong. It is my experience that many times people have got married and come for my blessings. Nirvano would say, “Don’t ask for his blessings, because once he has blessed you, you are finished.” And she was right, because she had been watching: whoever gets my blessings, within a few days they are separated, something goes wrong.\nNow, yesterday I had given some advice to Vimal. Vimal seems to be clever; he did not take it. But poor Rafia picked it up, and now do you see what has happened to Rafia? He writes:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI DID WHAT YOU SUGGESTED.… I had not suggested it to him! I WENT TO SLEEP SAYING, VIMAL... VIMAL... VIMAL... I was not suggesting this to him ... AND SURE ENOUGH, I WOKE UP SAYING, VIMAL... VIMAL... VIMAL... EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT UNTIL I STARTED HUGGING A BEAUTIFUL INDIAN GIRL, SHOWED UP FOR THE WRONG JOB, AND STARTED SPEAKING WITH A PRONOUNCED ENGLISH ACCENT. NOW I AM CONFUSED. BELOVED MASTER, WHO AM I?\nBecause the girl he hugged was Vimal’s girlfriend and the job he reached was Vimal’s job, not his job... But the whole night repeating “Vimal... Vimal... Vimal...” certainly he became confused – “Who am I?”\nSo when you ask for guidance, be very intelligent in applying it. The best is first to see if somebody else applies it and what happens to him.\nThis beautiful silence... this is my creation. Thousands of lotuses suddenly start flowering.\nThousands of hearts suddenly become a tremendous harmony, a song, a blissfulness.\nJust the other day I said a few words about Veeresh, one of the most sincere, honest and authentic therapists. And just now as I entered I saw him again. He was crying just like a child, with utter joy.\nThese tears are my creation.\nThey will not be recorded in any history book, but they will transform many who will come in contact with him. With his tears he has bridged his heart with my heart, his being with my being. He is one of the silent workers who go on doing, without bragging about anything.\nThis joke is for Veeresh, not to have any more tears but to have great laughter.\nA frustrated spinster was a menace to the police. She kept phoning up to say that there was a man under her bed. Before long she was sent to the mental hospital where she was treated with the latest drugs until one day she declared that she was cured.\n“You mean, Miss Rustavian,” asked one of the panel of shrinks, “that you can no longer see a man under you bed?”\n“No, I can’t,” she replied, “I can see two.”\nThe doctors consulted and diagnosed her complaint as malignant virginity, for which there was only one kind of injection that would cure her. They decided to shut her up in her bedroom with Big Don, the hospital handyman. Big Don was told of her complaint and that he would be locked up with her for an hour. He said that it would not take so long.\nAs the bedroom door closed an anxious group gathered outside. From inside was heard, “No, stop it, Don! Mother would never forgive you.”\n“Stop yelling! It has got to be done sometime! It should have been done years ago.” “Have it your way by force then, you brute!”\n“It is only what your husband would have done if you had married.” The medics could not wait. They burst into the room.\n“I have cured her!” cried Don.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"6753","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/>Satyam Shivam Sundram</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">30 In search of the ultimate new</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6753 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Satyam_Shivam_Sundram/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark29>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>30</span></p><p><br></p><p>In search of the ultimate new</p><p><br></p><p>21 November 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY IS THE NEW SO SCARY? MY WANTING AND NEED FOR RECOGNITION ARE GONE
ALONG WITH THE DOING. EVEN THOUGH DEEP INSIDE I AM TREMENDOUSLY THANKFUL
AND HAPPY, I FIND PART OF MYSELF FEELING GUILTY. I SEE AS WELL THAT
LAZINESS IS NOT ONE OF MY QUALITIES.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, I CAN’T FIND THE NEW WAY FOR ME TO BE TOTAL IN MY WORK.
IT IS BECOMING VERY PAINFUL. CAN YOU PLEASE BRING SOME LIGHT AND
GUIDANCE TO ME?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Candida, the new is always scary, for the simple reason that it
is new; you don’t know how to face it. All your knowledge is suddenly
found to be absolutely meaningless, because there is no answer in your
experience and knowledge that can be an authentic response to the
new.</p><p><br></p><p>You suddenly find yourself ignorant, helpless, not knowing what to
do; hence the scariness. Otherwise, instead of being afraid you would
have a totally different experience with the new. You will explode with
joy. If you are an explorer, an adventurer, then the new will fill you
with tremendous ecstasy, and you will see in this new a possibility for
your intelligence to function.</p><p><br></p><p>With the old, the intelligence has no need to function. Your memory
functions. You know the answer already; the answer is part of your
memory system. But memory is not intelligence, remember.</p><p>Intelligence is the capacity to rejoice in the new with openhearted
welcome, with intense clarity. Just by watching the new, from your very
innermost core will arise the response. That is the way of the
meditator. The meditator is continuously confronted with the new. In
fact, he is in search of the ultimate new, which will never become old,
which will always be fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the quality of satyam, shivam, sundram. Truth is never old;
neither is the godliness that surrounds you from all dimensions, nor the
experience of beauty. The roses may come and go, the expressions of
beauty may come and disappear, but the experience of beauty is always
there exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, Candida, “Why is the new so scary?” ... Because you
are still in the mind and you don’t know what meditation is.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind loves the old. With the old the mind is very at ease because it
knows all the answers. It does not feel helpless, it does not feel that
it has to choose this way or that way. It knows exactly what is the
right answer. The mind never wants you to come in contact with the new;
it keeps you going round and round with the old.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is just the opposite of mind. As mind is confined to the
old, meditation is an exploration of the expansion of the whole
universe. The meditator wants to come each moment to the new, because
only with the new does his intelligence become more sharp; only with the
new does he himself become new. Only with the new is the way towards the
ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>The old is dead. Of course the old seems to be very comfortable. It
seems comfortable because you don’t have to do anything. You don’t even
have to be intelligent. You can remain retarded and yet pretend to the
world that you are a great intellectual because your memory is filled
with all kinds of information.</p><p><br></p><p>The memory is not part of your consciousness; the memory is part of
your body. The memory is just a mechanism like any computer: you feed it
with information and whatever you feed it, it is perfectly comfortable
with. It knows it. And knowledge gives you a certain power. You are
within the territory where you are the ruler, you know everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The unknown, the new, suddenly exposes your ignorance, and that
hurts. You don’t want to know your ignorance; that’s why the new is
scary. But your ignorance is enormous, your knowledge is just a dewdrop.
If you don’t want to remain a dewdrop, closed, absolutely nonreceptive
and insensitive to the tremendous existence that is available to be
yours any moment, gather courage and come out of your smallness. The
moment the dewdrop takes a jump into the ocean... that’s exactly the
situation of a man who takes a jump from the mind into meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is so small. Existence, life, is so vast, so infinite that
unless you come out of the mind you will live the life of a prisoner and
a slave. A slave cannot know what dance is, a slave cannot know what
freedom is and the joy of freedom and the blissfulness and the ecstasy
of being vast, oceanic.</p><p><br></p><p>My work with you is to persuade you to come out of your caves, which
are dark, although they look very cozy to you because you are acquainted
with them.</p><p>It happened in the French Revolution... France had the greatest
prison, the Bastille, where only prisoners were sent who were going to
be there for their whole life. They could only enter there, they could
never come out. Once a person entered there... it had only a door to
enter, it had no exit.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two places like this in the world, and strangely, both
are prisons. One is a Catholic monastery in Europe where whoever enters,
enters forever. There are still almost ten thousand monks in that
monastery. They cannot come out again – at least not while they are
alive. Dead, they are free to go out; in fact others will throw them
out.</p><p><br></p><p>And the other place, where prisoners were thrown in, was the
Bastille. The Bastille had small caves for prisoners, thousands of
caves, dark caves with no light. The prisoners were handcuffed, chained,
and the keys of their chains and handcuffs were thrown into a well that
was in the middle of the prison. They were never going to be opened, so
what was the point of collecting thousands of keys unnecessarily? There
was no point; those people would die, then their chains would be cut,
not opened, so there was no need.</p><p><br></p><p>In the French Revolution, the revolutionaries immediately thought as
a priority, to open the doors of the Bastille and allow thousands of
prisoners their freedom. They were thinking that they were doing
something great. They could not have expected the response of the
prisoners – the prisoners refused. They said, “We have lived here,
somebody twenty years, somebody else thirty years<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>There were a few people who had lived there fifty, sixty, seventy
years.</p><p><br></p><p>Now a man who has lived there for seventy years must be nearabout a
hundred years old. His whole life experience is confined to a small
cave. He cannot come out of it; he is chained and tethered to the cave
wall. He cannot even move out of the cave just to see the sky or the
stars or the moon. Naturally, such a person will be afraid to go back
into the world after seventy years.</p><p><br></p><p>Almost everybody he used to know must either be dead by now<span class=s4></span>or else, where is he going to find</p><p>them? Their names have faded away, their faces have faded away; a
faraway seventy long years... And who knows if they will recognize him?
If he cannot remember them, who is going to recognize him? – a man
condemned to be in prison for life. And what will he do? From where will
he get his food and his clothes, and where will he be sleeping? He will
need a shelter too.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is almost a forgotten language to work, to earn, and at this
age, old, sick, tattered, who is going to give him work or employment?
Anyway, even ordinary prisoners who have been in prison for a few months
don’t easily get any employment; who is going to trust a man who has
been in jail seventy years? It is too risky.</p><p><br></p><p>Here everything is comfortable. It may look uncomfortable to an
outsider, but for the man who has lived in the cave for seventy
years<span class=s4></span>It may have been uncomfortable in the
beginning for a few days,</p><p>a few months, but man has a tremendous capacity of adaptability. In
any situation, if you force him, he will start adapting to the
situation.</p><p><br></p><p>And seventy years – or even fifty years is a long time, half a
century. Now he has started feeling perfectly cozy, comfortable, no
worry about bread, no worry about tomorrow, no worry about anything. He
has forgotten the names of his children, he has forgotten who used to be
his wife, and what happened to all those people. No, he does not want to
go out.</p><p>The revolutionaries could not believe it. “We are giving you freedom
and you are as scared as if we are going to kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And those prisoners said, “That’s exactly what we are feeling – that
you are going to kill us. We are perfectly happy here. Just excuse us;
we cannot fulfill your expectations, it is too late.”</p><p><br></p><p>But revolutionaries are stubborn people. They did not listen to the
prisoners; they cut their chains, they cut their handcuffs, they forced
them out with the same violence with which they had one day been forced
in. Against their will they had been brought in; against their will they
were brought out.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of them could not even open their eyes because the light was too
much. Their eyes had become too weak, too delicate, living in darkness;
their eyes were no longer capable of opening in the sunlight. Many of
them had forgotten how to walk. But the revolutionaries were adamant;
they did not listen to their cries, their tears. Revolutionaries are
revolutionaries; they forced them – almost three thousand prisoners –
out of the Bastille.</p><p><br></p><p>There was nobody to receive them, and they moved around the city like
dead people, almost like ghosts. They could not recognize anything.
Seventy years before, things had been totally different. Nor they could
see anybody who was contemporary to them. By the evening almost all of
them had returned back to the prison. They fought the revolutionaries
who were preventing them from getting into the prison.</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We cannot live outside. Who is going to give us food? And
who is going to take care of us, medical care, shelter, clothes? Who is
going to be responsible for all this? – you?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the most amazing thing they said was, “We cannot sleep without
chains and without handcuffs. We have become so accustomed to them, it
feels that something is missing. We cannot sleep – we tried in the day
under some trees, but unless we feel the load, the weight of the chains
on the feet, on the hands, we cannot sleep. So please don’t harass us.
Life has harassed us enough; now at the end we don’t want to change our
lifestyle.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the revolutionaries also recognized their problem. They had
not thought about this, that man becomes adapted to a certain situation,
and then it is his territory. In that territory he is perfectly
comfortable and cozy.</p><p><br></p><p>My own experience is... I have talked with beggars who had bank
balances. I don’t have a bank balance; I never did. It just happened by
chance that because I was continuously traveling I used to come to the
railway station in Jabalpur at least ten or fifteen times a month,
either going or coming.</p><p><br></p><p>There used to be an old beggar outside the railway station. Because
the first day I had given him one rupee, he would not accept less than
that, and he never asked more than that. So he had become adapted, I had
become adapted; that one rupee I had to give him. In fact, if sometimes
I came and I did not find the beggar, I would miss him. I would enquire,
“Where is the old man?” We had become very friendly, and if sometimes I
could not find him the next time I would give him two rupees – one for
the time when I missed him, because it had been very heavy on me.</p><p><br></p><p>One day just as I was passing the station I saw him. I was not going
out of town, but I was just driving by the railway station, going to
meet the doctor of the railway employees at the railway</p><p>hospital. There I suddenly saw in the corner the old man talking to a
young boy, and that young boy was my student. I stopped my car and
waited. When they were finished they were both shocked. The father was
shocked... but I could not understand why. I said, “Why do you look so
shocked?”</p><p><br></p><p>The father said, “I have been hiding it from everybody, but I cannot
hide it from you. He is my son and he is your student, and I am
preparing him to become at least a doctor.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the boy, “You never told me that you are the son of a
beggar.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My father never allows me. He never meets me anywhere where
people can see, because if people come to know I am the son of a beggar
it will be difficult – difficult in the college, difficult for getting
further admission into new colleges. It will become impossible, and my
father will be exposed: he can educate his son to become a medical
doctor and still he is continuing to beg. He brings me the best of
clothes.…” I used to see him: of the whole class, he had the best
clothes, the best shoes, everything the best.</p><p><br></p><p>That day I asked the old man, “How much bank balance do you
have?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Now I cannot hide it from you, and I trust that you will
not expose the fact that he is my son. I have thirty thousand rupees in
the bank.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “With thirty thousand rupees you can start a shop, a small
factory. Why do you go on begging in your old age?” He said, “Begging is
so comfortable. Everything else can make me bankrupt, but begging can
never make me bankrupt. And my earning is more than any shopkeeper or
small factory owner. I earn nearabout fifty rupees per day” – even a
doctor in India does not earn that much, nor a professor. And he said,
“I have my customers, and why should I unnecessarily go into something
new about which I don’t know anything? Begging is my heritage; my father
was a beggar, my father’s father was a beggar, and they were all rich
men.”</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time I became aware of a new dimension of human mind:
it does not matter what condition you are in; slowly, slowly you settle
down. And once you have settled down you don’t want even to budge,
because then again you will have to start from ABC. Again you will have
to start learning, again you will have to start facing problems. Right
now there are no problems: you know all the answers to all the questions
that can arise in a certain situation in which you have become
completely enclosed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is cozy and it is comfortable to live in the old, but it will not
bring the flowers of freedom and it will not open the whole sky for you
to open your wings and fly. It will not allow you to have aspirations
for the stars; it will not allow you to move in any direction or
dimension. You will remain just like a dead grave where nothing
moves.</p><p><br></p><p>Candida, the new is scary, but the new is what I teach you. You will
have to drop your fears, you will have to drop your ugly coziness, you
will have to drop your small comforts. These are the things you have to
pay for the greater joys, the higher realms of being, tremendous
possibilities of ecstasies. You will not be a loser, but in the
beginning you have to risk something.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good you are aware that the new makes you scared. For centuries
man, animals, everybody has been living with the old. Only man has risen
once in a while to have a glimpse of the new. Think</p><p>about buffaloes... can you conceive that at any time in the millions
of years of evolution, buffaloes have eaten any other grass than they
eat today? The same grass... can you conceive that one day buffaloes
will be different? They are so settled, so utterly settled and so
contented.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot make a buffalo a buddha. They are perfectly at ease.</p><p>Why should they bother?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole animal kingdom is lower than man only for one reason, which
is that man is an explorer; he has somewhere hidden in him the
adventurer. His mind may be afraid, scared, but his consciousness wants
to have communion with the universe, to touch the stars, to open up to
all the beauties and the truth and the godliness of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to shift your emphasis from mind to meditation, and all
fear will disappear. You will have to shift your attention from your
comfortable, cozy, but old and dirty and rotten state towards something
new, fresh, young – from the body to the consciousness, from mind to
no-mind. Then every moment you are confronting the new.</p><p><br></p><p>And one is thrilled with the new. Once you have learned that the new
is not your enemy the fear simply disappears; on the contrary, you start
searching for the new. The day you start searching for the new with joy
and a dancing heart, you have become a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>That is my definition of a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>I define my sannyasins from many dimensions; I want to give you the
idea of sannyas from as many aspects as possible. The search for the new
is one of the aspects of a seeker.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “My wanting and need for recognition are gone, along
with the doing. Even though deep inside I am tremendously thankful and
happy, I find part of myself feeling guilty. I see as well that laziness
is not one of my qualities. I can’t find the new way for me to be total
in my work. It is becoming very painful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Candida, all your problems are your creations. First, you should be
immensely happy that the need for recognition is gone. That is a great
achievement. You are no more dependent on others’ opinions; for the
first time you are just yourself and you don’t need anybody to
approve.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the beginning of the birth of individuality. Otherwise people
are only cogs in the wheel; whatever others say they believe, even about
themselves. All that they know about themselves is what others have
said. They go on collecting all kinds of opinions and that’s what their
self- knowledge consists of. It is a great experience that the need for
recognition is gone. You should be happy with it rather than making some
problem out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is very clever and very cunning. Even if you are feeling very
ecstatic, mind will say beware, you may be just having a hallucination.
And it will destroy your blissfulness – “My God! It is possible it may
be just a hallucination!” When you are having pain the mind never says
that – not in the whole history of mankind. When you are having a
migraine the mind never says that it may be just illusory.</p><p>But if you are having a beautiful space within you, as if a rose is
flowering, the mind is going to jump on it immediately: “You are
daydreaming, this is all hallucination, illusion. You are being
hypnotized.” And you immediately listen to the mind, because you have
listened to it for centuries. It is just a habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with the recognition, you are saying, your doing has also gone.
That’s an even greater achievement than the first. If the doing is gone,
the doer must have gone also – but I suspect that’s where the problem
is. Doing is gone but the doer is there: that is creating the tension.
That is making you feel a part of yourself as guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is this part?</p><p><br></p><p>If doing is gone, nothing is wrong. In fact it is one of the basic
fundamentals for enlightenment to happen that your doing should go. That
does not mean that you will not do things; you will do things but they
will not be fulfillments of your ego or projections of your mind. They
will be spontaneous and you will rejoice in doing them, or vice versa:
because you rejoice you do them.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems the doer is still hiding somewhere within you. So a part
has disappeared, but the other part is still there creating a feeling of
guilt: to be lazy, not to do anything – this is not good. You should do
something, you should not become a parasite. That doer goes on creating
problems for you, anxiety for you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have been able to let the recognition go, the doing go,
release the doer also. But remember, that does not mean that you will
become lazy. That is a wrong interpretation by the mind. Mind always
interprets wrongly anything that is going to become a step leading
beyond mind. When you feel let-go, mind will say, “This is laziness.”
Mind is a great condemnor. It enjoys condemning others, it enjoys
condemning you; its only joy is to condemn.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “Even though deep inside I am tremendously thankful
and happy, I find part of myself feeling guilty.” That part you have to
become aware of and drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can just drop so much, why carry this small part of being
guilty? You have not done any wrong to anyone. You are just feeling
guilty because the society brings you up with the idea to do something,
be somebody; don’t remain a nobody, don’t become a good-for-nothing.
Leave your footprints on the pages of history.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of stupidity is this? Why should I leave my footprints on
the pages of history? – to torture the future children? And why should I
be somebody special? Those are ego trips.</p><p><br></p><p>Much has disappeared, but something of the ego has remained which is
making you guilty and which is calling you lazy. But this is not
laziness; this is relaxation, let-go. And out of this let-go, out of
this relaxation will grow new flowers. The difference is that laziness
is barren, nothing grows out of it, it is a desert. So soon you will see
the difference; just don’t cling to the word laziness. Drop it, it is a
very negative and destructive word.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never done anything in the eyes of the world. My family from
the very beginning used to say to me, “You are going to be good for
nothing” – and they proved right. I am good only for nothing. They were
very much concerned, “How are you going to live your life? How are you
going to manage?”</p><p>And I always told them, “Don’t you be worried. If I am not worried,
why should you be worried? Something or other will happen, don’t be
worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they remained concerned, and they continually told me, “This is
laziness, this is not good.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I told them, “This is not laziness, it is my meditativeness. I am
just simply being silent. And you will see: if it is laziness, you will
find my life a desert where nothing grows. And if I am right and it is a
let-go, then you will see that although it may not be visible to
ordinary people, those who have eyes can see. Those who have ears can
hear that my life has become a song, a dance, a celebration, so many
flowers, and that I am so contented and so fulfilled.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have not known for a single moment any feeling of guilt. Just learn
the right language on the path of meditation. Your language belongs to
the mind; when you change the track from mind to meditation you will
have to change many words which mind uses but which are not applicable
in the world of meditation. Call it let-go and suddenly you will feel a
tremendous relaxation. Call it laziness and immediately some
condemnation, some anxiety, something painful... Learn the new language,
because you have chosen to be on the path in search of the new and the
unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also against laziness. Laziness is simply dullness, it is
stupidity. But let-go is the greatest quality a man can achieve.
Relaxation is one of the most beautiful experiences, which can bring you
so many gifts from the beyond that you are absolutely unaware of. Change
the language.</p><p><br></p><p>If laziness is not one of your qualities, good. Let relaxation be one
of your qualities. Relaxation, non- doing don’t disturb at all; just
your life becomes more creative, rather than being more productive.
Again, those two words make the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind calls productivity activeness, and creativity is not counted. It
takes time for authentic creativity to be realized. Just the other day,
one of van Gogh’s paintings was sold for forty million dollars. A few
months before, one of his paintings was sold for fourteen million
dollars, and at that time it was said that was is the most one could
imagine; no painting had fetched fourteen million – now what to say
about forty?</p><p><br></p><p>This man lived in poverty, hungry, starving, because he could not
sell a single painting. And he was not demanding forty million dollars;
sometimes he was ready to give one painting just for one meal. Sometimes
just for one cup of tea he was ready to give one of his paintings. But
people were not willing, even for just a cup of tea: “We don’t have
space, where will we put it? You just find someone else.” To them it was
a problem, “Where to put it? – we don’t have space.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was when he was no more there, one hundred years after his death,
that slowly, slowly the time for his recognition came. This is the case
with almost every genius. Every genius comes, for absolutely unknown
reasons, before his time. Why can’t these people wait a little? It is
just that they arrive when their contemporaries are not here; by the
time their contemporaries are here, they are gone, so they never
know.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think Jesus will ever know how many Christians there are in
the world now? Do you think Socrates will ever know that now his name is
something for Greece to be proud of? – otherwise, without his name,
Greece is nothing. It is his teachings and his disciples, Plato and
Aristotle, that</p><p>kept Greece at a peak of intelligence, because I don’t think anybody
else in the whole of Europe has been able to transcend the sharpness of
intelligence that Socrates had. Perhaps his contemporaries have not yet
arrived, although twenty-five centuries have passed.</p><p><br></p><p>When van Gogh’s paintings were recognized people started searching
them out. He must have painted thousands of paintings and just went on
giving them away – to friends, as gifts, or for a cup of tea or for a
meal. People accepted his paintings just not to look crude, not to look
uncivilized. They thought, “Once he is gone then we can put the painting
in the basement. Nobody was hanging his paintings in their sitting
rooms, because anybody looking at the paintings would think that this
man had gone crazy: why is he putting up this painting?</p><p><br></p><p>Van Gogh’s ideas looked crazy at the time, but his time came later.
His whole family condemned him, saying, “You have not done a single
thing and you are a parasite on your younger brother” – because his
younger brother went on supporting him just enough so that he could
survive.</p><p><br></p><p>Van Gogh could not eat every day of the week; four days he was eating
and three days he was fasting – one day eating, one day fasting, one day
eating, one day fasting – because with whatever he could save from those
three days, he would purchase colors, paints, canvasses, brushes for his
painting. There was no other way.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has painted with such love and with such joy, with his own
life and his own blood. He destroyed himself in painting. Now there is
so much search going on in the basements of Holland and Italy where he
lived; his paintings have been found in people’s basements, and now the
prices of those paintings are unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>The last one was sold the day before yesterday for forty million
dollars. When the painting was sold a few months ago the critics were
saying, “This is the end; nobody can purchase any painting for a higher
price than this.” He had set a record – fourteen million dollars. Before
this, the record had been only three million dollars for somebody else’s
painting. But this was a big jump, to fourteen million, and within three
or four months another of his paintings went for forty million dollars –
and I can conceive that the price of his paintings may go still
higher.</p><p><br></p><p>Just now two hundred more paintings have been found and those, too,
not in good condition. Now, this man was one of the greatest creators
the world has known, but he was not a doer, he was not a producer. If he
had even had any skill – carpentry or shoemaking or tailoring – he would
have earned enough and everybody would have respected him as a man who
earns his living. But he was continuously condemned for being absolutely
lazy, and nobody knew what he was doing.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole day would pass and he would forget completely about eating
or even drinking water, he was so absorbed in his painting. Only when
the night would descend and it would become difficult to see, then he
would recognize that the day was gone. He was so poor he could not even
manage to purchase a few candles; he used to paint outside his house
sometimes in the night under the street lamp.</p><p><br></p><p>His brother must have been sensitive. He was young and certainly he
understood something about paintings because he was working as a
salesman in a shop where paintings and other pieces of art were sold. So
he had a certain understanding, and he loved his brother, but what could
he do? He himself was a poor man, somehow surviving, and more than that
was not possible for him.</p><p>But one gift certainly he wanted to give to his brother – that he
should not die before seeing at least one of his paintings sold. So
somehow he collected some money and asked a friend, “Go and purchase a
painting from my brother. I just want to give him the consolation that
his life has not been absolutely futile; at least he sold one
painting.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man he had chosen had no sensitivity for paintings, so he
simply went to van Gogh and said, “I would like to purchase a
painting.”</p><p><br></p><p>So joyful, van Gogh said, “Come! I don’t have a big place, but I have
many paintings.” The man said, “Any will do” – and that hurt van Gogh
very much.</p><p>He said, “Any will do? You don’t want to see my paintings? You don’t
want to choose?” He said, “It doesn’t matter, don’t waste my time. Any
will do.”</p><p>He said, “Then I am not going to sell, and it is absolutely certain
you have been sent by my brother. Just get out and get lost! – and tell
my brother that this is not the way to console me. Now I am feeling more
hurt and wounded than ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then even his brother never tried again.</p><p><br></p><p>Creativity happens in a state of let-go; productivity needs tension,
anxiety, a doer, ego, recognition. Creativity needs no recognition, no
ego, no doer – just the sheer joy of creating it.</p><p><br></p><p>At least van Gogh could show his paintings. I cannot even show my
paintings. But you are my paintings.</p><p>I have been creating in my own way something very invisible and
subtle which cannot be shown and which cannot be sold, and nobody will
ever know about it. It will not be recorded anywhere how many people
were transformed, how many people changed their lives from the lowest to
the highest peak of illumination. But nobody can say that I have been
uncreative. Day and night I am working – but I am not a doer.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends had come from the Soviet Union and he shook hands
with me and he said, “You should never go to the Soviet Union.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Because anybody touching your hands will immediately shrink back.” I
said, “But why?”</p><p>He said, “Because your hands are bourgeois, you have never done
anything, and in the Soviet Union to be bourgeois is the worst
condemnation. You need the proletariat’s hand, the laborer’s hand,
rough.”</p><p>I said, “My God, then first I will try – if I have to go to the
Soviet Union – to make my hands as rough as I can.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is true that I have never done anything. But I am not lazy; I
have never thought for a moment that I am lazy, although I have never
done anything. Even if I am thirsty I trust somebody is going to appear;
and somebody always has appeared, so there is no need to distrust in the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>In America, when my bail was set at five hundred thousand dollars –
that’s near about seventy-five lakh rupees – even the jailer who was
taking me back to jail was worried. He said, “From where will it come?
The figure is too big. In my whole life I have never seen or heard of
anybody’s bail being set at five hundred thousand dollars. How are you
going to manage? – and you look so relaxed and so cool.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t bother about such things. Something will happen.” He
said, “But how will it happen?”</p><p>I said, “That I don’t know. How is not part of my language. It will
happen!”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked surprised; he could not believe it. But within ten minutes
it happened, and he came running to me and said, “You were right, your
bail has been deposited!” He said, “It is unprecedented that for a
person against whom no crime has yet been proved, there is no evidence
against him – and yet such a large amount for bail. But you are stranger
than the judge, because you remain so cool and so silent.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I went into the jail I had gone immediately to take my shower,
because it was my shower time. The jailer was standing there and he
said, “You cannot miss your shower even today? If nobody pays your bail,
then you will be in jail for at least twenty years.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is not the concern right now; right now the concern is
to take a good shower. I have always trusted. After my shower you come
to see me.”</p><p><br></p><p>And after my shower he was standing outside the bathroom. He said,
“Somebody has given the bail” – he could not believe it. “How are you
managing things?</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I have never managed. In my whole life I have never done
anything deliberately – but things go on happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are in a let-go existence takes care of you. Then you are
relaxed. If existence wants you to be in jail for twenty years, that’s
perfectly good; if it wants you to be out to prepare other people for
jail, that too is good. It depends on existence, whether it is satisfied
with one or many.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I am out, preparing many; sooner or later, in every country my
people will be in jails – and that too, to convert the prisoners into
sannyasins. I have new sannyasins in almost every jail, and they go on
asking for guidance. Now I have to send a few sannyasins to them.</p><p><br></p><p>From here, it is difficult for me to guide people all over the world.
They are in jails and they want guidance for meditation, and they have
problems. The best way will be for my people to start visiting just once
in a while, as a holiday.</p><p>And finally you are asking, Candida, for some guidance from me. That
is a very dangerous thing. I rarely give guidance, and whenever I give
guidance something goes wrong. It is my experience that many times
people have got married and come for my blessings. Nirvano would say,
“Don’t ask for his blessings, because once he has blessed you, you are
finished.” And she was right, because she had been watching: whoever
gets my blessings, within a few days they are separated, something goes
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, yesterday I had given some advice to Vimal. Vimal seems to be
clever; he did not take it. But poor Rafia picked it up, and now do you
see what has happened to Rafia? He writes:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I DID WHAT YOU SUGGESTED.… I had not suggested it to him! I WENT TO
SLEEP SAYING, VIMAL... VIMAL... VIMAL... I was not suggesting this to
him ... AND SURE ENOUGH, I WOKE UP SAYING, VIMAL... VIMAL... VIMAL...
EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT UNTIL I STARTED HUGGING A BEAUTIFUL INDIAN
GIRL, SHOWED UP FOR THE WRONG JOB, AND STARTED SPEAKING WITH A
PRONOUNCED ENGLISH ACCENT. NOW I AM CONFUSED. BELOVED MASTER, WHO AM
I?</p><p><br></p><p>Because the girl he hugged was Vimal’s girlfriend and the job he
reached was Vimal’s job, not his job... But the whole night repeating
“Vimal... Vimal... Vimal...” certainly he became confused – “Who am
I?”</p><p><br></p><p>So when you ask for guidance, be very intelligent in applying it. The
best is first to see if somebody else applies it and what happens to
him.</p><p><br></p><p>This beautiful silence... this is my creation. Thousands of lotuses
suddenly start flowering.</p><p>Thousands of hearts suddenly become a tremendous harmony, a song, a
blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I said a few words about Veeresh, one of the most
sincere, honest and authentic therapists. And just now as I entered I
saw him again. He was crying just like a child, with utter joy.</p><p><br></p><p>These tears are my creation.</p><p><br></p><p>They will not be recorded in any history book, but they will
transform many who will come in contact with him. With his tears he has
bridged his heart with my heart, his being with my being. He is one of
the silent workers who go on doing, without bragging about anything.</p><p><br></p><p>This joke is for Veeresh, not to have any more tears but to have
great laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>A frustrated spinster was a menace to the police. She kept phoning up
to say that there was a man under her bed. Before long she was sent to
the mental hospital where she was treated with the latest drugs until
one day she declared that she was cured.</p><p>“You mean, Miss Rustavian,” asked one of the panel of shrinks, “that
you can no longer see a man under you bed?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I can’t,” she replied, “I can see two.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctors consulted and diagnosed her complaint as malignant
virginity, for which there was only one kind of injection that would
cure her. They decided to shut her up in her bedroom with Big Don, the
hospital handyman. Big Don was told of her complaint and that he would
be locked up with her for an hour. He said that it would not take so
long.</p><p><br></p><p>As the bedroom door closed an anxious group gathered outside. From
inside was heard, “No, stop it, Don! Mother would never forgive
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stop yelling! It has got to be done sometime! It should have been
done years ago.” “Have it your way by force then, you brute!”</p><p>“It is only what your husband would have done if you had married.”
The medics could not wait. They burst into the room.</p><p>“I have cured her!” cried Don.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_buddha_disease/part30/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>30 If you know one secret \-- to be happy right now \-- you have learned it all</span>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY AM I ALWAYS RUNNING SO FAST? IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE?
Prem Amita, it is not only you; almost everybody is running as fast as he can from himself. And the problem is, you cannot run away from yourself.

IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE?\nPrem Amita, it is not only you; almost everybody is running as fast as he can from himself. And the problem is, you cannot run away from yourself.\nWherever you go you will be yourself.\nThe fear is of knowing oneself. It is the greatest fear in the world. It is because you have been so immensely condemned by everybody for the smallest things – for the smallest mistakes, which are absolutely human – that you have become afraid of yourself. You know that you are not worthy.\nThat idea has sunk very deep into your unconscious – that you are not deserving, that you are utterly worthless. Naturally, the best way is to get away from yourself. Everybody is doing it in different ways: somebody is running for money, somebody is running for power, somebody is running for respectability, somebody is running for virtue, saintliness.\nBut if you look deep down, they are not running for anything, they are running from. This is just an excuse, that somebody is running after money madly; he is deceiving himself and the whole world. The reality is that money gives him a good excuse to run after it, and hides the fact that he is running from himself. That’s why when he accumulates money, he comes to a point of tremendous\ndespair and anguish. What has happened? That was his goal; he has achieved it – he should be the happiest man in the world.\nBut the people who succeed are not the happiest people in the world, they are the most miserable. What is their anguish? Their anguish is that their whole effort has failed. Now there is no more to run after, and suddenly they are encountering themselves. At the highest peak of their success they meet nobody else but themselves. Strangely enough, this is the fellow they have been running from.\nYou cannot run from yourself.\nOn the contrary, you have to come closer to yourself, deeper into your being, and to drop all the condemnatory tones that have been handed over to you by everybody you have known in your life. The parents, the husband, the wife, the neighbors, the teachers, the friends, the enemies, everybody is pointing to something that is wrong in you. From no source comes any appreciation.\nHumanity has created a very strange situation for itself in which nobody is at ease, nobody can relax, because the moment you relax you face yourself. Relaxation becomes almost a mirror, and you don’t want to see your face because you are so much impressed by the condemnatory opinions of others.\nEven the smallest pleasures have not been allowed to you by your church, by your priests, by your religion, by your culture. Only misery is acceptable – not pleasure. In this situation it is very natural for you to feel, when from every source, from every direction comes only condemnation, that you are a sinner. Every religion has been shouting for centuries that you are born in sin, that suffering is your destiny. You have been condemned from so many sources without exception that it is very natural for any individual to be impressed by this vast conspiracy. Everybody is caught into it.\nAnd if you try to understand it you will be very much surprised. Just as others have condemned you, you are condemning others; it is a very mutual conspiracy. Just as your parents have never accepted you as being of any worth, you are doing the same with your children, without ever becoming aware that everybody is what he is; he cannot be otherwise. He can pretend to be otherwise, he can be a hypocrite, but in truth he will always remain himself.\nYour running away is nothing but creating more hypocrisy, more masks so that you can hide yourself completely from the eyes of everyone. You may succeed in hiding yourself from others, but how can you succeed in hiding yourself from yourself? You can go to the moon; you will find yourself there. You can go to Everest; you may be alone but you are with yourself. Perhaps in that aloneness on Everest you will become more alert and aware of yourself.\nThat is one of the reasons why people are also afraid of aloneness; they want a crowd, they want always to have people surrounding them, they want friends. It is very difficult for people to remain silent and peaceful in aloneness. The reason is that in aloneness you are left with yourself – and you have accepted the stupid ideas that you are ugly, that you are sensuous, that you are lustful, that you are greedy, that you are violent; there is nothing that can be appreciated in you.\nPrem Amita, you are asking, “Why am I always running so fast?” Because you are afraid you may be overtaken by yourself. And the implications of running so fast have many dimensions. This running\nfast from yourself has created a craziness about speed: everybody wants to reach somewhere with as much speed as possible.\nIt happened once, I was coming from a place called Nagpur, back to Jabalpur, and I was traveling with the vice-chancellor of Nagpur University, and the car broke down on the road. I have never seen anybody become so miserable.\nI told him, “There is no hurry. Nobody is waiting for your there, and the conference for which you are going is going to begin in twenty-four hours, and Jabalpur is only three hours away. There is no problem: either we will get the car repaired, or we will call another car from Jabalpur to come, or we may get some lift, or buses are continually passing by. There is no problem... you need not be so miserable.”\nHe was sitting in the car and I went to look for somebody. It was a small village, but maybe some mechanic or some help would be possible, or perhaps the landlord of the village would have a car. When I came back from the village, that man was almost in tears. I said, “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “I cannot afford to be alone. It exposes me so deeply, it makes me utterly naked before myself. It makes me aware that I have wasted my whole life – and I don’t want to know it.”\nI said, “Your not knowing it is not going to help you in any way. It is better to know it, and it is better to go deeper into yourself. That’s why this misery and aloneness...”\nAloneness should be one of the greatest joys.\nPeople are running. It does not matter where they are going; what matters is whether they are going at full speed or not.\nYou are asking, Amita, “Is there something I don’t want to see?” There are many things. Fundamentally, it is you that you don’t want to see – and it is because of a wrong conditioning.\nMy whole approach of inner transformation is that you will have to drop your conditionings. Whatever has been said about you by others, simply drop it. It is absolutely crap. They don’t know about themselves; what can they say about you which can be truthful?\nAnd the opinions that you have collected from others... just try to watch from whom you are collecting your opinions. They are not from a Gautam Buddha, or from a Jesus, or from a Socrates; they are from people who are as ignorant as you are. They are simply passing on others’ opinions that have been given to them.\nThere is a beautiful story. Whether it is factual or not does not matter; its beauty is in its meaning. One of the greatest emperors India has known was the Mogul emperor, Akbar. He can be compared only to one man in the West, and that is Marcus Aurelius. Emperors are very rarely wise people, but these two names are certainly exceptions.\nOne day he was in his court talking with his courtiers. He had collected the best people in the country – the best painter, the best musician, the best philosopher, the best poet. He had a small, special committee of nine members who were known as the nine jewels of Akbar’s court.\nThe most important of them was a man called Birbal. Immensely intelligent and a man of great sense of humor, he did something which was improper to do in front of the emperor. Every emperor has his own rules – his word is the law – and Birbal behaved against something about which Akbar was very stubborn. Akbar immediately slapped Birbal. He respected Birbal, he loved Birbal, he was his most intimate friend, but as far as the rules of the court were concerned... he could not forgive.\nBut what Birbal did is the real story. He did not wait for a single moment; he immediately slapped the man who was standing on his other side. The other man was shocked, and even Akbar was shocked. He used to think that this man is very wise: I she mad, or what? I have slapped him... This is strange, absolutely absurd and illogical.\nAnd the other man was standing there shocked and Birbal said, “Don’t stand there like a fool, just pass it on!” So that man slapped somebody else who was standing by the side – and now the game became clear: you have to pass it on.\nIn the night, when Akbar went to sleep with his wife, his wife slapped him. He said, “What is the matter?”\nShe said, “It has been going on around the city, and finally it has reached to its original source. Somebody else has slapped me, and when I asked, ‘What is the matter?’, I was told that this is the game Akbar has started. I thought it is better to finish it, to complete the circle.”\nAnd the next day, first thing, Birbal asked, “Have you received my slap back or not?” Akbar said, “I had never thought that this would happen!”\nBirbal said, “I was absolutely certain, because where will it go finally? It will go around the city. You cannot escape; it is bound to come to you.”\nFor centuries everything goes on being transferred, being passed on from one hand to another, from one generation to another generation – and the game continues. This is the game that you have to come out of. The only way to come out of it is to rediscover your self-respect, attain again your dignity which you had when you were a child, when you were still not contaminated, when you were not yet conditioned and poisoned by the society and by the people around you.\nBe a child again and you will not be running away from yourself. You will be running within yourself – and that is the way of the meditator. The worldly man runs away from himself, and the seeker runs within himself to find the source of this life, this consciousness. And when he discovers the source, he has discovered not only his life source, he has discovered the life source of the universe, of the whole cosmos.\nA tremendous celebration arises in him. Life becomes just a song, a dance, moment to moment. One becomes absolutely free from all the jargon that the society has handed down. One simply throws away all conditionings, all traditions, the whole past.\nI say unto you, only one thing you have to renounce, and that is the past and nothing else.\nIf you can renounce the past you will be absolutely fresh, just born, and to be in that freshness is such a blessing, such an ecstasy, you cannot even think of going away even for a single moment. The man who knows himself never takes any holiday. But most people go on behaving stupidly.…\nAn American was driving along a small country lane in Ireland when he was horrified to see a cartload of hay coming out of the field into the narrow road. He jumped on the brakes but couldn’t stop in time, and ended up driving through the fence into the field where the car burst into flames.\n“Bejabers!” exclaimed Paddy to his friend Seamus, who was driving the hay cart, “Some of these tourists are terrible drivers. We only just got out of that field in time.”\nThe old farmer, plowing his fields with a pair of bulls, was asked by a neighbor why he did not use oxen.\n“I don’t want to use oxen,” replied the farmer, “I want to use bulls.”\n“Well,” continued the neighbor, “If you don’t want to use oxen, why don’t you use horses?” “I don’t want to use horses!” retorted the farmer, “I want to use bulls!”\n“Well, perhaps,” tried the neighbor, you could try using that new tractor your son has just bought.” “I don’t want to use tractors, either, I want to use bulls.” reaffirmed the farmer.\n“Why do you only want to use bulls?” asked the neighbor at a loss. “Because,” said the old boy, “I don’t want them to think that life is all romance.”\nThis is simply the situation in which you are born, in which you have been conditioned. Nobody wants you to know that life is simply romance. And that is my crime – because that is my whole teaching, that life is nothing but romance.\nThe newlywed couple flew to Miami and checked into the honeymoon hotel. For days nothing was seen of them, until the morning of the sixth day, when they came to the dining room for breakfast. As the waiter approached their table, the bride turned to her husband and said, “Honey, do you know what I would like?”\n“Yes, I know,” he replied wearily, “but we have to eat sometime.”\nSo once in a while it is good to have a breakfast; otherwise, life is a continuous romance. And I teach you not only the romance of the body, which is very ordinary; I teach you the romance of the spirit which is eternal, which begins but never ends. But this is possible only if you start going inwards.\nGoing inwards is going Godwards.\nGoing inwards is the whole secret of all alchemical transformation of being. Running away is simply wasting tremendously valuable time, and a life that could have been a great song, a great creativity, a\ntremendous festival of lights. The farther away you are from yourself, the darker your life will become, the more miserable, more anxiety ridden, more wounded, condemned, rejected by yourself.\nAnd the farther away you are the more difficult it becomes to find the way back home. You have been going away from yourself for many many lives, but if you move on a right, meditative path you are not gone very far.\nMeditation is the short cut from where you are to where you should be. And meditation is such a simple method that anybody, even a small child, can enter into its wonderland.\nAmita, rather than running away, run withinwards. Come closer to yourself to have a better look. Nobody else can see your inner reality; only you can see that splendor and that glory. Because nobody else can see your inner beauty they go on condemning you. Only you can assert your blissfulness, only you can assert ultimately your enlightenment.\nEven then people will be suspicious. They were suspicious about Socrates, they were suspicious about Gautam Buddha, they were suspicious about Jesus. Their suspicion is rooted in fact in their own unawareness of their inner being.\nHow can they believe Gautam Buddha, that in the inner silences of the heart is the ultimate ecstasy? They don’t know anything of the inner, not even the ABC. They don’t know anything about ecstasy. They may listen to a Gautam Buddha, just because of his presence, his charismatic eyes, his magnetic vibration, but when they go home, they will start suspecting, doubting.\nAnd this is happening even here. I receive many letters saying that “when we listen to you everything seems to be absolutely right. As we reach home doubts start arising; the mind starts saying to us that we have been hypnotized.\nThere are millions of people who want to come close to me but are afraid, for the simple reason that they may be hypnotized. It is something far deeper than hypnosis. You are not hypnotized, you are simply taken into a different vision of your own self. It is not something like magic; you are not being befooled, you are being awakened.\nThe word ‘hypnosis’ means asleep, and my whole work is to awaken you. You are already asleep and you have been asleep for lives together.\nIt is time to wake up.\nYou have wasted too much valuable time, energy, opportunity already. But still there is time and the moment you wake up, for you the night ends and the dawn begins.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE BARRIERS I HAVE BUILT UP IN MYSELF OVER THE YEARS AGAINST BEING A JOYFUL SELF-LOVING OPEN BEING. IT FEELS\nLIKE THE WALL IN ME IS GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER THE MORE I AM AWARE OF IT, AND I CAN’T COME THROUGH. DO I FIRST NEED MORE COURAGE?\nMY BELOVED BEAUTIFUL MASTER, COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR UNDERSTANDING?\nShunyam Para, it is the same question again. I have been answering Amita but I have also answered you, although you have phrased your question in a different way. A few small details are different; otherwise it is the same problem. I will discuss those small differences in detail.\nYou say, “I am becoming more and more conscious of the barriers that have built up in myself over the years against being a joyful self-loving open being. It feels like the wall in me is getting stronger and stronger the more I am aware of it, and I can’t come through.”\nThe first thing to understand is that the wall is not becoming stronger; it is only that your awareness is becoming clear. There is no reason at all why the wall should become stronger when you are becoming more aware. It is simply like when you bring the light in your dark house, you start seeing the cobwebs and the spiders – not that they have suddenly started growing because you have brought light in. They have always been there; it is just that you are becoming aware, alert.\nBut don’t think that they are growing. Your light has nothing to do with their growth. Yes, it reveals their presence. Your growing awareness is revealing the presence of your prison walls.\nAnd you say, “I am aware of it and I can’t come through.” Because these walls are not true walls – they are not made of bricks or stone, they are made of only thoughts – they cannot prevent you. You just have to know the secret of how to come through them. If you start struggling within your thought processes, which constitute the prison walls, then you will get into a tremendous mess. One can even go insane.\nThat’s how people go insane: they are surrounded by so many thoughts and they are trying hard to come out of the crowd and they go on getting deeper and deeper into the crowd, and then naturally a breakdown follows. Their nervous system cannot sustain so much pressure and so much tension. They have opened Pandora’s box. It was all hidden there, but they were blissfully unaware of it. Now they have brought a meditative awareness; suddenly they see a great crowd so thick that the more they try the more they feel their impotence against the walls that are surrounding them.\nIf you start fighting with them then there is no way; you will become sooner or later tired, tethered, you will find yourself slipping from your sanity. But if you use a right method, instead of a breakdown you will have a breakthrough. The right method to deal with all that you feel you are surrounded with is to be just a witness – not to fight, not to judge, not to condemn. Just remain silent and still, purely witnessing whatever is there.\nThis is almost a miracle. I have not come across any miracle other than the miracle of meditation, the miracle of witnessing. If you can witness, you will be surprised that the strong wall is becoming thinner, the crowd is dispersing; slowly, slowly you see doors and gaps through which you can get out.\nBut there is no need to get out. Remain where you are. Just go on witnessing. As your witnessing will become stronger, the wall that surrounds you will become weaker. The day your witnessing will be perfect, you will find there has been no wall, nothing is surrounding you, the whole sky is available to you. Rather than fighting with thoughts, fighting against wrong conditionings, just become a pure witness.\nFighting, you cannot win. Without fighting victory is yours.\nVictory belongs only to those who can witness.\nHymie Goldberg was having trouble getting Becky, his wife, to make love to him anymore. So one night just before bedtime, he offered her a glass of water and two aspirins.\n“What are you giving me these for?” Becky asked. “I have not got a headache.” “Great,” said Hymie. “Let us get started.”\nThis headache was the problem. Every day, whenever poor Goldberg would ask, the wife was having a great headache. This time he worked through a different methodology. Becky could not understand that now he is using a very wise strategy – offering aspirins even before she has said she has a headache. So just be a little wise.…\nDoctor Klein finished the examination of his patient and then said, “You are in perfect health, Mr. Levinsky, your heart, lungs, blood pressure, cholesterol level, everything is fine.”\n“Splendid,” said Mr. Levinsky.\n“I will see you next year,” said Doctor Klein.\nThey shook hands, but as soon as the patient had left the room, Doctor Klein heard a loud crash. He opened the door and there, flat on his face, lay Mr. Levinsky. The nurse cried, “Doctor, he just collapsed. He fell down like a rock.”\nThe doctor felt his heart and said, “My God, he is dead.” He even put his hands under the corpse’s arms.\n“Quick,” said the doctor, “take his feet!” “What?” cried the nurse.\n“For God’s sake,” said the doctor, “let us turn him round. We have to make it look like he was coming in!”\nJust be a little intelligent. It is said that intelligence is not of much use unless you are intelligent enough to know how to use it.\nJust the other day I came across a tremendously great discovery. It says that every idiot you meet in the world is the end-product of millions of years of evolution. Intelligence is certainly rare but the people who have gathered around me – just the fact that they had the courage to be here is enough proof of their intelligence. Now you have to put your intelligence into action.\n“My God,” sighed Paddy, “I had everything a man could want – the love of a gorgeous woman, a beautiful house, plenty of money, fine clothes.”\n“What happened?” asked Seamus.\n“What happened? Out of the blue without any hint of warning, my wife walked in.”\nJust be alert. There are dangers on every step. A man who decides to be a meditator has to be very cautious.\nLao Tzu’s statement is that a man of meditation walks always as if he is passing through an ice-cold stream in winter, very careful, very alert.\nUnless you are very careful and very alert, the millions-of-years-old mind and its functioning is going to be difficult to transcend. Although the strategy is simple, sometimes the simple seems to be the most difficult – and particularly when you are absolutely unacquainted with it.\nMeditation is only a word to you. It has not become a taste, it has not been a nourishment, it has not been an experience for you; hence I can understand your difficulty. But you have also to understand my difficulty: your diseases may be many, but I have only one medicine, and my difficulty is to go on selling the same medicine for different patients, different diseases. I don’t care what your disease is, because I know I have got only one medicine.\nWhatever your disease I will discuss it, but finally you have to accept the same medicine. It never changes. As far as I know, in these thirty-five years it has never changed. I have seen millions of people, millions of different questions, and even before I hear their questions, I know the answer. It does not matter what their question is; what matters is how to manage to bring their question to my answer.\nThe maths teacher turned to little Ernie and said, “Ernest, if your father borrowed three hundred dollars and promised to pay back fifteen dollars a week, how much would he owe at the end of ten weeks?”\n“Three hundred dollars,” Ernie quickly replied.\n“I am afraid,” said the teacher, “that you don’t know your maths very well.” “I am afraid,” said Ernie, “that you don’t know my father.”\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4294","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/>Satyam Shivam Sundram</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16 Going inwards, going godwards</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4294 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Satyam_Shivam_Sundram/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I DON’T WANT
TO SEE?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Amita, it is not only you; almost everybody is running as fast
as he can from himself. And the problem is, you cannot run away from
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever you go you will be yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The fear is of knowing oneself. It is the greatest fear in the world.
It is because you have been so immensely condemned by everybody for the
smallest things – for the smallest mistakes, which are absolutely human
– that you have become afraid of yourself. You know that you are not
worthy.</p><p><br></p><p>That idea has sunk very deep into your unconscious – that you are not
deserving, that you are utterly worthless. Naturally, the best way is to
get away from yourself. Everybody is doing it in different ways:
somebody is running for money, somebody is running for power, somebody
is running for respectability, somebody is running for virtue,
saintliness.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you look deep down, they are not running for anything, they
are running from. This is just an excuse, that somebody is running after
money madly; he is deceiving himself and the whole world. The reality is
that money gives him a good excuse to run after it, and hides the fact
that he is running from himself. That’s why when he accumulates money,
he comes to a point of tremendous</p><p>despair and anguish. What has happened? That was his goal; he has
achieved it – he should be the happiest man in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>But the people who succeed are not the happiest people in the world,
they are the most miserable. What is their anguish? Their anguish is
that their whole effort has failed. Now there is no more to run after,
and suddenly they are encountering themselves. At the highest peak of
their success they meet nobody else but themselves. Strangely enough,
this is the fellow they have been running from.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot run from yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, you have to come closer to yourself, deeper into
your being, and to drop all the condemnatory tones that have been handed
over to you by everybody you have known in your life. The parents, the
husband, the wife, the neighbors, the teachers, the friends, the
enemies, everybody is pointing to something that is wrong in you. From
no source comes any appreciation.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity has created a very strange situation for itself in which
nobody is at ease, nobody can relax, because the moment you relax you
face yourself. Relaxation becomes almost a mirror, and you don’t want to
see your face because you are so much impressed by the condemnatory
opinions of others.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the smallest pleasures have not been allowed to you by your
church, by your priests, by your religion, by your culture. Only misery
is acceptable – not pleasure. In this situation it is very natural for
you to feel, when from every source, from every direction comes only
condemnation, that you are a sinner. Every religion has been shouting
for centuries that you are born in sin, that suffering is your destiny.
You have been condemned from so many sources without exception that it
is very natural for any individual to be impressed by this vast
conspiracy. Everybody is caught into it.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you try to understand it you will be very much surprised. Just
as others have condemned you, you are condemning others; it is a very
mutual conspiracy. Just as your parents have never accepted you as being
of any worth, you are doing the same with your children, without ever
becoming aware that everybody is what he is; he cannot be otherwise. He
can pretend to be otherwise, he can be a hypocrite, but in truth he will
always remain himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Your running away is nothing but creating more hypocrisy, more masks
so that you can hide yourself completely from the eyes of everyone. You
may succeed in hiding yourself from others, but how can you succeed in
hiding yourself from yourself? You can go to the moon; you will find
yourself there. You can go to Everest; you may be alone but you are with
yourself. Perhaps in that aloneness on Everest you will become more
alert and aware of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the reasons why people are also afraid of aloneness;
they want a crowd, they want always to have people surrounding them,
they want friends. It is very difficult for people to remain silent and
peaceful in aloneness. The reason is that in aloneness you are left with
yourself – and you have accepted the stupid ideas that you are ugly,
that you are sensuous, that you are lustful, that you are greedy, that
you are violent; there is nothing that can be appreciated in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Amita, you are asking, “Why am I always running so fast?”
Because you are afraid you may be overtaken by yourself. And the
implications of running so fast have many dimensions. This running</p><p>fast from yourself has created a craziness about speed: everybody
wants to reach somewhere with as much speed as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once, I was coming from a place called Nagpur, back to
Jabalpur, and I was traveling with the vice-chancellor of Nagpur
University, and the car broke down on the road. I have never seen
anybody become so miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “There is no hurry. Nobody is waiting for your there, and
the conference for which you are going is going to begin in twenty-four
hours, and Jabalpur is only three hours away. There is no problem:
either we will get the car repaired, or we will call another car from
Jabalpur to come, or we may get some lift, or buses are continually
passing by. There is no problem... you need not be so miserable.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was sitting in the car and I went to look for somebody. It was a
small village, but maybe some mechanic or some help would be possible,
or perhaps the landlord of the village would have a car. When I came
back from the village, that man was almost in tears. I said, “What is
the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot afford to be alone. It exposes me so deeply, it
makes me utterly naked before myself. It makes me aware that I have
wasted my whole life – and I don’t want to know it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Your not knowing it is not going to help you in any way. It
is better to know it, and it is better to go deeper into yourself.
That’s why this misery and aloneness...”</p><p><br></p><p>Aloneness should be one of the greatest joys.</p><p><br></p><p>People are running. It does not matter where they are going; what
matters is whether they are going at full speed or not.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, Amita, “Is there something I don’t want to see?”
There are many things. Fundamentally, it is you that you don’t want to
see – and it is because of a wrong conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole approach of inner transformation is that you will have to
drop your conditionings. Whatever has been said about you by others,
simply drop it. It is absolutely crap. They don’t know about themselves;
what can they say about you which can be truthful?</p><p><br></p><p>And the opinions that you have collected from others... just try to
watch from whom you are collecting your opinions. They are not from a
Gautam Buddha, or from a Jesus, or from a Socrates; they are from people
who are as ignorant as you are. They are simply passing on others’
opinions that have been given to them.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful story. Whether it is factual or not does not
matter; its beauty is in its meaning. One of the greatest emperors India
has known was the Mogul emperor, Akbar. He can be compared only to one
man in the West, and that is Marcus Aurelius. Emperors are very rarely
wise people, but these two names are certainly exceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was in his court talking with his courtiers. He had
collected the best people in the country – the best painter, the best
musician, the best philosopher, the best poet. He had a small, special
committee of nine members who were known as the nine jewels of Akbar’s
court.</p><p>The most important of them was a man called Birbal. Immensely
intelligent and a man of great sense of humor, he did something which
was improper to do in front of the emperor. Every emperor has his own
rules – his word is the law – and Birbal behaved against something about
which Akbar was very stubborn. Akbar immediately slapped Birbal. He
respected Birbal, he loved Birbal, he was his most intimate friend, but
as far as the rules of the court were concerned... he could not
forgive.</p><p><br></p><p>But what Birbal did is the real story. He did not wait for a single
moment; he immediately slapped the man who was standing on his other
side. The other man was shocked, and even Akbar was shocked. He used to
think that this man is very wise: I she mad, or what? I have slapped
him... This is strange, absolutely absurd and illogical.</p><p><br></p><p>And the other man was standing there shocked and Birbal said, “Don’t
stand there like a fool, just pass it on!” So that man slapped somebody
else who was standing by the side – and now the game became clear: you
have to pass it on.</p><p><br></p><p>In the night, when Akbar went to sleep with his wife, his wife
slapped him. He said, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “It has been going on around the city, and finally it has
reached to its original source. Somebody else has slapped me, and when I
asked, ‘What is the matter?’, I was told that this is the game Akbar has
started. I thought it is better to finish it, to complete the
circle.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the next day, first thing, Birbal asked, “Have you received my
slap back or not?” Akbar said, “I had never thought that this would
happen!”</p><p>Birbal said, “I was absolutely certain, because where will it go
finally? It will go around the city. You cannot escape; it is bound to
come to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>For centuries everything goes on being transferred, being passed on
from one hand to another, from one generation to another generation –
and the game continues. This is the game that you have to come out of.
The only way to come out of it is to rediscover your self-respect,
attain again your dignity which you had when you were a child, when you
were still not contaminated, when you were not yet conditioned and
poisoned by the society and by the people around you.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a child again and you will not be running away from yourself. You
will be running within yourself – and that is the way of the meditator.
The worldly man runs away from himself, and the seeker runs within
himself to find the source of this life, this consciousness. And when he
discovers the source, he has discovered not only his life source, he has
discovered the life source of the universe, of the whole cosmos.</p><p><br></p><p>A tremendous celebration arises in him. Life becomes just a song, a
dance, moment to moment. One becomes absolutely free from all the jargon
that the society has handed down. One simply throws away all
conditionings, all traditions, the whole past.</p><p><br></p><p>I say unto you, only one thing you have to renounce, and that is the
past and nothing else.</p><p>If you can renounce the past you will be absolutely fresh, just born,
and to be in that freshness is such a blessing, such an ecstasy, you
cannot even think of going away even for a single moment. The man who
knows himself never takes any holiday. But most people go on behaving
stupidly.…</p><p><br></p><p>An American was driving along a small country lane in Ireland when he
was horrified to see a cartload of hay coming out of the field into the
narrow road. He jumped on the brakes but couldn’t stop in time, and
ended up driving through the fence into the field where the car burst
into flames.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bejabers!” exclaimed Paddy to his friend Seamus, who was driving the
hay cart, “Some of these tourists are terrible drivers. We only just got
out of that field in time.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old farmer, plowing his fields with a pair of bulls, was asked by
a neighbor why he did not use oxen.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t want to use oxen,” replied the farmer, “I want to use
bulls.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” continued the neighbor, “If you don’t want to use oxen, why
don’t you use horses?” “I don’t want to use horses!” retorted the
farmer, “I want to use bulls!”</p><p>“Well, perhaps,” tried the neighbor, you could try using that new
tractor your son has just bought.” “I don’t want to use tractors,
either, I want to use bulls.” reaffirmed the farmer.</p><p>“Why do you only want to use bulls?” asked the neighbor at a loss.
“Because,” said the old boy, “I don’t want them to think that life is
all romance.”</p><p>This is simply the situation in which you are born, in which you have
been conditioned. Nobody wants you to know that life is simply romance.
And that is my crime – because that is my whole teaching, that life is
nothing but romance.</p><p><br></p><p>The newlywed couple flew to Miami and checked into the honeymoon
hotel. For days nothing was seen of them, until the morning of the sixth
day, when they came to the dining room for breakfast. As the waiter
approached their table, the bride turned to her husband and said,
“Honey, do you know what I would like?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, I know,” he replied wearily, “but we have to eat sometime.”</p><p><br></p><p>So once in a while it is good to have a breakfast; otherwise, life is
a continuous romance. And I teach you not only the romance of the body,
which is very ordinary; I teach you the romance of the spirit which is
eternal, which begins but never ends. But this is possible only if you
start going inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Going inwards is going Godwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Going inwards is the whole secret of all alchemical transformation of
being. Running away is simply wasting tremendously valuable time, and a
life that could have been a great song, a great creativity, a</p><p>tremendous festival of lights. The farther away you are from
yourself, the darker your life will become, the more miserable, more
anxiety ridden, more wounded, condemned, rejected by yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And the farther away you are the more difficult it becomes to find
the way back home. You have been going away from yourself for many many
lives, but if you move on a right, meditative path you are not gone very
far.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the short cut from where you are to where you should
be. And meditation is such a simple method that anybody, even a small
child, can enter into its wonderland.</p><p><br></p><p>Amita, rather than running away, run withinwards. Come closer to
yourself to have a better look. Nobody else can see your inner reality;
only you can see that splendor and that glory. Because nobody else can
see your inner beauty they go on condemning you. Only you can assert
your blissfulness, only you can assert ultimately your
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Even then people will be suspicious. They were suspicious about
Socrates, they were suspicious about Gautam Buddha, they were suspicious
about Jesus. Their suspicion is rooted in fact in their own unawareness
of their inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>How can they believe Gautam Buddha, that in the inner silences of the
heart is the ultimate ecstasy? They don’t know anything of the inner,
not even the ABC. They don’t know anything about ecstasy. They may
listen to a Gautam Buddha, just because of his presence, his charismatic
eyes, his magnetic vibration, but when they go home, they will start
suspecting, doubting.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is happening even here. I receive many letters saying that
“when we listen to you everything seems to be absolutely right. As we
reach home doubts start arising; the mind starts saying to us that we
have been hypnotized.</p><p><br></p><p>There are millions of people who want to come close to me but are
afraid, for the simple reason that they may be hypnotized. It is
something far deeper than hypnosis. You are not hypnotized, you are
simply taken into a different vision of your own self. It is not
something like magic; you are not being befooled, you are being
awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘hypnosis’ means asleep, and my whole work is to awaken you.
You are already asleep and you have been asleep for lives together.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time to wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>You have wasted too much valuable time, energy, opportunity already.
But still there is time and the moment you wake up, for you the night
ends and the dawn begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE BARRIERS I HAVE BUILT UP
IN MYSELF OVER THE YEARS AGAINST BEING A JOYFUL SELF-LOVING OPEN BEING.
IT FEELS</p><p>LIKE THE WALL IN ME IS GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER THE MORE I AM
AWARE OF IT, AND I CAN’T COME THROUGH. DO I FIRST NEED MORE COURAGE?</p><p><br></p><p>MY BELOVED BEAUTIFUL MASTER, COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR
UNDERSTANDING?</p><p><br></p><p>Shunyam Para, it is the same question again. I have been answering
Amita but I have also answered you, although you have phrased your
question in a different way. A few small details are different;
otherwise it is the same problem. I will discuss those small differences
in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I am becoming more and more conscious of the barriers that
have built up in myself over the years against being a joyful
self-loving open being. It feels like the wall in me is getting stronger
and stronger the more I am aware of it, and I can’t come through.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to understand is that the wall is not becoming
stronger; it is only that your awareness is becoming clear. There is no
reason at all why the wall should become stronger when you are becoming
more aware. It is simply like when you bring the light in your dark
house, you start seeing the cobwebs and the spiders – not that they have
suddenly started growing because you have brought light in. They have
always been there; it is just that you are becoming aware, alert.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t think that they are growing. Your light has nothing to do
with their growth. Yes, it reveals their presence. Your growing
awareness is revealing the presence of your prison walls.</p><p><br></p><p>And you say, “I am aware of it and I can’t come through.” Because
these walls are not true walls – they are not made of bricks or stone,
they are made of only thoughts – they cannot prevent you. You just have
to know the secret of how to come through them. If you start struggling
within your thought processes, which constitute the prison walls, then
you will get into a tremendous mess. One can even go insane.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how people go insane: they are surrounded by so many thoughts
and they are trying hard to come out of the crowd and they go on getting
deeper and deeper into the crowd, and then naturally a breakdown
follows. Their nervous system cannot sustain so much pressure and so
much tension. They have opened Pandora’s box. It was all hidden there,
but they were blissfully unaware of it. Now they have brought a
meditative awareness; suddenly they see a great crowd so thick that the
more they try the more they feel their impotence against the walls that
are surrounding them.</p><p><br></p><p>If you start fighting with them then there is no way; you will become
sooner or later tired, tethered, you will find yourself slipping from
your sanity. But if you use a right method, instead of a breakdown you
will have a breakthrough. The right method to deal with all that you
feel you are surrounded with is to be just a witness – not to fight, not
to judge, not to condemn. Just remain silent and still, purely
witnessing whatever is there.</p><p><br></p><p>This is almost a miracle. I have not come across any miracle other
than the miracle of meditation, the miracle of witnessing. If you can
witness, you will be surprised that the strong wall is becoming thinner,
the crowd is dispersing; slowly, slowly you see doors and gaps through
which you can get out.</p><p>But there is no need to get out. Remain where you are. Just go on
witnessing. As your witnessing will become stronger, the wall that
surrounds you will become weaker. The day your witnessing will be
perfect, you will find there has been no wall, nothing is surrounding
you, the whole sky is available to you. Rather than fighting with
thoughts, fighting against wrong conditionings, just become a pure
witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting, you cannot win. Without fighting victory is yours.</p><p>Victory belongs only to those who can witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Hymie Goldberg was having trouble getting Becky, his wife, to make
love to him anymore. So one night just before bedtime, he offered her a
glass of water and two aspirins.</p><p><br></p><p>“What are you giving me these for?” Becky asked. “I have not got a
headache.” “Great,” said Hymie. “Let us get started.”</p><p>This headache was the problem. Every day, whenever poor Goldberg
would ask, the wife was having a great headache. This time he worked
through a different methodology. Becky could not understand that now he
is using a very wise strategy – offering aspirins even before she has
said she has a headache. So just be a little wise.…</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Klein finished the examination of his patient and then said,
“You are in perfect health, Mr. Levinsky, your heart, lungs, blood
pressure, cholesterol level, everything is fine.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Splendid,” said Mr. Levinsky.</p><p><br></p><p>“I will see you next year,” said Doctor Klein.</p><p><br></p><p>They shook hands, but as soon as the patient had left the room,
Doctor Klein heard a loud crash. He opened the door and there, flat on
his face, lay Mr. Levinsky. The nurse cried, “Doctor, he just collapsed.
He fell down like a rock.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor felt his heart and said, “My God, he is dead.” He even put
his hands under the corpse’s arms.</p><p><br></p><p>“Quick,” said the doctor, “take his feet!” “What?” cried the
nurse.</p><p>“For God’s sake,” said the doctor, “let us turn him round. We have to
make it look like he was coming in!”</p><p><br></p><p>Just be a little intelligent. It is said that intelligence is not of
much use unless you are intelligent enough to know how to use it.</p><p>Just the other day I came across a tremendously great discovery. It
says that every idiot you meet in the world is the end-product of
millions of years of evolution. Intelligence is certainly rare but the
people who have gathered around me – just the fact that they had the
courage to be here is enough proof of their intelligence. Now you have
to put your intelligence into action.</p><p><br></p><p>“My God,” sighed Paddy, “I had everything a man could want – the love
of a gorgeous woman, a beautiful house, plenty of money, fine
clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened?” asked Seamus.</p><p><br></p><p>“What happened? Out of the blue without any hint of warning, my wife
walked in.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just be alert. There are dangers on every step. A man who decides to
be a meditator has to be very cautious.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu’s statement is that a man of meditation walks always as if he
is passing through an ice-cold stream in winter, very careful, very
alert.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you are very careful and very alert, the millions-of-years-old
mind and its functioning is going to be difficult to transcend. Although
the strategy is simple, sometimes the simple seems to be the most
difficult – and particularly when you are absolutely unacquainted with
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is only a word to you. It has not become a taste, it has
not been a nourishment, it has not been an experience for you; hence I
can understand your difficulty. But you have also to understand my
difficulty: your diseases may be many, but I have only one medicine, and
my difficulty is to go on selling the same medicine for different
patients, different diseases. I don’t care what your disease is, because
I know I have got only one medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever your disease I will discuss it, but finally you have to
accept the same medicine. It never changes. As far as I know, in these
thirty-five years it has never changed. I have seen millions of people,
millions of different questions, and even before I hear their questions,

AND THEN I AM AT THE CENTER OF EXPERIENCING MY MIND, MY BODY, AND WHAT COMES TO MY SENSES. THIS FEELS ECSTATIC, YET IS VERY SUBTLE, AND EASILY DISAPPEARS WHEN I AGAIN IDENTIFY WITH WHAT IS EXPERIENCED. IS THIS MY MIND ENTERING BY A BACK DOOR, OR AM I GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION?\nPrem Vijen, the experience that you are going through happens to everyone when he first comes into contact with his being. Our whole experience of the past is of identification. When you are full of anger, you don’t say, “I see anger in my mind,” you say “I am angry.” In fact you are not angry, you are just a watcher. The anger is on the screen of the mind.\nBut identification is the greatest spiritual disease. We get very easily identified because for centuries that has been our habit. So when for the first time you get out of identification, you become centered, naturally you cannot see your being, just as you cannot see your eyes.\nTo see your eyes you need a mirror and to see your being you need a master, or someone who is already totally centered. In his presence you may be able to see reflected – just as in a mirror things are reflected – your being. But you cannot see directly your being.\nI have been telling you many functions of the master. This is one of the most subtle and perhaps the last function. The master is already settled. You are wavering: one moment you are at the center,\nthen you can see your body and your mind and your thoughts and feelings. There is a gap between you and your body-mind system. But the gap is very small and very fresh, and the habit of being identified is very old and very strong.\nSo one moment you feel you are the being... but the very desire to see the being disturbs the whole thing. You cannot see it. You need a mirror to see it, and no ordinary mirror will do. You need a mirror of consciousness... And then too you will not be seeing your being, just the reflection of it. In the completely silent and settled lake of somebody’s consciousness, you may be able to see a reflection of your being.\nBut to try to see your being alone is not possible; it just is not in the nature of things. You can be the being – you are the being. You can experience the ecstasy of being there at the very center; you can feel immense joy, fulfillment, contentment. But the moment the desire to see it arises you have already slipped out of it, you have come back into the mind.\nBecause the gap is very small you will not even be aware when you are slipping. But it is a tremendously significant experience that you are going through. If the gap is small today, tomorrow it may be bigger. If the gap has already happened, the day is not far away when the desire to see yourself will disappear.\nYou will simply be yourself, full of ecstasy. And as you become centered, everything else – your body, your mind, your thoughts – will go on becoming farther away from you. Just a little patience, and just a little awareness...\nYou say, “It is very subtle and easily disappears when I again identify with what is experienced.” Being is never experienced. Experience means a memory, it is already past. Being is always a process of experiencing.\nPerhaps the word experiencing does not exist in the dictionaries, but that’s exactly the existential situation. It is always a process which goes on deepening. You can never come to a moment when you can say, “I have experienced.” That will be the moment when you have fallen out of the flow of experiencing.\n“Is this my mind,” you are asking, “entering by a back door, or am I going in the right direction?” Both are true. When you are centered within yourself and feeling ecstatic, you are going in the right direction. The moment you start thinking about it, what this experience is, how to see it, the mind is coming from the back door.\nYou have to avoid the mind completely. As far as you are concerned, there is no enemy in the whole world except mind. Mind is your enemy for the simple reason that your whole experience of past is accumulated there.\nAnd you have always experienced identificationYou say, “I am thirsty, I am hungry,” without ever\nthinking what you are saying. Just look at the process: are you really hungry, or are you aware that there is hunger in your body? Are you really thirsty, or can you experience the thirst in your throat, in your body?\nBut because of the language which has been made up by people who are not enlightened... There exists no enlightened language in the world yet – and perhaps never will exist – for the simple reason that language is needed for communication.\nThere are only three possibilities of communication. Two ignorant persons can communicate very easily; they are in the same boat. They are surrounded by the same darkness, their identifications are same.\nSecondly, communication is a little difficult, but can happen, between an enlightened person and one who is ignorant. The difficulty is created by the ignorant person, because he knows the language of ignorance but he does not know the language of enlightenment; hence, constant misunderstanding. But the enlightened people of the world have tried their hardest somehow to reach you. They have succeeded in reaching a few people only. The task seems to be immensely difficult.\nAnd there is a third possibility – two enlightened people. But they will sit in silence, that is their communication. So I don’t see any possibility that there will ever be an enlightened language.\nThe language that we have created is basically faulty. For example, when you say “the tree,” you make a noun of a process. The tree is not static; it is treeing, it is growing. Even when you see with your own eyes a river flowing, you don’t use the word rivering, you use the word river. River makes it something static. It never is – not even for a single moment. It is constantly flowing; that’s its intrinsic nature.\nThe same is true about everything that we have made static. You are growing, even this very moment. When you came this morning to see me you were younger; now you are a little older. By the time you will be going, you will be very much older.\nExistence consists not of nouns and pronouns; existence consists only of processes. Hence, we cannot use the word experience, we can only use the word experiencing. We cannot use the word love, we can only use the word loving. We cannot use the word friendship, we can only use the word friendliness.\nBut then talking with people will become impossible: “I am coming from rivering. On the way I saw many people becoming old.” People will think you have gone cuckoo. In fact you are stating\nthe actual facticity, the very existential nature of things, beings. Everything is always in constant movement; howsoever slow, the movement is there.\nYou have to learn something very basic that in the inward world, please, don’t use the wrong language. The wrong language is not only a mistaken language, it becomes your mind also. And your mind is full of all wrong identifications of the past.\nYou are entering into a totally new territory of your being. This territory belongs to no language, it belongs only to silence. So when it happens, remain utterly silent and relish it. Rejoice in it, feel it, taste it, but don’t try to see it. Don’t try to figure out what is happening. Don’t bring your logic in and don’t bring your old intellectual acumen to try to understand something which is beyond intellect.\nSoon the gaps will become bigger, and a day finally comes, Vijen, when you are settled and nothing can distract you from your being. You will see your mind and you will see your body, but on the\nperiphery. And even when they are taken away, killed and destroyed, you will not be affected because you are no more identified.\nIt is the identification that has to be understood.\nA man had a very beautiful house that even the king wanted to purchase. He had made it with such love – he himself was an architect – and the king was jealous because even his palace was not so beautiful. All sorts of rich people had offered that whatever money he wanted he could have, but the man always refused. The palace that he had made was a small palace, hidden in a thick garden, with shrubs, rosebushes. One day he had gone out and when he came home there was a vast crowd and his house was on fire. Either it may have been the conspiracy of the king or the conspiracy of other people who were very jealous of his house. He was an old man, but tears started flowing from his ... eyes. It was not just a house for him, it was his very creativity. He was so identified with it, as if it was not the house burning but him. Such a deep attachment...\nAnd then his son came running and told him, “Father, you need not cry for that house. Last night I sold it to the king. He was offering any price we want and there was no question of any negotiation, so I asked three times the price. We can make a house three times bigger, and then the king will know... It is already old and you have so many new ideas, it is a good opportunity.”\nThe moment he heard that the house was sold, tears disappeared. In fact he started laughing – this is a great coincidence. He started talking with son and with his neighbors, “Perhaps I may purchase the land back, because what is the king going to do with the land? And I will make a three times bigger and more beautiful palace.” He started already dreaming about the future, and the palace was burning.\nHis second son came running and he told him, “Yes, my older brother is right. We had agreed to sell, but it was only verbal. Neither had the money been given to us, nor had even a sales deed been written. We were waiting for you.” Again the tears came – because now the king is not going to purchase it, he is not going to give the money. He forgot all about the palace three times bigger and he was again crying like a small child. What happened?\nThe attachment... the identification... the moment you are unidentified with your body, even if the body is on the funeral pyre there will be no problem for you. It is as if somebody else is being burned. You can also stand by the side in the crowd and nobody will see you.\nTo be in the being, more and more one has to learn unidentification with everything. Use everything but don’t get attached. I have been telling you to be in the world but don’t be of the world. Be in the world, but don’t let the world enter in you. I have been saying the same thing in other words. Don’t be identified. Use this whole existence, but don’t be possessive. Remain aloof, aware and silently watching.\nA man had been bitten by a dog, but did not give it much thought until he noticed that the wound was taking a remarkably long time to heal. Finally he consulted a doctor who took one look at the wound and ordered the dog brought in.\nJust as the doctor suspected, the dog had rabies. Since it was too late to give the patient a serum the doctor felt he had to prepare him for the worst.\nThe poor man sat down at the doctor’s desk and began to write. The physician tried to comfort him. “Perhaps it won’t be so bad,” he said. “You needn’t make out your will right now.”\n“I’m not making out my will or anything,” replied the man. “I’m just writing out a list of people I’m going to bite.”\nThis is awareness. Even in such a bad situation he is not identified with the body or death or anything. He is calm and cool and writing a list of the people in the city, all of whom at least he will bite before dying. A very alert mind, a very centered being.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nRELAXATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE STATES OF BEING FOR ME. “WATCHFULNESS” SEEMS TO BE POSSIBLE ONLY THEN, OR AT LEAST SO MUCH EASIER. BELOVED MASTER, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON HOW “RELAXATION” IS CONNECTED TO “AWARENESS”?\nSadhan, they are not only connected with each other, they are almost two sides of the same coin. You cannot separate them. Either you can begin with awareness, and then you will find yourself relaxing... What is your tension? Your identification with all kinds of thoughts, fears, death, bankruptcy, the dollar going down... all kinds of fears are there. These are your tensions, and they affect your body also. Your body also becomes tense, because body and mind are not two separate entities. Body-mind is a single system, so when the mind becomes tense, the body becomes tense.\nYou can start with awareness; then awareness takes you away from the mind and the identifications with the mind. Naturally, the body starts relaxing. You are no more attached, and tensions cannot exist in the light of awareness.\nYou can start from the other end also. Just relax... let all tensions drop... and as you relax you will be surprised that a certain awareness is arising in you. They are inseparable. But to start from awareness is easier; to start with relaxation is a little difficult, because even the effort to relax creates a certain tension.\nThere is an American book – and if you want to discover all kinds of stupid books, America is the place. The moment I saw the title of the book, I could not believe it. The title is, YOU MUST RELAX. Now if the must is there, how can you relax? The must will make you tense; the very word immediately creates tension. ‘Must’ comes like a commandment from God. Perhaps the person who is writing the book knows nothing about relaxation and knows nothing about the complexities of relaxation.\nHence, in the East we have never started meditation from relaxation; we have started meditation from awareness. Then relaxation comes on its own accord, you don’t have to bring it. If you have to bring it there will be a certain tension. It should come on its own; then only will it be pure relaxation. And it comes.…\nIf you want to you can try from relaxation, but not according to American advisors. In the sense of experience of the inner world, America is the most childish place on the earth. Europe is a little older – but the East has lived for thousands of years in the search for its inner self.\nAmerica is only three hundred years old – in the life of a nation three hundred years are nothing – hence, America is the greatest danger to the world. Nuclear weapons in the hands of children... Russia will behave more rationally; it is an old and ancient land and has all the experiences of a long history. In America there is no history. Everybody knows his father’s name, forefather’s name and that’s all. There your family tree ends.\nIn India it is very difficult. One of the scholars of this very city, Lokmanya Tilak, proved – and his proof has not yet been disproved by any argument by other scholars. Now almost the whole century has passed, but his evidence is such that it cannot be disproved.\nThe Western scholars used to argue that RIGVEDA, the most ancient book in the world, is five thousand years old. There was a difficulty because according to Christianity God created the world four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ, so now it is only six thousand years old. Now they have to put everything, fit everything into six thousand years; beyond that they cannot go. Going beyond means going against Christianity, against THE BIBLE, against Jesus Christ, and it is too risky.\nLokmanya Tilak proved with intrinsic logic that in RIGVEDA there is a description of a certain constellation of stars about which astronomers are absolutely certain that it happened ninety thousand years ago. There is no way to describe it unless these people had been the observers of that constellation, and it has not happened since then.\nLokmanya Tilak proved that RIGVEDA may not be older, but it is certainly ninety thousand years old. And one thing brings another thing in. In RIGVEDA, the founder of Jainism, Adinatha, is mentioned with great respect. That means that if Hinduism is ninety thousand years old, Jainism must be even older, because nobody talks with such respect about contemporaries – particularly contemporaries who are not willing to agree with you.\nAdinatha did not agree on any point with Hinduism; that makes it certain that he was not a contemporary. Perhaps by the time RIGVEDA was written, he had been dead for a thousand years. People have a certain tendency to be respectful about the dead, and the longer they are dead, the more respectful they become. So I am giving you a recipe: if you want to become respectable, be dead, and everybody will be respectful to you.\nHave you watched? – when somebody dies, nobody speaks anything against him. It is simply etiquette and mannerism.\nIn one small town a man died. The tradition is that before a man is lowered down into his grave somebody should say some good things about him. Everybody looked at each other – but because he was such a rascal they could not find single word. He had tortured almost everybody in the town; he was such a harassment that everybody was deep down very happy that finally he had died: “Now we can relax a little.” So nobody was ready to say something good about the man, because everybody knew that people would laugh if they said something good.\nFinally one man stood up and said, “Compared to his other four brothers he was an angel. His other four brothers are still alive; you should not forget that fact.” And it was true; those other four brothers were even more nasty, more dangerous. But he managed to say something good about the man – that compared to the four brothers he was an angel.\nRIGVEDA mentioning Adinatha with deep respect can mean only one thing, that Adinatha was dead long before. About contemporaries, it is very difficult, it hurts your ego... and particularly for those who are not in agreement with you. Not only that, but their arguments are far superior to yours and you cannot even answer them. Then it becomes very difficult to respect them, and condemnation comes on them from all sides. But RIGVEDA has a whole passage devoted just to making Adinatha almost a god, with not a single word of criticism.\nOn this point Jainism can be said to be even older than ninety thousand years. Now, these people have history. America is just a baby – or not even a baby, just in pregnancy. Compared to ninety thousand years... maybe it has just been conceived. It is dangerous to give these people nuclear weapons.\nThere are political, religious, sociological, economical problems, all torturing you. To begin with relaxation is difficult; hence, in the East we have never started from relaxation. But if you want to, I have a certain idea how you should start. I have been working with my Western sannyasins and I have become aware of the fact that they don’t belong to the East and they don’t know the Eastern current of consciousness; they are coming from a different tradition which has never known any awareness.\nFor the Western sannyasins especially, I have created meditations like dynamic meditation. While I was taking camps of meditators I used a gibberish meditation and the kundalini meditation. If you want to start from relaxation, then these meditations have to be done first. They will take out all tensions from your mind and body, and then relaxation is very easy. You don’t know how much you are holding in, and that that is the cause of tension.\nWhen I was allowing gibberish meditation in the camps in the mountains... It is difficult to allow it here because the neighbors start going mad. They start phoning the police and the commissioner, saying, “Our whole life is being destroyed!” They don’t know that if they would participate in their own houses, their lives would come out of the insanity in which they are living. But they are not even aware of their insanity.\nThe gibberish meditation was that everybody was allowed to say loudly whatever comes into his mind. And it was such a joy to hear what people were saying, irrelevant, absurd – because I was the only witness. People were doing all kinds of things, and the only condition was that you should not touch anybody else. You could do whatever you wanted.Somebody was standing on his head,\nsomebody had thrown off his clothes and become naked, running all around – for the whole hour.\nOne man used to sit every day in front me – he must have been a broker or something – and as the meditation would begin, first he would smile, just at the idea of what he was going to do. Then he would take up his phone, “Hello, hello” From the his corner of his eyes he would go on looking\nat me. I would avoid looking at him so as not to disturb his meditation. He was selling his shares, purchasing – the whole hour he was on the phone.\nEverybody was doing the strange things that they were holding back. When the meditation would end there were ten minutes for relaxation and you could see that in those ten minutes people fell down – not with any effort, but because they were utterly tired. All the rubbish had been thrown out, so they had a certain cleanliness, and they relaxed. Thousands of people... and you could not even think that there were a thousand people.\nPeople used to come to me and say, “Prolong those ten minutes, because in our whole life we have never seen such relaxation, such joy. We had never thought we would ever understand what awareness is, but we felt it was coming.”\nSo if you want to start with relaxation, first you have to go through a cathartic process. Dynamic meditation, latihan, kundalini or gibberish. You may not know from where this word gibberish comes; it comes from a Sufi mystic whose name was Jabbar – and that was his only meditation. Whoever would come, he would say, “Sit down and start” – and people knew what he meant. He never talked, he never gave any discourses; he simply taught people gibberish.\nFor example, once in a while he would give people a demonstration. For half an hour he would talk all kinds of nonsense in nobody knows what language. It was not a language; he would go on teaching people just whatever came to his mind. That was his only teaching – and to those who had understood it he would simply say, “Sit down and start.”\nBut Jabbar helped many people to become utterly silent. How long you can go on? – the mind becomes empty. Slowly, slowly a deep nothingness... and in that nothingness a flame of awareness. It is always present, surrounded by your gibberish. The gibberish has to be taken out; that is your poison.\nThe same is true about the body. Your body has tensions. Just start making any movements that the body wants to make. You should not manipulate it. If it wants to dance, it wants to jog, it wants to run, it wants to roll down on the ground, you should not do it, you should simply allow it. Tell the body, “You are free, do whatever you want” – and you will be surprised,” My God. All these things the body wanted to do but I was holding back, and that was the tension.”\nSo there are two kinds of tension, the body tensions and the mind tensions. Both have to be released before you can start relaxation, which will bring you to awareness.\nBut beginning from awareness is far easier, and particularly for those who can understand the process of awareness, which is very simple. The whole day you are using it about things – cars, in the traffic – even in the Poona traffic you survive! It is absolutely mad.\nJust a few days ago I read about Athens. Athens is even worse than Poona. The government made a special seven day competition for the taxi drivers and they had put golden trophies for those who were the best at following traffic rules, the second and the third. But in the whole of Athens they could not find a single person. The police were getting worried; the days were almost finished, and the last day they wanted to find anyhow three – they may not be perfect, but those prizes had to be distributed.\nOne man they found was following the traffic rules exactly, so they were very happy. They rushed towards him with the trophy, but seeing the police coming towards him the man went against a red\nlight. Who wants to get unnecessarily into trouble? The police were shouting, “Wait!” – but he did not listen, he was immediately gone, against the light. They tried with two other people, but nobody would stop, seeing the police. So after seven days’ effort, those three prizes are still sitting in the headquarters of the police, and Athens is going on as rejoicingly as ever.\nYou can have a little taste in Poona, but still you survive because you remain alert, aware. Perhaps the worst traffic situation is in Italy. That’s why I was telling you the other day that the people who sell cars have come to the conclusion that if the man first tries to look at the engine of the car he is a German. If the man first looks at the beautiful lines and curves of the car he is French. But if the man first looks at the horn, whether it works or not, he is an Italian – because the real thing is the horn, otherwise you cannot survive.\nYou are using awareness without being aware of it, but only about outside things. It is the same awareness that has to be used for the inside traffic. When you close your eyes there is a traffic of thoughts, emotions, dreams, imaginations; all kinds of things start flashing by.\nWhat you have been doing in the outside world, do exactly the same with the inside world and you will become a witness. And once tasted, the joy of being a witness is so great, so other-worldly that you would like to go more and more in. Whenever you find time you would like to go more and more in.\nIt is not a question of any posture; it is not a question of any temple, of any church or synagogue. Sitting in a public bus or in a railway train, when you have nothing to do just close your eyes. It will save your eyes being tired from looking outside, and it will give you time enough to watch yourself. Those moments will become moments of the most beautiful experiences.\nAnd slowly, slowly, as awareness grows your whole personality starts changing. From unawareness to awareness is the greatest quantum leap.\nHymie Goldberg was on holiday in Ireland, driving his new Mercedes. He came to a small farm where the road went right through a large puddle. Paddy was standing next to it, so Hymie leaned out and asked if the puddle was shallow.\nPaddy said, “Yes,” so Hymie drove on, only to have his car sink slowly out of sight.\nSpluttering with rage and dripping wet, Hymie shouted at Paddy, “You idiot! Why the hell did you tell me it was shallow enough to drive through?”\nPaddy scratched his head and said, “I don’t understand it. The water only came half way up my ducks.”\nJust learn to be aware in all situations. Make a point of using every situation for awareness. A man rushed into the “Pig and Whistle” pub in great agitation.\n“Does anyone own a great big black cat with a white collar?” he said in a nervous voice. There was no reply.\n“Well, does anyone know of a large black cat with a white collar?” asked the man again, raising his voice above the general noise of the bar.

AND THEN I AM AT THE CENTER OF EXPERIENCING MY MIND, MY BODY, AND WHAT
COMES TO MY SENSES. THIS FEELS ECSTATIC, YET IS VERY SUBTLE, AND EASILY
DISAPPEARS WHEN I AGAIN IDENTIFY WITH WHAT IS EXPERIENCED. IS THIS MY
MIND ENTERING BY A BACK DOOR, OR AM I GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION?</p><p>Prem Vijen, the experience that you are going through happens to
everyone when he first comes into contact with his being. Our whole
experience of the past is of identification. When you are full of anger,
you don’t say, “I see anger in my mind,” you say “I am angry.” In fact
you are not angry, you are just a watcher. The anger is on the screen of
the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>But identification is the greatest spiritual disease. We get very
easily identified because for centuries that has been our habit. So when
for the first time you get out of identification, you become centered,
naturally you cannot see your being, just as you cannot see your
eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>To see your eyes you need a mirror and to see your being you need a
master, or someone who is already totally centered. In his presence you
may be able to see reflected – just as in a mirror things are reflected
– your being. But you cannot see directly your being.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been telling you many functions of the master. This is one of
the most subtle and perhaps the last function. The master is already
settled. You are wavering: one moment you are at the center,</p><p>then you can see your body and your mind and your thoughts and
feelings. There is a gap between you and your body-mind system. But the
gap is very small and very fresh, and the habit of being identified is
very old and very strong.</p><p><br></p><p>So one moment you feel you are the being... but the very desire to
see the being disturbs the whole thing. You cannot see it. You need a
mirror to see it, and no ordinary mirror will do. You need a mirror of
consciousness... And then too you will not be seeing your being, just
the reflection of it. In the completely silent and settled lake of
somebody’s consciousness, you may be able to see a reflection of your
being.</p><p><br></p><p>But to try to see your being alone is not possible; it just is not in
the nature of things. You can be the being – you are the being. You can
experience the ecstasy of being there at the very center; you can feel
immense joy, fulfillment, contentment. But the moment the desire to see
it arises you have already slipped out of it, you have come back into
the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Because the gap is very small you will not even be aware when you are
slipping. But it is a tremendously significant experience that you are
going through. If the gap is small today, tomorrow it may be bigger. If
the gap has already happened, the day is not far away when the desire to
see yourself will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>You will simply be yourself, full of ecstasy. And as you become
centered, everything else – your body, your mind, your thoughts – will
go on becoming farther away from you. Just a little patience, and just a
little awareness...</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “It is very subtle and easily disappears when I again
identify with what is experienced.” Being is never experienced.
Experience means a memory, it is already past. Being is always a process
of experiencing.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the word experiencing does not exist in the dictionaries, but
that’s exactly the existential situation. It is always a process which
goes on deepening. You can never come to a moment when you can say, “I
have experienced.” That will be the moment when you have fallen out of
the flow of experiencing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Is this my mind,” you are asking, “entering by a back door, or am I
going in the right direction?” Both are true. When you are centered
within yourself and feeling ecstatic, you are going in the right
direction. The moment you start thinking about it, what this experience
is, how to see it, the mind is coming from the back door.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to avoid the mind completely. As far as you are concerned,
there is no enemy in the whole world except mind. Mind is your enemy for
the simple reason that your whole experience of past is accumulated
there.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have always experienced identification<span class=s4></span>You say, “I am thirsty, I am hungry,” without ever</p><p>thinking what you are saying. Just look at the process: are you
really hungry, or are you aware that there is hunger in your body? Are
you really thirsty, or can you experience the thirst in your throat, in
your body?</p><p>But because of the language which has been made up by people who are
not enlightened... There exists no enlightened language in the world yet
– and perhaps never will exist – for the simple reason that language is
needed for communication.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only three possibilities of communication. Two ignorant
persons can communicate very easily; they are in the same boat. They are
surrounded by the same darkness, their identifications are same.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, communication is a little difficult, but can happen,
between an enlightened person and one who is ignorant. The difficulty is
created by the ignorant person, because he knows the language of
ignorance but he does not know the language of enlightenment; hence,
constant misunderstanding. But the enlightened people of the world have
tried their hardest somehow to reach you. They have succeeded in
reaching a few people only. The task seems to be immensely
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is a third possibility – two enlightened people. But they
will sit in silence, that is their communication. So I don’t see any
possibility that there will ever be an enlightened language.</p><p><br></p><p>The language that we have created is basically faulty. For example,
when you say “the tree,” you make a noun of a process. The tree is not
static; it is treeing, it is growing. Even when you see with your own
eyes a river flowing, you don’t use the word rivering, you use the word
river. River makes it something static. It never is – not even for a
single moment. It is constantly flowing; that’s its intrinsic
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about everything that we have made static. You are
growing, even this very moment. When you came this morning to see me you
were younger; now you are a little older. By the time you will be going,
you will be very much older.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence consists not of nouns and pronouns; existence consists only
of processes. Hence, we cannot use the word experience, we can only use
the word experiencing. We cannot use the word love, we can only use the
word loving. We cannot use the word friendship, we can only use the word
friendliness.</p><p><br></p><p>But then talking with people will become impossible: “I am coming
from rivering. On the way I saw many people becoming old.<span class=s4></span>” People will think you have gone cuckoo. In fact you
are stating</p><p>the actual facticity, the very existential nature of things, beings.
Everything is always in constant movement; howsoever slow, the movement
is there.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to learn something very basic that in the inward world,
please, don’t use the wrong language. The wrong language is not only a
mistaken language, it becomes your mind also. And your mind is full of
all wrong identifications of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>You are entering into a totally new territory of your being. This
territory belongs to no language, it belongs only to silence. So when it
happens, remain utterly silent and relish it. Rejoice in it, feel it,
taste it, but don’t try to see it. Don’t try to figure out what is
happening. Don’t bring your logic in and don’t bring your old
intellectual acumen to try to understand something which is beyond
intellect.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon the gaps will become bigger, and a day finally comes, Vijen,
when you are settled and nothing can distract you from your being. You
will see your mind and you will see your body, but on the</p><p>periphery. And even when they are taken away, killed and destroyed,
you will not be affected because you are no more identified.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the identification that has to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>A man had a very beautiful house that even the king wanted to
purchase. He had made it with such love – he himself was an architect –
and the king was jealous because even his palace was not so beautiful.
All sorts of rich people had offered that whatever money he wanted he
could have, but the man always refused. The palace that he had made was
a small palace, hidden in a thick garden, with shrubs, rosebushes. One
day he had gone out and when he came home there was a vast crowd and his
house was on fire. Either it may have been the conspiracy of the king or
the conspiracy of other people who were very jealous of his house. He
was an old man, but tears started flowing from his ... eyes. It was not
just a house for him, it was his very creativity. He was so identified
with it, as if it was not the house burning but him. Such a deep
attachment...</p><p><br></p><p>And then his son came running and told him, “Father, you need not cry
for that house. Last night I sold it to the king. He was offering any
price we want and there was no question of any negotiation, so I asked
three times the price. We can make a house three times bigger, and then
the king will know... It is already old and you have so many new ideas,
it is a good opportunity.”</p><p><br></p><p>The moment he heard that the house was sold, tears disappeared. In
fact he started laughing – this is a great coincidence. He started
talking with son and with his neighbors, “Perhaps I may purchase the
land back, because what is the king going to do with the land? And I
will make a three times bigger and more beautiful palace.” He started
already dreaming about the future, and the palace was burning.</p><p><br></p><p>His second son came running and he told him, “Yes, my older brother
is right. We had agreed to sell, but it was only verbal. Neither had the
money been given to us, nor had even a sales deed been written. We were
waiting for you.” Again the tears came – because now the king is not
going to purchase it, he is not going to give the money. He forgot all
about the palace three times bigger and he was again crying like a small
child. What happened?</p><p><br></p><p>The attachment... the identification... the moment you are
unidentified with your body, even if the body is on the funeral pyre
there will be no problem for you. It is as if somebody else is being
burned. You can also stand by the side in the crowd and nobody will see
you.</p><p><br></p><p>To be in the being, more and more one has to learn unidentification
with everything. Use everything but don’t get attached. I have been
telling you to be in the world but don’t be of the world. Be in the
world, but don’t let the world enter in you. I have been saying the same
thing in other words. Don’t be identified. Use this whole existence, but
don’t be possessive. Remain aloof, aware and silently watching.</p><p><br></p><p>A man had been bitten by a dog, but did not give it much thought
until he noticed that the wound was taking a remarkably long time to
heal. Finally he consulted a doctor who took one look at the wound and
ordered the dog brought in.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as the doctor suspected, the dog had rabies. Since it was too
late to give the patient a serum the doctor felt he had to prepare him
for the worst.</p><p>The poor man sat down at the doctor’s desk and began to write. The
physician tried to comfort him. “Perhaps it won’t be so bad,” he said.
“You needn’t make out your will right now.”</p><p>“I’m not making out my will or anything,” replied the man. “I’m just
writing out a list of people I’m going to bite.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is awareness. Even in such a bad situation he is not identified
with the body or death or anything. He is calm and cool and writing a
list of the people in the city, all of whom at least he will bite before
dying. A very alert mind, a very centered being.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>RELAXATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE STATES OF BEING
FOR ME. “WATCHFULNESS” SEEMS TO BE POSSIBLE ONLY THEN, OR AT LEAST SO
MUCH EASIER. BELOVED MASTER, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON HOW
“RELAXATION” IS CONNECTED TO “AWARENESS”?</p><p><br></p><p>Sadhan, they are not only connected with each other, they are almost
two sides of the same coin. You cannot separate them. Either you can
begin with awareness, and then you will find yourself relaxing... What
is your tension? Your identification with all kinds of thoughts, fears,
death, bankruptcy, the dollar going down... all kinds of fears are
there. These are your tensions, and they affect your body also. Your
body also becomes tense, because body and mind are not two separate
entities. Body-mind is a single system, so when the mind becomes tense,
the body becomes tense.</p><p><br></p><p>You can start with awareness; then awareness takes you away from the
mind and the identifications with the mind. Naturally, the body starts
relaxing. You are no more attached, and tensions cannot exist in the
light of awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>You can start from the other end also. Just relax... let all tensions
drop... and as you relax you will be surprised that a certain awareness
is arising in you. They are inseparable. But to start from awareness is
easier; to start with relaxation is a little difficult, because even the
effort to relax creates a certain tension.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an American book – and if you want to discover all kinds of
stupid books, America is the place. The moment I saw the title of the
book, I could not believe it. The title is, YOU MUST RELAX. Now if the
must is there, how can you relax? The must will make you tense; the very
word immediately creates tension. ‘Must’ comes like a commandment from
God. Perhaps the person who is writing the book knows nothing about
relaxation and knows nothing about the complexities of relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, in the East we have never started meditation from relaxation;
we have started meditation from awareness. Then relaxation comes on its
own accord, you don’t have to bring it. If you have to bring it there
will be a certain tension. It should come on its own; then only will it
be pure relaxation. And it comes.…</p><p>If you want to you can try from relaxation, but not according to
American advisors. In the sense of experience of the inner world,
America is the most childish place on the earth. Europe is a little
older – but the East has lived for thousands of years in the search for
its inner self.</p><p><br></p><p>America is only three hundred years old – in the life of a nation
three hundred years are nothing – hence, America is the greatest danger
to the world. Nuclear weapons in the hands of children... Russia will
behave more rationally; it is an old and ancient land and has all the
experiences of a long history. In America there is no history. Everybody
knows his father’s name, forefather’s name and that’s all. There your
family tree ends.</p><p><br></p><p>In India it is very difficult. One of the scholars of this very city,
Lokmanya Tilak, proved – and his proof has not yet been disproved by any
argument by other scholars. Now almost the whole century has passed, but
his evidence is such that it cannot be disproved.</p><p><br></p><p>The Western scholars used to argue that RIGVEDA, the most ancient
book in the world, is five thousand years old. There was a difficulty
because according to Christianity God created the world four thousand
and four years before Jesus Christ, so now it is only six thousand years
old. Now they have to put everything, fit everything into six thousand
years; beyond that they cannot go. Going beyond means going against
Christianity, against THE BIBLE, against Jesus Christ, and it is too
risky.</p><p><br></p><p>Lokmanya Tilak proved with intrinsic logic that in RIGVEDA there is a
description of a certain constellation of stars about which astronomers
are absolutely certain that it happened ninety thousand years ago. There
is no way to describe it unless these people had been the observers of
that constellation, and it has not happened since then.</p><p><br></p><p>Lokmanya Tilak proved that RIGVEDA may not be older, but it is
certainly ninety thousand years old. And one thing brings another thing
in. In RIGVEDA, the founder of Jainism, Adinatha, is mentioned with
great respect. That means that if Hinduism is ninety thousand years old,
Jainism must be even older, because nobody talks with such respect about
contemporaries – particularly contemporaries who are not willing to
agree with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Adinatha did not agree on any point with Hinduism; that makes it
certain that he was not a contemporary. Perhaps by the time RIGVEDA was
written, he had been dead for a thousand years. People have a certain
tendency to be respectful about the dead, and the longer they are dead,
the more respectful they become. So I am giving you a recipe: if you
want to become respectable, be dead, and everybody will be respectful to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you watched? – when somebody dies, nobody speaks anything
against him. It is simply etiquette and mannerism.</p><p><br></p><p>In one small town a man died. The tradition is that before a man is
lowered down into his grave somebody should say some good things about
him. Everybody looked at each other – but because he was such a rascal
they could not find single word. He had tortured almost everybody in the
town; he was such a harassment that everybody was deep down very happy
that finally he had died: “Now we can relax a little.” So nobody was
ready to say something good about the man, because everybody knew that
people would laugh if they said something good.</p><p>Finally one man stood up and said, “Compared to his other four
brothers he was an angel. His other four brothers are still alive; you
should not forget that fact.” And it was true; those other four brothers
were even more nasty, more dangerous. But he managed to say something
good about the man – that compared to the four brothers he was an
angel.</p><p><br></p><p>RIGVEDA mentioning Adinatha with deep respect can mean only one
thing, that Adinatha was dead long before. About contemporaries, it is
very difficult, it hurts your ego... and particularly for those who are
not in agreement with you. Not only that, but their arguments are far
superior to yours and you cannot even answer them. Then it becomes very
difficult to respect them, and condemnation comes on them from all
sides. But RIGVEDA has a whole passage devoted just to making Adinatha
almost a god, with not a single word of criticism.</p><p><br></p><p>On this point Jainism can be said to be even older than ninety
thousand years. Now, these people have history. America is just a baby –
or not even a baby, just in pregnancy. Compared to ninety thousand
years... maybe it has just been conceived. It is dangerous to give these
people nuclear weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>There are political, religious, sociological, economical problems,
all torturing you. To begin with relaxation is difficult; hence, in the
East we have never started from relaxation. But if you want to, I have a
certain idea how you should start. I have been working with my Western
sannyasins and I have become aware of the fact that they don’t belong to
the East and they don’t know the Eastern current of consciousness; they
are coming from a different tradition which has never known any
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>For the Western sannyasins especially, I have created meditations
like dynamic meditation. While I was taking camps of meditators I used a
gibberish meditation and the kundalini meditation. If you want to start
from relaxation, then these meditations have to be done first. They will
take out all tensions from your mind and body, and then relaxation is
very easy. You don’t know how much you are holding in, and that that is
the cause of tension.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was allowing gibberish meditation in the camps in the
mountains... It is difficult to allow it here because the neighbors
start going mad. They start phoning the police and the commissioner,
saying, “Our whole life is being destroyed!” They don’t know that if
they would participate in their own houses, their lives would come out
of the insanity in which they are living. But they are not even aware of
their insanity.</p><p><br></p><p>The gibberish meditation was that everybody was allowed to say loudly
whatever comes into his mind. And it was such a joy to hear what people
were saying, irrelevant, absurd – because I was the only witness. People
were doing all kinds of things, and the only condition was that you
should not touch anybody else. You could do whatever you wanted.<span class=s4></span>Somebody was standing on his head,</p><p>somebody had thrown off his clothes and become naked, running all
around – for the whole hour.</p><p><br></p><p>One man used to sit every day in front me – he must have been a
broker or something – and as the meditation would begin, first he would
smile, just at the idea of what he was going to do. Then he would take
up his phone, “Hello, hello<span class=s4></span>” From the his corner
of his eyes he would go on looking</p><p>at me. I would avoid looking at him so as not to disturb his
meditation. He was selling his shares, purchasing – the whole hour he
was on the phone.</p><p>Everybody was doing the strange things that they were holding back.
When the meditation would end there were ten minutes for relaxation and
you could see that in those ten minutes people fell down – not with any
effort, but because they were utterly tired. All the rubbish had been
thrown out, so they had a certain cleanliness, and they relaxed.
Thousands of people... and you could not even think that there were a
thousand people.</p><p><br></p><p>People used to come to me and say, “Prolong those ten minutes,
because in our whole life we have never seen such relaxation, such joy.
We had never thought we would ever understand what awareness is, but we
felt it was coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>So if you want to start with relaxation, first you have to go through
a cathartic process. Dynamic meditation, latihan, kundalini or
gibberish. You may not know from where this word gibberish comes; it
comes from a Sufi mystic whose name was Jabbar – and that was his only
meditation. Whoever would come, he would say, “Sit down and start” – and
people knew what he meant. He never talked, he never gave any
discourses; he simply taught people gibberish.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, once in a while he would give people a demonstration.
For half an hour he would talk all kinds of nonsense in nobody knows
what language. It was not a language; he would go on teaching people
just whatever came to his mind. That was his only teaching – and to
those who had understood it he would simply say, “Sit down and
start.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Jabbar helped many people to become utterly silent. How long you
can go on? – the mind becomes empty. Slowly, slowly a deep
nothingness... and in that nothingness a flame of awareness. It is
always present, surrounded by your gibberish. The gibberish has to be
taken out; that is your poison.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about the body. Your body has tensions. Just start
making any movements that the body wants to make. You should not
manipulate it. If it wants to dance, it wants to jog, it wants to run,
it wants to roll down on the ground, you should not do it, you should
simply allow it. Tell the body, “You are free, do whatever you want” –
and you will be surprised,” My God. All these things the body wanted to
do but I was holding back, and that was the tension.”</p><p><br></p><p>So there are two kinds of tension, the body tensions and the mind
tensions. Both have to be released before you can start relaxation,
which will bring you to awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>But beginning from awareness is far easier, and particularly for
those who can understand the process of awareness, which is very simple.
The whole day you are using it about things – cars, in the traffic –
even in the Poona traffic you survive! It is absolutely mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago I read about Athens. Athens is even worse than
Poona. The government made a special seven day competition for the taxi
drivers and they had put golden trophies for those who were the best at
following traffic rules, the second and the third. But in the whole of
Athens they could not find a single person. The police were getting
worried; the days were almost finished, and the last day they wanted to
find anyhow three – they may not be perfect, but those prizes had to be
distributed.</p><p><br></p><p>One man they found was following the traffic rules exactly, so they
were very happy. They rushed towards him with the trophy, but seeing the
police coming towards him the man went against a red</p><p>light. Who wants to get unnecessarily into trouble? The police were
shouting, “Wait!” – but he did not listen, he was immediately gone,
against the light. They tried with two other people, but nobody would
stop, seeing the police. So after seven days’ effort, those three prizes
are still sitting in the headquarters of the police, and Athens is going
on as rejoicingly as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have a little taste in Poona, but still you survive because
you remain alert, aware. Perhaps the worst traffic situation is in
Italy. That’s why I was telling you the other day that the people who
sell cars have come to the conclusion that if the man first tries to
look at the engine of the car he is a German. If the man first looks at
the beautiful lines and curves of the car he is French. But if the man
first looks at the horn, whether it works or not, he is an Italian –
because the real thing is the horn, otherwise you cannot survive.</p><p><br></p><p>You are using awareness without being aware of it, but only about
outside things. It is the same awareness that has to be used for the
inside traffic. When you close your eyes there is a traffic of thoughts,
emotions, dreams, imaginations; all kinds of things start flashing
by.</p><p><br></p><p>What you have been doing in the outside world, do exactly the same
with the inside world and you will become a witness. And once tasted,
the joy of being a witness is so great, so other-worldly that you would
like to go more and more in. Whenever you find time you would like to go
more and more in.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of any posture; it is not a question of any
temple, of any church or synagogue. Sitting in a public bus or in a
railway train, when you have nothing to do just close your eyes. It will
save your eyes being tired from looking outside, and it will give you
time enough to watch yourself. Those moments will become moments of the
most beautiful experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>And slowly, slowly, as awareness grows your whole personality starts
changing. From unawareness to awareness is the greatest quantum
leap.</p><p><br></p><p>Hymie Goldberg was on holiday in Ireland, driving his new Mercedes.
He came to a small farm where the road went right through a large
puddle. Paddy was standing next to it, so Hymie leaned out and asked if
the puddle was shallow.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy said, “Yes,” so Hymie drove on, only to have his car sink
slowly out of sight.</p><p><br></p><p>Spluttering with rage and dripping wet, Hymie shouted at Paddy, “You
idiot! Why the hell did you tell me it was shallow enough to drive
through?”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy scratched his head and said, “I don’t understand it. The water
only came half way up my ducks.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just learn to be aware in all situations. Make a point of using every
situation for awareness. A man rushed into the “Pig and Whistle” pub in
great agitation.</p><p>“Does anyone own a great big black cat with a white collar?” he said
in a nervous voice. There was no reply.</p><p>“Well, does anyone know of a large black cat with a white collar?”
asked the man again, raising his voice above the general noise of the
bar. But still there was no answer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh dear!” muttered the man, “I think I’ve just run over the priest.”
The difference between a politician and an English lady...</p><p>When a politician says yes, he means maybe. When he says maybe, he
means no. If he says no, he’s no politician.</p><p><br></p><p>When an English lady says no, she means maybe. When she says maybe,
she means yes. If she says yes, she’s no lady.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AT THE SAME TIME IT TWISTS AND BREAKS ITS OWN LAWS TO PERSECUTE YOU WHO EMBODY FREEDOM AND TRUTH. IT SEEMS THE POLITICIANS ALWAYS TELL THE BIGGEST LIES IN THE LOUDEST VOICE. THE WORST TYRANTS TALK MOST ABOUT PEACE AND FREEDOM. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT.\nPrem Niren, there are many questions in your question, many implications of tremendous importance. I would like to go step by step, giving you the total view of the situation that exists in the United States of America.\nAnd what I am going to say is not only true about the United States of America; it is more or less true about every nation dominated by the cunning, clever and crooked politicians.\nThe first thing you say is, “The United States government proudly proclaims itself the land of the free and the home of the brave and points to its constitutional protections of fundamental rights.”\nThe first thing to be noted about the United States of America is that the land does not belong to the so-called Americans; the land belongs to the natives, the Red Indians. And America is, in fact, one of the most strange places to talk about freedom and democracy. If they really mean what they\nsay, then all Americans are foreigners except the Red Indians – simple hearted, innocent people who have been forced to live in forests, in special reservations. The whole land is theirs, but they don’t rule it. Those who rule it are from either Britain or France or Italy or Switzerland or Sweden or Belgium or Greece; they all come from European countries. If they are really sincere, they should pack their luggage and go back home.\nIt is a strange kind of democracy in which the people of the land, the real owners of the land have no participation at all. And the foreigners, the invaders who have killed mercilessly the innocent people of America, are proudly proclaiming freedom, democracy, basic human rights, freedom of expression and all kinds of nonsense. Especially Americans should not use these words at all. It is the greatest slavery that is still in existence. And there seems to be no possibility that Red Indians will ever again be rulers, owners of their own land, because they are poor, they don’t have modern war technology.\nWhat irritated the Americans most was when I said to them, “You are just as much foreigners as I am here. The only difference is that I am new, you are old tourists. I have come with a valid visa, and you entered America with your guns, not with your visas. In what way have you become citizens of America? Who accepted you? At the point of the gun you just destroyed the poor people, peaceful people, and proclaimed yourselves Americans – and you call the real Americans, Red Indians.” It gives the sense as if America belongs to the Americans, it creates an illusion.\nThe Americans are all invaders, and if they have any self-respect and dignity they should leave America and go back home.\nThey have deported me. This is strange... foreigners deporting another foreigner. At least I had a valid visa and I was not an invader. They are invaders and entered America with force and violence – and now they have become the proclaimers of freedom and democracy. The day America will be free, it will be in the hands of Red Indians. It is the greatest land of slavery today.\nAs far as their constitution is concerned, Americans have been very proud, proclaiming that they have one of the best constitutions. The latest research has just been published. Just two or three days ago I received the information that all that is beautiful in the American constitution is borrowed from the Red Indians and their old, ancient books of wisdom. So the so-called “great American fathers,” the founders of America, were simply thieves and nothing else. They have not mentioned, not even once, that they have borrowed the whole constitution from the poor Red Indians and their books of wisdom.\nAnd you are saying, “At the same time it twists and breaks its own laws to persecute you.” It has been persecuting the Red Indians; if it decided to persecute me, there are valid reasons for their persecution.\nOne of the most shocking things to the fundamentalist Christians of America – and Ronald Reagan belongs to that group – was this. They have always been sending missionaries to the East, to the poor countries of the East. There are thousands of missionaries all over India, converting the beggars into Christians, the orphans into Christians, the prostitutes into Christians, the aboriginals into Christians, the uneducated, uncultured. But they have not been able to convert a single cultured, educated, high class brahmin or a Jaina or a Buddhist.\nTheir shock was that I was there and the most cultured and educated people of their country, doctors, surgeons, scientists, engineers were dropping Christianity and becoming sannyasins. And I am not a missionary; I have never told them... I have never promised them any salvation or any heavenly pleasures. I have not told them that “I will be your protector against hell.” I was simply telling them what is true and what is divine and what is beautiful.\nSatyam, shivam, sundram.\nChristianity has nothing to offer to the educated and the cultured. The shock was tremendous. Before me also there have been many people from the East, but they were all cunning, clever, and the Christians were not annoyed with them. For example, Vivekananda: he was the first Indian who was very much appreciated by the Christians, because he proclaimed that Christianity is teaching essentially what all religions are teaching. This was very ego-fulfilling.\nWhen I said that Christianity is the lowest as far as the hierarchy of religions is concerned... It has nothing to be compared with Zen or Sufism or Hassidism; it has not even known the word meditation. All that it consists of is hypothetical. In fact, it prevents people from experiencing truth; its emphasis is on believing in God and believing in Jesus Christ.\nWhenever a religion emphasizes belief, it is against wisdom, it is against enlightenment. It does not want you to become high peaks of consciousness and freedom. It simply wants you to become just a seed and the shepherd, Jesus Christ will take care of you. It takes away your responsibility and you think, “This is very good. We are unburdened”. But with responsibility, automatically your freedom disappears. A Christian is the poorest religious person in the world.\nBefore me there was Ramateertha, but he praised Christianity just as Vivekananda did. These are not authentically enlightened people; their whole interest is in how to get more admirers. And it is very easy to get admirers in a Christian country, if you admire Christianity; in the Mohammedan country, if you admire Mohammedanism you will have thousands of admirers. It is a very mutual conspiracy: they fulfill your ego, you fulfill their egos.\nI am a simple person and I simply say whatever is the truth. Whether it hurts you, shocks you or not, it does not matter. To me truth is what matters – and certainly only the very cultured cream of the society has been attracted towards me. I cannot attract the beggars, I cannot attract the orphans, and I cannot attract the aboriginals, because they will not even be able to understand what I am saying. Everybody is not capable of understanding the music of Mozart or Wagner; you will need very trained ears to understand those great masters.\nAnd as far as spirituality is concerned, it is the highest point of intelligence. Unless you have that intelligence you are bound to misunderstand. Authentic religion is only for very few people, because it requires a tremendous preparation beforehand.\nThe American Christians were tremendously puzzled how to prevent their educated and cultured people from moving towards me, because that will become ultimately a movement where even less cultured people will start following the more cultured. That is human nature. When people see that all the geniuses, scientists, engineers, doctors, surgeons are moving towards a certain magnetic force, a certain charisma, the others also start following without even understanding. That was the danger.\nAnd the politician was also in difficulty. His difficulty was that I had created a commune of five thousand people according to my ideas, which go essentially against a Christian society, or a Hindu society, or a Mohammedan society – against any organized religion. I am against it because to me truth can never be organized. It is an individual affair – just between one individual and the cosmos.\nThis was appealing to all those who had the intelligence. The commune became an alternative society in the eyes of the politicians. They could see the great success of the commune – it was the highest quality of communism – and they could not believe that five thousand people were living there, and there was no murder, no theft, no rape. Women could move in the middle of the night alone without any fear. And because my concepts about marriage, about family, about education, are absolutely against the traditional concepts, their fear was that if this commune went on succeeding, there would arise more communes.\nI am absolutely anti-political. Deep down I am an anarchist.\nMy ultimate goal finally is that there should be a humanity without any government. Government is a condemnation of every one of us. The very existence of the government and the police and the army shows that we are still not civilized; otherwise there is no need for courts, judges, police officers. What is the need of them?\nIf man is really man, if people become meditators and their criminal mind disappears, then the politician is naturally alerted. It is dangerous. If this commune succeeds, then there will be more communes arising in the country, and the politician will be in danger.\nI have been condemning the politicians and the priests together, because they are two sides of one coin. They are conspiring together against humanity. They have made a division: the politician will rule the body of man, and the priest will rule his soul. And they will support each other, because their interest is the same – domination over humanity.\nMy effort to make life absolutely based on freedom and to destroy all possibilities of domination by anybody, naturally brought the politicians and the Christian priests together.\nThis persecution was not the simple persecution that every religion does against any competitive religion. This was a very unprecedented persecution. All religions, all societies, all nations were against a single man who had no organization, but only friends and lovers and fellow travelers.\nIt is a strange fact that Christians are against Hindus, Hindus are against Jainas, Jainas are against Buddhists, Buddhists are against Mohammedans – but as far as I am concerned they are all together. On one point at least I have created a unity: they are all my enemies, because I am hammering on the basic roots of every religion, which are the same.\nYou are saying, Niren, “At the same time, it twists and breaks its own laws to persecute you who embody freedom and truth.” That is my crime. freedom and truth.\nPoliticians are very happy if you simply talk about it, but if you start creating a certain group of people who start living truth, who start living in freedom, then the danger immediately arises in the hearts of the priests and politicians. They are perfectly at ease if you are only talking.\nI was not only talking.…\nMy effort is that I want to see whatever I am saying as a realized experience for all those who have come in some deep loving commitment with me. This was the danger.\nYou say, “It seems that politicians always tell the biggest lies in the loudest voice. The worst tyrants talk most about peace and freedom.” There is some hidden psychology behind it.\nFirst, the worst tyrants talk most about peace and freedom. They have to, just to create a facade around them, so that you cannot see their reality in the smoke of their talk of peace and freedom. They have to make much fuss around themselves just to hide behind it. And the biggest lies come in the loudest voice from the politicians.\nOne of my vice-chancellors was one of the greatest legal experts of his times. He had three offices, one in London, one in New Delhi and one in Peking, and he was continually running from China to India, from India to England, and he was fighting the greatest cases. I was not his student, but even though he was a vice-chancellor, he loved law so much that he used to teach law in the university, and I used to go to his class. I had a certain friendship with him which arose by accident.\nI used to go for an early morning walk at three o’clock in the morning, and by chance he was also a lover of going at three o’clock. We met every day on a lonely place by the side of a lake. I have never seen such a beautiful lake with so many lotus flowers; it was almost covered with flowers. And just by the side there was a huge forest and mountain, and a small path going around the lake.\nWe were the only two persons every day, so naturally we started talking to each other, we became friendly. He told me that he would be very happy if I sometimes turned up to his class, although I was not a student of law. I said, “What will be the point?”\nHe said, “At least you will be a challenge to me. I have lived my whole life challenging the greatest legal experts all around the world, I feel sorry... why have you joined the philosophy department? You should have been in the department of law, because your logic is so sharp and so clear.”\nSo I started going to his class, and I started arguing with him. I had no idea about law – but logic I understand, and law is simply a by-product of logic, just logic applied. But if you understand logic in its purity, you can understand law without any difficulty.\nOne day he was saying in the class – it was the final day before the examinations and he said to his students, “My last advice to you is this: If you have facts in your hands and you also have the support of the law, be calm and quiet. Lay out your facts, lay out your laws. There is no need for you to be excited, angry or in a fighting mood; that will spoil the whole thing. You just be utterly silent. Evidence and law is enough.\n“But if you don’t have any evidence for your case and you have only the law, then bring all the law books in your car to the court and make as much fuss as possible about laws, ancient precedents, ancient decisions by other courts. Create a jungle of laws. Because you don’t have any evidence for your case, it all depends how much you can enforce on the mind of the judge that your position is logical and legal.\n“But sometimes there are situations when you don’t have evidence for your case and neither do you have any support of the law. Don’t be worried. Shout as loudly as you can. Go on hitting on the table of the judge. Let everybody present shake and be afraid, and make it a point that you must be having all the evidence and the laws, otherwise you could not be roaring like a lion. All depends on how loud you are and how many times you hit on the table of the judge.”\nWhenever you see politicians telling the biggest lies in the loudest voice, you should know that lies can only be told in loud voices. The loudness of the voice hides the lies. Truth can be whispered, but lies can only be loudly declared. Their strength lies in your voice.\nTruth is self-evident.\nJust whispering it is enough.\nPrem Niren, what happened with me in America and with my people has to become a historical fact, exposing both the religions and the politicians, and all their bogus talk and great words.\nNiren himself was one of my attorneys. In fact he was my chief attorney, because he was my sannyasin and all the other attorneys were chosen by him; he was the coordinator. The others were paid, only he was working for love. You cannot depend on the paid people because their interest is in money; they don’t care what is true and what is not true.\nSecondly, you can never be sure of their own prejudices – which I became aware of sitting silently for three days in North Carolina. They were all insistent that I should not say a single word. They were afraid that if I said anything, the case would become too long, complicated, and that I may say things which may become contempt of court and it will complicate things.\nTheir insistence was that I should remain completely silent. So I enjoyed complete silence for three days, watching, witnessing what those attorneys were doing. And the first thing that came to my notice was that although they were fighting for me, their hearts were with the American government. Although they were fighting for me, their conditioning was for the Christian church, so deep down they were not for me. Except Niren, I could not feel any of the attorneys – and they were the best attorneys in America.\nBut a man may be an attorney or a judge, it doesn’t matter; he is still a human being with the whole unconscious conditioning. Even they – being Christians, being Americans – could not accept my approach towards life’s problems. And moreover I was a non-American, a non-white, against whom they have deep prejudices. Because they were paid so much money, they were ready – but they were simply paid people, servants, and I could see that their arguments were half hearted, as if deep down they wanted that I should be persecuted, that I should be fined, that I should be jailed. Except Niren, I could not feel the sincerity and honesty in any of those attorneys.\nThere came a situation when one of the best – Peter Schey, who is head of the department of law in a Californian university... Niren must have been his student, so he had employed him. He was one of the best experts, there is no doubt about it, but at a certain point Niren came running to me in the jail and said, “Peter Schey seems to be sick. A few things he is not willing to say under the oath of truth, so what should we do?”\nI said, “There is no problem. Instead of Peter Schey, you simply go to the witness stand. Only you can overcome the prejudices of Christians.”\nNiren did a beautiful job. And he brought in Peter Schey in a roundabout way in his witnessing. “Peter Schey told me...”and then he repeated the whole thing that was supposed to be told by Peter Schey. I was sitting by the side of Peter Schey and I could see his head down, afraid that this man was bringing him in. I could see their split personality: For money, they could not deny, but just for money they could not go against their prejudices either. It was a strange experience.\nOne of our attorneys, Jack Ransom, told this to Niren. Niren informed me, “We are fighting a losing battle, because the people we depend on like Jack Ransom” – a topmost attorney – “told me that ‘we cannot fight as totally as we could have fought for any American, because Osho will go to India. We have to live in America and we cannot annoy these magistrates and judges, because we have to be continually in the courts in front of them. This is not our last case.’”\nNiren again became very shaken: If our attorneys are saying that they will only go so far, not more than that; they cannot annoy the magistrate; they cannot annoy the judge – even if he rules illegally, against the constitution...\nAnd that’s what happened finally. They did everything against their own constitution, against their own law.\nJust the other day I was informed by Barkha, who was an important sannyasin in the commune... She was the head of the commune police. Because the commune had become a city, was incorporated as a city, the government wanted the city to have a magistrate, a police department. We did not want non-sannyasins to be in the commune, because they would feel strange and our people would feel strange, so the only way was to train our own people as police, as magistrate. So one woman was the magistrate; Sangeet is here, she was the city attorney; and Barkha is here, she was the city’s police chief.\nThe day I was arrested and I was shown on all the television stations of America, the chief of police of Oregon phoned Barkha. Barkha was working under him as chief of police of the city of Rajneeshpuram. He phoned to tell her that this was absolutely illegal; you cannot arrest anybody without an arrest warrant. And even if you have to take somebody into custody in special cases when the warrant has not arrived yet, but you have been told to do so, then you cannot put handcuffs and chains on the person, because he is not yet confirmed by the magistrate as a criminal.\nBut that’s what was done. And the police chief said, “I am feeling so sad and sorry that they arrested Osho with twelve loaded guns, and they did not show any arrest warrant, they did not even show verbally what was the cause of arrest.”\nWhen he saw the second day that I had been taken to another jail and I was descending from the staircase of the airplane with handcuffs, chains on my hands and feet, with another chain around my waist to which the handcuffs were also joined – I could not even scratch a fly which was sitting on my head – he said, “It is absolutely unprecedented. A man who has no warrant against him, a man who has done no wrong...”\nIn three days the government attorney could not prove a single thing against me, and he accepted in his summarizing statement that “we have been unable to prove anything against Osho.” Still, the way they were behaving was simply for humiliation.\nBut you cannot humiliate me – and they felt it. Even the jailers said to me, “Everything is being done to humiliate you – but it is strange, we don’t see any humiliation. You are taking it so coolly and so silently and so peacefully as if this has been your whole life’s practice.”\nI said, “Who knows, it may be in the future. So I am training myself, because one never knows about tomorrow – this may be my whole lifestyle for the future, and I never miss a single moment of learning.”\nAccording to every psychoanalytic school, politicians suffer from inferiority complex. In fact, if a man does not suffer from inferiority complex he will not try to dominate anyone. The very effort to dominate is just to convince oneself that “I am not inferior, I am superior to those whom I rule, whom I dominate.” It is strange that your presidents, your prime ministers are all psychologically sick people. They are full of jealousies, competitions.\nThe commune became their jealousy, because the commune was living according to my ideology. I am against poverty; hence in the commune there was nobody poor and nobody was rich either. There was not a single beggar, and the commune itself was comfortably rich. It had its own airport, its own four airplanes, hundreds of cars, one hundred buses – particularly for the celebration days when people used to come from all over the world.\nOn celebration days the population of the commune – which was only five thousand – used to rise to twenty thousand. We had every arrangement for twenty thousand people. We created new kinds of tents which can be air-conditioned, which can be centrally heated, which can be used around the year, whether it is hot or cold, or snow is falling. These were our own invention. They could be folded in ten minutes and could be put up again in ten minutes. We were keeping those tents for the fifteen thousand people coming for festivals.\nThe festivals were exactly what festivals should be – twenty thousand people eating together under one roof, and while people were eating, somebody was playing guitar and somebody was dancing and somebody was playing on the flute. That was my idea always, that people should live as festively as possible. Their lives should be one long celebration. Happy people can never be forgiven – and the commune was one of the happiest collections of people that has ever happened on the earth. You could not find a single person who was miserable; misery was simply sent away to other American cities.\nIn five years not a single fight between two sannyasins... The whole of America, and particularly the politicians, became jealous. This is dangerous, because if people come to know more and more about it... And they were going to know because every day planes were landing in the commune with television reporters, all kinds of news media.\nFor a time it looked as if Rajneeshpuram had become the capital of America. I was more on television than the president of America. Naturally, jealousy arises...\nI was not even a tourist. Because my tourist visa expired in three months, I asked for an extension. That expired again in three months, and then I applied for a permanent residentship and the immigration department was in trouble. The trouble was that they could not say yes to me, because the government was pressurizing them, the church was pressurizing them, “This man should not be allowed in America.”\nThey could not say yes and they could not say no either, because if they had said no I could have gone to the court: on what grounds can they say no to me? They have six categories of people who can be allowed to stay in America as permanent residents; I fulfilled five categories. Only one category I could not fulfill, and that was marriage. But if the worst came to the worst I could have fulfilled that too. There was no problem in it.\nThey could not say no, they could not say yes, so for five years I was there without any visa, without any permission. A man without a visa who is getting more attention than the president of a country is naturally going to create in these inferior beings, psychologically sick and almost retarded, a great violence. Then they forget all the constitutions and all the laws that they have themselves made.\nPaddy was showing...\n(THERE IS AN OUTBURST OF SUDDEN AND SURPRISED LAUGHTER AS OSHO, AFTER ALL THIS SERIOUS TALK, BEGINS READING A JOKE!)\nI will have to begin it again.\nPaddy was showing Sean his pet turtle. “Wow,” said Sean, “that certainly is a magnificent turtle.” “Maybe,” replied Paddy, “but he is very shortsighted.”\n“Shortsighted?” asked Sean in surprise. “How can you tell?”\nPaddy smiled and said, “He has fallen in love with my old army helmet.”\nPoliticians are almost like Paddy’s turtle – very shortsighted. The day America deported me, I told a few of my friends who had come to send me off at the airport, “This is the beginning of their downfall.”\nExistence functions in its own way, not according to human stupidities. After Socrates, what happened to Greece? It was at the highest peak of consciousness – but the day they poisoned Socrates, they poisoned themselves. Never again in these twenty-five centuries could they become a world power. What happened to Judea which crucified Jesus? It has disappeared from the map completely.\nThe day they fined me without my having committed any crime, and forced me to leave America immediately, they were not aware that existence is more just than any human court or any human constitution can be. I told my friends, “My leaving America... you will soon see it falling from being a world power” – and it has come true. Now America is falling every day into a ditch, and I declare that it will never again be the world’s greatest economical power as it has been.\nExistence supports even a single innocent man against a whole country, against a whole government, because existence has no fear of your atomic missiles, your nuclear weapons. It does not care about anything except innocence. The only value in the eyes of existence is the eyes of a sage, so utterly innocent and mystified and wondrous that for a single sage like Socrates or Jesus, the whole country can be removed, erased from history.\nSean and Paddy were having a drink at the pub when Sean said, “I heard you having a great argument with Maureen, your wife, last night. How did you make out?”\n“Ah,” said Paddy, “she came crawling to me on her hands and knees.” “Is that so?” said Sean. “What did she say?”\n“She said,” replied Paddy sipping his beer, “come out from under the bed you coward.”\nAmerica behaved with me and my people like utter cowards. If they had any guts, they could have called me to their senate and I was ready to answer all their questions and I was ready to defend all my ideas. That would have been dignified, rather than forcing me into a jail under loaded guns and then trying to poison me. And because they failed in sending me for twenty or thirty years to jail, they managed to have a bomb planted under my seat.\nJust today I have received the whole investigation report. I had asked them whether they have investigated how the bomb entered the jail with all their security and how it managed just to be under my seat. Now comes long report with so many contradictions and stupidities.\nThe report says that at four o’clock, just after the judgment was given by federal judge Leavy against me, an anonymous phone call came to the police station, to the jail, and to a television station, that a bomb had been placed under a certain seat in the visitor’s room. And the report says – it is from the police department of Portland – that “we searched the whole place, we evacuated the whole ground floor. But it was only a threat, no bomb was found.”\nI have asked my legal secretary to write to them, “If you had evacuated the whole ground floor, why did you take me to that ground floor? You evacuated everybody from the ground floor and immediately you took me there.” The first thing I had noticed was that there was nobody on the ground floor, where there used to be hundreds of people working. I asked the man who had taken me there, “What happened to all the people – some kind of holiday?” If it was a bomb threat, then certainly they should not have taken me on that ground floor.\nBut it was not a bomb threat, and the ground floor was not evacuated because of the bomb threat. It was evacuated so that if the bomb under my seat exploded, nobody else would be hurt. When I asked that man, he said, “I don’t know. Perhaps it is a shift change.”\nI said, “I do understand a little bit about shift changes. The second shift people should be here; then only can the first shift people go. This gap cannot be left between the two.”\nHe became shaky and he said, “I don’t know at all anything about what happened,” and he left me inside the waiting room – exactly the waiting room where that anonymous call had indicated that under a certain seat there was a bomb, which was going to explode at five minutes to six.\nThat was their calculation, that the case would take at least that much time; not before five would the court decide. And after the court’s decision my fine had to be filed and only when my fine was paid, would I be allowed to be taken to the jail. So they had calculated perfectly – nearabout six I would come back to take my clothes.\nBut because there was no trial... The government was not ready to go for a trial, knowing perfectly well that they didn’t have any evidence against me. They had seen the same government attorney general who was fighting for three days in the court of North Carolina conclude his speech, “We don’t have any evidence against him.” Now, what more they could do?\nIt was absolutely clear that if they went for trial they would be defeated. And they told my attorneys, “You should remember one thing: the case you can win, but it may take ten years or twenty years; we can go on postponing it. And the second thing you should remember is that the government of the United States of America is not going to be defeated by a single individual. If you are interested in saving Osho’s life, it is better not to go for a trial.”\nThat’s why the case was finished within two minutes. I reached the jail too early... In the waiting room where they were going to deliver me my clothes, there was only one man, and he was shaky. The form in his hand showed that his whole being was shaking. I asked him, “Something is wrong with your hand? – or something is wrong with the form?”\nHe said, “You sit on this seat, and just wait. It will take ten or fifteen minutes for me to get my boss’s signature on the form – which was an absolute lie, because there was no place on the form where anybody else’s signature was needed. It was a simple form saying that I had received my clothes back. Only my signature was needed.\nWhen he went out, locking the door from outside, he indicated the chair on which I had to sit. That was the same chair under which the bomb was found. Perhaps he had gone to ask what had to be done now, because he may not have been aware what the decision in the court had been. If I was released, then there was no need to explode the bomb; if I was going for trial, then it was better to finish it on the first day. Why wait unnecessarily for years of trial and millions of dollars to be wasted?\nLooking at the police department’s report, it is absolutely clear that now they are trying to make it simply a rumor. But if it was a rumor, why did they evacuate the prison? And if they believed in the rumor and evacuated the prison, they should not have taken me in there. It is so clearSo what\nthey have been doing for investigation is finding out who phoned. They found out the locality from where the call had come, but in that locality there are many people and many phones. That is the end of the street. The investigation has stopped. Where to go from there?\nEven a certain belief in an anonymous phonecall was stupid, because the jail was so secure and safe; it was perhaps the most modern jail in America. It opened only three months before I entered it. It has all the latest security equipment – doors which open only with remote control buttons; nobody can open them by hand. And there were doors beyond doorsas far as I remember, there\nwere three doors through which they took me in.\nJust inside the car they had the remote controller, and the first gate would open. The gate was a solid steel rock rising up just to give space for the car to move in. Then there was the second gate,\nand the second gate would open only when the first gate had come down. And then there was a third gate, and the third would open only when the second had come down. That was all automatic.\nIt is absolutely impossible for any individual who is not an insider to reach inside and plant a bomb.\nThe American government may have the nuclear weapons, but it has a very cowardly soul. They could not encounter a single individual. That very day I thought, “How are these people going to manage in the third world war with the Soviet Union?” And now their situation is becoming worse every day.\nIt will be good for you to be reminded that it was not Columbus who first discovered America. It has been discovered many times, and then it was found that it was not worth discovering. Then it was hushed up.\nIn Turkey there exists a map eight hundred years old which has America on it, exactly as you have it on any modern map. That was four hundred years before Columbus discovered America – but that is also not very old.\nIn Mahabharata, a great war that happened five thousand years ago in India, the hero of the war was Arjuna, the greatest archer perhaps of all time. He married many wives from different countries, and one of his wives was Mexican. Of course America was known... but it has been hushed up again and again. Perhaps the time has again come to hush it up.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6434","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/satyam_shivam_sundram/>Satyam Shivam Sundram</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Nuclear weapons, and a cowardly soul</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6434 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Satyam_Shivam_Sundram/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE AND POINTS TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL
PROTECTIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AT THE SAME TIME IT TWISTS AND BREAKS
ITS OWN LAWS TO PERSECUTE YOU WHO EMBODY FREEDOM AND TRUTH. IT SEEMS THE
POLITICIANS ALWAYS TELL THE BIGGEST LIES IN THE LOUDEST VOICE. THE WORST
TYRANTS TALK MOST ABOUT PEACE AND FREEDOM. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Niren, there are many questions in your question, many
implications of tremendous importance. I would like to go step by step,
giving you the total view of the situation that exists in the United
States of America.</p><p><br></p><p>And what I am going to say is not only true about the United States
of America; it is more or less true about every nation dominated by the
cunning, clever and crooked politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing you say is, “The United States government proudly
proclaims itself the land of the free and the home of the brave and
points to its constitutional protections of fundamental rights.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to be noted about the United States of America is
that the land does not belong to the so-called Americans; the land
belongs to the natives, the Red Indians. And America is, in fact, one of
the most strange places to talk about freedom and democracy. If they
really mean what they</p><p>say, then all Americans are foreigners except the Red Indians –
simple hearted, innocent people who have been forced to live in forests,
in special reservations. The whole land is theirs, but they don’t rule
it. Those who rule it are from either Britain or France or Italy or
Switzerland or Sweden or Belgium or Greece; they all come from European
countries. If they are really sincere, they should pack their luggage
and go back home.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange kind of democracy in which the people of the land,
the real owners of the land have no participation at all. And the
foreigners, the invaders who have killed mercilessly the innocent people
of America, are proudly proclaiming freedom, democracy, basic human
rights, freedom of expression and all kinds of nonsense. Especially
Americans should not use these words at all. It is the greatest slavery
that is still in existence. And there seems to be no possibility that
Red Indians will ever again be rulers, owners of their own land, because
they are poor, they don’t have modern war technology.</p><p><br></p><p>What irritated the Americans most was when I said to them, “You are
just as much foreigners as I am here. The only difference is that I am
new, you are old tourists. I have come with a valid visa, and you
entered America with your guns, not with your visas. In what way have
you become citizens of America? Who accepted you? At the point of the
gun you just destroyed the poor people, peaceful people, and proclaimed
yourselves Americans – and you call the real Americans, Red Indians.” It
gives the sense as if America belongs to the Americans, it creates an
illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>The Americans are all invaders, and if they have any self-respect and
dignity they should leave America and go back home.</p><p><br></p><p>They have deported me. This is strange... foreigners deporting
another foreigner. At least I had a valid visa and I was not an invader.
They are invaders and entered America with force and violence – and now
they have become the proclaimers of freedom and democracy. The day
America will be free, it will be in the hands of Red Indians. It is the
greatest land of slavery today.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as their constitution is concerned, Americans have been very
proud, proclaiming that they have one of the best constitutions. The
latest research has just been published. Just two or three days ago I
received the information that all that is beautiful in the American
constitution is borrowed from the Red Indians and their old, ancient
books of wisdom. So the so-called “great American fathers,” the founders
of America, were simply thieves and nothing else. They have not
mentioned, not even once, that they have borrowed the whole constitution
from the poor Red Indians and their books of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are saying, “At the same time it twists and breaks its own
laws to persecute you.” It has been persecuting the Red Indians; if it
decided to persecute me, there are valid reasons for their
persecution.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most shocking things to the fundamentalist Christians of
America – and Ronald Reagan belongs to that group – was this. They have
always been sending missionaries to the East, to the poor countries of
the East. There are thousands of missionaries all over India, converting
the beggars into Christians, the orphans into Christians, the
prostitutes into Christians, the aboriginals into Christians, the
uneducated, uncultured. But they have not been able to convert a single
cultured, educated, high class brahmin or a Jaina or a Buddhist.</p><p>Their shock was that I was there and the most cultured and educated
people of their country, doctors, surgeons, scientists, engineers were
dropping Christianity and becoming sannyasins. And I am not a
missionary; I have never told them... I have never promised them any
salvation or any heavenly pleasures. I have not told them that “I will
be your protector against hell.” I was simply telling them what is true
and what is divine and what is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Satyam, shivam, sundram.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity has nothing to offer to the educated and the cultured.
The shock was tremendous. Before me also there have been many people
from the East, but they were all cunning, clever, and the Christians
were not annoyed with them. For example, Vivekananda: he was the first
Indian who was very much appreciated by the Christians, because he
proclaimed that Christianity is teaching essentially what all religions
are teaching. This was very ego-fulfilling.</p><p><br></p><p>When I said that Christianity is the lowest as far as the hierarchy
of religions is concerned... It has nothing to be compared with Zen or
Sufism or Hassidism; it has not even known the word meditation. All that
it consists of is hypothetical. In fact, it prevents people from
experiencing truth; its emphasis is on believing in God and believing in
Jesus Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a religion emphasizes belief, it is against wisdom, it is
against enlightenment. It does not want you to become high peaks of
consciousness and freedom. It simply wants you to become just a seed and
the shepherd, Jesus Christ will take care of you. It takes away your
responsibility and you think, “This is very good. We are unburdened”.
But with responsibility, automatically your freedom disappears. A
Christian is the poorest religious person in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Before me there was Ramateertha, but he praised Christianity just as
Vivekananda did. These are not authentically enlightened people; their
whole interest is in how to get more admirers. And it is very easy to
get admirers in a Christian country, if you admire Christianity; in the
Mohammedan country, if you admire Mohammedanism you will have thousands
of admirers. It is a very mutual conspiracy: they fulfill your ego, you
fulfill their egos.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a simple person and I simply say whatever is the truth. Whether
it hurts you, shocks you or not, it does not matter. To me truth is what
matters – and certainly only the very cultured cream of the society has
been attracted towards me. I cannot attract the beggars, I cannot
attract the orphans, and I cannot attract the aboriginals, because they
will not even be able to understand what I am saying. Everybody is not
capable of understanding the music of Mozart or Wagner; you will need
very trained ears to understand those great masters.</p><p><br></p><p>And as far as spirituality is concerned, it is the highest point of
intelligence. Unless you have that intelligence you are bound to
misunderstand. Authentic religion is only for very few people, because
it requires a tremendous preparation beforehand.</p><p><br></p><p>The American Christians were tremendously puzzled how to prevent
their educated and cultured people from moving towards me, because that
will become ultimately a movement where even less cultured people will
start following the more cultured. That is human nature. When people see
that all the geniuses, scientists, engineers, doctors, surgeons are
moving towards a certain magnetic force, a certain charisma, the others
also start following without even understanding. That was the
danger.</p><p>And the politician was also in difficulty. His difficulty was that I
had created a commune of five thousand people according to my ideas,
which go essentially against a Christian society, or a Hindu society, or
a Mohammedan society – against any organized religion. I am against it
because to me truth can never be organized. It is an individual affair –
just between one individual and the cosmos.</p><p>This was appealing to all those who had the intelligence. The commune
became an alternative society in the eyes of the politicians. They could
see the great success of the commune – it was the highest quality of
communism – and they could not believe that five thousand people were
living there, and there was no murder, no theft, no rape. Women could
move in the middle of the night alone without any fear. And because my
concepts about marriage, about family, about education, are absolutely
against the traditional concepts, their fear was that if this commune
went on succeeding, there would arise more communes.</p><p>I am absolutely anti-political. Deep down I am an anarchist.</p><p>My ultimate goal finally is that there should be a humanity without
any government. Government is a condemnation of every one of us. The
very existence of the government and the police and the army shows that
we are still not civilized; otherwise there is no need for courts,
judges, police officers. What is the need of them?</p><p>If man is really man, if people become meditators and their criminal
mind disappears, then the politician is naturally alerted. It is
dangerous. If this commune succeeds, then there will be more communes
arising in the country, and the politician will be in danger.</p><p>I have been condemning the politicians and the priests together,
because they are two sides of one coin. They are conspiring together
against humanity. They have made a division: the politician will rule
the body of man, and the priest will rule his soul. And they will
support each other, because their interest is the same – domination over
humanity.</p><p>My effort to make life absolutely based on freedom and to destroy all
possibilities of domination by anybody, naturally brought the
politicians and the Christian priests together.</p><p>This persecution was not the simple persecution that every religion
does against any competitive religion. This was a very unprecedented
persecution. All religions, all societies, all nations were against a
single man who had no organization, but only friends and lovers and
fellow travelers.</p><p>It is a strange fact that Christians are against Hindus, Hindus are
against Jainas, Jainas are against Buddhists, Buddhists are against
Mohammedans – but as far as I am concerned they are all together. On one
point at least I have created a unity: they are all my enemies, because
I am hammering on the basic roots of every religion, which are the
same.</p><p>You are saying, Niren, “At the same time, it twists and breaks its
own laws to persecute you who embody freedom and truth.” That is my
crime. freedom and truth.</p><p>Politicians are very happy if you simply talk about it, but if you
start creating a certain group of people who start living truth, who
start living in freedom, then the danger immediately arises in the
hearts of the priests and politicians. They are perfectly at ease if you
are only talking.</p><p>I was not only talking.…</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is that I want to see whatever I am saying as a realized
experience for all those who have come in some deep loving commitment
with me. This was the danger.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “It seems that politicians always tell the biggest lies in
the loudest voice. The worst tyrants talk most about peace and freedom.”
There is some hidden psychology behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the worst tyrants talk most about peace and freedom. They have
to, just to create a facade around them, so that you cannot see their
reality in the smoke of their talk of peace and freedom. They have to
make much fuss around themselves just to hide behind it. And the biggest
lies come in the loudest voice from the politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my vice-chancellors was one of the greatest legal experts of
his times. He had three offices, one in London, one in New Delhi and one
in Peking, and he was continually running from China to India, from
India to England, and he was fighting the greatest cases. I was not his
student, but even though he was a vice-chancellor, he loved law so much
that he used to teach law in the university, and I used to go to his
class. I had a certain friendship with him which arose by accident.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to go for an early morning walk at three o’clock in the
morning, and by chance he was also a lover of going at three o’clock. We
met every day on a lonely place by the side of a lake. I have never seen
such a beautiful lake with so many lotus flowers; it was almost covered
with flowers. And just by the side there was a huge forest and mountain,
and a small path going around the lake.</p><p><br></p><p>We were the only two persons every day, so naturally we started
talking to each other, we became friendly. He told me that he would be
very happy if I sometimes turned up to his class, although I was not a
student of law. I said, “What will be the point?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “At least you will be a challenge to me. I have lived my
whole life challenging the greatest legal experts all around the world,
I feel sorry... why have you joined the philosophy department? You
should have been in the department of law, because your logic is so
sharp and so clear.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I started going to his class, and I started arguing with him. I
had no idea about law – but logic I understand, and law is simply a
by-product of logic, just logic applied. But if you understand logic in
its purity, you can understand law without any difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was saying in the class – it was the final day before the
examinations and he said to his students, “My last advice to you is
this: If you have facts in your hands and you also have the support of
the law, be calm and quiet. Lay out your facts, lay out your laws. There
is no need for you to be excited, angry or in a fighting mood; that will
spoil the whole thing. You just be utterly silent. Evidence and law is
enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“But if you don’t have any evidence for your case and you have only
the law, then bring all the law books in your car to the court and make
as much fuss as possible about laws, ancient precedents, ancient
decisions by other courts. Create a jungle of laws. Because you don’t
have any evidence for your case, it all depends how much you can enforce
on the mind of the judge that your position is logical and legal.</p><p>“But sometimes there are situations when you don’t have evidence for
your case and neither do you have any support of the law. Don’t be
worried. Shout as loudly as you can. Go on hitting on the table of the
judge. Let everybody present shake and be afraid, and make it a point
that you must be having all the evidence and the laws, otherwise you
could not be roaring like a lion. All depends on how loud you are and
how many times you hit on the table of the judge.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you see politicians telling the biggest lies in the loudest
voice, you should know that lies can only be told in loud voices. The
loudness of the voice hides the lies. Truth can be whispered, but lies
can only be loudly declared. Their strength lies in your voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is self-evident.</p><p><br></p><p>Just whispering it is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Niren, what happened with me in America and with my people has
to become a historical fact, exposing both the religions and the
politicians, and all their bogus talk and great words.</p><p><br></p><p>Niren himself was one of my attorneys. In fact he was my chief
attorney, because he was my sannyasin and all the other attorneys were
chosen by him; he was the coordinator. The others were paid, only he was
working for love. You cannot depend on the paid people because their
interest is in money; they don’t care what is true and what is not
true.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you can never be sure of their own prejudices – which I
became aware of sitting silently for three days in North Carolina. They
were all insistent that I should not say a single word. They were afraid
that if I said anything, the case would become too long, complicated,
and that I may say things which may become contempt of court and it will
complicate things.</p><p><br></p><p>Their insistence was that I should remain completely silent. So I
enjoyed complete silence for three days, watching, witnessing what those
attorneys were doing. And the first thing that came to my notice was
that although they were fighting for me, their hearts were with the
American government. Although they were fighting for me, their
conditioning was for the Christian church, so deep down they were not
for me. Except Niren, I could not feel any of the attorneys – and they
were the best attorneys in America.</p><p><br></p><p>But a man may be an attorney or a judge, it doesn’t matter; he is
still a human being with the whole unconscious conditioning. Even they –
being Christians, being Americans – could not accept my approach towards
life’s problems. And moreover I was a non-American, a non-white, against
whom they have deep prejudices. Because they were paid so much money,
they were ready – but they were simply paid people, servants, and I
could see that their arguments were half hearted, as if deep down they
wanted that I should be persecuted, that I should be fined, that I
should be jailed. Except Niren, I could not feel the sincerity and
honesty in any of those attorneys.</p><p><br></p><p>There came a situation when one of the best – Peter Schey, who is
head of the department of law in a Californian university... Niren must
have been his student, so he had employed him. He was one of the best
experts, there is no doubt about it, but at a certain point Niren came
running to me in the jail and said, “Peter Schey seems to be sick. A few
things he is not willing to say under the oath of truth, so what should
we do?”</p><p>I said, “There is no problem. Instead of Peter Schey, you simply go
to the witness stand. Only you can overcome the prejudices of
Christians.”</p><p><br></p><p>Niren did a beautiful job. And he brought in Peter Schey in a
roundabout way in his witnessing. “Peter Schey told me...”and then he
repeated the whole thing that was supposed to be told by Peter Schey. I
was sitting by the side of Peter Schey and I could see his head down,
afraid that this man was bringing him in. I could see their split
personality: For money, they could not deny, but just for money they
could not go against their prejudices either. It was a strange
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>One of our attorneys, Jack Ransom, told this to Niren. Niren informed
me, “We are fighting a losing battle, because the people we depend on
like Jack Ransom” – a topmost attorney – “told me that ‘we cannot fight
as totally as we could have fought for any American, because Osho will
go to India. We have to live in America and we cannot annoy these
magistrates and judges, because we have to be continually in the courts
in front of them. This is not our last case.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Niren again became very shaken: If our attorneys are saying that they
will only go so far, not more than that; they cannot annoy the
magistrate; they cannot annoy the judge – even if he rules illegally,
against the constitution...</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what happened finally. They did everything against their
own constitution, against their own law.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was informed by Barkha, who was an important
sannyasin in the commune... She was the head of the commune police.
Because the commune had become a city, was incorporated as a city, the
government wanted the city to have a magistrate, a police department. We
did not want non-sannyasins to be in the commune, because they would
feel strange and our people would feel strange, so the only way was to
train our own people as police, as magistrate. So one woman was the
magistrate; Sangeet is here, she was the city attorney; and Barkha is
here, she was the city’s police chief.</p><p><br></p><p>The day I was arrested and I was shown on all the television stations
of America, the chief of police of Oregon phoned Barkha. Barkha was
working under him as chief of police of the city of Rajneeshpuram. He
phoned to tell her that this was absolutely illegal; you cannot arrest
anybody without an arrest warrant. And even if you have to take somebody
into custody in special cases when the warrant has not arrived yet, but
you have been told to do so, then you cannot put handcuffs and chains on
the person, because he is not yet confirmed by the magistrate as a
criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s what was done. And the police chief said, “I am feeling so
sad and sorry that they arrested Osho with twelve loaded guns, and they
did not show any arrest warrant, they did not even show verbally what
was the cause of arrest.”</p><p><br></p><p>When he saw the second day that I had been taken to another jail and
I was descending from the staircase of the airplane with handcuffs,
chains on my hands and feet, with another chain around my waist to which
the handcuffs were also joined – I could not even scratch a fly which
was sitting on my head – he said, “It is absolutely unprecedented. A man
who has no warrant against him, a man who has done no wrong...”</p><p>In three days the government attorney could not prove a single thing
against me, and he accepted in his summarizing statement that “we have
been unable to prove anything against Osho.” Still, the way they were
behaving was simply for humiliation.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot humiliate me – and they felt it. Even the jailers said
to me, “Everything is being done to humiliate you – but it is strange,
we don’t see any humiliation. You are taking it so coolly and so
silently and so peacefully as if this has been your whole life’s
practice.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Who knows, it may be in the future. So I am training myself,
because one never knows about tomorrow – this may be my whole lifestyle
for the future, and I never miss a single moment of learning.”</p><p><br></p><p>According to every psychoanalytic school, politicians suffer from
inferiority complex. In fact, if a man does not suffer from inferiority
complex he will not try to dominate anyone. The very effort to dominate
is just to convince oneself that “I am not inferior, I am superior to
those whom I rule, whom I dominate.” It is strange that your presidents,
your prime ministers are all psychologically sick people. They are full
of jealousies, competitions.</p><p><br></p><p>The commune became their jealousy, because the commune was living
according to my ideology. I am against poverty; hence in the commune
there was nobody poor and nobody was rich either. There was not a single
beggar, and the commune itself was comfortably rich. It had its own
airport, its own four airplanes, hundreds of cars, one hundred buses –
particularly for the celebration days when people used to come from all
over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>On celebration days the population of the commune – which was only
five thousand – used to rise to twenty thousand. We had every
arrangement for twenty thousand people. We created new kinds of tents
which can be air-conditioned, which can be centrally heated, which can
be used around the year, whether it is hot or cold, or snow is falling.
These were our own invention. They could be folded in ten minutes and
could be put up again in ten minutes. We were keeping those tents for
the fifteen thousand people coming for festivals.</p><p><br></p><p>The festivals were exactly what festivals should be – twenty thousand
people eating together under one roof, and while people were eating,
somebody was playing guitar and somebody was dancing and somebody was
playing on the flute. That was my idea always, that people should live
as festively as possible. Their lives should be one long celebration.
Happy people can never be forgiven – and the commune was one of the
happiest collections of people that has ever happened on the earth. You
could not find a single person who was miserable; misery was simply sent
away to other American cities.</p><p><br></p><p>In five years not a single fight between two sannyasins... The whole
of America, and particularly the politicians, became jealous. This is
dangerous, because if people come to know more and more about it... And
they were going to know because every day planes were landing in the
commune with television reporters, all kinds of news media.</p><p><br></p><p>For a time it looked as if Rajneeshpuram had become the capital of
America. I was more on television than the president of America.
Naturally, jealousy arises...</p><p>I was not even a tourist. Because my tourist visa expired in three
months, I asked for an extension. That expired again in three months,
and then I applied for a permanent residentship and the immigration
department was in trouble. The trouble was that they could not say yes
to me, because the government was pressurizing them, the church was
pressurizing them, “This man should not be allowed in America.”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not say yes and they could not say no either, because if
they had said no I could have gone to the court: on what grounds can
they say no to me? They have six categories of people who can be allowed
to stay in America as permanent residents; I fulfilled five categories.
Only one category I could not fulfill, and that was marriage. But if the
worst came to the worst I could have fulfilled that too. There was no
problem in it.</p><p><br></p><p>They could not say no, they could not say yes, so for five years I
was there without any visa, without any permission. A man without a visa
who is getting more attention than the president of a country is
naturally going to create in these inferior beings, psychologically sick
and almost retarded, a great violence. Then they forget all the
constitutions and all the laws that they have themselves made.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy was showing...</p><p><br></p><p>(THERE IS AN OUTBURST OF SUDDEN AND SURPRISED LAUGHTER AS OSHO, AFTER
ALL THIS SERIOUS TALK, BEGINS READING A JOKE!)</p><p><br></p><p>I will have to begin it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy was showing Sean his pet turtle. “Wow,” said Sean, “that
certainly is a magnificent turtle.” “Maybe,” replied Paddy, “but he is
very shortsighted.”</p><p>“Shortsighted?” asked Sean in surprise. “How can you tell?”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy smiled and said, “He has fallen in love with my old army
helmet.”</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians are almost like Paddy’s turtle – very shortsighted. The
day America deported me, I told a few of my friends who had come to send
me off at the airport, “This is the beginning of their downfall.”</p><p><br></p><p>Existence functions in its own way, not according to human
stupidities. After Socrates, what happened to Greece? It was at the
highest peak of consciousness – but the day they poisoned Socrates, they
poisoned themselves. Never again in these twenty-five centuries could
they become a world power. What happened to Judea which crucified Jesus?
It has disappeared from the map completely.</p><p><br></p><p>The day they fined me without my having committed any crime, and
forced me to leave America immediately, they were not aware that
existence is more just than any human court or any human constitution
can be. I told my friends, “My leaving America... you will soon see it
falling from being a world power” – and it has come true. Now America is
falling every day into a ditch, and I declare that it will never again
be the world’s greatest economical power as it has been.</p><p>Existence supports even a single innocent man against a whole
country, against a whole government, because existence has no fear of
your atomic missiles, your nuclear weapons. It does not care about
anything except innocence. The only value in the eyes of existence is
the eyes of a sage, so utterly innocent and mystified and wondrous that
for a single sage like Socrates or Jesus, the whole country can be
removed, erased from history.</p><p><br></p><p>Sean and Paddy were having a drink at the pub when Sean said, “I
heard you having a great argument with Maureen, your wife, last night.
How did you make out?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah,” said Paddy, “she came crawling to me on her hands and knees.”
“Is that so?” said Sean. “What did she say?”</p><p>“She said,” replied Paddy sipping his beer, “come out from under the
bed you coward.”</p><p><br></p><p>America behaved with me and my people like utter cowards. If they had
any guts, they could have called me to their senate and I was ready to
answer all their questions and I was ready to defend all my ideas. That
would have been dignified, rather than forcing me into a jail under
loaded guns and then trying to poison me. And because they failed in
sending me for twenty or thirty years to jail, they managed to have a
bomb planted under my seat.</p><p><br></p><p>Just today I have received the whole investigation report. I had
asked them whether they have investigated how the bomb entered the jail
with all their security and how it managed just to be under my seat. Now
comes long report with so many contradictions and stupidities.</p><p><br></p><p>The report says that at four o’clock, just after the judgment was
given by federal judge Leavy against me, an anonymous phone call came to
the police station, to the jail, and to a television station, that a
bomb had been placed under a certain seat in the visitor’s room. And the
report says – it is from the police department of Portland – that “we
searched the whole place, we evacuated the whole ground floor. But it
was only a threat, no bomb was found.”</p><p><br></p><p>I have asked my legal secretary to write to them, “If you had
evacuated the whole ground floor, why did you take me to that ground
floor? You evacuated everybody from the ground floor and immediately you
took me there.” The first thing I had noticed was that there was nobody
on the ground floor, where there used to be hundreds of people working.
I asked the man who had taken me there, “What happened to all the people
– some kind of holiday?” If it was a bomb threat, then certainly they
should not have taken me on that ground floor.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was not a bomb threat, and the ground floor was not evacuated
because of the bomb threat. It was evacuated so that if the bomb under
my seat exploded, nobody else would be hurt. When I asked that man, he
said, “I don’t know. Perhaps it is a shift change.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I do understand a little bit about shift changes. The second
shift people should be here; then only can the first shift people go.
This gap cannot be left between the two.”</p><p><br></p><p>He became shaky and he said, “I don’t know at all anything about what
happened,” and he left me inside the waiting room – exactly the waiting
room where that anonymous call had indicated that under a certain seat
there was a bomb, which was going to explode at five minutes to six.</p><p>That was their calculation, that the case would take at least that
much time; not before five would the court decide. And after the court’s
decision my fine had to be filed and only when my fine was paid, would I
be allowed to be taken to the jail. So they had calculated perfectly –
nearabout six I would come back to take my clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>But because there was no trial... The government was not ready to go
for a trial, knowing perfectly well that they didn’t have any evidence
against me. They had seen the same government attorney general who was
fighting for three days in the court of North Carolina conclude his
speech, “We don’t have any evidence against him.” Now, what more they
could do?</p><p><br></p><p>It was absolutely clear that if they went for trial they would be
defeated. And they told my attorneys, “You should remember one thing:
the case you can win, but it may take ten years or twenty years; we can
go on postponing it. And the second thing you should remember is that
the government of the United States of America is not going to be
defeated by a single individual. If you are interested in saving Osho’s
life, it is better not to go for a trial.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the case was finished within two minutes. I reached the
jail too early... In the waiting room where they were going to deliver
me my clothes, there was only one man, and he was shaky. The form in his
hand showed that his whole being was shaking. I asked him, “Something is
wrong with your hand? – or something is wrong with the form?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You sit on this seat, and just wait. It will take ten or
fifteen minutes for me to get my boss’s signature on the form – which
was an absolute lie, because there was no place on the form where
anybody else’s signature was needed. It was a simple form saying that I
had received my clothes back. Only my signature was needed.</p><p><br></p><p>When he went out, locking the door from outside, he indicated the
chair on which I had to sit. That was the same chair under which the
bomb was found. Perhaps he had gone to ask what had to be done now,
because he may not have been aware what the decision in the court had
been. If I was released, then there was no need to explode the bomb; if
I was going for trial, then it was better to finish it on the first day.
Why wait unnecessarily for years of trial and millions of dollars to be
wasted?</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the police department’s report, it is absolutely clear
that now they are trying to make it simply a rumor. But if it was a
rumor, why did they evacuate the prison? And if they believed in the
rumor and evacuated the prison, they should not have taken me in there.
It is so clear<span class=s4></span>So what</p><p>they have been doing for investigation is finding out who phoned.
They found out the locality from where the call had come, but in that
locality there are many people and many phones. That is the end of the
street. The investigation has stopped. Where to go from there?</p><p><br></p><p>Even a certain belief in an anonymous phonecall was stupid, because
the jail was so secure and safe; it was perhaps the most modern jail in
America. It opened only three months before I entered it. It has all the
latest security equipment – doors which open only with remote control
buttons; nobody can open them by hand. And there were doors beyond
doors<span class=s4></span>as far as I remember, there</p><p>were three doors through which they took me in.</p><p><br></p><p>Just inside the car they had the remote controller, and the first
gate would open. The gate was a solid steel rock rising up just to give
space for the car to move in. Then there was the second gate,</p><p>and the second gate would open only when the first gate had come
down. And then there was a third gate, and the third would open only
when the second had come down. That was all automatic.</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely impossible for any individual who is not an insider
to reach inside and plant a bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>The American government may have the nuclear weapons, but it has a
very cowardly soul. They could not encounter a single individual. That
very day I thought, “How are these people going to manage in the third
world war with the Soviet Union?” And now their situation is becoming
worse every day.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be good for you to be reminded that it was not Columbus who
first discovered America. It has been discovered many times, and then it
was found that it was not worth discovering. Then it was hushed up.</p><p><br></p><p>In Turkey there exists a map eight hundred years old which has
America on it, exactly as you have it on any modern map. That was four
hundred years before Columbus discovered America – but that is also not
very old.</p><p><br></p><p>In Mahabharata, a great war that happened five thousand years ago in
India, the hero of the war was Arjuna, the greatest archer perhaps of
all time. He married many wives from different countries, and one of his
wives was Mexican. Of course America was known... but it has been hushed
up again and again. Perhaps the time has again come to hush it up.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The energy is arising, and you start controlling it. You are doing two opposite things together. You meditate and that creates energy – and then you want to control it. That friction between these two opposite directions can crete fever.\nSo drop controlling it... rather move with it. Enjoy it, delight in it... it is something beautiful. People hanker for it, but whenever it starts working they become scared.\n[She said it was like taking acid... ]\nIt will look like that – because every meditation creates an inner LSD. It is alchemical.\n... Right now you simply move with the energy. You are changing but you are not allowing the change to happen – so how can you see the change?\nYou are afraid... you are scared of the change. That’s why you feel... you feel shattered. You are going to be demolished completely – only then the new will arise; only on your death. You as you are will disappear. So you will have to pass through a very shattering experience.\nThat is the death, the cross, and then is the resurrection of the new being. The new being is completely discontinuous with you... you simply give space for it.\n[She asks: Does it happen little by little then?]\nNo, it will happen in a sudden moment. But you will get ready for it by and by.\nIt can happen right now, but if you get scared you won’t allow it. Your permission is needed – only then it can happen. God never interferes – remember that. When you invite, He comes. When you dose the door, He waits outside. He will not even knock because that may be an interference, a trespass.\nThe energy is arising – cooperate with it. Feel happy and grateful and move with it... don’t go in the opposite direction. Be completely mad with it. Then suddenly... it is gone. And you will feel after it quiet, calm, collected.\n[A sannyasin refers to Ma Vipassana who is dying in hospital: I didn’t know if it was really any better to die like that here, or as a housewife in England somewhere... But when something happens – a shock, a crisis – there’s just doubt and fear inside.]\nMm mm... the only problem is that you go on expecting too much from yourself. You have dropped other expectations... now there is this new expectation of being understanding.\nWhy can’t one simply be as one is? If you are not understanding, you are not understanding. Why this constant effort to make something, become something, be something, which you are not?\nThe only understanding there is, is this: that one accepts oneself as one is. What else can you do? This whole effort in the name of growth is nothing but an ego trip. You will get frustrated again and again. And in every crisis you will come to a point where you feel that nothing has happened. But why should anything happen in the first place?\nThe expectation that something has to happen is creating the whole trouble. Why should it happen? And what is the point of expecting it? You will go on trying to make it happen, planning how to – then you will be tense. And when it will not happen, you will create a false pretension that it has happened – because one cannot live in continuous misery. To hide that misery, one creates a mask of understanding. But again and again this mask is to be broken. Whenever a real problem arises, again you will see that you are standing naked, and the mask is not functioning.\nSo what I am insisting is – accept the situation you find that you are in. There is no way out of it. That’s what understanding is – accepting the way you are. Not that you grow. Suddenly you see that there is no need for anything. Then all these situations can be helpful... they bring you back down to reality. A crisis is a blessing; it brings you back to earth again and again. Otherwise you start moving in your fantasy.\nSo it is not a question of Vipassana – it has nothing to do with her; it is your problem. Why do you think that a housewife in England is in some way inferior to you, mm?’\n[She answers:... everybody says how incredible and how beautiful Vipassana must be feeling. I can say that too – but I don’t know it.]\nNo, there is no need to say anything. If others are saying, maybe they are right – maybe they are feeling that way. But there is no need for you to feel that way too. You are not like them. And there\nis no need for them to feel like you – so don’t think that they are pretending. They may be true. It is not a problem for them – it is a problem for you.\nJust one thing has to be understood: that this is the way you are, and that you don’t understand. Accept this non-understanding. You are fighting with it – that’s why you feel depressed. [That you are] ignorant, non-understanding, stupid, idiotic – accept it! Why do you want to be a wise woman or something like that?\nThen the problem disappears – because it is created by a deep non-acceptance. Somehow you go on rejecting yourself in subtle ways. If I tell you, then you drop one way, but you create the same problem in some other way. Someday you will see.… You were saying that you don’t like your body – somehow you dropped it. Now from another angle you say that you don’t like your non-understanding. But somehow you want to become something, somebody. And whenever you feel your nobodiness, you feel frustrated. A nobodiness is... natural.\nIt is not a question of what you say about Vipassana – that is not the point at all. Everything you say about everybody is basically about you... and every situation is your situation. Whether Vipassana is in a beautiful space or not is not a problem to you – you have nothing to do with that. And how can you decide whether she is in a beautiful space or not? Only one thing is certain – that whatsoever space you are in, you go on creating trouble for yourself. You don t accept it... you don’t allow it to be beautiful. Somehow you condemn it – a suicidal tendency.\nSo wherever you are, you are going to be yourself – whether a housewife in England or a sannyasin in Poona makes no difference. Wherever you are, you are going to be yourself. Places cannot make any difference – they are irrelevant factors.\nMy whole effort is, that wherever you are, if you accept yourself, you will be happy. If you reject yourself, then wherever you are you will be in misery... and misery is your creation.\nSo stop fighting with yourself. Just see that it is pointless. If you don’t understand, you don’t. What can be done? Accept it – and then the problem disappears.\nThat is the point where growth starts – through acceptance, not struggle. It is not an effort to become something. It is a relaxation into whatever you are. Then you will not feel depressed; you may feel helpless, but not depressed. And helplessness is a beautiful feeling, because all prayer arises out of helplessness.\nHelplessness is a beautiful feeling, because it is a non-ego state. You will feel helpless... you cannot do anything. Somebody is dying, and you loved the person – and you cannot do anything. Tremendously helpless, impotent – yet this is beautiful. You understand that the whole ego is nonsense – it is of no use. You cannot make anything out of it... you cannot even help a person who is dying. So what else can you do?\nIt becomes a depression if you think in terms of ego. Then you would like to become strong, more understanding, more powerful, so that next time anybody is in trouble and you feel hurt, you can help him. That’s what you are doing. Then you feel depressed that you have not grown yet.\nIf you feel helpless, simply bow down in that deep helplessness. You sit by the side of Vipassana and pray that ‘I am helpless, and nothing can be done’. And in that helplessness, you will see not only yourself as helpless, but that the whole of humanity is helpless. In that helplessness you will see that all egos are false. Suddenly the ego becomes absolutely irrelevant. And in that humbleness, you disappear. Something else arises – a prayer. Nothing more can be done. Whenever somebody is in trouble, you pray – that’s all. But people like to do something rather than pray, because prayer means helplessness.\n[She replies: I’ve always prayed... but now I don’t know who’s there to pray to.]\nAgain, mm? your prayer must be a trick to do something. You pray – for some end. You pray and you will see whether it is working or not. Then it is not prayer... it is again a method. If everything is failing, one prays to God, and thinks that now prayer should do something. And when too it does nothing, you become even more depressed. You don’t know who to pray to, and what to say, and what not to say. That is not the point.\nPrayer is an end in itself. It is just a cry of humbleness, a deep cry of helplessness. Not that you pray to somebody – there may be nobody – but you simply feel helpless like a child. The child starts calling for the mummy or the dad. They may not be anywhere... they may not exist. But that is not the point. The child starts crying – and that crying is cleansing.\nIt is not that Vipassana is going to be helped. My whole point is totally different. You are going to be helped. And not as an end result of it, but just by praying you will feel cleansed. You will again feel settled, undisturbed. You will be able to accept more, you will become more open. Even death becomes okay.\nPeople pray – that too is a technique for them; part of their egoistic effort. I’m not talking about that kind of prayer – but the prayer that arises out of a situation where you feel you cannot do anything. Not that something will happen out of it – but you will be transformed. You will not feel that something is lacking. You will feel a fulfillment. You will feel a certain new calmness that has never been there. And it always happens near death, because death is the most crucial moment.\nWhenever you love somebody – a friend – and he is dying, a great opportunity opens for you... because this moment will throw you into complete helplessness. And if you can pray – I don’t mean that you verbalise, or say something – if you can simply cry in helplessness and tears come, you will be cleansed. It will be a purification. You will come out of it younger, fresher, new.\nSo don’t make it a depression, because that is not going to do anything. If you can enjoy it, you enjoy it, mm? and there is no problem. But if you are depressed, it will not be of any useIt is just\na sheer wastage. Death should not be wasted that way.\nThere will be so many sannyasins who will be going by and bythey have to go. (a gentle laugh)\nSo it is a training. Vipassana is a door – now other sannyasins will also follow. So this crisis will be coming again and again – because nobody is going to be here forever. So learn from it. It is a great discipline to watch death.\nAnd she is really dying in a very very meaningful way, mm? She is dying the way I would like her to die. She is giving time to everybody to think; to go again and again, and find death is there. She will\nbe hanging between death and life and... you will all be hanging between death and life with her. She is really doing her very best. What more can she do for you? So use this opportunity.\nAnd the day she dies – she will die some day – make it a celebration. First be purified by her death. In fact in her death, try to learn how to die. In her death let your death also happen. Make it an opportunity to move and see what death is... so you have some taste of it... some flavour of it. And when she dies, all the sannyasins should make it a celebration... dance, sing... be ecstatic.\nDeath should be welcomed... it is one of the greatest events in life. There are only three great events in life: birth, love, and death. So birth has already happened – cannot do anything about it. Love is very exceptional... happens to very few people, and you cannot know anything about it. Death happens to all, and you cannot avoid it, mm? – that is the only certainty. So accept it, rejoice in it, delight in it.\nBut before she dies, Vipassana is giving you an opportunity to be cleansed and pure and meditative. So when she leaves the body, you can all delight in that phenomenon, mm? I would like you all to go dancing around her body on the fire, mm? till she is reduced to ashes. Go on dancing ecstatically! You may never attain to that deep meditation again.\n[The Enlightenment Intensive group are present. One group member says: I am understanding more and more things, but every time I understand something, it doesn’t do any good. I don’t understand what point understanding has.]\nFirst thing to be understood is that understanding is not a static thing... it is a dynamic energy. People think in terms of understanding being a static thing – that once you have attained it, you have attained for always.\nUnderstanding is not like that. It is a constantly flowing river. It is not that you attain it once and forever and then you are finished with it; then there is no need to worry about it, and whenever you want to use it you can, because it is always there. No. It has to be attained every moment again and again. It is just like breathing.\nIt is not that you have taken one breath, so now there is no need to breathe again. You have to breathe again and again every moment. It is a life-process – a process, not a thing. Understanding cannot be possessed. You have to create it every moment – it is a creative process.\nSo this happens in a group – you attain to some insight, and then you are very happy that you have understood, mm? Then you go into the market, and again you have lost it, again you are miserable. If you really want to be a man of understanding, you have to go on creating it continuously – otherwise it will be a dead thing.\n[The sannyasin says: It seems like I keep getting the message, but I don’t see it clearly.]\nThat’s what understanding means – to see clearly, (a chuckle) whatsoever is the message. If you feel that you need not understand each moment – perfectly good. Who else should decide it?\nThen this is your understanding – that sometimes you need it, and sometimes you don’t. It is your understanding that there are moments that it becomes heavy on you – then no need to be heavy; put it aside. There are moments when you want to be foolish – be foolish.\nBut what I am saying is that if you become foolish because of the understanding that wisdom becomes a burden for you, then you are following understanding. Understand me? Understanding continues. Now you are understandingly foolish, now you are understandingly on a holiday. Now you know that understanding becomes a tension, so you go into the marketplace and you get lost ut this is your understanding. Understanding is such a vast phenomenon that it can comprehend its opposite.\nSo there is no problem. But if you enjoy problems, you can create them. And I am not condemning it – that there is something wrong. I am the last person to condemn anything.\n[The sannyasin says: I get the feeling that I use my understanding to hold on to things.]\nIt is not in fact understanding. What you are doing is, you are afraid of the unknown – so you want it to be made, reduced, known. If you encounter anything that you feel is unknown, you feel insecure with it, afraid, scared. You want to figure it out so that it becomes familiar. Once it is familiar and known, you are not worried – then you can tackle it. You want to categorise, label things... this is this and that is that, mm? Once you have labelled things you are at home. You feel now there is no danger, no stranger. You know everybody’s name, everybody’s religion, everybody’s country – finished! You have a complete file. But this file is not reality.\nAnd if you know somebody’s name, that does not mean that you know him. If you know somebody’s religion and country, that does not mean that you know him. You may know that he is English, speaks English... is a doctor, or this and that – but this is not knowing him.\nIn fact this is trying to avoid the unknown in that person. You are creating a front from where you can relate. You don’t want to relate to a man who is unknown, so you call him a doctor or an engineer. Now it is manageable... you know what an engineer is. But a man... nobody knows what a man is. This is not understanding. In fact this is a trick of the fear.\nWhenever he comes across a man who says that he is an Englishman, is a doctor, that his name is this and that, that he is a Christian or whatever, a man of understanding will put aside all these labels. Labels are useless. How can a man be labelled? And how can reality be confined to words? It is so vast... so immense.\nSo you put aside all the labels, and you look inside the man. You forget that he is English, you forget that he is German; you forget that he is a doctor or an engineer. You simply look into the reality of that which is there. You look into the fact... and that penetration into the fact is understanding. And that will never burden you – because to come to such a contact with a person is a non-ending contact. The person will always remain new.\nReality is so vast, so multifaceted, that the more you know, the more remains to be known. Understanding is non-ending. It is not knowledge. Knowledge is limited, of the mind. Understanding is of the heart. Then you feel the reality... you touch the reality. You forget all words about it, all theories. Then you are never burdened. You cannot say that now I have it in my hands like an alive thing, crystal-clear. No.\nLao Tzu says that ‘Everybody seems to be clear. Only I am muddle-headed’. A man of understanding is muddle-headed because he looks so deeply that he cannot figure out, mm?\nPeople always manage to find out immediately who is who. Otherwise everybody is such a strange phenomenon – how can you figure it out?\nSo live according to your own feelings. And sometimes if you feel that understanding.I have not\nknown that understanding can become a burden – knowledge becomes a burden.so you must be\nmisunderstanding somewhere. But if this is your understanding I say perfectly good, mm? Follow your understanding.\n[Another sannyasin says: I’ve a lot to say but it’s all stuff that I’ve said before. And when I say it, nothing seems to happen to it.]\nThis time keep quiet, and let us see if something happens! Who knows – maybe it will happen.\nThat’s good... that’s understanding, mm? If you can see that you go on repeating your questions, the same questionsEven if you can understand this – that you go on repeating your habits and\nthe same questions – then something is on the way. Something is happeningyou are no more the\nsame.\nThrough intellect, nothing ever happens. But once you understand this, then by and by you shift from intellect and intellectual questions, and this and that, and you start. Living a more ordinary reality. Things start happening – they are always happening there.\nIt is the head which goes on functioning as a buffer. It doesn’t allow you to come in contact with reality. Everything is happening, but hidden behind your head, cushioned, comfortable, it seems nothing has happened.\nGood! This time be quiet, mm?\n[A sannyasin said that much energy was arising through the groups and the meditations, and that his skin had begun to erupt.]\nIt is nothing to worry about. When the mind starts throwing something out, particularly negative emotions, the body also correspondingly releases its negativities – because body and mind exist parallel, exactly parallel.\nIf you are suppressing anger, the body is also suppressing some energy parallel to it. So every emotion has some counterpart in the body. So when mind catharsis goes through the process, the body will also go through catharsis, and it will release many things, and something painful also. But it is good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3710","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/>Nothing to Lose But Your Head</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3710 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nothing_to_Lose_But_Your_Head/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

change?</p><p><br></p><p>You are afraid... you are scared of the change. That’s why you
feel... you feel shattered. You are going to be demolished completely –
only then the new will arise; only on your death. You as you are will
disappear. So you will have to pass through a very shattering
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the death, the cross, and then is the resurrection of the new
being. The new being is completely discontinuous with you... you simply
give space for it.</p><p><br></p><p>[She asks: Does it happen little by little then?]</p><p><br></p><p>No, it will happen in a sudden moment. But you will get ready for it
by and by.</p><p><br></p><p>It can happen right now, but if you get scared you won’t allow it.
Your permission is needed – only then it can happen. God never
interferes – remember that. When you invite, He comes. When you dose the
door, He waits outside. He will not even knock because that may be an
interference, a trespass.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy is arising – cooperate with it. Feel happy and grateful
and move with it... don’t go in the opposite direction. Be completely
mad with it. Then suddenly... it is gone. And you will feel after it
quiet, calm, collected.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin refers to Ma Vipassana who is dying in hospital: I
didn’t know if it was really any better to die like that here, or as a
housewife in England somewhere... But when something happens – a shock,
a crisis – there’s just doubt and fear inside.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm... the only problem is that you go on expecting too much from
yourself. You have dropped other expectations... now there is this new
expectation of being understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Why can’t one simply be as one is? If you are not understanding, you
are not understanding. Why this constant effort to make something,
become something, be something, which you are not?</p><p><br></p><p>The only understanding there is, is this: that one accepts oneself as
one is. What else can you do? This whole effort in the name of growth is
nothing but an ego trip. You will get frustrated again and again. And in
every crisis you will come to a point where you feel that nothing has
happened. But why should anything happen in the first place?</p><p><br></p><p>The expectation that something has to happen is creating the whole
trouble. Why should it happen? And what is the point of expecting it?
You will go on trying to make it happen, planning how to – then you will
be tense. And when it will not happen, you will create a false
pretension that it has happened – because one cannot live in continuous
misery. To hide that misery, one creates a mask of understanding. But
again and again this mask is to be broken. Whenever a real problem
arises, again you will see that you are standing naked, and the mask is
not functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>So what I am insisting is – accept the situation you find that you
are in. There is no way out of it. That’s what understanding is –
accepting the way you are. Not that you grow. Suddenly you see that
there is no need for anything. Then all these situations can be
helpful... they bring you back down to reality. A crisis is a blessing;
it brings you back to earth again and again. Otherwise you start moving
in your fantasy.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not a question of Vipassana – it has nothing to do with her;
it is your problem. Why do you think that a housewife in England is in
some way inferior to you, mm?’</p><p><br></p><p>[She answers:... everybody says how incredible and how beautiful
Vipassana must be feeling. I can say that too – but I don’t know
it.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, there is no need to say anything. If others are saying, maybe
they are right – maybe they are feeling that way. But there is no need
for you to feel that way too. You are not like them. And there</p><p><br></p><p>is no need for them to feel like you – so don’t think that they are
pretending. They may be true. It is not a problem for them – it is a
problem for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one thing has to be understood: that this is the way you are,
and that you don’t understand. Accept this non-understanding. You are
fighting with it – that’s why you feel depressed. [That you are]
ignorant, non-understanding, stupid, idiotic – accept it! Why do you
want to be a wise woman or something like that?</p><p><br></p><p>Then the problem disappears – because it is created by a deep
non-acceptance. Somehow you go on rejecting yourself in subtle ways. If
I tell you, then you drop one way, but you create the same problem in
some other way. Someday you will see.… You were saying that you don’t
like your body – somehow you dropped it. Now from another angle you say
that you don’t like your non-understanding. But somehow you want to
become something, somebody. And whenever you feel your nobodiness, you
feel frustrated. A nobodiness is... natural.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of what you say about Vipassana – that is not
the point at all. Everything you say about everybody is basically about
you... and every situation is your situation. Whether Vipassana is in a
beautiful space or not is not a problem to you – you have nothing to do
with that. And how can you decide whether she is in a beautiful space or
not? Only one thing is certain – that whatsoever space you are in, you
go on creating trouble for yourself. You don t accept it... you don’t
allow it to be beautiful. Somehow you condemn it – a suicidal
tendency.</p><p><br></p><p>So wherever you are, you are going to be yourself – whether a
housewife in England or a sannyasin in Poona makes no difference.
Wherever you are, you are going to be yourself. Places cannot make any
difference – they are irrelevant factors.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort is, that wherever you are, if you accept yourself,
you will be happy. If you reject yourself, then wherever you are you
will be in misery... and misery is your creation.</p><p><br></p><p>So stop fighting with yourself. Just see that it is pointless. If you
don’t understand, you don’t. What can be done? Accept it – and then the
problem disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the point where growth starts – through acceptance, not
struggle. It is not an effort to become something. It is a relaxation
into whatever you are. Then you will not feel depressed; you may feel
helpless, but not depressed. And helplessness is a beautiful feeling,
because all prayer arises out of helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Helplessness is a beautiful feeling, because it is a non-ego state.
You will feel helpless... you cannot do anything. Somebody is dying, and
you loved the person – and you cannot do anything. Tremendously
helpless, impotent – yet this is beautiful. You understand that the
whole ego is nonsense – it is of no use. You cannot make anything out of
it... you cannot even help a person who is dying. So what else can you
do?</p><p><br></p><p>It becomes a depression if you think in terms of ego. Then you would
like to become strong, more understanding, more powerful, so that next
time anybody is in trouble and you feel hurt, you can help him. That’s
what you are doing. Then you feel depressed that you have not grown
yet.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel helpless, simply bow down in that deep helplessness. You
sit by the side of Vipassana and pray that ‘I am helpless, and nothing
can be done’. And in that helplessness, you will see not only yourself
as helpless, but that the whole of humanity is helpless. In that
helplessness you will see that all egos are false. Suddenly the ego
becomes absolutely irrelevant. And in that humbleness, you disappear.
Something else arises – a prayer. Nothing more can be done. Whenever
somebody is in trouble, you pray – that’s all. But people like to do
something rather than pray, because prayer means helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>[She replies: I’ve always prayed... but now I don’t know who’s there
to pray to.]</p><p><br></p><p>Again, mm? your prayer must be a trick to do something. You pray –
for some end. You pray and you will see whether it is working or not.
Then it is not prayer... it is again a method. If everything is failing,
one prays to God, and thinks that now prayer should do something. And
when too it does nothing, you become even more depressed. You don’t know
who to pray to, and what to say, and what not to say. That is not the
point.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is an end in itself. It is just a cry of humbleness, a deep
cry of helplessness. Not that you pray to somebody – there may be nobody
– but you simply feel helpless like a child. The child starts calling
for the mummy or the dad. They may not be anywhere... they may not
exist. But that is not the point. The child starts crying – and that
crying is cleansing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that Vipassana is going to be helped. My whole point is
totally different. You are going to be helped. And not as an end result
of it, but just by praying you will feel cleansed. You will again feel
settled, undisturbed. You will be able to accept more, you will become
more open. Even death becomes okay.</p><p><br></p><p>People pray – that too is a technique for them; part of their
egoistic effort. I’m not talking about that kind of prayer – but the
prayer that arises out of a situation where you feel you cannot do
anything. Not that something will happen out of it – but you will be
transformed. You will not feel that something is lacking. You will feel
a fulfillment. You will feel a certain new calmness that has never been
there. And it always happens near death, because death is the most
crucial moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you love somebody – a friend – and he is dying, a great
opportunity opens for you... because this moment will throw you into
complete helplessness. And if you can pray – I don’t mean that you
verbalise, or say something – if you can simply cry in helplessness and
tears come, you will be cleansed. It will be a purification. You will
come out of it younger, fresher, new.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t make it a depression, because that is not going to do
anything. If you can enjoy it, you enjoy it, mm? and there is no
problem. But if you are depressed, it will not be of any use<span class=s4></span>It is just</p><p>a sheer wastage. Death should not be wasted that way.</p><p><br></p><p>There will be so many sannyasins who will be going by and by<span class=s4></span>they have to go. (a gentle laugh)</p><p>So it is a training. Vipassana is a door – now other sannyasins will
also follow. So this crisis will be coming again and again – because
nobody is going to be here forever. So learn from it. It is a great
discipline to watch death.</p><p><br></p><p>And she is really dying in a very very meaningful way, mm? She is
dying the way I would like her to die. She is giving time to everybody
to think; to go again and again, and find death is there. She will</p><p><br></p><p>be hanging between death and life and... you will all be hanging
between death and life with her. She is really doing her very best. What
more can she do for you? So use this opportunity.</p><p>And the day she dies – she will die some day – make it a celebration.
First be purified by her death. In fact in her death, try to learn how
to die. In her death let your death also happen. Make it an opportunity
to move and see what death is... so you have some taste of it... some
flavour of it. And when she dies, all the sannyasins should make it a
celebration... dance, sing... be ecstatic.</p><p>Death should be welcomed... it is one of the greatest events in life.
There are only three great events in life: birth, love, and death. So
birth has already happened – cannot do anything about it. Love is very
exceptional... happens to very few people, and you cannot know anything
about it. Death happens to all, and you cannot avoid it, mm? – that is
the only certainty. So accept it, rejoice in it, delight in it.</p><p>But before she dies, Vipassana is giving you an opportunity to be
cleansed and pure and meditative. So when she leaves the body, you can
all delight in that phenomenon, mm? I would like you all to go dancing
around her body on the fire, mm? till she is reduced to ashes. Go on
dancing ecstatically! You may never attain to that deep meditation
again.</p><p>[The Enlightenment Intensive group are present. One group member
says: I am understanding more and more things, but every time I
understand something, it doesn’t do any good. I don’t understand what
point understanding has.]</p><p>First thing to be understood is that understanding is not a static
thing... it is a dynamic energy. People think in terms of understanding
being a static thing – that once you have attained it, you have attained
for always.</p><p>Understanding is not like that. It is a constantly flowing river. It
is not that you attain it once and forever and then you are finished
with it; then there is no need to worry about it, and whenever you want
to use it you can, because it is always there. No. It has to be attained
every moment again and again. It is just like breathing.</p><p>It is not that you have taken one breath, so now there is no need to
breathe again. You have to breathe again and again every moment. It is a
life-process – a process, not a thing. Understanding cannot be
possessed. You have to create it every moment – it is a creative
process.</p><p>So this happens in a group – you attain to some insight, and then you
are very happy that you have understood, mm? Then you go into the
market, and again you have lost it, again you are miserable. If you
really want to be a man of understanding, you have to go on creating it
continuously – otherwise it will be a dead thing.</p><p>[The sannyasin says: It seems like I keep getting the message, but I
don’t see it clearly.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what understanding means – to see clearly, (a chuckle)
whatsoever is the message. If you feel that you need not understand each
moment – perfectly good. Who else should decide it?</p><p>Then this is your understanding – that sometimes you need it, and
sometimes you don’t. It is your understanding that there are moments
that it becomes heavy on you – then no need to be heavy; put it aside.
There are moments when you want to be foolish – be foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>But what I am saying is that if you become foolish because of the
understanding that wisdom becomes a burden for you, then you are
following understanding. Understand me? Understanding continues. Now you
are understandingly foolish, now you are understandingly on a holiday.
Now you know that understanding becomes a tension, so you go into the
marketplace and you get lost ut this is your understanding.
Understanding is such a vast phenomenon that it can comprehend its
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no problem. But if you enjoy problems, you can create
them. And I am not condemning it – that there is something wrong. I am
the last person to condemn anything.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin says: I get the feeling that I use my understanding to
hold on to things.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is not in fact understanding. What you are doing is, you are
afraid of the unknown – so you want it to be made, reduced, known. If
you encounter anything that you feel is unknown, you feel insecure with
it, afraid, scared. You want to figure it out so that it becomes
familiar. Once it is familiar and known, you are not worried – then you
can tackle it. You want to categorise, label things... this is this and
that is that, mm? Once you have labelled things you are at home. You
feel now there is no danger, no stranger. You know everybody’s name,
everybody’s religion, everybody’s country – finished! You have a
complete file. But this file is not reality.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you know somebody’s name, that does not mean that you know
him. If you know somebody’s religion and country, that does not mean
that you know him. You may know that he is English, speaks English... is
a doctor, or this and that – but this is not knowing him.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact this is trying to avoid the unknown in that person. You are
creating a front from where you can relate. You don’t want to relate to
a man who is unknown, so you call him a doctor or an engineer. Now it is
manageable... you know what an engineer is. But a man... nobody knows
what a man is. This is not understanding. In fact this is a trick of the
fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever he comes across a man who says that he is an Englishman, is
a doctor, that his name is this and that, that he is a Christian or
whatever, a man of understanding will put aside all these labels. Labels
are useless. How can a man be labelled? And how can reality be confined
to words? It is so vast... so immense.</p><p><br></p><p>So you put aside all the labels, and you look inside the man. You
forget that he is English, you forget that he is German; you forget that
he is a doctor or an engineer. You simply look into the reality of that
which is there. You look into the fact... and that penetration into the
fact is understanding. And that will never burden you – because to come
to such a contact with a person is a non-ending contact. The person will
always remain new.</p><p><br></p><p>Reality is so vast, so multifaceted, that the more you know, the more
remains to be known. Understanding is non-ending. It is not knowledge.
Knowledge is limited, of the mind. Understanding is of the heart. Then
you feel the reality... you touch the reality. You forget all words
about it, all theories. Then you are never burdened. You cannot say that
now I have it in my hands like an alive thing, crystal-clear. No.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says that ‘Everybody seems to be clear. Only I am
muddle-headed’. A man of understanding is muddle-headed because he looks
so deeply that he cannot figure out, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>People always manage to find out immediately who is who. Otherwise
everybody is such a strange phenomenon – how can you figure it out?</p><p><br></p><p>So live according to your own feelings. And sometimes if you feel
that understanding.<span class=s4></span>I have not</p><p>known that understanding can become a burden – knowledge becomes a
burden.<span class=s4></span>so you must be</p><p>misunderstanding somewhere. But if this is your understanding I say
perfectly good, mm? Follow your understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>[Another sannyasin says: I’ve a lot to say but it’s all stuff that
I’ve said before. And when I say it, nothing seems to happen to it.]</p><p><br></p><p>This time keep quiet, and let us see if something happens! Who knows
– maybe it will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s good... that’s understanding, mm? If you can see that you go
on repeating your questions, the same questions<span class=s4></span>Even if you can understand this – that you go on
repeating your habits and</p><p>the same questions – then something is on the way. Something is
happening<span class=s4></span>you are no more the</p><p>same.</p><p><br></p><p>Through intellect, nothing ever happens. But once you understand
this, then by and by you shift from intellect and intellectual
questions, and this and that, and you start. Living a more ordinary
reality. Things start happening – they are always happening there.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the head which goes on functioning as a buffer. It doesn’t
allow you to come in contact with reality. Everything is happening, but
hidden behind your head, cushioned, comfortable, it seems nothing has
happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Good! This time be quiet, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said that much energy was arising through the groups and
the meditations, and that his skin had begun to erupt.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is nothing to worry about. When the mind starts throwing something
out, particularly negative emotions, the body also correspondingly
releases its negativities – because body and mind exist parallel,
exactly parallel.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are suppressing anger, the body is also suppressing some
energy parallel to it. So every emotion has some counterpart in the
body. So when mind catharsis goes through the process, the body will
also go through catharsis, and it will release many things, and
something painful also. But it is good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

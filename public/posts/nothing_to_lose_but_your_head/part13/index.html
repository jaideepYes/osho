He asked Osho if he should ‘do my own thing’.]\nYou do your own thing. Absorb whatsoever you can get from anywhere, and always create a synthesis out of your own experience. Otherwise what you teach is borrowed, and the borrowed cannot be taught – because it is an art, not a science. Unless you have experienced something within you you cannot transfer that experience to anybody else. You can teach the techniques, but they are not the basic thing – they are just the outer shell. The content is something totally different – that is your experience.\nSo always remain open to learn from wherever you can. Never become closed. Life is so tremendous that one can never come to a point where one can say ‘Now I have learned’. It never happens. Even God is learning – hence He goes on creating. If He has learnt the art, there is no need to create anymore. He still goes on innovating, creating, experimenting. The whole existence is an experiment.\nKnowledge should never become a dead thing. It should be a constant learning. So learn from everywhere, and then always listen to your own inner synthesis. If you are teaching something which you have not experienced, which is not your own, in which your own heart is not beating, you are transferring stale knowledge – and that is dangerous. All stale knowledge becomes poisonous to the person to whom you are transferring it. So learn from everywhere, and learn with total humbleness, but remain open to transfer your own experience.\nI am not in favour of too much strain. The whole point is that people are already too strained. They are almost on the verge of breakdown. Don’t put any more strain on them. Rather, teach them how to relax – so relaxation remains the background. Even if they are doing yoga exercises, the\ngoal remains relaxation. Sometimes in certain postures they have to strain, but the goal remains relaxation. For example, I can close my fist as hard as I can, I can put all my energies into closing it. A point will come where it is no more possible to force it, and it will open on its own and become relaxed – more relaxed than it was before.\nAfter every deep exercise you can relax more. Tension can be used only as a step towards relaxation; it is not a goal in itself. Many Hatha Yoga exercises are designed as if tension is the goal, and many yoga teachers think tension is the goal – it is not.\nJust the other day I was reading a book of Lenza Del Vasto. He is Italian and a disciple of Gandhi. He says never allow yourself any unoccupied moment: constantly do something. Even if you have nothing to do, walk, dig a hole in the garden, run – but do something. Don’t just sit without doing anything, because then the mind will start working. If you are tired, the mind cannot think – but this is not a state of meditation. This is simply a state of exhaustion – it is not rest.\nI also say work hard – but the goal remains relaxation. Work so hard that you can relax deeply. If you don’t work hard you cannot relax deeply.\nWork is not worship. Worship is always relaxation. Work is just a means to reach that relaxation where worship is possible, where deep gratefulness, prayer, meditation, is possible. But rest is the goal, not work. Love is the goal, not labour. Celebration is the goal, not duty. So this emphasis has to be remembered.\nWhatsoever you are doing here is to help people to become more happy, more loose, more easy- going. It is to help them towards a deep let-go. That remains the goal of whatsoever is happening around me – that people should become capable of deep sleep, of deep meditation, of deep relaxation. They should become capable of enjoying fun. They should be able to fool around. They should not be serious. Seriousness is a disease.\nSo while you are teaching Yoga, don’t be serious. When one is teaching people, one tends to become serious – because if you are not, people will think that the thing that you are teaching is not serious. Teachers become serious, longfaced, and they destroy young children.\nBe laughing, ke relaxed – because the whole goal is how to be able to play; how to be able to play without any motivation. There is no motivation, but the energy is there. The thing is now to delight in it. So remember, mm?\n[The sannyasin then asks about giving space to his girlfriend when she is involved with someone else.]\nIf you can relax and give [your girlfriend] that much space, it is going to do something tremendous for you. For her it may not be much, but for you it is going to be a tremendous thing, and very meaningful.\nWhen you give freedom, it has to be unconditional. Sex, no sex, is not the question. When you give the other person his or her own space, you give it totally, with no strings attached to it. It is not a long rope – there is no rope. If you mean by freedom a long rope, it is not freedom. It is just cleverness\nand being cunning – and it is not going to help you. You give space and freedom, but you go on hoping that it will never be taken for granted.\nThat’s the confusion; that’s why you feel off-balance. We give freedom to the other with the idea that the other is not going to use it. Deep down we go on hoping that the other will feel obliged to us. will become more in love with us. We give freedom but with the deep unconscious hope that the other is not going to use it. If the other uses it, then the problem arises. Give total freedom.\nYou should feel good that she is not feeling guilty. To make anybody feel guilty is a sin; there is no other sin like it. It cripples people, paralyses them. So tell her to be completely free and not to feel any guilt.\nOnce you have accepted this, you will have a very very deep freedom within yourself, because this is a basic law: if you can give freedom to others, you have it. And there is nothing like freedom. If you don’t give freedom to others, you don’t have it, you can’t have it. The more you give it, the more you have of it. The less you give, the less you have of it. It is a double-edged sword – it cuts both ways. You give freedom to the other and immediately you are free. You try to make a bondage, a possessiveness around the other, and you are bound, you are a slave; it is mutual.\nSo just accept it. If you do, very soon a deep tranquillity will come to you, suddenly a freedom. It can come right now. It is not a question of thinking about it. It is just a flash of understanding.\nAnd if she feels attracted to somebody else, what can she do? Nothing can be done about it. One is a victim of so many desires. So feel compassion for her, and just tell her to not be disturbed in any way about it.\nSoon you will see that as you give her more freedom, her guilt will disappear, and then by and by the desire for others will disappear too. It is a vicious circle. You feel attracted towards somebody and you feel guilty because you have promised to somebody else to be with him forever. You are going against your own promise, your own ego, your own image. The more guilty you feel, the more attracted you feel. The more you try to repress a desire, the more powerful it becomes. The more you resist it, the more the mind fantasises about it.\nWhen the guilt disappears, it is a good sign; a sign that [your girlfriend] is coming out of the vicious circle. Soon she will see that nobody is preventing her, and all the charm will be gone. She will see that somebody is there who loves her so much that he is even ready to love her lovers. She will feel a new and even deeper relationship to you. Freedom will bring you closer and closer.\nAnd this is something to be understood: you can be close to somebody in two ways. You can be forced by the law, by conscience, guilt, religion, the police – then you are close, but you are not close. You are just physically close.\nThere is another closeness that comes out of freedom. Both partners are free to be as far away as they want, but still they choose to be close. It is a choice out of total freedom. It has a different fragrance. It is nothing of this world... it is almost something of another world.\nSo just accept it, and accept it with joy. Feel happy that you could give her such freedom.\n[The sannyasin replies: I don’t know whether I’m suppressing my feeling... I’m confused about what I feel.]\nNo, if you have understood me, things will change immediately, from tomorrow.\nAnd it is not a question of what she says. It is for you to look inside and see whether you are real or not. She may say that you are not being real because she cannot understand that a man who loves her will allow her to move with somebody else. That is her problem, not yours. Now she will try to throw the whole responsibility on you – as if you are trying to be higher than her, holier than her.\nThat too is good, that too is a situation for you, mm? First she will wait for you to make her feel guilty. If that doesn’t happen, then somewhere something is wrong. So she will immediately say that you are being unreal. She may even say that you don’t love her, and that is why you are allowing her to move with someone else. She will say that if you had loved her you would have fought for her, and that it is not that you are not jealous – you don’t love her. She will say all these things – it is natural. She will have to cope with this problem, and it is a great problem, because the vicious circle has been broken.\nBy and by the clouds will disappear from her eyes and she will be able to see what is happening. But it is good, it is very good. It is going to be a great blessing to you... This is the real Yoga!\n[A sannyasin in the yoga class said she wanted to scream in one of the postures and asked if she should do so.]\nYou can do it in your own room whenever you feel like it – and it will come again. It is good to allow it – but not in the class, because then everybody will start.\nAnd this is going to happen, rememberThis is going to happen with our people because they are\ndoing other meditations, and the meditations are hitting their repressed things deeply. In doing a certain posture they may touch the same centre. Many people will feel that they want to scream, so tell them they will have to do it at home.\nSoon we will have a small room here, and whenever somebody feels, he can go and scream there. Underground rooms will be ready soon. But allow it in your room. It will be very good and will relax many things.\n[A sannyasin said that he was hard of hearing in his right ear since he had been blown up in the second world war.…\nOsho checked his energy, and then said that much could be done, and suggested that he should take a very very hot shower, so hot that he perspired, then follow this with a very cold shower. This would give exercise to the tissues of the right hemisphere, helping them to expand and contract.]\n... within three months you will be able to hear almost sixty percent. And this exercise will help your consciousness also, because the mind will start functioning.\nThe second thing: when you do the Nadabrahma meditation, use ear plugs so that no outer sound can be heard. Then just hum so that you can just feel the inner sound. That inner sound will hit the ear from inside and it will become an inner massage. That also will help.\n[The ashram yoga teacher] can teach you two yoga exercises. One is sarvangasan, if shirshasan is not possible. These two exercises will do – just three minutes in the morning before you take your bath. It is just standing on your head so that the blood circulates deep down into the head. The whole thing is how to make the inner brain moving, functioning. Ordinarily it is very difficult for blood to reach the brain, because it is against gravitation and the heart has to pump continuously.\nIf you feel that these positions are difficult, use a slanting bed – just for five to ten minutes. Dead tissues have collected in your head, and this blood will carry them away.\nIf you continue these things for three months, you will have almost sixty percent hearing in your right ear. If you can continue them for a year, you can have almost ninety percent hearing.\n[A sannyasin says: Sometimes when I go to sleep and I lie on my back, I can feel something moving in my body. It’s not my body... it feels like energy.]\nMm mm, it is energy – so help it to move, and don’t stop it. Wherever it goes, you simply follow. Simply become the shadow and let it become the real; it is your real energy. So just help it to move.\nYou may be scared in the beginning because it can go away from the body, and that is very scaring. Once you become attuned to it, it has a beauty of its own. Nothing can be compared to it – sexual orgasm is nothing. It gives you such a deep orgasm... the whole body thrills with bliss.\nIf you follow it silently, without resistance, it will move away, and you may be able to see your own body lying on the bed – and you are standing near the door. You may be able to hover over your bed like a cloud. Don’t be afraid. Enjoy it... it is perfectly good.\nWhen you come back to the body you will have a thrill. Leaving the body and coming back again, you Will have a thrill, and the thrill is deeper than any sexual orgasm.\nIn fact in sexual orgasm the same thing happens. Because of the female energy, your male energy is attracted so deeply that it leaves your body for a few seconds. It is not only an ejaculation of semen – it is an ejaculation of you. Your whole energy is ejaculated just for a second, and then you are again back in the body. And that is the whole thrill of it.\nOnce you know how to do it without any partner, without any sex being involved, then sex becomes meaningless because now you know a higher way to attain to a deeper orgasm more easily, and at no risk, no cost.\nSo allow this... it is very good. For fifteen days cooperate.…\n[A visitor says: I don’t know... to get in touch with my creativity, with some warmth inside me. I have low energy a lot, and I don’t have good relationships with women... I came to ask you the answer... I admit want something from you.]\nI know – and you will have it.\nAll these things are interconnected. If you feel something is missing, some key is missing, then you will not be able to move in a deep relationship. You can move deeply into another being only if you have moved into your own depth, otherwise not. A superficial relationship is possible, but it satisfies nobody. On the contrary, it makes you even more disconnected.\nSo the first relationship is with oneself. Meditation is more primary than love. Without meditation, your love will be a failure. You may try with many different people, but again and again something will come in and the affair will be destroyed. That something comes from within your depth. You move so unconsciously – as if almost in a sleep – that somewhere or other you are bound to stumble and everything will be destroyed. Love is very fragile. Unless you have a perfect light in you, it will be difficult to move in love.\nAnd the work that you have been doing – Encounter groups, Psychoanalysis, Marathons – is all negative. They bring out your negative things but they don’t give you something positive. They help to clean you, but they don’t replace anything. Nobody can live in an emptiness, so again one fills oneself with the same things.\nSo you go on cleaning every day – and you will feel good. It is just as when you have taken a bath and for half an hour you feel good. Then again dirt gathers and you perspire, and the feeling from the bath is lost. That’s why people go on living from one Encounter group to another. It gives a thrill, and one feels good, but again the same life and the same things happen. These are good cleaning processes, but that is not enough. Necessary, but not enough.\nIt is as if you have cleaned the ground and you think that that is the garden. Cleaning is good – the weeds and stones have to be removed. The ground has to be prepared, seeds have to be planted, and watering and work and much patience is needed – and then the garden will come.\nWhat you have been doing is just a half of it. The other half is missing, and that is the key that you feel you would like to have.\nSannyas can be very helpful if you take courage. It becomes the first positive step. It is a commitment, and it is getting hooked with me on an unknown journey. For you it is almost dark, and you are moving in the unknown. Of course fear comes and a thousand and one questions and doubts arise, but they all belong to your negative mind.\nIf you decide to go towards some positivity, you have to become indifferent to all those doubts and questions. It is a risk. All positivity is a risk, all growth is a risk. Every birth is going to be very painful.\nWhenever a child is born, there exist two possibilities: he may live, he may not live. When he was in the mother’s womb, she was breathing for him – he was not even breathing for himself. Out of the womb he will have to breathe for himself. The first two or three minutes after the child is born are the most dangerous. Everybody is in suspense, wondering whether the child will breathe or not. And if the child does not cry the doctor has to hit him so he starts breathing. And the child has never breathed before, so it is unknown.\nSannyas is like a new birth.\nYou have lived a way, a certain style of life, and you have worked – and still you go on missing something. Try something new, something absolutely new.\nAnd this is the thing – when I say take sannyas, I mean give the responsibility to me. You drop it. Start living as if there is no problem. From this moment, simply relax. And that relaxation comes through sannyas.\nSo if you can take courage – and it is a question of courage, it is an adventure – it can be tremendously helpful. Would you like to take the jump?\n[The visitor answers: I have to think about it... I’ve worked too hard and I don’t want to think about myself anymore. But what I really want to do is to go in the other direction... to be wild and you know, not holy in the least bit.]\nThat’s what my sannyas is! (laughter) Not holy in the least bit... and it is wild. And if you are really fed up with working on yourself – that’s what I am saying – give the responsibility to me. After that there is no work. There is only trust.\nWork you have been doing – and if you think about sannyas, that also will be work. You lose nothing by it – just your past, which is meaningless. You get rid of something that has been of no worth to you. But if you think about sannyas, you will ask that same past. It is as if you ask the disease if you should take the medicine or not. That is absolutely stupid! Whom are you going to ask? You will ask yourself – and you are in a mess.\nThat’s what I mean when I say not to think about it. This is moving from reason to irreason... so come closer, (much laughter ) and close your eyes.\n... and the only thing I would like to say to you in this moment is to start living as if there is no problem. In the beginning it is only ‘as if’ but by and by you will feel that there is no problem. In fact there is no problem. The mind just goes on creating them – it is a problem-creating machine.\nLife as such has no problems. One can simply live it. Even trees are living it. Even birds and animals are living it. Only man is somehow missing it, because man has a mind, and the mind goes on creating problems.\nSo start living from this moment as if there is no problem. Move completely freely. The past is gone. And I start working immediately from this moment.\n[A sannyasin said that he was reluctant to leave Poona he was nearing a point of surrendering on another level... ]\nYou will be afraid whenever you go, because once you are here, you are so different, that going back to the old world creates fear. But that has to be faced, and it is going to be a deep experience. It will not disturb anything. It is going to be beautiful and you are going to be strengthened by it. And the next surrender will happen there, so don’t be worried about it.\nMany surrenders happen – because the first surrender can rarely be total. The mind won’t allow it. It even seems total, but it is not. The mind goes on holding something – just as a safety measure. Many times you will feel you are surrendered, and many times you will feel that you have gone far away; this will happen many times.\nBy and by you will be able to watch both. Then the real surrender will happen – and that surrender is not surrender at all. The real is so different from what you call surrender that there is no need even to call it surrender – because there is nothing opposite to it. In the beginning it is going to be a duality – just a part of the mind surrenders.\nTry to understand the mechanism. Maybe sixty percent of the mind, seventy percent, sometimes only fifty-one percent of the mind surrenders, and forty-nine percent doesn’t surrender. Then too it is good, because it is the major part and you surrender. The fifty-one percent of the mind that surrenders may lose its majority any day. It is almost parliamentary, mm? The other part of the mind will remain there hiding, watching for the right moment when it can persuade a few members of the major party towards it – and there will be many moments.\nMany times you will be angry with me and suddenly forty percent will be surrendered and sixty percent not. Many times you will expect something and it will not be fulfilled.Because it is not\nalways good to fulfill your expectations; sometimes they have to be completely destroyed.because\nunless you love me even with frustrations, you cannot love me. Your love has to come to such a point where anger, frustrationsnothing matters. The love remains uncorrupted by all these things.\nThey come and they go – at the most they become momentary things, flashes. But they are no more meaningful in any meaningful sense.\nSo many times it will happen. You have simply to watch the game of the mind. Watching both sides, by and by you will become separate from both. Then a surrender happens which is not of the mind. You cannot even call it surrenderthere is no word for it. It has a taste but it is non-verbal. When it\ncomes you will recognise it immediately.\n[The sannyasin’s wife was present. He said that though they had been married for ten years, they would have fights between them, but why, they could not say.\nThe wife said: We don’t believe each other]\nWhat is the need to believe? [She asks: Surrender?]\nThere is no need. You are asking unnecessary things. What is the need to believe and to surrender? You think you should surrender to him and he should surrender to you? That is impossible. No wife and husband can ever do that.\nThe fight is clear – you are both trying to force the other to surrender. It is an ego trip and very dangerous. If he surrenders you will not be able to forgive him – because no woman can love a man who surrenders to her. And every woman tries to have the man surrender to her.\nSo this is not a problem at all... just foolishness. If you want, I can tell him to surrender to you – and he will do it because he is my disciple. I can tell him, and every day he will touch your feet and surrender completely. (laughter) Whatsoever you say, he will do – he will become obedient.\n[She asks: But the fighting will go on?]\nThere is no need – if you understand that there is no need to surrender. There is some need to share... share your love with each other. But this is not a master and disciple relationship – sharing is enough. Two people loving each other are equal – there is no question of surrender. Drop that idea and the conflict will drop.\nOne woman came to me a few years ago – she was on the same trip. I told her husband to touch her feet at least three times a day, and that whatsoever the wife says, he has to say yes. Just after a few days she said to me, ‘What are you doing? My husband has gone almost mad! He says yes to everything. I cannot love such a man... he looks like a dog!’\nShare and love – and then sometimes fighting is not bad. But then it should be out of love, and not for each other’s surrender, and things like that. Two persons live together and sometimes a quarrel arises. It is good. It simply shows that the two are alive. If you are both dead and you live in the same room, no quarrel will arise. (laughter) Alive – a little quarrel, a little conflict.\nAnd then – he is a German. (more laughter) Take care of him... and you love each other, so there is no need to surrender. Simply share – and things will be good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4714","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/>Nothing to Lose But Your Head</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">13</h1><div class=post-meta>23 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4714 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nothing_to_Lose_But_Your_Head/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

learnt from several teachers. He asked Osho if he should ‘do my own
thing’.]</p><p><br></p><p>You do your own thing. Absorb whatsoever you can get from anywhere,
and always create a synthesis out of your own experience. Otherwise what
you teach is borrowed, and the borrowed cannot be taught – because it is
an art, not a science. Unless you have experienced something within you
you cannot transfer that experience to anybody else. You can teach the
techniques, but they are not the basic thing – they are just the outer
shell. The content is something totally different – that is your
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>So always remain open to learn from wherever you can. Never become
closed. Life is so tremendous that one can never come to a point where
one can say ‘Now I have learned’. It never happens. Even God is learning
– hence He goes on creating. If He has learnt the art, there is no need
to create anymore. He still goes on innovating, creating, experimenting.
The whole existence is an experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge should never become a dead thing. It should be a constant
learning. So learn from everywhere, and then always listen to your own
inner synthesis. If you are teaching something which you have not
experienced, which is not your own, in which your own heart is not
beating, you are transferring stale knowledge – and that is dangerous.
All stale knowledge becomes poisonous to the person to whom you are
transferring it. So learn from everywhere, and learn with total
humbleness, but remain open to transfer your own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not in favour of too much strain. The whole point is that people
are already too strained. They are almost on the verge of breakdown.
Don’t put any more strain on them. Rather, teach them how to relax – so
relaxation remains the background. Even if they are doing yoga
exercises, the</p><p><br></p><p>goal remains relaxation. Sometimes in certain postures they have to
strain, but the goal remains relaxation. For example, I can close my
fist as hard as I can, I can put all my energies into closing it. A
point will come where it is no more possible to force it, and it will
open on its own and become relaxed – more relaxed than it was
before.</p><p><br></p><p>After every deep exercise you can relax more. Tension can be used
only as a step towards relaxation; it is not a goal in itself. Many
Hatha Yoga exercises are designed as if tension is the goal, and many
yoga teachers think tension is the goal – it is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a book of Lenza Del Vasto. He is
Italian and a disciple of Gandhi. He says never allow yourself any
unoccupied moment: constantly do something. Even if you have nothing to
do, walk, dig a hole in the garden, run – but do something. Don’t just
sit without doing anything, because then the mind will start working. If
you are tired, the mind cannot think – but this is not a state of
meditation. This is simply a state of exhaustion – it is not rest.</p><p><br></p><p>I also say work hard – but the goal remains relaxation. Work so hard
that you can relax deeply. If you don’t work hard you cannot relax
deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>Work is not worship. Worship is always relaxation. Work is just a
means to reach that relaxation where worship is possible, where deep
gratefulness, prayer, meditation, is possible. But rest is the goal, not
work. Love is the goal, not labour. Celebration is the goal, not duty.
So this emphasis has to be remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you are doing here is to help people to become more happy,
more loose, more easy- going. It is to help them towards a deep let-go.
That remains the goal of whatsoever is happening around me – that people
should become capable of deep sleep, of deep meditation, of deep
relaxation. They should become capable of enjoying fun. They should be
able to fool around. They should not be serious. Seriousness is a
disease.</p><p><br></p><p>So while you are teaching Yoga, don’t be serious. When one is
teaching people, one tends to become serious – because if you are not,
people will think that the thing that you are teaching is not serious.
Teachers become serious, longfaced, and they destroy young children.</p><p><br></p><p>Be laughing, ke relaxed – because the whole goal is how to be able to
play; how to be able to play without any motivation. There is no
motivation, but the energy is there. The thing is now to delight in it.
So remember, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin then asks about giving space to his girlfriend when
she is involved with someone else.]</p><p><br></p><p>If you can relax and give [your girlfriend] that much space, it is
going to do something tremendous for you. For her it may not be much,
but for you it is going to be a tremendous thing, and very
meaningful.</p><p><br></p><p>When you give freedom, it has to be unconditional. Sex, no sex, is
not the question. When you give the other person his or her own space,
you give it totally, with no strings attached to it. It is not a long
rope – there is no rope. If you mean by freedom a long rope, it is not
freedom. It is just cleverness</p><p><br></p><p>and being cunning – and it is not going to help you. You give space
and freedom, but you go on hoping that it will never be taken for
granted.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the confusion; that’s why you feel off-balance. We give
freedom to the other with the idea that the other is not going to use
it. Deep down we go on hoping that the other will feel obliged to us.
will become more in love with us. We give freedom but with the deep
unconscious hope that the other is not going to use it. If the other
uses it, then the problem arises. Give total freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>You should feel good that she is not feeling guilty. To make anybody
feel guilty is a sin; there is no other sin like it. It cripples people,
paralyses them. So tell her to be completely free and not to feel any
guilt.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have accepted this, you will have a very very deep freedom
within yourself, because this is a basic law: if you can give freedom to
others, you have it. And there is nothing like freedom. If you don’t
give freedom to others, you don’t have it, you can’t have it. The more
you give it, the more you have of it. The less you give, the less you
have of it. It is a double-edged sword – it cuts both ways. You give
freedom to the other and immediately you are free. You try to make a
bondage, a possessiveness around the other, and you are bound, you are a
slave; it is mutual.</p><p><br></p><p>So just accept it. If you do, very soon a deep tranquillity will come
to you, suddenly a freedom. It can come right now. It is not a question
of thinking about it. It is just a flash of understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>And if she feels attracted to somebody else, what can she do? Nothing
can be done about it. One is a victim of so many desires. So feel
compassion for her, and just tell her to not be disturbed in any way
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon you will see that as you give her more freedom, her guilt will
disappear, and then by and by the desire for others will disappear too.
It is a vicious circle. You feel attracted towards somebody and you feel
guilty because you have promised to somebody else to be with him
forever. You are going against your own promise, your own ego, your own
image. The more guilty you feel, the more attracted you feel. The more
you try to repress a desire, the more powerful it becomes. The more you
resist it, the more the mind fantasises about it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the guilt disappears, it is a good sign; a sign that [your
girlfriend] is coming out of the vicious circle. Soon she will see that
nobody is preventing her, and all the charm will be gone. She will see
that somebody is there who loves her so much that he is even ready to
love her lovers. She will feel a new and even deeper relationship to
you. Freedom will bring you closer and closer.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is something to be understood: you can be close to somebody
in two ways. You can be forced by the law, by conscience, guilt,
religion, the police – then you are close, but you are not close. You
are just physically close.</p><p><br></p><p>There is another closeness that comes out of freedom. Both partners
are free to be as far away as they want, but still they choose to be
close. It is a choice out of total freedom. It has a different
fragrance. It is nothing of this world... it is almost something of
another world.</p><p><br></p><p>So just accept it, and accept it with joy. Feel happy that you could
give her such freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin replies: I don’t know whether I’m suppressing my
feeling... I’m confused about what I feel.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, if you have understood me, things will change immediately, from
tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not a question of what she says. It is for you to look
inside and see whether you are real or not. She may say that you are not
being real because she cannot understand that a man who loves her will
allow her to move with somebody else. That is her problem, not yours.
Now she will try to throw the whole responsibility on you – as if you
are trying to be higher than her, holier than her.</p><p><br></p><p>That too is good, that too is a situation for you, mm? First she will
wait for you to make her feel guilty. If that doesn’t happen, then
somewhere something is wrong. So she will immediately say that you are
being unreal. She may even say that you don’t love her, and that is why
you are allowing her to move with someone else. She will say that if you
had loved her you would have fought for her, and that it is not that you
are not jealous – you don’t love her. She will say all these things – it
is natural. She will have to cope with this problem, and it is a great
problem, because the vicious circle has been broken.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by the clouds will disappear from her eyes and she will be
able to see what is happening. But it is good, it is very good. It is
going to be a great blessing to you... This is the real Yoga!</p><p>[A sannyasin in the yoga class said she wanted to scream in one of
the postures and asked if she should do so.]</p><p><br></p><p>You can do it in your own room whenever you feel like it – and it
will come again. It is good to allow it – but not in the class, because
then everybody will start.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is going to happen, remember<span class=s4></span>This is
going to happen with our people because they are</p><p>doing other meditations, and the meditations are hitting their
repressed things deeply. In doing a certain posture they may touch the
same centre. Many people will feel that they want to scream, so tell
them they will have to do it at home.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon we will have a small room here, and whenever somebody feels, he
can go and scream there. Underground rooms will be ready soon. But allow
it in your room. It will be very good and will relax many things.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said that he was hard of hearing in his right ear since
he had been blown up in the second world war.…</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checked his energy, and then said that much could be done, and
suggested that he should take a very very hot shower, so hot that he
perspired, then follow this with a very cold shower. This would give
exercise to the tissues of the right hemisphere, helping them to expand
and contract.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>... within three months you will be able to hear almost sixty
percent. And this exercise will help your consciousness also, because
the mind will start functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: when you do the Nadabrahma meditation, use ear
plugs so that no outer sound can be heard. Then just hum so that you can
just feel the inner sound. That inner sound will hit the ear from inside
and it will become an inner massage. That also will help.</p><p><br></p><p>[The ashram yoga teacher] can teach you two yoga exercises. One is
sarvangasan, if shirshasan is not possible. These two exercises will do
– just three minutes in the morning before you take your bath. It is
just standing on your head so that the blood circulates deep down into
the head. The whole thing is how to make the inner brain moving,
functioning. Ordinarily it is very difficult for blood to reach the
brain, because it is against gravitation and the heart has to pump
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>If you feel that these positions are difficult, use a slanting bed –
just for five to ten minutes. Dead tissues have collected in your head,
and this blood will carry them away.</p><p><br></p><p>If you continue these things for three months, you will have almost
sixty percent hearing in your right ear. If you can continue them for a
year, you can have almost ninety percent hearing.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Sometimes when I go to sleep and I lie on my back,
I can feel something moving in my body. It’s not my body... it feels
like energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm, it is energy – so help it to move, and don’t stop it. Wherever
it goes, you simply follow. Simply become the shadow and let it become
the real; it is your real energy. So just help it to move.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be scared in the beginning because it can go away from the
body, and that is very scaring. Once you become attuned to it, it has a
beauty of its own. Nothing can be compared to it – sexual orgasm is
nothing. It gives you such a deep orgasm... the whole body thrills with
bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>If you follow it silently, without resistance, it will move away, and
you may be able to see your own body lying on the bed – and you are
standing near the door. You may be able to hover over your bed like a
cloud. Don’t be afraid. Enjoy it... it is perfectly good.</p><p><br></p><p>When you come back to the body you will have a thrill. Leaving the
body and coming back again, you Will have a thrill, and the thrill is
deeper than any sexual orgasm.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact in sexual orgasm the same thing happens. Because of the
female energy, your male energy is attracted so deeply that it leaves
your body for a few seconds. It is not only an ejaculation of semen – it
is an ejaculation of you. Your whole energy is ejaculated just for a
second, and then you are again back in the body. And that is the whole
thrill of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know how to do it without any partner, without any sex being
involved, then sex becomes meaningless because now you know a higher way
to attain to a deeper orgasm more easily, and at no risk, no cost.</p><p><br></p><p>So allow this... it is very good. For fifteen days cooperate.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: I don’t know... to get in touch with my creativity,
with some warmth inside me. I have low energy a lot, and I don’t have
good relationships with women... I came to ask you the answer... I admit
want something from you.]</p><p><br></p><p>I know – and you will have it.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things are interconnected. If you feel something is
missing, some key is missing, then you will not be able to move in a
deep relationship. You can move deeply into another being only if you
have moved into your own depth, otherwise not. A superficial
relationship is possible, but it satisfies nobody. On the contrary, it
makes you even more disconnected.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first relationship is with oneself. Meditation is more primary
than love. Without meditation, your love will be a failure. You may try
with many different people, but again and again something will come in
and the affair will be destroyed. That something comes from within your
depth. You move so unconsciously – as if almost in a sleep – that
somewhere or other you are bound to stumble and everything will be
destroyed. Love is very fragile. Unless you have a perfect light in you,
it will be difficult to move in love.</p><p><br></p><p>And the work that you have been doing – Encounter groups,
Psychoanalysis, Marathons – is all negative. They bring out your
negative things but they don’t give you something positive. They help to
clean you, but they don’t replace anything. Nobody can live in an
emptiness, so again one fills oneself with the same things.</p><p><br></p><p>So you go on cleaning every day – and you will feel good. It is just
as when you have taken a bath and for half an hour you feel good. Then
again dirt gathers and you perspire, and the feeling from the bath is
lost. That’s why people go on living from one Encounter group to
another. It gives a thrill, and one feels good, but again the same life
and the same things happen. These are good cleaning processes, but that
is not enough. Necessary, but not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if you have cleaned the ground and you think that that is
the garden. Cleaning is good – the weeds and stones have to be removed.
The ground has to be prepared, seeds have to be planted, and watering
and work and much patience is needed – and then the garden will
come.</p><p><br></p><p>What you have been doing is just a half of it. The other half is
missing, and that is the key that you feel you would like to have.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas can be very helpful if you take courage. It becomes the first
positive step. It is a commitment, and it is getting hooked with me on
an unknown journey. For you it is almost dark, and you are moving in the
unknown. Of course fear comes and a thousand and one questions and
doubts arise, but they all belong to your negative mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If you decide to go towards some positivity, you have to become
indifferent to all those doubts and questions. It is a risk. All
positivity is a risk, all growth is a risk. Every birth is going to be
very painful.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a child is born, there exist two possibilities: he may live,
he may not live. When he was in the mother’s womb, she was breathing for
him – he was not even breathing for himself. Out of the womb he will
have to breathe for himself. The first two or three minutes after the
child is born are the most dangerous. Everybody is in suspense,
wondering whether the child will breathe or not. And if the child does
not cry the doctor has to hit him so he starts breathing. And the child
has never breathed before, so it is unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is like a new birth.</p><p><br></p><p>You have lived a way, a certain style of life, and you have worked –
and still you go on missing something. Try something new, something
absolutely new.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the thing – when I say take sannyas, I mean give the
responsibility to me. You drop it. Start living as if there is no
problem. From this moment, simply relax. And that relaxation comes
through sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you can take courage – and it is a question of courage, it is
an adventure – it can be tremendously helpful. Would you like to take
the jump?</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor answers: I have to think about it... I’ve worked too
hard and I don’t want to think about myself anymore. But what I really
want to do is to go in the other direction... to be wild and you know,
not holy in the least bit.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what my sannyas is! (laughter) Not holy in the least bit...
and it is wild. And if you are really fed up with working on yourself –
that’s what I am saying – give the responsibility to me. After that
there is no work. There is only trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Work you have been doing – and if you think about sannyas, that also
will be work. You lose nothing by it – just your past, which is
meaningless. You get rid of something that has been of no worth to you.
But if you think about sannyas, you will ask that same past. It is as if
you ask the disease if you should take the medicine or not. That is
absolutely stupid! Whom are you going to ask? You will ask yourself –
and you are in a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean when I say not to think about it. This is moving
from reason to irreason... so come closer, (much laughter ) and close
your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>... and the only thing I would like to say to you in this moment is
to start living as if there is no problem. In the beginning it is only
‘as if’ but by and by you will feel that there is no problem. In fact
there is no problem. The mind just goes on creating them – it is a
problem-creating machine.</p><p><br></p><p>Life as such has no problems. One can simply live it. Even trees are
living it. Even birds and animals are living it. Only man is somehow
missing it, because man has a mind, and the mind goes on creating
problems.</p><p><br></p><p>So start living from this moment as if there is no problem. Move
completely freely. The past is gone. And I start working immediately
from this moment.</p><p>[A sannyasin said that he was reluctant to leave Poona he was nearing
a point of surrendering on another level... ]</p><p><br></p><p>You will be afraid whenever you go, because once you are here, you
are so different, that going back to the old world creates fear. But
that has to be faced, and it is going to be a deep experience. It will
not disturb anything. It is going to be beautiful and you are going to
be strengthened by it. And the next surrender will happen there, so
don’t be worried about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Many surrenders happen – because the first surrender can rarely be
total. The mind won’t allow it. It even seems total, but it is not. The
mind goes on holding something – just as a safety measure. Many times
you will feel you are surrendered, and many times you will feel that you
have gone far away; this will happen many times.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by you will be able to watch both. Then the real surrender
will happen – and that surrender is not surrender at all. The real is so
different from what you call surrender that there is no need even to
call it surrender – because there is nothing opposite to it. In the
beginning it is going to be a duality – just a part of the mind
surrenders.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand the mechanism. Maybe sixty percent of the mind,
seventy percent, sometimes only fifty-one percent of the mind
surrenders, and forty-nine percent doesn’t surrender. Then too it is
good, because it is the major part and you surrender. The fifty-one
percent of the mind that surrenders may lose its majority any day. It is
almost parliamentary, mm? The other part of the mind will remain there
hiding, watching for the right moment when it can persuade a few members
of the major party towards it – and there will be many moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times you will be angry with me and suddenly forty percent will
be surrendered and sixty percent not. Many times you will expect
something and it will not be fulfilled.<span class=s4></span>Because
it is not</p><p>always good to fulfill your expectations; sometimes they have to be
completely destroyed.<span class=s4></span>because</p><p>unless you love me even with frustrations, you cannot love me. Your
love has to come to such a point where anger, frustrations<span class=s4></span>nothing matters. The love remains uncorrupted by all
these things.</p><p>They come and they go – at the most they become momentary things,
flashes. But they are no more meaningful in any meaningful sense.</p><p><br></p><p>So many times it will happen. You have simply to watch the game of
the mind. Watching both sides, by and by you will become separate from
both. Then a surrender happens which is not of the mind. You cannot even
call it surrender<span class=s4></span>there is no word for it. It has
a taste but it is non-verbal. When it</p><p>comes you will recognise it immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin’s wife was present. He said that though they had been
married for ten years, they would have fights between them, but why,
they could not say.</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said: We don’t believe each other<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need to believe? [She asks: Surrender?]</p><p>There is no need. You are asking unnecessary things. What is the need
to believe and to surrender? You think you should surrender to him and
he should surrender to you? That is impossible. No wife and husband can
ever do that.</p><p><br></p><p>The fight is clear – you are both trying to force the other to
surrender. It is an ego trip and very dangerous. If he surrenders you
will not be able to forgive him – because no woman can love a man who
surrenders to her. And every woman tries to have the man surrender to
her.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is not a problem at all... just foolishness. If you want, I
can tell him to surrender to you – and he will do it because he is my
disciple. I can tell him, and every day he will touch your feet and
surrender completely. (laughter) Whatsoever you say, he will do – he
will become obedient.</p><p><br></p><p>[She asks: But the fighting will go on?]</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need – if you understand that there is no need to
surrender. There is some need to share... share your love with each
other. But this is not a master and disciple relationship – sharing is
enough. Two people loving each other are equal – there is no question of
surrender. Drop that idea and the conflict will drop.</p><p><br></p><p>One woman came to me a few years ago – she was on the same trip. I
told her husband to touch her feet at least three times a day, and that
whatsoever the wife says, he has to say yes. Just after a few days she
said to me, ‘What are you doing? My husband has gone almost mad! He says
yes to everything. I cannot love such a man... he looks like a dog!’</p><p><br></p><p>Share and love – and then sometimes fighting is not bad. But then it
should be out of love, and not for each other’s surrender, and things
like that. Two persons live together and sometimes a quarrel arises. It
is good. It simply shows that the two are alive. If you are both dead
and you live in the same room, no quarrel will arise. (laughter) Alive –
a little quarrel, a little conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>And then – he is a German. (more laughter) Take care of him... and
you love each other, so there is no need to surrender. Simply share –
and things will be good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

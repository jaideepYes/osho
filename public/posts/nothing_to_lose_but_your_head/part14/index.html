You are accepted. And I looked at your album of sculpture. It is beautiful... but it seems to me that you are working with a very limited idea again and again.

And I want to give myself to you.]\nYou are accepted. And I looked at your album of sculpture. It is beautiful... but it seems to me that you are working with a very limited idea again and again.\n[He replies: Now I have no idea.","keywords":[],"articleBody":"\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n‌CHAPTER 14\n27 February 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\n[A sannyasin, who is a sculptor, says: I want it to flow here. And I want to give myself to you.]\nYou are accepted. And I looked at your album of sculpture. It is beautiful... but it seems to me that you are working with a very limited idea again and again.\n[He replies: Now I have no idea.]\nMm, that’s very good. From no idea, tremendous possibilities open. With ideas, there is always a limitation. The idea itself is the limitation; it becomes the boundary. One goes on and on in a circle, again and again repeating the same thing. Mind is just like a stuck gramophone record, and the needle goes on moving in the same groove again and again. Maybe one can modify. can change things a little, but things remain the same.\nIt happens to almost all people – unless they come to know that there is a possibility of a totally different kind of creativity. That creativity is not of the mind. It is of no-mind. In the West, mind still remains the source of all creativity. In the East, we have worked totally differently. That’s why you will always see a difference in a zen painting, or a zen poem. It is a totally different world, because the person who was making it was not motivated by any idea. It simply came – out of the blue. He was not more than a vehicle, a passage.\nSo from today you allow me to work through you. Simply drop everything – and then much is possible. All the techniques that you have known, all the skills that you have gathered will be used, but they will be used by somebody who is bigger than you, greater than you, higher than you. The part has to be used by the whole – that is the meaning of being possessed by God. Then even you are surprised by whatsoever you create. If you are not surprised, then it is a repetition. When a\nreal creation happens, you are simply surprised. You cannot believe that this has happened through you. You will hesitate to sign it.\nYoga Sahajo.\nIt means spontaneous, and it is also the name of an indian woman mystic, a very rare woman.\nSo sometime if you can find something, read something about Sahajo. She has not been translated yet, but I am thinking to talk about her in English.\n[A sannyasin admits she enjoys her negativity.]\nSo for two or three months, forget about feeling good. Feel bad, and enjoy it. If you want to come and describe it to me, you can come. I will help you to be in the negative space. Be in it!\nThe whole of the time you have been trying to be positive, you have been clinging to the positive. Now drop out of it. What is wrong in it? Be negative...\nThis time you remain in it. Your whole life you have been trying to get out of it – and you don’t want to get out of it. So nothing can be done about it.\nThis time decide to live in it and enjoy it. be negative and be knowingly negative. Let this be your way of life, mm? You are going to reach God via negativity. So be negative – there is nothing wrong in it.\nPrem means love and leena means absorption – absorbed in love, lost in love. [The ashram kids’ school is present. A teacher says: I find it’s very much chaos.]\nThey are my children – they have to be chaotic! And you have to help them to be chaotic.…\nThe basic thing to remember is their freedom. Help them to grow but never curb their freedom. Discipline them but always remember that all discipline is a means – freedom is the end.\nSo freedom should not be sacrificed for anything whatsoever. Discipline can be sacrificed... so just allow them to be more and more themselves. Don’t try to create types. Individuals are the goal. Each child should be so individual, so unique and different from everybody else, that you cannot categorise them.\nSo help them. It is difficult, I know. It is simple for the teacher to force them into pigeon-holes, into categories; to make rules and regulations. Then you are not disturbed by their individuality .… Individuality is chaotic.\n[The teacher says: I find that so often I do things without any awareness. Like, something happens and I just react.]\nBy and by you will become aware.\nAnd also remember that not only you are the teacher – they are also teachers. So teach them and also learn from them... Let it be a sharing.\nYou can give them knowledge – they can give you a more valuable thing, and that is learning. You can give them information, and they can give you something of the chaotic life – which is more valuable. You can help them adjust to society. They can help you to adjust to God... they are closer to God. By and by they will drift away.…\nSo also learn from them, and feel humble. There is a danger that the teacher can become a dictator, and it is very easy to dictate to small children because they are so helpless, so fragile. You can force them, and it can become an ego trip. So always remember it – let it be your meditation that you are not going to force anything.\nDon’t be worried about making them very useful – that is not the point. I am not interested in much usefulness and efficiency. If they can learn how to communicate, a little language, a little mathematics, that will do. We are not in a hurry to teach them many things – geography, history... almost ninety percent is rubbish. If they don’t know it, nothing is lost.\nAnd we are not interested in making them fit with a rotten society. They don’t have to become clerks, or a master or a professor – we are not interested in that. If they can become human beings – even if they don’t become rich – that’s okay.\nSo remember these things, and by and by you will learn much, and by learning, things will evolve. It is just the beginning – many more children will be coming soon – so from the very beginning be alert so that a trend is set. Then others who will join you by and by, will follow the trend. So much responsibility is on you both. It is just a beginning... it is going to become a big thing soon. And they are lovely children.…\nYou will have to learn a little German and Italian. These two will be needed, because it is going to be really an international school. Small, but international.\n[She says: right now it’s more like a play centre than a school.]\nLet it always be a play centre. Learning is secondary. Just teach in between... let there be some learning gaps – otherwise it is a play centre. And it has to be that way. Play is life, and everything else is to help life.\nSo let them enjoy – be playful... don’t let them be serious. (to the children) Create as much trouble as you can!... never allow the teachers any rest!\n[A sannyasin says he feels hurt because the person he loved rejected him.]\nI understand; it is natural to feel hurt, but there is no necessity for someone to respond to your love. If it was necessary then the whole charm would be lost.\nSo accept it. And if you feel hurt, it will make you incapable of falling in love again. So never be bothered about it. You loved, and the other was not willing – there is no necessity for them to.\nWho knows, a better person may be coming.\n[He answers: I’ve lost all my aggressiveness. I’m very passive now.]\nThen some aggressive woman may be coming. (laughter) Life has surprises... just wait! But never feel hurt.\n[Osho went on to say that one has to learn to accept these things that are unpalatable; that is part of maturity. He said that when one door closes, another opens, but if you are too concerned with the closed door, you miss the opening one. He said to him to be open to the future and not to repent and pine for the past... ]\nOnce rejected, one feels as if one has to conquer the situation – one has to come again and again to fight. Don’t make it an ego thing. The ego is feeling hurt – and love is not an ego thing.\nNow another thing I would like to say to you – just as a suggestion to keep in mind. It may be that because of the ego you were rejected. Whenever you approach somebody with an egoistic mind, the other starts feeling resistance – rejection comes easy. It seems as if you are interfering, trespassing, and the other wants to reject. When she does, your ego feels hurt.\nDrop the ego and look – a door has opened. It always does.\n[A visitor said to Osho that though he had everything in life that he could wish for, every two or three months he seemed to have outbursts of anger and feelings of violence.\nOsho said that it would be better to allow the anger out in small doses, ‘homeopathic doses’, rather than allowing it to accumulate. He suggested that each evening, for ten minutes he should take out his anger on a pillow, or alternatively, do the Dynamic meditation each morning.\nThe man said he just couldn’t understand why he had this anger as everything was so perfect for him materially]\nThere is no reason. If you go on looking for a reason, you will never come to an end. It is just part of natural life. You eat, and part of that is absorbed, but the remainder has to be thrown out of the body – you have to defecate. The whole day you are accumulating energy from people, all of which cannot be absorbed. Much of it is not useful – it is harmful, toxic. That toxic energy has to be released. That becomes anger. So don’t look for reasons.\nIn fact people who are not contented are less angry, because their anger is released. A woodchopper will never be angry because chopping wood is such a great meditation – all anger is thrown. That’s why poor people look more happy – and they have nothing to be happy about. Richer people look more unhappy – because there is nothing to be unhappy about, and so there is no way to release the energy. It accumulates, and drives you crazy – it becomes aggression.\nSo simply throw it out. If you play some game, it is good – football or volleyball. People who are absorbed in their games are less angry. Soldiers are less angry than businessmen. It should be otherwise. The whole parade in the morning, the throwing of energy – turn left, right – relaxes them.\nThey are more silent people. You will find them more friendly, more loving, more gentlemanly than businessmen, who are just sitting at their desks doing nothing. They become more and more angry and aggressive. Their aggression comes out as exploitation, in accumulating money.\nSo simply release it, and don’t be bothered about the reasons.\n[The music group plays for Osho while people at darshan dance around. To the leader of the group Osho says... ]\nNow the group is very good. But now make a permanent group... a few people should remain permanent... A few people can come and go, but at least six or eight people should remain permanent.\n[A musician said that sannyasins were joining in the music group with their own instruments and not in key with the group.]\nNew people can join in, can participate in singing, but if somebody wants to play an instrument, he has to ask the permission of the group – and you give permission only when he can play in tune. Just tell them that they are allowed, but they have to be in tune. Everybody can participate in singing, but they have to be told that this is not a catharsis, that they have to be in rhythm. A few people can dance around, but they should not go in catharsis. By and by manage it...\nI should like it to be a permanent thing so it continues every day, every night, with at least thirty or forty people, and by and by, more. But by and by – so the tune, the harmony, is not lost. It is necessary because if it becomes discordant it is meaningless and even harmful.\n[Osho turned to the teachers of the children and said that dancing should become part of the children’s daily play; that it was ‘more essential than anything else’.]\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2198","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/nothing_to_lose_but_your_head/>Nothing to Lose But Your Head</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2198 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Nothing_to_Lose_But_Your_Head/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

and not to repent and pine for the past... ]</p><p><br></p><p>Once rejected, one feels as if one has to conquer the situation – one
has to come again and again to fight. Don’t make it an ego thing. The
ego is feeling hurt – and love is not an ego thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Now another thing I would like to say to you – just as a suggestion
to keep in mind. It may be that because of the ego you were rejected.
Whenever you approach somebody with an egoistic mind, the other starts
feeling resistance – rejection comes easy. It seems as if you are
interfering, trespassing, and the other wants to reject. When she does,
your ego feels hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the ego and look – a door has opened. It always does.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor said to Osho that though he had everything in life that he
could wish for, every two or three months he seemed to have outbursts of
anger and feelings of violence.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho said that it would be better to allow the anger out in small
doses, ‘homeopathic doses’, rather than allowing it to accumulate. He
suggested that each evening, for ten minutes he should take out his
anger on a pillow, or alternatively, do the Dynamic meditation each
morning.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said he just couldn’t understand why he had this anger as
everything was so perfect for him materially<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>There is no reason. If you go on looking for a reason, you will never
come to an end. It is just part of natural life. You eat, and part of
that is absorbed, but the remainder has to be thrown out of the body –
you have to defecate. The whole day you are accumulating energy from
people, all of which cannot be absorbed. Much of it is not useful – it
is harmful, toxic. That toxic energy has to be released. That becomes
anger. So don’t look for reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact people who are not contented are less angry, because their
anger is released. A woodchopper will never be angry because chopping
wood is such a great meditation – all anger is thrown. That’s why poor
people look more happy – and they have nothing to be happy about. Richer
people look more unhappy – because there is nothing to be unhappy about,
and so there is no way to release the energy. It accumulates, and drives
you crazy – it becomes aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply throw it out. If you play some game, it is good – football
or volleyball. People who are absorbed in their games are less angry.
Soldiers are less angry than businessmen. It should be otherwise. The
whole parade in the morning, the throwing of energy – turn left, right –
relaxes them.</p><p><br></p><p>They are more silent people. You will find them more friendly, more
loving, more gentlemanly than businessmen, who are just sitting at their
desks doing nothing. They become more and more angry and aggressive.
Their aggression comes out as exploitation, in accumulating money.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply release it, and don’t be bothered about the reasons.</p><p><br></p><p>[The music group plays for Osho while people at darshan dance around.
To the leader of the group Osho says... ]</p><p><br></p><p>Now the group is very good. But now make a permanent group... a few
people should remain permanent... A few people can come and go, but at
least six or eight people should remain permanent.</p><p><br></p><p>[A musician said that sannyasins were joining in the music group with
their own instruments and not in key with the group.]</p><p><br></p><p>New people can join in, can participate in singing, but if somebody
wants to play an instrument, he has to ask the permission of the group –
and you give permission only when he can play in tune. Just tell them
that they are allowed, but they have to be in tune. Everybody can
participate in singing, but they have to be told that this is not a
catharsis, that they have to be in rhythm. A few people can dance
around, but they should not go in catharsis. By and by manage it...</p><p><br></p><p>I should like it to be a permanent thing so it continues every day,
every night, with at least thirty or forty people, and by and by, more.
But by and by – so the tune, the harmony, is not lost. It is necessary
because if it becomes discordant it is meaningless and even harmful.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho turned to the teachers of the children and said that dancing
should become part of the children’s daily play; that it was ‘more
essential than anything else’.]</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IS IT ONLY IN THE EXISTENCE OF\nMIND? AND HOW IS THE DESIRE OF THE BODY FOR SEX RELATED\nTO THE MIND?\nAnurag, the energy called desire has been condemned for centuries. Almost all the so-called saints have been against it, because desire is life and they were all life-negative.\nDesire is the very source of all that you see, and they were against all that which is visible. They wanted to sacrifice the visible at the feet of the invisible; they wanted to cut the roots of desire so there would no longer be any possibility of life.\nA tremendously great urge to commit total suicide has dominated humanity down the ages.\nI have a totally different concept of desire. First, desire itself is God. Desire without any object, desire without being goal-oriented, unmotivated desire, pure desire, is God. The energy called desire is the same energy as God.\nDesire has not to be destroyed, it has to be purified. Desire has not to be dropped, it has to be transformed. Your very being is desire; to be against it is to be against yourself and against all. To be against it is to be against the flowers and the birds and the sun and the moon. To be against it is against all creativity. Desire is creativity.\nThe Eastern scriptures are perfectly right when they say that God created the world because a great desire arose in him -- a desire to create, a desire to manifest, a desire to make many from one, a desire to expand. But these are only metaphors; God is not separate from desire. Desire means a longing, a great longing, to expand, to become huge, to be enormous -- as huge as the sky.\nJust watch people, watch desires, and you will understand what I mean. Even in your ordinary desires, the basic thing is present. In fact what the man who wants to have more and more money really wants is not money but expansion, because money can help you expand. You can have a bigger house, you can have a bigger garden, you can have this, you can have that -- your territory will be bigger, your freedom will be bigger. With more money you will have more alternatives to choose from.\nThe man who is after money may not know why he is after the money. He may himself think and believe that he loves money, but that is only on the surface of his consciousness. Go deeper into his unconscious, help him to meditate, and you will be surprised and he will be surprised to find that the desire for money is not really the desire for money, it is the desire to expand.\nAnd the same is the case with all other desires. Men want more power, more fame, longer life, better health, but what are they desiring in these different things? The same, exactly the same: they want to be more. They don't want to remain confined, they don't want to be limited. It hurts to feel that you are definable, because if you are definable then you are just an object, a thing, a commodity. It hurts that you have limitations, because to have limitations means to be imprisoned.\nBut all these objects of desire, sooner or later, disappoint. Money becomes possible one day, and yet expansion has not happened; you may have a little more freedom of choice, but that does not satisfy. The desire was for the infinite, and money cannot purchase the infinite. Yes, you have more power, you are more well-known, but that doesn't really matter in the long run. Millions of people have lived on this earth and were very famous, and now nobody even knows their names. Everything has disappeared into dust -- dust into dust, not even traces are left. Where is Alexander the Great? What is he? Would you like to be a dead Alexander the Great or an alive beggar? Ask yourself, and your being will say it is better to be alive and be a beggar than to be dead and be an Alexander.\nIf you watch carefully, money, power, prestige -- nothing satisfies. On the contrary, they make you more discontented. Why? -- because when you were poor there was a hope that one day the money was going to happen and all would be settled and settled forever, and then you would relax and enjoy. Now that has happened, and there seems to be no sign of any relaxation. In fact, you are more tense than before, you are more anxiety-ridden than before.\nMoney has brought a few blessings, but in the same measure it has brought many curses too. You can have a bigger house, but now you will have less peace. You can have a bigger bank balance, but you will also have a bigger madness, anxiety, neurosis, psychosis. Money has brought a few things which are good; in the wake of it many other things have arrived which are not good at all. And if you look at the whole thing, the whole effort has been a sheer wastage. And now\nyou cannot have even the hope that the poor man can have.\nThe rich man becomes hopeless. He knows now the money will go on increasing and nothing is going to happen -- just death, only death. He has tasted all kinds of things; now he only feels a tastelessness. A kind of death has already happened, because he cannot conceive of how to fulfill that desire for expansion.\nBut desire in itself is not wrong. The desire for money, the desire for power, the desire for prestige, are wrong objects for desire -- let it be very clear. By having wrong objects of desire, desire itself does not become wrong. You can have a sword and you can kill somebody -- that does not make the sword something wrong. You can also save somebody with the same sword. Poison can kill and poison can become medicine too. In the right hands, poison is nectar; in the wrong hands, nectar is poison.\nThis is the essential wisdom of all the buddhas of all the ages. What the priests say is one thing; what the buddhas have brought to the world is totally different, it is diametrically opposite.\nDesire has to be purified and transformed, because it is your energy -- you don't have any other energy. How to transform desire? One way, the ordinary way, the mediocre way, is to change the object. Don't go after money, start going after God. You are frustrated with money -- become religious, go to the church, to the temple, to the mosque. Let your desire have a new object called God, which is as illusory as the object called money, even more illusory, because what do you know about God? Money at least is something visible, objective; you have known it, you have seen it. What do you know of God? You have only heard the word. God remains a word unless experienced. God remains an empty word unless you pour some content into it through your own existential experience.\nPeople, when they are frustrated with worldly desires, start changing the object: they start making otherworldly objects of desire -- heaven, paradise, and all the joys of heaven. But it is the same trick, the mind is again befooling you. This is not the way of the intelligent person, this is the way of the stupid.\nWhat is intelligence? Intelligence means the insight that no object can fulfill your desire.\nNo object, I say, and I say it categorically, no object can ever fulfill your desire. Your desire is divine. Your desire is as big as the sky -- even the sky is not a\nlimit to it. No object can fill it. Then what is to be done? The intelligent person stops desiring objects.\nHe makes his desire pure of all objects -- worldly, otherworldly. He starts living his desire in its purity, moment to moment. He is full of desire, full of overflowing energy.\nHis ordinary life becomes so intense, so passionate, that whatsoever he touches will be transformed. The baser metal will become gold, and the dead tree will come to bloom again.\nIt is said of Buddha that wherever he moved, dead trees would start growing leaves; out of season, trees would bloom. These are beautiful poetic expressions of a certain metaphysical truth. Buddha is pure desire, just desire. Not a desire for anything; he has abandoned all objects.\nLet me remind you, first he abandoned the world. He was a prince, he was born to be a king. Seeing the futility of money, seeing the futility of all kinds of relationships, seeing the futility of all that the world can give -- he was only twenty-nine years old -- he escaped. He did well, because after thirty it becomes more difficult, more and more difficult.\nHippies are right. They say, \"Don't believe a man who is over thirty.\" Buddha escaped at the right time -- he was exactly twenty-nine -- because the more you become experienced in worldly ways, the more cowardly you become. Religion is for the courageous, religion is for the brave, religion is for the young, those who are still able to take the risk, those who are still able to gamble.\nBuddha escaped. Seeing the futility, he escaped in search of God, in search of truth. He replaced his desire for the world with the desire for God, truth, nirvana. For six years he worked hard. By the time he was thirty-five he was utterly spent. He had done all that was possible, humanly possible, to do. He fasted for months, meditated, practiced yoga.\nAnd in those days there were different kinds of schools. He went from one teacher to another, from one school to another, he practiced all possible methods. And one day it suddenly flashed.\nHe was crossing the river Niranjana. It is a small river -- when I went to see the river I could not believe the story. The story says that he could not cross the river\nNiranjana, he could not swim it, because he was so weak. The river is so narrow, the river is so small, but he must have been very weak from years of fasting. It is said that he had fasted so long that you could count his bones, his ribs. He had become simply bones, he was a skeleton; his stomach had completely disappeared, his stomach and his back had become one. He must have been really weak; he could not cross the river, and was hanging onto the root of a tree, having no energy to get out of the river.\nIn that moment, a great insight happened. Insights happen only in such moments. When the frustration is total, when the disappointment is complete, when the disillusionment is utter, when there is nothing left to hope for... in that moment he saw the pointlessness of it all. The worldly objects were meaningless; he had had all of them and they did not satisfy. And those otherworldly desires were just as foolish as the worldly desires. In that moment, in that insight, he became objectless.\nLet me tell you, the scriptures report it very wrongly. They say that in that moment he became desireless. But try to understand what I am trying to convey to you. He became objectless, not desireless. You cannot become desireless. Desire is your very life, your breath, your heartbeat; desire is your being. But certainly a transformation happened; he became objectless. This-worldly, otherworldly, all desires in toto disappeared as objects, not desire as energy. There was no object; pure energy was felt, a desiring for nothing, a pure desire moving nowhere, a pure desire herenow.\nThat very night he attained enlightenment. Having nothing to desire, he rested under a tree and fell asleep. For the first time he really slept. When there is nothing to desire, there is nothing to dream about either, because dreams are reflections of your desires.\nDreams are reflections of your frustrations, dreams are reflections of your repressions, dreams reflect your day-life. That night there was no dream, it was a dreamless deep sleep.\nPatanjali says dreamless deep sleep is closest to samadhi -- just one step more, and you have come home. And that one step happened early in the morning. Rested, Buddha opened his eyes. For the first time in his life there was nowhere to go, nothing to do. For the first time in life he must have been at a loss. Now what? There was nothing to cling to, nothing to hold on to. There must have\nbeen an utter emptiness. Time must have stopped. There was no program any more. Every day he used to get up with so many ideas to be cultivated, so many methods to be practiced, so many religious rituals to be done, and all that. Today there was nothing left! Utter emptiness.\nBut do you think he died? No, he was born. Objects were not there. Now the desire was pure -- just a throb, a pulsation, just a passion for nothing in particular. Resting under the tree with open eyes, he must have been seeing the sky in the east becoming red, and then the sunrise. And with the rising sun and with the sky turning red, and with the last star of the night disappearing, he became enlightened.\nWhat does this word enlightenment mean? It simply means desire was freed from all objects. He became pure love, compassion, pure life. And this pure life has tremendous beauty and ecstasy; with this pure life you have attained the infinite. Desire remains small because you confine it to small objects, desire remains small because you desire small things. Seeing it, people start desiring big things -- but big things are also small things; howsoever big they are, they have limitations.\nJust think of your God. How big is he? Egyptians used to say he is seven feet tall\n--\nnothing much. There are many Dutch sannyasins here. Whenever I see a Dutch sannyasin, I remember the Egyptians and the Egyptian gods. Indians say he has three faces. So what? Our politicians have one thousand and one faces, and everyone has many faces. Only three? When you talk to your wife you have one face, when you talk to your girlfriend you have another face, when you talk to your servant still another, when you talk to your boss still another. Just watch the whole day, how many faces you have! And God seems to be very poor -- only three faces? How does he manage with only three faces?\nAll concepts of God are bound to be limited. Concepts as such are bound to be limited.\nEven if you say he is infinite, what do you mean? What do you mean by infinite? Try to comprehend the meaning of the word infinite and you will be in a difficulty. Even your word infinite will be found to be finite. You can say he is unbounded, but just think, what do you mean? The boundary must be\nsomewhere; how could it be that one just goes on and on and on? There must be a boundary -- maybe it is very far away, far far away, maybe you will never reach it, but what do you mean by \"unbounded\"? You simply mean unmeasured, nothing more.\nWhat do you mean when you say the ocean is unfathomable? Do you think there is no bottom to it? The bottom is there, although we may not have fathomed it. Our ways of measurement are small, our yardsticks are small.\nAny word that we can use is bound to remain limited. Hence, those who have known God, they say nothing can be said about him. Buddha did not even say this much, that nothing can be said about him, because he said if you say nothing can be said about him, you have already said something. You have already defined him! \"Nothing can be said about him\" is a statement, and all statements define.\nYou can move from small objects to bigger and bigger objects, but still your desire, your life, will not feel fulfilled. It cannot feel fulfilled unless it is really infinite, not in conceptions but in experience, and unless you taste the infinity of existence.\nDesire is beautiful, there is nothing wrong in it -- only free it from objects. With freedom from objects, desire is divine.\nAnurag, you say, \"You must have told us so many times already, but I still don't get it \"\nJust by my saying it, you are not going to get it. You will have to move into experience. It is not a philosophical system of thought that I am conveying to you. I am only pointing towards a path; the path has to be followed. You will not get it just by listening to me.\nYes, you can get it if you sit silently by my side. You can get it in the intervals, when I am here and you are here and no word interferes, intervenes.\nWords don't communicate. On the contrary, for higher things they become barriers. For lower things they are bridges; the higher you move, the less and less they are bridges, the more and more they are walls.\nYou say, \"You must have told us so many times already, but I still don't get it \"\nI will go on saying it, Anurag, again and again, but remember, you will not get it just by listening to me. You will have to be something like me. You will have to imbibe me, you will have to digest me. It is not something verbal that is happening here, it is something existential. It is a love affair.\nI am not a teacher, I am not teaching you anything, I am simply imparting something to you. What has happened to me, I am inviting you to partake of it. Be my guest, let me be your host. And if you can even be a guest for a single moment, that which has not been understood for so long will be immediately understood. And not only will it be understood, you will be surprised how you went on missing it. It is so simple; to have understood it would have been simple.\nBut it is a question of an energy communication. And, slowly slowly, I will turn the commune into an energy communication. Words can take you only so far, then it has to become a meeting of energies. You have to be electrified by me. You have to allow my pure desiring, my pure energy. It is objectless; I don't desire a thing, I am simply desire.\nIf you allow yourself to come in contact with this energy, there will be a transformation, a turning point, a conversion.\nYou say, \"What is the seed of desire?\"\nThere is no seed of desire. Desire is the seed of all. Desire is the ultimate seed. God desired to be man, God desired to expand, God desired to create.\nDesire is the seed of everything!\nIf you ask me, I will say God is desire -- that's why he could desire. Only desire can desire.\nYou ask, \"Is it only in the existence of mind?\"\nNo. The mind has only a very tunnel vision. The mind is as if you are hiding behind a door and looking through the keyhole. Yes, sometimes you can see a bird on the wing, but for only a split second, and then it is gone. You see somebody passing by -- a beautiful woman, a beautiful man, or a dog -- just for a moment, and it is gone. A moment before, it was not there; a moment afterwards, it is no more there. That's how the mind creates time. It is a keyhole.\nYou see a bird on the wing, and you see it only for just a second. Before that, it was not --\ndo you think it was not? It was, but for you it was in the future, because it was not in front of your keyhole. And after a moment it is no more again -- do you think it is no more? It still is, but for you it is past.\nMind is limited, hence it creates divisions -- past, present and future. The present is that which for a moment appears on the screen of the mind, and the past is that which is no more on the screen, and the future is that which is not yet. But let me tell you: all is, and always is. Nothing ever goes out of existence, and nothing ever comes into existence.\nEverything persists, remains.\nTime is a false notion created by the mind. Eternity is truth, timelessness is truth.\nSomebody asked Jesus, \"Tell us something more about the kingdom of God. What will be special there? Something unique. Yes, we have heard that there will be pleasure, but pleasure we know -- maybe it will be thousands and thousands of times greater, but we know what pleasure is. We have heard there will be celestial music -- okay, we know something about music. But what will be special?\"\nAnd you will be surprised what Jesus said. It is not recorded in the Christian scriptures, but there are a few sayings scattered here and there in other scriptures. This is recorded by the Sufis. Jesus said, \"There shall be time no longer.\" A tremendously significant answer. There shall be time no longer -- this will be special. You have known everything, but you have not known timelessness. \"There shall be time no longer\" means there shall be mind no longer. Mind and time are synonymous.\nIn the ultimate reckoning, time is mind, mind is time. Both are aspects of the same coin, they both disappear together. Drop one, and the other is gone also.\nYou ask me, \"What is the seed of desire?\"\nAnurag, there is no seed of desire. Desire is the ultimate seed of all other seeds.\nAnd you ask, \"Is it only in the existence of mind?\"\nNo. The mind has only a little glimpse of desire, just a flickering glimpse of desire. Mind knows nothing of desire; mind only knows about desiring this and desiring that. Desiring money, desiring power, desiring prestige -- mind knows about desires for objects. When the objects are no more there, desire is no more part of the mind. Then desire is beyond mind; then desire is simply an overflowing energy.\nWilliam Blake says desire is energy and energy is delight. I have heard a rumor that Sargama, one of our sannyasins, is a direct descendant of William Blake. We have beautiful people here. William Blake is one of the most beautiful persons who has ever walked on the earth, one of the most penetrating mystics. Sargama must have something of William Blake's quality in him. But it may be just a rumor, because I have heard another rumor also that William Blake had no son at all. But that may be applicable only to legal sons; one can have illegal sons.\nWilliam Blake's insight is true. Desire is energy, energy is delight. Contemplate over it.\nJust pure desire, just overflowing energy, for no particular object, for no destination.\nThat's what you have to remember when you come to me for an energy darshan, for a\n\"close-up.\" Just become pure desire, just an overflowing desire, for nothing in particular.\nDon't wait for any experience. Experiences will come, but don't wait for them. If you wait, you will miss, because when you are waiting for an experience you are no more in the herenow. You have already missed the point; the mind has come in. The object has obstructed the purity of desire.\nWhen you are in an energy darshan with me, when you are partaking of something of my energy, just be pure desire -- going nowhere, moving nowhere, just thrilled for no reason at all, just madly ecstatic for no reason at all. And in those few moments you will have the contact with me, because those few moments are my reality.\nBut if you are sitting there, waiting to have some great experience of light inside, then maybe you may experience some light, but you have missed. You have thrown the diamonds away and gathered pebbles on the shore. You may be waiting for your kundalini to rise, you may have a certain sensation rising in your spine, but what is it? It is pointless. It may give you a kick, a spiritual kick, but then it is gone.\nWith me, just be pure desire -- swaying with me, moving with me, dancing with me, allowing me to penetrate you to your deepest core, to the deepest core of your desire, to the very seed. And then something immense, something incredible, something you cannot imagine, is possible -- an entry of the beyond into you, the meeting of the earth and sky.\nYou say, \"Is it only in the existence of mind?\"\nNo, the mind is a barrier. It allows desire only little outlets -- and desire is an ocean. The mind has to be dropped, not desire; the mind has to be dropped so that you can have total desire.\nAnd you ask, \"And how is the desire in the body for sex related to the mind?\"\nThe mind is not separate from your body, it is the inner part of the body. You are separate from the body and the mind, both. You are an entity, transcendental, you are a witness to the mind and the body, both. But your mind and your body are both one and the same energy. The body is visible mind, the mind is invisible body. The body is the exterior mind, and the mind is the interior body.\nHence sex is not only physical. It is far more cerebral, it is far more psychological than physical. In fact, sex is triggered not by your physiology but by your psychology. The physiology cooperates with it, but deep down sex comes from the inner body to the outer body.\nYou may be aware, you may not be aware, because you are not at all aware of what goes on happening to you. But watch, the first thing about sex happens in the head, in the mind. And then immediately the body is affected, because the body and the mind are not separate.\nThere can be a physiological sex too. That's what happens when you go to a prostitute; it is physiological, it is just a relief for the body. The body is overburdened with energy and you don't know what to do with it. You have to\nthrow it out somehow to unburden yourself, so that you can feel a little relaxed, because you have too much energy and you are so uncreative that you don't know what to do with it.\nYou can't sing a song totally. If you can, you will be surprised; the energy disappears into the song and becomes the song. There is no need to go to a prostitute. But you cannot dance, you cannot play on the guitar, you are so uncreative.\nProstitutes will exist in the world unless man becomes more creative. And now in the West where the Women's Liberation movement is demanding equality in everything, even male prostitutes have come into existence. They were bound to, because why should there be only female prostitutes? Why not male prostitutes too? Equality is equality.\nMan is uncreative. Have you observed? Any time when you are creative, sex disappears.\nIf you are painting and totally absorbed in it, you don't have any sexual desire. Sex simply does not cross the threshold of your mind; it is simply not there.\nOnly in deep creativity are people celibate, in no other way. Your saints, so- called saints, are not celibate -- because they are so uncreative, they cannot be. It is impossible; it is just against the very science of energy. They are doing nothing, sitting in the temples and ashrams repeating Ram-Ram, Ram-Ram, or just stupidly playing with their malas -- how can they be celibate? How can brahmacharya happen to them? It happens only when creativity takes all your energy, and no energy is left as a tension in you.\nPoets can be celibate more, painters can be celibate more, dancers can be celibate more, musicians can be celibate more. I am not saying that they are all celibates, I am saying that whenever a poet is a poet, he can be celibate -- because a poet is not twenty-four hours a day a poet. It is very rare to find a poet who is twenty-four hours a day a poet.\nThen he becomes a seer, then he becomes a rishi, then he is no more an ordinary poet.\nIt is from people like these who were for twenty-four hours poets that great poems like the Upanishads, the Koran and the Gita were born. It is not ordinary\npoetry. Ordinary poets are only once in a while poets, otherwise they are ordinary people -- maybe far worse. Ordinary painters are only once in a while painters.\nIt is said about a great Indian poet, Rabindranath, that whenever he was in the mood to create, he would close his doors and disappear into his room for days together -- three or four days. No food, no bath, he would not even come out. Only when his energy had moved into creativity and he was unburdened would he open his door and come out. And people who saw him coming out of his room after four days of fasting and remaining lost in his creativity, all observed that his face was no more the same. He looked as if he had gone to some other world. He looked so delicate, like a roseflower; he looked so beautiful, so feminine, so graceful, so buddhalike. But only for a few hours would that fragrance surround him, and then it would disappear. And even for months together, the mood might not come.\nPoets are only once in a while poets. And when you read a whole poem, the whole poem is not a poem either. Only a few lines here and there are really poetry; the other lines are just managed by the poet, they did not descend on him.\nA great poet, Coleridge, died. He left forty thousand incomplete poems. Many times in his life he was asked, \"Why don't you complete these things? They are so tremendously beautiful, and only one line is missing. Just complete one line and the poem will be complete.\"\nBut Coleridge always refused. He said, \"I will not complete it unless it comes from the beyond. I am not going to do it. These lines have come from the beyond, I have just noted them down. I am not the writer, I am not the author, I am just a steno; I have simply noted down something that has been dictated from the beyond. And that one line is missing. I cannot add it, because many times I have tried to add it, and I have always failed. It looks so ugly, it looks so different, so mundane, so mediocre. It does not have that luminosity.\"\nWhen Rabindranath for the first time translated his great book Gitanjali into English, he was a little worried as to whether the translation had come through or not. English was not his mother tongue, in the first place. And secondly, to translate prose is one thing, it is easy; to translate poetry is very difficult, and more so to translate poetry from a language like Bengali which is so poetic. The\nwhole language is poetic, its flavor is of poetry.\nHe was worried: \"Has the translation come true to the spirit of my original?\" He showed it to one great Englishman, C.F. Andrews. Andrews went through it, and at just four points he said, \"Four words have to be changed, grammatically they are wrong.\"\nNaturally, Rabindranath changed them.\nThen when he read Gitanjali and his poems for the first time in a poets' gathering in London, he was surprised, he could not believe his ears. One English poet, Yeats, stood up and said, \"Everything is perfectly right, but at just four points something is very mundane, something is not poetic. The whole poetry flows beautifully, but at four points the river comes across rocks.\"\nWith a trembling in his heart, Rabindranath asked, \"What are those four points?\" And they were exactly the same as those which C.F. Andrews had suggested. Rabindranath told him, \"These are C.F. Andrews' words, he knows English better than me.\"\nYeats said, \"That is right -- it is better English, but not better poetry. The grammar is right, but poetry is not grammar. The language is right, but poetry is not only language.\nPoetry is something that hovers above language and grammar. Please go back to your old words!\"\nRabindranath got his Nobel prize with this book, Gitanjali.\nAll poets are not always poets, all poems are not poems. Hence you may not be able to understand what I am trying to convey to you, but whenever a poet is a poet, he is celibate. Sexuality simply disappears, evaporates. And whenever a poem is born in a poet he is part of God, he is a creator. In that moment it is impossible to give any object to your desire. Sex gives an object to your desire. Sex is not pure, cannot be, because the object is always there.\nThe moment sex becomes pure, it is samadhi.\nThe mind and the body both are sexual. The body has come out of sex, and the mind is always hankering for objects, hence it is sexual. But both can be purified\nthrough creativity.\nMy message, my key, my golden key to transform your energies, is creativity. Be more and more creative, and slowly slowly you will see a transformation happening of its own accord. Your mind will disappear, your body will have a totally different feel to it, and constantly you will remain aware that you are separate, that you are a pure witness.\nAnd that pure witness is pure desire and nothing else.\nI am not against desire. I am all for desire, but I am not for desires with objects. Let objects disappear, and then you will have a desire like a flame without any smoke. It brings great liberation.\nThe second question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 2\nI UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY, BUT WHY DOES MY LIFE\nSTILL REMAIN UNCHANGED?\nSudhas, to understand something intellectually is one thing, but to understand something intellectually is not going to transform your life. You will remain the same. To understand something intellectually is really to deceive yourself. You have not understood, the mind has only pretended to have understood. This is a trick, because if you really understand it then change is bound to happen. And the mind does not want any change.\nThe mind is very traditional, conventional, conformist, orthodox. The mind is never revolutionary; it is against all change. And the change I am talking about is a total change.\nYou say, \"I understand everything that you say \"\nYou only believe that you understand. You understand the words, naturally. My words are simple, I don't know many words. In fact, if you count, I must be\nusing not more than four hundred words. But see the turnout! I am not a man of language. You can understand what I am saying as far as words are concerned -- but do you comprehend it? That is the question, that is the crux of the matter. Do you comprehend what is being imparted to you?\nSudhas, you must have a very philosophical bent of mind. Meditate over this anecdote: A patient of his, a great philosopher in his thirties, eagerly responded at the beginning of therapy to each interpretation his analyst made by saying, \"I hear you, I hear you.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the doctor. \"I didn't know you were a little deaf.\" \"I'm not. I hear you. It means I comprehend,\" said the philosopher. \"Well, what is it that you comprehend?\"\nThe philosopher paused. \"Jesus,\" he finally replied, \"I don't know.\"\nUnderstanding is not the question, but comprehension. Understanding is of the head; comprehension is something deeper, of the heart. And if it is really total then it is even deeper, of the being.\nWhen you understand something then you have to do something about it. When you comprehend something you need not do anything about it; the very comprehension is enough to change you. If you comprehend something, it has already changed you; there is no need to do anything about your comprehensions.\nPlease don't try to understand me intellectually. I am not an intellectual, in fact I am anti-intellectual. I am not a philosopher, I am very anti-philosophic. Try to comprehend me.\nAnd how does one try to comprehend? How does one try to understand in the first place?\nUnderstanding means listening with the head, continuously interpreting, evaluating, judging: \"This is right, this is wrong. Yes, this is true, I have read about it. This must be right, because Jesus also said it in the same way. This is also in the Gita and in the Vedas.\"\nThis goes on, this constant chattering inside that you call understanding. And then out of this hotch-potch you create a hypothesis, and you think this is what I have been telling you. Comprehension cannot come this way; this is the way to prevent comprehension.\nListen silently with no inner chattering, with no inner talk, without evaluating. I am not saying believe what I say, I am not saying accept what I say. I am saying there is no need to be in a hurry to accept or reject. First at least listen -- why be in such a hurry? When you see a roseflower, do you accept or reject it? When you see a beautiful sunset, do you accept or reject it? You simply see it, and in that very seeing is a meeting.\nDon't let your mind wander. Listen silently, attuned, and then something will stir in the heart. Truth has that quality, it stirs the heart. Truth has the quality of being self-evident, it needs no proofs.\nIf what I am saying has anything of truth in it, it will be understood by your heart. But the mind has to give way. And then you will not need to change your life according to it, it will be changed of its own accord.\nThe third question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 3\nWHAT? WHAT?? WHAT???\nPatren, you remind me of a story. A man was troubled for many years with a sore arm.\nHe had been to many doctors and could not find out what was causing the problem.\nFinally a friend urged him to see a doctor who was famous for his ability to diagnose illnesses. The doctor was very expensive and he had to wait a long time for an appointment. Finally he sat waiting in the office. The doctor walked in, handed him a jar and told him to return it the next day with his first morning's urine. Then he promptly left the room.\nThe man was infuriated! \"He did not even look at me,\" he thought. \"And how can he tell what is wrong with my arm from my urine?\"\nThe next morning, the man, still angry, peed in the jar. Then he had his wife pee in it, then he had his daughter pee in it. Then as he walked out the door he saw his dog peeing on a tree and he got some of that also. He gave the urine to the doctor and sat there laughing to himself.\nJust then, the doctor re-entered the room and exclaimed, \"Please sir, this is no laughing matter! Your wife has been fooling around on you, your daughter is pregnant, your dog has worms, and if you don't stop jerking off, your arm will never get better!\"\nNow, Patren, you ask me, \"What? What?? WHAT???\"\nI am not this kind of doctor, you will have to go somewhere else. The fourth question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 4\nWHY CAN'T I FEEL ANY WONDER IN EXISTENCE?\nShivananda, you are too knowledgeable, you know too much. And all that you know is just holy cow dung -- all knowledge always is. Wisdom is a totally different matter.\nKnowledge is all rot, junk; you gather it from here and there, it is not your own. It has no authenticity, it has not grown in your being, you have not given birth to it.\nBut it gives you a very gratified ego to feel \"I know.\" And the more you become settled in the idea of \"I know,\" the less and less will you feel wonder in life. How can a man of knowledge feel wonder? Knowledge destroys wonder. And wonder is the source of wisdom, wonder is the source of all that is beautiful, and wonder is the source for the search, the real search. Wonder takes you on the adventure to know the mysteries of life.\nThe knowledgeable person already knows -- knows nothing, but thinks that he already knows. He has come to a full stop. He has not reached anywhere, he has not known anything. He is a computer, his mind is simply programmed. Maybe he has M.A.'s, Ph.D.'s, D.Litt.'s, maybe he has been to the biggest education centers of the world and he has accumulated much information, but that information is destroying his sensitivity to feel the mystery of the flowers, the birds, the trees, the sunlight and the moon, because he knows all the answers.\nHow can he see any beauty in the moon? He already knows everything about the moon.\nAnd if you say to him, \"My beloved's face looks like the full moon,\" he will laugh. He will say, \"You are simply foolish. How can you compare the moon with your beloved's face? There is no comparison possible!\"\nHe is mathematically right, scientifically right, but poetically wrong. And life is not only science. Just as Jesus said, \"Man cannot live by bread alone,\" I say to you, \"Man cannot live by science alone.\" A few windows are to be left open for poetic experiences, so some sun, some wind and some rain can come from real existence.\nYou cannot be thrilled by life if you are too full of knowledge.\nI used to go for a long walk every evening when I was in the university. A professor used to follow me. For two or three days I tolerated it, and then I said, \"Either you stop coming, or I will have to stop coming.\"\nHe said, \"Why?\"\nI said, \"You are destroying my whole walk.\" He said, \"How?\"\nHe knew too much about everything, and he would talk. \"This tree belongs to that species.\" Now, who bothers? The tree is beautiful; it is dancing in the wind, the foliage is so young, so fresh. The green of it, the red of it, the gold of it, all is so beautiful -- and he is talking about the species. He was a very very informed man about everything. A bird on the wind, he would immediately label it. He was a great labeler.\nI said, \"Please, either you stop coming -- you are destroying my evening walk -- or I will have to stop.\"\nShivananda, you must be too burdened. You are, I know you. You are burdened with great scriptures, mountains of scriptures; nothing can ever surprise you.\nA man comes into a bar, obviously nervous and obviously in a hurry, walks over to the counter, picks up an empty glass and starts eating it. When he is finished he goes over to the wall, walks up the wall, walks along the ceiling, walks down the other wall and disappears out the door.\nThe barkeeper can't believe his eyes. \"What the hell,\" he says, \"is going on here?\"\nA man who has been sitting on a bar stool and seen the whole thing, says with a shrug of his shoulders, \"Don't worry, I know that guy. It's always the same thing with him --\ncomes and goes without even saying hello.\"\nThere are millions of people who are living like this. Miracles are happening all around but they can't see anything, they are blind with their knowledge.\nDrop your knowledge. Knowledge is worthless, wonder is precious. Regain the wonder that you had when you were a child -- and the kingdom of God belongs only to those who are able to become children again.\nThe last question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 5\nI AM IN A JAM. I LOVE THREE WOMEN. THIS IS HELL, AND THIS HAS BEEN\nGOING ON FOR THREE MONTHS. NOW WHAT TO DO?\nYou must be something of a man! One woman is enough. You need legal protection. But if you have tolerated it patiently for three months, wait a little\nmore. Time settles everything. And women are always more perceptive than men\n-- if you cannot do anything, they are bound to do something.\nJohn and Mary began making love in a railway cutting. As their lovemaking progressed, they rolled down onto the railway tracks in the path of the oncoming express.\nThe driver, seeing the two bodies ahead on the line, halted the train just in time. Now, delaying the train is a serious offense, and at the trial the judge demanded an explanation.\n\"Now look, John,\" he said, \"I am a man of the world and I can understand you and your girlfriend having a little fun. But why didn't you get out of the way of the train?\"\n\"Well, it's like this, Your Honor,\" said John. \"I was coming, the train was coming and Mary was coming, and I thought that whoever could stop would stop!\"\nEnough for today. The Book of Wisdom Chapter #16\nChapter title: The University of Inner Alchemy 26 February 1979 am in Buddha Hall\nArchive code: 7902260\nShortTitle: WISDOM16\nAudio: Yes\nVideo: No Length:\n103\nmins\nThe first question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 1 YES AND NO!\nPrem Madhu, man is a dilemma, he is both yes and no. It is not abnormal in you, it is the normal state of humankind. Man is half earth, half sky; part matter, part consciousness; part dust, part divine. Man is a tension. Friedrich Nietzsche says \"a rope stretched between two infinities.\"\nThe past is that of an animal and the future is that of God. And between the two is man --\nhalf animal, half angel. The no comes from the past, the yes is a possibility for the future.\nDoubt comes from darkness, trust is the by-product of light. The higher self in you is always trusting, the lower is cunning and always doubting. And you are both, as you are now.\nMan is naturally schizophrenic. Schizophrenia is not a disease; it is not pathology, it is the state of normal human beings. It starts looking like a pathology only when it goes to the extreme, when yes and no are so divided that there is not even an \"and\" to bridge them. When they become unbridgeable, then it becomes pathological. Otherwise every human being is always in a kind of duality, in a state of either/or. No other animal is in that state. Dogs are simply dogs, and lions are lions, and trees are trees, and rocks are rocks. They don't have any duality, there is no division.\nMan is dual, double, divided. It is his misery, but it is also the possibility for his bliss. It is his agony, but out of this agony ecstasy can be born. No animal can be ecstatic except man. Have you seen any animal ecstatic -- ecstasy like a buddha, a Ramakrishna? There is no possibility of coming across an animal which is so ecstatic. Even the rosebush with so many beautiful flowers is not ecstatic in the sense Jesus is. The rosebush is simply a rosebush; there is no exuberance, there is no overflowing, there is no rejoicing. It is a matter of fact -- not that something incredible is happening, not that something from the beyond has descended, not that God has been realized, not that light has come and penetrated to the deepest core of your being and you are full of it and you are enlightened.\nThe bird on the wing is free, but knows nothing about freedom. Only man, even though he may be imprisoned, knows about freedom. Hence the misery; the bondage on one hand, and the vision of freedom on the other. The reality, the ugly reality, and the tremendously luminous possibility.\nMan can be miserable as no other animal can ever be miserable. Have you seen any animal crying its heart out, weeping, committing suicide? Have you seen any animal laughing, a belly laughter that shakes the very foundations? No, all these things are possible only for man. Hence the grandeur of man, hence his dignity, and hence his anxiety too.\nThe anxiety is over whether you are going to make it or not, whether this time it is going to happen or not. The anxiety is a natural consequence of two diametrically opposite possibilities: one can fall into hell, and one can rise into heaven.\nMan is just a ladder, and you move on this ladder like a yo-yo. One moment you are in heaven, another moment you are in hell. One moment suddenly the sunlit peak, another moment the darkest valley that you have ever come across. One moment love, sharing; another moment anger, miserliness. One moment such an expanded heart that you can contain the whole world, and another moment you are so mean that you cannot imagine you had this possibility to be so mean. Man goes on moving between these two infinities continuously like a pendulum.\nPrem Madhu, your question is significant, because it is everybody's question. It is not a question, it is far more existential. It is a problem; no answer can help, some solution has to be searched for.\nNow, there are two possibilities for the solution. One is to fall back and be satisfied with your animalness. Be satisfied -- that's what millions are trying to do; drink, eat, sleep, and forget all about the greater challenges of life. Eat, drink and be merry, because tomorrow we shall be no more. That's what the materialist says.\nThe materialist has accepted the lower self; he denies the higher self just in sheer self-defense. He does not deny it because he knows that it is not; no -- he knows nothing about it. He denies it because if he does not deny it then that either/or opens up again.\nAgain one is in a problem, again something has to be done, again the at-easeness is lost.\nAgain the journey, the wandering, and the discomfort and the inconvenience and the insecurity of the journey.\nIt is better to say that the higher does not exist, that there is no God, that there has never been any God, that there is no soul, that there is nothing inner, that man has no interiority, that man is just what he is from the outside, that man is his behavior and there is no soul in him.\nFrom Pavlov to B.F. Skinner, this is what is being taught to the world by the so- called scientific psychologists, the behaviorists, that man is only behavior. There is no one inside, just as there is no one inside a machine. The machine is just a functional unity; it has no organic unity in it, it has no soul. You can dismantle it, you can rearrange it again.\nThat's what scientists hope, that sooner or later they will be able to dismantle man and reassemble him. At least theoretically, it seems possible for them. It is not possible. You cannot dismantle and reassemble man, because there is something which is nonmechanical in man. And that nonmechanical part is his glory. But it is better to deny it; it makes life easier, it makes life less anxious, it makes life less of a problem. You can go on living the shallow day-to-day life of so-called pleasures -- eat, drink and be merry.\nThose who decide for that are renouncing the opportunity Atisha is talking about. They are renouncing the opportunity to become gods. They are settling for something very low, they are settling for something very cheap, they are missing something very essential.\nYes, you can be at ease with the lower self, you can settle with the doubting self. But then there is no growth. And there will be no ecstasy, because there will never be any buddha born in you. You will never come to know anything of christ-consciousness. You will remain in darkness -- of course at ease, but what is the point of being at ease?\nFar more valuable is creative discontent, far more valuable is the insecurity of the unknown, far more valuable is a homeless wandering in search of the real home.\nReligion is for those who don't accept the lower as the be all and end all. I am not saying deny the lower, remember, because there are foolish people who go to the other extreme.\nOne stupid type of people denies the higher, says it does not exist, and settles with the lower. The other stupid kind denies the lower, says there is no lower, there is only the higher. One says God is illusion, the world is truth. The other says the world is illusion, God is truth.\nIn my approach, both are being stupid, because both are doing the same thing. Both want to be at ease; both are denying the polar opposite, both are denying the possibility of any inner tension. And remember, it is the inner tension that gives you aliveness. And the bigger the tension, the more alive you are.\nYou know, you have experienced it. Everybody has experienced it, more or less -\n- the attraction of the opposite. A man is attracted to a woman, and vice versa -- why? The negative pole of electricity is attracted towards the positive pole, and vice versa -- why?\nWhy the attraction for the opposite? Because in that very attraction, life arises. In that tension, how can you remain dead? In that very tension you start pulsating.\nThose who settle and choose one against the other become stale, become dead. The materialist becomes superficial, and your so-called spiritualist also becomes phony. Your so-called materialist lives with shallow pleasures, and your so- called spiritualist lives in imagination, in fantasy. Both are missing life and its life-giving tensions. Man has to live with both, and in such a way that neither is denied and yet both become complementary to each other. Yes need not be against no; there is no necessity that the no should be against the yes. They can\ndefine each other, they can nourish each other.\nThat's my whole effort here. I bring you a new dispensation, that the earth and the sky have to be accepted together. Body and soul, the world and God, have to be accepted together. Nothing is wrong in the lower, the lower has to become the base for the higher.\nThe lower has to function as the foundation; if you deny it you won't have any foundation.\nThat's why religious countries, for example India, became poorer and poorer and poorer.\nThey lost their foundations and became very phony. How can you be true if you deny something which is all around you and so real? If you say the world is illusion, maya, how can you be true? You know it is not.\nEven the person who says that the world is maya does not try to pass through the wall, he goes through the door. If both are maya, illusion, what is the difference? Can you find any difference between two illusions? Is one a little less an illusion and the other a little more? Even the person who says the world is illusion does not start eating stones. What is the difference between bread and stones then? Both are illusions, both are dreams.\nBut by denying the world you lose contact with the reality. That's what happened in the East, particularly in India. India became disoriented from reality, it lost its roots in the earth. It became unearthly, a little ghostly. That's my experience of India -- India is a ghost, it has lost its body. And nobody else is responsible for it. It could not gather courage to accept the polar opposites. It became poor, it became ugly, it became ill.\nIndia chose this so that it could be at ease with the higher. But the higher can exist only with the lower; this is one thing more of great importance to be remembered. The lower can exist without the higher -- it will remain unfulfilled, but it can exist. The higher cannot even exist without the lower.\nYou cannot have a building -- a temple, a church -- without the foundations. But you can have the foundations without making the temple. That is possible because the lower comes first and the higher comes later. The lower can come, and the higher may not come.\nThe East tried the higher without the lower, the temple without the foundations. Now, such a temple can only be in your imagination, it cannot exist in reality. And it creates hypocrisy. The greatest hypocrisy possible in the world has happened in India. The hypocrisy is: we have to live in the lower because the lower is the real, and we have to deny it and talk about the higher. And because the lower is denied, the higher cannot have any substance; it is dream stuff. So people are very much obsessed with money, but they talk of God; obsessed with politics and power, and they talk of God. That remains just talk.\nIn the West, just the opposite has happened. The lower was accepted, for the same reason\n-- because if there is only one, you can relax. You can drop the creative discontent if there is only one. Hence the attraction for the one; it is an attraction towards suicide.\nThink of a world where only men exist and no women. There will be no tension, certainly. There will be great brotherhood, everybody will be gay -- literally gay! But life will lose something, something of immense importance -- there will be no tension. It will be like having loose strings on a sitar; you cannot create music. You have to make them tight and tense, only then can you strike music out of them, only then can the hidden become manifest. With loose strings on a sitar how can you create music? They have to be tight, in a certain tension. Only great masters know how much tension is the right tension. And in the right tension the greatest melody is possible.\nI teach you the right tension between the lower and the higher, between the body and the soul, between the earth and heaven; a right tension with no antagonism. The lower has not to be denied for the higher, neither has the higher to be denied for the lower. They are together, they are two aspects of the same reality, they interpenetrate.\nSo I don't say drop your doubt, I don't say drop your no. I say let your no become the tension for your yes, let your no become the background for your yes. Let your no create the context in which the yes will be more meaningful. Only in contrast does meaning arise. You write with white chalk on a blackboard\n-- why? Because only in contrast will the white show; it will be loud and clear. Let no become the blackboard, and yes the white writing on it.\nYour trust should not be a blind trust, your trust should be a trust which has eyes. Your trust should not be an impotent trust, a trust which is trust because you are impotent to say no. Your trust should be alive, strong and vital. Your trust will be capable of saying no. Say yes and yet retain the capacity to say no, then you will be surprised -- your yes has such sharpness, such brilliance, such intelligence! Then it is not blind, it has eyes to see.\nUse no as a foundation for yes, use doubt as manure for the rosebush. Use everything that God has given to you. Nothing, nothing at all, has to be denied; all has to be absorbed, because nothing is unessential or unimportant. Even though sometimes it looks unessential and unimportant, even though sometimes it looks positively harmful and poisonous, it has not to be denied. It has not to be thrown out, because later on, on the way, as you become wiser you will repent if you threw something away, because you will need it in some situation. There are moments when poison is needed as medicine. There are moments of wisdom when just the touch of the wise man and the poison becomes nectar.\nI want you to become alchemists. This is an alchemical school, a university for inner alchemy. We are trying to change the baser metal into gold. So remember, I accept your no too, I love your no too. I accept all that you are. I accept all that you are not, even that too. You are accepted whatsoever you are, and you are accepted whatsoever you are not.\nYou are accepted in totality.\nFrom my side there is no question of denying anything, but of transforming it. The second question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 2\nWHAT IS THE EGO? REMAINING UNENLIGHTENED, ARE WE ALWAYS\nFUNCTIONING THROUGH THE EGO OR ARE THERE MOMENTS WHEN WE\nARE FREE OF IT?\nPrem parijat, man has no center separate from the center of the whole. There is only one center in existence; the ancients used to call it Tao, dhamma, God. Those words have become old now; you can call it truth. There is only one center of existence. There are not many centers, otherwise the universe would not be really a universe, it would become a multiverse. It is a unity, hence it is called the \"universe\"; it has only one center.\nBut this is to be meditated upon a little. That one center is my center, your center, everybody's center. That one center does not mean that you are centerless, that one center simply means that you don't have a separate center. Let us say it in different words. You can make many concentric circles on one center, many circles. You can throw a pebble in a silent lake: one center arises from the fall of the pebble and then many concentric circles arise and they go on spreading to the farthest shore -- millions of concentric circles, but they all have one center.\nEach can claim this center as his own. And in a way it is his center, but it is not only his.\nThe ego arises with the claim, \"The center is mine, separate. It is not your center, it is my center; it is me.\" The idea of a separate center is the root of the ego.\nWhen a child is born he comes without a center of his own. For nine months in the mother's womb he functions with the mother's center as his center; he is not separate.\nThen he is born. Then it is utilitarian to think of oneself as having a separate center; otherwise life will become very difficult, almost impossible. To survive, and to struggle for survival in the fight of life, everybody needs a certain idea of who they are. And nobody has any idea. In fact nobody can ever have any idea, because at the deepest core you are a mystery. You can't have any idea of it. At the deepest core you are not individual, you are universal.\nThat's why if you ask the Buddha, \"Who are you?\" he remains silent, he does not answer it. He cannot, because now he is no more separate. He is the whole. But in ordinary life even Buddha has to use the word 'I'. If he feels thirsty he has to say, \"I am thirsty.\nAnanda, bring me a little water, I am thirsty.\"\nTo be exactly right, he should say, \"Ananda, bring some water. The universal\ncenter is a little thirsty.\" But that will look a little odd. And to say it again and again -- sometimes the universal center is hungry, and sometimes the universal center is feeling a little cold, and sometimes the universal center is tired -- it will be unnecessary, absolutely unnecessary. So he continues to use the old meaningful word 'I'. It is very meaningful; even though a fiction, it is still meaningful. But many fictions are meaningful.\nFor example, you have a name. That is a fiction. You came without a name, you did not bring a name with you, the name was given to you. Then by constant repetition you start becoming identified with it. You know your name is Rama or Rahim or Krishna. It goes so deep that if all you three thousand sannyasins fall asleep here and somebody comes and calls, \"Rama, where are you?\" nobody will hear except Rama. Rama will say, \"Who has come to disturb my sleep?\" Even in sleep he knows his name; it has reached to the unconscious, it has seeped through and through. But it is a fiction.\nBut when I say it is a fiction I don't mean it is unnecessary. It is necessary fiction, it is useful; otherwise how are you going to address people? If you want to write a letter to somebody, to whom are you going to write?\nA small child once wrote a letter to God. His mother was ill and his father had died and they had no money, so he asked God for fifty rupees.\nWhen the letter reached the post office they were at a loss -- what to do with it? Where to send it? It was simply addressed to God. So they opened it. They felt very sorry for the little boy and they decided to collect some money and send it to him. They collected some money; he had asked for fifty rupees but they could collect only forty.\nThe next letter came, again addressed to God, and the boy had written, \"Dear Sir, please next time when you send the money, send it directly to me, don't send it through the post office. They have taken their commission -- ten rupees!\"\nIt will be difficult if nobody has a name. Although nobody has a name in reality, still, it is a beautiful fiction, helpful. And nobody knows it more than I do, because I don't think anybody in the whole history of humanity has given as many names as I have given. You can count on me!\nNames are needed for others to call you, 'I' is needed for you to call yourself, but it is just a fiction. If you go deep into yourself you will find the name has\ndisappeared, the idea of\n'I' has disappeared; there is left only a pure am-ness, is-ness, existence, being.\nAnd that being is not separate, it is not yours and mine; that being is the being of all.\nRocks, rivers, mountains, trees, all are included. It is all-inclusive, it excludes nothing.\nThe whole past, the whole future, this immense universe, everything is included in it. The deeper you go into yourself, the more and more you will find that persons don't exist, that individuals don't exist. Then what exists is a pure universalness. On the circumference we have names, egos, identities. When we jump from the circumference towards the center, all those identities disappear.\nThe ego is just a useful fiction. Use it, but don't be deceived by it.\nParijat, you also ask, \"Remaining unenlightened, are we always functioning through the ego or are there moments when we are free of it?\"\nBecause it is a fiction, there are moments when you are free of it. Because it is a fiction, it can remain there only if you go on maintaining it. A fiction needs great maintenance.\nTruth needs no maintenance, that is the beauty of truth. But a fiction? You have constantly to paint it, to give it a prop here and there, and it is constantly collapsing. By the time you have managed to prop up one side, the other side starts collapsing.\nAnd that's what people go on doing their whole life, trying to make the fiction seem as if it is the truth. Have more money, then you can have a bigger ego, a little more solid than the ego of the poor man. The poor man's ego is thin; he can't afford a thicker ego.\nBecome the prime minister or president of a country, and your ego is puffed up to extremes. Then you don't walk on the earth.\nOur whole life, the search for money, power, prestige, this and that, is nothing but a search for new props, a search for new supports, to somehow keep the fiction going. And all the time you know death is coming. Whatsoever you make, death is going to destroy it. But still one goes on hoping against hope -- maybe everybody else dies, but not you.\nAnd in a way it is true. You have always seen other people dying, you have never seen yourself dying, so it seems true also, logical also. This person dies, that person dies, and you never die. You are always there to feel sorry for them, you always go with them to the cemetery to say goodbye, and then you are back home again.\nDon't be deceived by it, because all those people were doing the same thing. And nobody is an exception. Death comes and destroys the whole fiction of your name, your fame.\nDeath comes and simply effaces all; not even footprints are left. Whatsoever we go on making out of our life is nothing but writing on water -- not even on sand, but on water.\nYou have not even written it, and it is gone. You cannot even read it; before you could have read it, it is gone.\nBut we go on trying to make these castles in the air. Because it is a fiction, it needs constant maintenance, constant effort, day and night. And nobody can be so careful for twenty-four hours. So sometimes, in spite of you, there are moments when you have a glimpse of reality without the ego functioning as a barrier. Without the screen of the ego, there are moments -- in spite of you, remember. Everybody once in a while has those moments.\nFor example, every night when you fall deeply into sleep, and the sleep is so deep that you cannot even dream, then the ego is no more found; all the fictions are gone. Deep dreamless sleep is a kind of small death. In dreams there is a possibility that you may still manage to remember it. People go on managing to maintain their ego even in their dreams.\nThat's why psychoanalysis tries to go deep into your dreams, because there is less possibility of you maintaining your identity; more loopholes can be found there. In the daytime you are very alert and on guard, continuously there with a shield to protect your ego. In dreams sometimes you forget. But the people who\nhave been studying dreams say that even in dreams the protection remains; it becomes a little more subtle.\nFor example, you see in a dream that you have killed your uncle. If you go deep into it you will be surprised: you wanted to kill your father, but you killed your uncle. You deceived yourself, the ego played a game. You are such a good guy, how can you kill your own father? And the uncle looks like your father, although nobody really wants to kill their uncle. Uncles are always nice people -- who wants to kill one's uncle? And who does not want to kill one's own father?\nThere is bound to be great antagonism between the father and the son. The father has to discipline the son, he has to curb and cut his freedom and order him and force him to obey. And nobody wants to obey and be disciplined and given shoulds and should-nots.\nThe father is so powerful that the son feels jealous. And the greatest jealousy is that the son wants the mother to be completely his own, and this father always comes in between, he is always there. And not only does the son feel jealous of the father, the father also feels jealous of the son because he is always there between his wife and him.\nMulla Nasruddin's son got married. He came home with his wife and with his friends and relatives; the whole house was full. He went out for something and when he came back he was very much taken aback -- his father was hugging his wife and kissing her. This was too much! This is not allowed. He was very angry and said, \"What are you doing?\"\nThe father said, \"And what have you been doing your whole life? You have been kissing and hugging my wife -- and I never said anything to you.\"\nHe may not have said anything, but he must have felt like it. There is an antagonism between the father and the son, between the daughter and the mother\n-- a natural antagonism, a natural jealousy. The daughter wants to possess the father but the mother is there; she looks like the enemy.\nUncles are very beautiful people, but in a dream you will not kill your own father. Your moral conscience, part of your ego, will prevent you from doing such a thing. You will find a substitute; this is a strategy.\nIf you minutely observe your dreams you will find many strategies the ego is\nstill trying to play. The ego cannot accept the fact: \"I am killing my own father? I am such an obedient son, respectful towards my father, loving him so much -- and I am trying to kill my father?\" The ego won't accept the idea; the ego shifts the idea a little bit to the side.\nThe uncle looks almost like the father; kill the uncle, that seems easier. The uncle is only a substitute. This is what goes on even in dreams.\nBut in dreamless sleep the ego completely disappears, because when there is no thinking, no dreaming, how can you carry a fiction? But dreamless sleep is very small. In eight hours of healthy sleep it is not more than two hours. But only those two hours are revitalizing. If you have two hours of deep dreamless sleep, in the morning you are new, fresh, alive. Life again has a thrill to it, the day seems to be a gift. Everything seems to be new, because you are new. And everything seems to be beautiful, because you are in a beautiful space.\nWhat happened in these two hours when you fell into deep sleep -- what Patanjali calls sushupti, dreamless sleep? The ego disappeared. And the disappearance of the ego has revitalized you, rejuvenated you. With the disappearance of the ego, even though in deep unconsciousness, you had a taste of God.\nPatanjali says there is not much difference between sushupti, dreamless sleep, and samadhi, the ultimate state of buddhahood -- not much difference, although there is a difference. The difference is that of consciousness. In dreamless sleep you are unconscious, in samadhi you are conscious, but the state is the same. You move into God, you move into the universal center. You disappear from the circumference and you go to the center. And just that contact with the center so rejuvenates you.\nPeople who cannot sleep are really miserable people, very miserable people. They have lost a natural source of being in contact with God. They have lost a natural passage into the universal; a door has closed.\nThis century is the first century which is suffering from sleeplessness. We have closed all the other doors; now we are closing the last door, the door of sleep. That seems to be the last disconnection from the universal energy -- the greatest danger. And now there are foolish people in the world who are writing books, and with very logical acumen, saying that sleep is not needed at all, it is a\nwastage of time. They are right, it is a wastage of time. For people who think in terms of money and work, people who are workaholics, for them it is a wastage of time.\nJust as there is now Alcoholics Anonymous, soon we will need Workaholics Anonymous.\nI propose Morarji Desai's name for the president of Workaholics Anonymous.\nPeople who are obsessed with work, they have to be constantly on the go. They cannot rest, they cannot relax. Even when they are dying, they will be doing something or other.\nThese people are now suggesting that sleep is unnecessary. They are suggesting that sleep is really an unnecessary hangover from the past. They say that in the past, when there was no electricity and no fire, out of necessity people had to sleep. Now there is no need. It is just an old habit imbibed in millions of years; it has to be dropped. Their idea is that in the future sleep will disappear.\nAnd the same is happening behind the iron curtain in Russia too. They are creating new devices so that people can be taught things while they are asleep -- a new kind of education, so time is not wasted. It is the last torture that we are going to invent for children. We invented the school; we are not satisfied with that. Small children, imprisoned in schools.…\nIn India, schools and prisons used to be painted the same way, the same color. And they were the same type of building -- ugly, with no aesthetic sense, with no trees and birds and animals around them, so that children would not be distracted. Otherwise, who will listen to the foolish mathematics teacher when a cuckoo suddenly starts calling from the window? Or a deer comes into the class, and the teacher is teaching you geography or history.… Children will be distracted, so they have to be taken away from nature, away from society. They have to be forced to sit on hard benches for five hours, six hours, seven hours.\nThis goes on for years together. Almost one third of life is spent in schools. You have made slaves of them. In their remaining life they will remain workaholics; they will not be able to have a real holiday.\nNow these people are thinking, why waste the night time? So children can be put into night education. They will be asleep in bed but their ears will be connected\nto a central school, and in a very very subtle subliminal way, messages will be put into their heads.\nThey will be programmed.\nAnd it has been found that they can learn more easily in this way than they learn while they are awake. Naturally, because when you are awake, howsoever you are protected, a thousand and one things distract your mind. And children are so full of energy that everything attracts them; they are continuously distracted. That is just energy, nothing else; there is no sin in it. They are not dead, that's why they are distracted.\nA dog starts barking, somebody starts fighting outside, somebody plays a trick on the teacher or somebody tells a joke -- and there are a thousand and one things which go on distracting them. But when a child is asleep -- and deeply asleep, when dreams are not there -- there is no distraction at all. Now that dreamless sleep can be used as part of pedagogy.\nIt seems we are in every way ready to disconnect ourselves from the universal source of being. Now, these children will be the ugliest possible, because even when there was a possibility of being lost completely beyond the ego, that has also been taken away. The last possibility of ego disappearance is then no longer available. When they could have been in contact with God, they will be taught some rubbish history. The dates when Genghis Khan was born -- who bothers, who cares? In fact if Genghis Khan had never been born, that would have been far better. That's what I wrote in my paper, and my teacher was very angry. I had to stand for twenty-four hours outside the class, because I had written, \"It is unfortunate that he was born. It would have been very fortunate if he had not been born at all.\"\nBut kings and emperors, they go on and on being born just to torture small children; they have to remember the dates and the names for no reason at all. A better kind of education will drop all this crap. Ninety percent of it is crap, and the remaining ten percent can be very much improved. And then life can have more joy, more rest, more relaxation.\nBecause the ego is a fiction, it disappears sometimes. The greatest time is dreamless sleep. So make it a point that sleep is very valuable; don't miss it for any reason. Slowly slowly, make sleep a regular thing. Because the body is a\nmechanism, if you follow a regular pattern of sleep the body will find it easier and the mind will find it easier to disappear.\nGo to bed at exactly the same time. Don't take it literally -- if one day you are late you will not be sent to hell or anything! I have to be cautious, because there are a few people here who are health freaks. Their only disease is that they are continuously thinking of health. If they stop thinking of health they will be perfectly well. But if you can make your sleep a regular thing, going to bed at almost the same time and getting up at almost the same time... the body is a mechanism, the mind is too, and it simply slips into dreamless sleep at a certain moment.\nThe second greatest source of egoless experiences is sex, love. That too has been destroyed by the priests; they have condemned it, so it is no longer such a great experience. Such a condemnation for so long, it has conditioned the minds of people.\nEven while they are making love, they know deep down that they are doing something wrong. Some guilt is lurking somewhere. And this is so even for the most modern, the most contemporary, even the younger generation.\nOn the surface you may have revolted against the society, on the surface you may be a conformist no more. But things have gone very deep; it is not a question of revolting on the surface. You can grow long hair, that won't help much. You can become a hippy and stop taking baths, that won't help much. You can become a dropout in every possible way that you can imagine and think of, but that won't help really, because things have gone too deep and all these are superficial measures.\nFor thousands of years we have been told that sex is the greatest sin. It has become part of our blood, bone and marrow. So even if you know consciously that there is nothing wrong in it, the unconscious keeps you a little detached, afraid, guilt-ridden, and you cannot move into it totally.\nIf you can move into lovemaking totally, the ego disappears, because at the highest peak, at the highest climax of lovemaking, you are pure energy. The mind cannot function.\nWith such joy, with such an outburst of energy, the mind simply stops. It is such an upsurge of energy that the mind is at a loss, it does not know what to do now.\nIt is perfectly capable of remaining in function in normal situations, but when anything very new and very vital happens it stops. And sex is the most vital thing.\nIf you can go deeply into lovemaking, the ego disappears. That is the beauty of lovemaking, that it is another source of a glimpse of God -- just like deep sleep but far more valuable, because in deep sleep you will be unconscious. In lovemaking you will be conscious -- conscious yet without the mind.\nHence the great science of Tantra became possible. Patanjali and yoga worked on the lines of deep sleep; they chose that path to transform deep sleep into a conscious state so you know who you are, so you know what you are at the center.\nTantra chose lovemaking as a window towards God. The path of yoga is very long, because to transform unconscious sleep into consciousness is very arduous; it may take many lives. And who knows, you may or may not be able to persist for so long, persevere for so long, be patient for so long. So the fate that has fallen on yoga is this, that the so-called yogis go on only doing body postures. They never go deeper than that; that takes their whole life. Of course they get better health, a longer life -- but that is not the point!\nYou can have better health by jogging, running, swimming; you can have a longer life through medical care. That is not the point.\nThe point was to become conscious in deep sleep. And your so-called yogis go on teaching you how to stand on your head and how to distort and contort your body. Yoga has become a kind of circus -- meaningless. It has lost its real dimension.\nIn the new commune, I have the vision of reviving yoga again in its true flavor, in its true dimension. And the goal is to become conscious while you are deeply asleep. That is the essential thing in yoga, and if any yogi is teaching anything else it is all useless.\nBut Tantra has chosen a far shorter way, the shortest, and far more pleasant too!\nLovemaking can open the window. All that is needed is to uproot the conditionings that the priests have put into you. The priests put those conditionings into you so that they could become mediators and agents between\nyou and God, so that your direct contact was cut. Naturally you would need somebody else to connect you, and the priest would become powerful. And the priest has been powerful down the ages.\nWhosoever can put you in contact with power, real power, will become powerful. God is real power, the source of all power. The priest remained down the ages so powerful --\nmore powerful than kings. Now the scientist has taken the place of the priest, because now he knows how to unlock the doors of the power hidden in nature. The priest knew how to connect you with God, the scientist knows how to connect you with nature. But the priest has to disconnect you first, so no individual private line remains between you and God. He has spoiled your inner sources, poisoned them. He became very powerful but the whole humanity became lustless, loveless, full of guilt.\nMy people have to drop that guilt completely. While making love, think of prayer, meditation, God. While making love, burn incense, chant, sing, dance. Your bedroom should be a temple, a sacred place. And lovemaking should not be a hurried thing. Go deeper into it; savor it as slowly and as gracefully as possible. And you will be surprised.\nYou have the key.\nGod has not sent you into the world without keys. But those keys have to be used, you have to put them into the lock and turn them.\nLove is another phenomenon, one of the most potential, where the ego disappears and you are conscious, fully conscious, pulsating, vibrating. You are no more an individual, you are lost into the energy of the whole.\nThen, slowly slowly, let this become your very way of life. What happens at the peak of love has to become your discipline -- not just an experience but a discipline. Then whatsoever you are doing and wherever you are walking... early in the morning with the sun rising, have the same feeling, the same merger with existence. Lying down on the ground, the sky full of stars, have the same merger again. Lying down on the earth, feel one with the earth.\nSlowly slowly, lovemaking should give you the clue for how to be in love with existence itself. And then the ego is known as a fiction, is used as a fiction. And\nif you use it as a fiction, there is no danger.\nThere are a few other moments when the ego slips of its own accord. In moments of great danger: you are driving, and suddenly you see an accident is going to happen. You have lost control of the car and there seems to be no possibility of saving yourself. You are going to crash into the tree or into the oncoming truck, or you are going to fall in the river, it is absolutely certain. In those moments suddenly the ego will disappear.\nThat's why there is a great attraction to move into dangerous situations. People climb Everest. It is a deep meditation, although they may or may not understand this.\nMountaineering is of great importance. Climbing mountains is dangerous -- the more dangerous it is, the more beautiful. You will have glimpses, great glimpses of egolessness. Whenever danger is very close, the mind stops. Mind can think only when you are not in danger; it has nothing to say in danger. Danger makes you spontaneous, and in that spontaneity you suddenly know that you are not the ego.\nOr -- these will be for different people, because people are different -- if you have an aesthetic heart, then beauty will open the doors. Just seeing a beautiful woman or a man passing by, just for a single moment a flash of beauty, and suddenly the ego disappears.\nYou are overwhelmed.\nOr seeing a lotus in the pond, or seeing the sunset or a bird on the wing -- anything that triggers your inner sensitivity, anything that possesses you for the moment so deeply that you forget yourself, that you are and yet you are not, that you abandon yourself -- then too, the ego slips. It is a fiction; you have to carry it. If you forget it for a moment, it slips.\nAnd it is good that there are a few moments when it slips and you have a glimpse of the true and the real. It is because of these glimpses that religion has not died. It is not because of the priests -- they have done everything to kill it. It is not because of the so-called religious, those who go to the church and the mosque and the temple. They are not religious at all, they are pretenders.\nReligion has not died because of these few moments which happen more or less\nto almost everybody. Take more note of them, imbibe the spirit of those moments more, allow those moments more, create spaces for those moments to happen more. This is the true way to seek God. Not to be in the ego is to be in God.\nThe third question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 3\nWHY DO YOU EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HERENOW SO MUCH?\nRahim, because there is nothing else. Here is the only space, now is the only time.\nBeyond the herenow, there is nothing. Two thousand years ago, a great Jewish master, Hillel, wrote a little poem in Aramaic. The poem is this:\n\"If I'm not for myself, Then who can be for me? And if I'm only for myself, Then what am I?\nAnd if not now, When?\"\nIt is a beautiful statement: if not now, then when? Tomorrow? But the tomorrow never comes.\nHence I emphasize the herenow. Don't let this moment slip by unused, unlived, unpenetrated; squeeze all that you can out of it. Live it passionately and with intensity, so you need not repent later on that you missed your life.\nIt was after the Second World War; the war had ended. Joe Dink was still in Japan waiting to be discharged. His wife, Irma Dink, was wild with anxiety and\njealousy because she read about the goings on between the American soldiers and the Japanese girls.\nFinally she could stand it no longer, and she wrote her husband, \"Joe, hurry up and come back. What do those girls have, anyway, that the American girls don't?\"\n\"Not a thing,\" wrote back Joe. \"But what they've got, they've got here.\" And that is the most important thing. The question is of here and now. And the last question:\nQuestion 4\nBELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS A MIRACLE?\nSadhananda, it depends. To me, everything is a miracle. I never come across anything that is not a miracle; only miracles exist. Everything is such a surprise, it is so unbelievable! But if your eyes are closed, if your eyes are full of dust, if your mind is too knowledgeable, if you think you know all, then nothing is a miracle.\nTo know \"I don't know anything\" makes everything a miracle. It depends on your inner state, it depends on you. And to live a life without miracles is not to live at all. You can have a million miracles every day, you are entitled to have them. But because you don't know how to connect yourself with the miraculous, you are being cheated by stupid people.\nSomebody produces a Swiss-made watch and you think this is a miracle. Then you become victims of ordinary magicians. Don't be befooled.\nThe seed sprouting into leaves is a miracle -- not somebody producing a Swiss- made watch out of nothing. That is just a trick, a very ordinary trick; street magicians are doing it all over the world. They are just simple people, not cunning people, otherwise you would have worshipped them.\nWhile exploring the wilds of South America, a man was captured by savages. They were dancing excitedly around before killing him when the explorer had a bright idea. He would baffle them with magic. Taking a cigarette-lighter from his\npocket, he shouted, \"I make fire!\"\nWith a flick of the thumb, the lighter burst into flame. The savages fell back and gazed in wonder.\n\"Magic!\" cried the explorer.\n\"It certainly is,\" said the chief. \"It's the only time I ever saw a lighter work on the first try.\"\nIt depends on you, what you call a miracle. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing else except miracles. And drop these stupid kinds of miracles.\nMulla Nasruddin and his wife are sitting one Sunday listening to the radio, when this faith healer comes on and he says, \"If you have a part of your body you want healed, place one hand on the radio and the other hand on the afflicted part.\"\nThe wife placed one hand on the radio and the other on her heart. The Mulla placed one hand on the radio and the other on his appendage.\nSo the wife said, \"Mulla, he's trying to cure the sick, not raise the dead.\" Enough for today.\nThe Book of Wisdom Chapter #17\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"16130","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_wisdom/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_wisdom/>The Book of Wisdom</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: The Smokeless Flame</h1><div class=post-meta>76 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;16130 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Book_of_Wisdom/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IS IT ONLY IN THE EXISTENCE
OF</p><p>MIND? AND HOW IS THE DESIRE OF THE BODY FOR SEX RELATED</p><p>TO THE MIND?</p><p>Anurag, the energy called desire has been condemned for centuries.
Almost all the so-called saints have been against it, because desire is
life and they were all life-negative.</p><p>Desire is the very source of all that you see, and they were against
all that which is visible. They wanted to sacrifice the visible at the
feet of the invisible; they wanted to cut the roots of desire so there
would no longer be any possibility of life.</p><p>A tremendously great urge to commit total suicide has dominated
humanity down the ages.</p><p>I have a totally different concept of desire. First, desire itself is
God. Desire without any object, desire without being goal-oriented,
unmotivated desire, pure desire, is God. The energy called desire is the
same energy as God.</p><p>Desire has not to be destroyed, it has to be purified. Desire has not
to be dropped, it has to be transformed. Your very being is desire; to
be against it is to be against yourself and against all. To be against
it is to be against the flowers and the birds and the sun and the moon.
To be against it is against all creativity. Desire is creativity.</p><p>The Eastern scriptures are perfectly right when they say that God
created the world because a great desire arose in him -- a desire to
create, a desire to manifest, a desire to make many from one, a desire
to expand. But these are only metaphors; God is not separate from
desire. Desire means a longing, a great longing, to expand, to become
huge, to be enormous -- as huge as the sky.</p><p>Just watch people, watch desires, and you will understand what I
mean. Even in your ordinary desires, the basic thing is present. In fact
what the man who wants to have more and more money really wants is not
money but expansion, because money can help you expand. You can have a
bigger house, you can have a bigger garden, you can have this, you can
have that -- your territory will be bigger, your freedom will be bigger.
With more money you will have more alternatives to choose from.</p><p>The man who is after money may not know why he is after the money. He
may himself think and believe that he loves money, but that is only on
the surface of his consciousness. Go deeper into his unconscious, help
him to meditate, and you will be surprised and he will be surprised to
find that the desire for money is not really the desire for money, it is
the desire to expand.</p><p>And the same is the case with all other desires. Men want more power,
more fame, longer life, better health, but what are they desiring in
these different things? The same, exactly the same: they want to be
more. They don't want to remain confined, they don't want to be limited.
It hurts to feel that you are definable, because if you are definable
then you are just an object, a thing, a commodity. It hurts that you
have limitations, because to have limitations means to be
imprisoned.</p><p>But all these objects of desire, sooner or later, disappoint. Money
becomes possible one day, and yet expansion has not happened; you may
have a little more freedom of choice, but that does not satisfy. The
desire was for the infinite, and money cannot purchase the infinite.
Yes, you have more power, you are more well-known, but that doesn't
really matter in the long run. Millions of people have lived on this
earth and were very famous, and now nobody even knows their names.
Everything has disappeared into dust -- dust into dust, not even traces
are left. Where is Alexander the Great? What is he? Would you like to be
a dead Alexander the Great or an alive beggar? Ask yourself, and your
being will say it is better to be alive and be a beggar than to be dead
and be an Alexander.</p><p>If you watch carefully, money, power, prestige -- nothing satisfies.
On the contrary, they make you more discontented. Why? -- because when
you were poor there was a hope that one day the money was going to
happen and all would be settled and settled forever, and then you would
relax and enjoy. Now that has happened, and there seems to be no sign of
any relaxation. In fact, you are more tense than before, you are more
anxiety-ridden than before.</p><p>Money has brought a few blessings, but in the same measure it has
brought many curses too. You can have a bigger house, but now you will
have less peace. You can have a bigger bank balance, but you will also
have a bigger madness, anxiety, neurosis, psychosis. Money has brought a
few things which are good; in the wake of it many other things have
arrived which are not good at all. And if you look at the whole thing,
the whole effort has been a sheer wastage. And now</p><p>you cannot have even the hope that the poor man can have.</p><p>The rich man becomes hopeless. He knows now the money will go on
increasing and nothing is going to happen -- just death, only death. He
has tasted all kinds of things; now he only feels a tastelessness. A
kind of death has already happened, because he cannot conceive of how to
fulfill that desire for expansion.</p><p>But desire in itself is not wrong. The desire for money, the desire
for power, the desire for prestige, are wrong objects for desire -- let
it be very clear. By having wrong objects of desire, desire itself does
not become wrong. You can have a sword and you can kill somebody -- that
does not make the sword something wrong. You can also save somebody with
the same sword. Poison can kill and poison can become medicine too. In
the right hands, poison is nectar; in the wrong hands, nectar is
poison.</p><p>This is the essential wisdom of all the buddhas of all the ages. What
the priests say is one thing; what the buddhas have brought to the world
is totally different, it is diametrically opposite.</p><p>Desire has to be purified and transformed, because it is your energy
-- you don't have any other energy. How to transform desire? One way,
the ordinary way, the mediocre way, is to change the object. Don't go
after money, start going after God. You are frustrated with money --
become religious, go to the church, to the temple, to the mosque. Let
your desire have a new object called God, which is as illusory as the
object called money, even more illusory, because what do you know about
God? Money at least is something visible, objective; you have known it,
you have seen it. What do you know of God? You have only heard the word.
God remains a word unless experienced. God remains an empty word unless
you pour some content into it through your own existential
experience.</p><p>People, when they are frustrated with worldly desires, start changing
the object: they start making otherworldly objects of desire -- heaven,
paradise, and all the joys of heaven. But it is the same trick, the mind
is again befooling you. This is not the way of the intelligent person,
this is the way of the stupid.</p><p>What is intelligence? Intelligence means the insight that no object
can fulfill your desire.</p><p>No object, I say, and I say it categorically, no object can ever
fulfill your desire. Your desire is divine. Your desire is as big as the
sky -- even the sky is not a</p><p>limit to it. No object can fill it. Then what is to be done? The
intelligent person stops desiring objects.</p><p>He makes his desire pure of all objects -- worldly, otherworldly. He
starts living his desire in its purity, moment to moment. He is full of
desire, full of overflowing energy.</p><p>His ordinary life becomes so intense, so passionate, that whatsoever
he touches will be transformed. The baser metal will become gold, and
the dead tree will come to bloom again.</p><p>It is said of Buddha that wherever he moved, dead trees would start
growing leaves; out of season, trees would bloom. These are beautiful
poetic expressions of a certain metaphysical truth. Buddha is pure
desire, just desire. Not a desire for anything; he has abandoned all
objects.</p><p>Let me remind you, first he abandoned the world. He was a prince, he
was born to be a king. Seeing the futility of money, seeing the futility
of all kinds of relationships, seeing the futility of all that the world
can give -- he was only twenty-nine years old -- he escaped. He did
well, because after thirty it becomes more difficult, more and more
difficult.</p><p>Hippies are right. They say, "Don't believe a man who is over
thirty." Buddha escaped at the right time -- he was exactly twenty-nine
-- because the more you become experienced in worldly ways, the more
cowardly you become. Religion is for the courageous, religion is for the
brave, religion is for the young, those who are still able to take the
risk, those who are still able to gamble.</p><p>Buddha escaped. Seeing the futility, he escaped in search of God, in
search of truth. He replaced his desire for the world with the desire
for God, truth, nirvana. For six years he worked hard. By the time he
was thirty-five he was utterly spent. He had done all that was possible,
humanly possible, to do. He fasted for months, meditated, practiced
yoga.</p><p>And in those days there were different kinds of schools. He went from
one teacher to another, from one school to another, he practiced all
possible methods. And one day it suddenly flashed.</p><p>He was crossing the river Niranjana. It is a small river -- when I
went to see the river I could not believe the story. The story says that
he could not cross the river</p><p>Niranjana, he could not swim it, because he was so weak. The river is
so narrow, the river is so small, but he must have been very weak from
years of fasting. It is said that he had fasted so long that you could
count his bones, his ribs. He had become simply bones, he was a
skeleton; his stomach had completely disappeared, his stomach and his
back had become one. He must have been really weak; he could not cross
the river, and was hanging onto the root of a tree, having no energy to
get out of the river.</p><p>In that moment, a great insight happened. Insights happen only in
such moments. When the frustration is total, when the disappointment is
complete, when the disillusionment is utter, when there is nothing left
to hope for... in that moment he saw the pointlessness of it all. The
worldly objects were meaningless; he had had all of them and they did
not satisfy. And those otherworldly desires were just as foolish as the
worldly desires. In that moment, in that insight, he became
objectless.</p><p>Let me tell you, the scriptures report it very wrongly. They say that
in that moment he became desireless. But try to understand what I am
trying to convey to you. He became objectless, not desireless. You
cannot become desireless. Desire is your very life, your breath, your
heartbeat; desire is your being. But certainly a transformation
happened; he became objectless. This-worldly, otherworldly, all desires
in toto disappeared as objects, not desire as energy. There was no
object; pure energy was felt, a desiring for nothing, a pure desire
moving nowhere, a pure desire herenow.</p><p>That very night he attained enlightenment. Having nothing to desire,
he rested under a tree and fell asleep. For the first time he really
slept. When there is nothing to desire, there is nothing to dream about
either, because dreams are reflections of your desires.</p><p>Dreams are reflections of your frustrations, dreams are reflections
of your repressions, dreams reflect your day-life. That night there was
no dream, it was a dreamless deep sleep.</p><p>Patanjali says dreamless deep sleep is closest to samadhi -- just one
step more, and you have come home. And that one step happened early in
the morning. Rested, Buddha opened his eyes. For the first time in his
life there was nowhere to go, nothing to do. For the first time in life
he must have been at a loss. Now what? There was nothing to cling to,
nothing to hold on to. There must have</p><p>been an utter emptiness. Time must have stopped. There was no program
any more. Every day he used to get up with so many ideas to be
cultivated, so many methods to be practiced, so many religious rituals
to be done, and all that. Today there was nothing left! Utter
emptiness.</p><p>But do you think he died? No, he was born. Objects were not there.
Now the desire was pure -- just a throb, a pulsation, just a passion for
nothing in particular. Resting under the tree with open eyes, he must
have been seeing the sky in the east becoming red, and then the sunrise.
And with the rising sun and with the sky turning red, and with the last
star of the night disappearing, he became enlightened.</p><p>What does this word enlightenment mean? It simply means desire was
freed from all objects. He became pure love, compassion, pure life. And
this pure life has tremendous beauty and ecstasy; with this pure life
you have attained the infinite. Desire remains small because you confine
it to small objects, desire remains small because you desire small
things. Seeing it, people start desiring big things -- but big things
are also small things; howsoever big they are, they have
limitations.</p><p>Just think of your God. How big is he? Egyptians used to say he is
seven feet tall</p><p>--</p><p>nothing much. There are many Dutch sannyasins here. Whenever I see a
Dutch sannyasin, I remember the Egyptians and the Egyptian gods. Indians
say he has three faces. So what? Our politicians have one thousand and
one faces, and everyone has many faces. Only three? When you talk to
your wife you have one face, when you talk to your girlfriend you have
another face, when you talk to your servant still another, when you talk
to your boss still another. Just watch the whole day, how many faces you
have! And God seems to be very poor -- only three faces? How does he
manage with only three faces?</p><p>All concepts of God are bound to be limited. Concepts as such are
bound to be limited.</p><p>Even if you say he is infinite, what do you mean? What do you mean by
infinite? Try to comprehend the meaning of the word infinite and you
will be in a difficulty. Even your word infinite will be found to be
finite. You can say he is unbounded, but just think, what do you mean?
The boundary must be</p><p>somewhere; how could it be that one just goes on and on and on? There
must be a boundary -- maybe it is very far away, far far away, maybe you
will never reach it, but what do you mean by "unbounded"? You simply
mean unmeasured, nothing more.</p><p>What do you mean when you say the ocean is unfathomable? Do you think
there is no bottom to it? The bottom is there, although we may not have
fathomed it. Our ways of measurement are small, our yardsticks are
small.</p><p>Any word that we can use is bound to remain limited. Hence, those who
have known God, they say nothing can be said about him. Buddha did not
even say this much, that nothing can be said about him, because he said
if you say nothing can be said about him, you have already said
something. You have already defined him! "Nothing can be said about him"
is a statement, and all statements define.</p><p>You can move from small objects to bigger and bigger objects, but
still your desire, your life, will not feel fulfilled. It cannot feel
fulfilled unless it is really infinite, not in conceptions but in
experience, and unless you taste the infinity of existence.</p><p>Desire is beautiful, there is nothing wrong in it -- only free it
from objects. With freedom from objects, desire is divine.</p><p>Anurag, you say, "You must have told us so many times already, but I
still don't get it "</p><p>Just by my saying it, you are not going to get it. You will have to
move into experience. It is not a philosophical system of thought that I
am conveying to you. I am only pointing towards a path; the path has to
be followed. You will not get it just by listening to me.</p><p>Yes, you can get it if you sit silently by my side. You can get it in
the intervals, when I am here and you are here and no word interferes,
intervenes.</p><p>Words don't communicate. On the contrary, for higher things they
become barriers. For lower things they are bridges; the higher you move,
the less and less they are bridges, the more and more they are
walls.</p><p>You say, "You must have told us so many times already, but I still
don't get it "</p><p>I will go on saying it, Anurag, again and again, but remember, you
will not get it just by listening to me. You will have to be something
like me. You will have to imbibe me, you will have to digest me. It is
not something verbal that is happening here, it is something
existential. It is a love affair.</p><p>I am not a teacher, I am not teaching you anything, I am simply
imparting something to you. What has happened to me, I am inviting you
to partake of it. Be my guest, let me be your host. And if you can even
be a guest for a single moment, that which has not been understood for
so long will be immediately understood. And not only will it be
understood, you will be surprised how you went on missing it. It is so
simple; to have understood it would have been simple.</p><p>But it is a question of an energy communication. And, slowly slowly,
I will turn the commune into an energy communication. Words can take you
only so far, then it has to become a meeting of energies. You have to be
electrified by me. You have to allow my pure desiring, my pure energy.
It is objectless; I don't desire a thing, I am simply desire.</p><p>If you allow yourself to come in contact with this energy, there will
be a transformation, a turning point, a conversion.</p><p>You say, "What is the seed of desire?"</p><p>There is no seed of desire. Desire is the seed of all. Desire is the
ultimate seed. God desired to be man, God desired to expand, God desired
to create.</p><p>Desire is the seed of everything!</p><p>If you ask me, I will say God is desire -- that's why he could
desire. Only desire can desire.</p><p>You ask, "Is it only in the existence of mind?"</p><p>No. The mind has only a very tunnel vision. The mind is as if you are
hiding behind a door and looking through the keyhole. Yes, sometimes you
can see a bird on the wing, but for only a split second, and then it is
gone. You see somebody passing by -- a beautiful woman, a beautiful man,
or a dog -- just for a moment, and it is gone. A moment before, it was
not there; a moment afterwards, it is no more there. That's how the mind
creates time. It is a keyhole.</p><p>You see a bird on the wing, and you see it only for just a second.
Before that, it was not --</p><p>do you think it was not? It was, but for you it was in the future,
because it was not in front of your keyhole. And after a moment it is no
more again -- do you think it is no more? It still is, but for you it is
past.</p><p>Mind is limited, hence it creates divisions -- past, present and
future. The present is that which for a moment appears on the screen of
the mind, and the past is that which is no more on the screen, and the
future is that which is not yet. But let me tell you: all is, and always
is. Nothing ever goes out of existence, and nothing ever comes into
existence.</p><p>Everything persists, remains.</p><p>Time is a false notion created by the mind. Eternity is truth,
timelessness is truth.</p><p>Somebody asked Jesus, "Tell us something more about the kingdom of
God. What will be special there? Something unique. Yes, we have heard
that there will be pleasure, but pleasure we know -- maybe it will be
thousands and thousands of times greater, but we know what pleasure is.
We have heard there will be celestial music -- okay, we know something
about music. But what will be special?"</p><p>And you will be surprised what Jesus said. It is not recorded in the
Christian scriptures, but there are a few sayings scattered here and
there in other scriptures. This is recorded by the Sufis. Jesus said,
"There shall be time no longer." A tremendously significant answer.
There shall be time no longer -- this will be special. You have known
everything, but you have not known timelessness. "There shall be time no
longer" means there shall be mind no longer. Mind and time are
synonymous.</p><p>In the ultimate reckoning, time is mind, mind is time. Both are
aspects of the same coin, they both disappear together. Drop one, and
the other is gone also.</p><p>You ask me, "What is the seed of desire?"</p><p>Anurag, there is no seed of desire. Desire is the ultimate seed of
all other seeds.</p><p>And you ask, "Is it only in the existence of mind?"</p><p>No. The mind has only a little glimpse of desire, just a flickering
glimpse of desire. Mind knows nothing of desire; mind only knows about
desiring this and desiring that. Desiring money, desiring power,
desiring prestige -- mind knows about desires for objects. When the
objects are no more there, desire is no more part of the mind. Then
desire is beyond mind; then desire is simply an overflowing energy.</p><p>William Blake says desire is energy and energy is delight. I have
heard a rumor that Sargama, one of our sannyasins, is a direct
descendant of William Blake. We have beautiful people here. William
Blake is one of the most beautiful persons who has ever walked on the
earth, one of the most penetrating mystics. Sargama must have something
of William Blake's quality in him. But it may be just a rumor, because I
have heard another rumor also that William Blake had no son at all. But
that may be applicable only to legal sons; one can have illegal
sons.</p><p>William Blake's insight is true. Desire is energy, energy is delight.
Contemplate over it.</p><p>Just pure desire, just overflowing energy, for no particular object,
for no destination.</p><p>That's what you have to remember when you come to me for an energy
darshan, for a</p><p>"close-up." Just become pure desire, just an overflowing desire, for
nothing in particular.</p><p>Don't wait for any experience. Experiences will come, but don't wait
for them. If you wait, you will miss, because when you are waiting for
an experience you are no more in the herenow. You have already missed
the point; the mind has come in. The object has obstructed the purity of
desire.</p><p>When you are in an energy darshan with me, when you are partaking of
something of my energy, just be pure desire -- going nowhere, moving
nowhere, just thrilled for no reason at all, just madly ecstatic for no
reason at all. And in those few moments you will have the contact with
me, because those few moments are my reality.</p><p>But if you are sitting there, waiting to have some great experience
of light inside, then maybe you may experience some light, but you have
missed. You have thrown the diamonds away and gathered pebbles on the
shore. You may be waiting for your kundalini to rise, you may have a
certain sensation rising in your spine, but what is it? It is pointless.
It may give you a kick, a spiritual kick, but then it is gone.</p><p>With me, just be pure desire -- swaying with me, moving with me,
dancing with me, allowing me to penetrate you to your deepest core, to
the deepest core of your desire, to the very seed. And then something
immense, something incredible, something you cannot imagine, is possible
-- an entry of the beyond into you, the meeting of the earth and
sky.</p><p>You say, "Is it only in the existence of mind?"</p><p>No, the mind is a barrier. It allows desire only little outlets --
and desire is an ocean. The mind has to be dropped, not desire; the mind
has to be dropped so that you can have total desire.</p><p>And you ask, "And how is the desire in the body for sex related to
the mind?"</p><p>The mind is not separate from your body, it is the inner part of the
body. You are separate from the body and the mind, both. You are an
entity, transcendental, you are a witness to the mind and the body,
both. But your mind and your body are both one and the same energy. The
body is visible mind, the mind is invisible body. The body is the
exterior mind, and the mind is the interior body.</p><p>Hence sex is not only physical. It is far more cerebral, it is far
more psychological than physical. In fact, sex is triggered not by your
physiology but by your psychology. The physiology cooperates with it,
but deep down sex comes from the inner body to the outer body.</p><p>You may be aware, you may not be aware, because you are not at all
aware of what goes on happening to you. But watch, the first thing about
sex happens in the head, in the mind. And then immediately the body is
affected, because the body and the mind are not separate.</p><p>There can be a physiological sex too. That's what happens when you go
to a prostitute; it is physiological, it is just a relief for the body.
The body is overburdened with energy and you don't know what to do with
it. You have to</p><p>throw it out somehow to unburden yourself, so that you can feel a
little relaxed, because you have too much energy and you are so
uncreative that you don't know what to do with it.</p><p>You can't sing a song totally. If you can, you will be surprised; the
energy disappears into the song and becomes the song. There is no need
to go to a prostitute. But you cannot dance, you cannot play on the
guitar, you are so uncreative.</p><p>Prostitutes will exist in the world unless man becomes more creative.
And now in the West where the Women's Liberation movement is demanding
equality in everything, even male prostitutes have come into existence.
They were bound to, because why should there be only female prostitutes?
Why not male prostitutes too? Equality is equality.</p><p>Man is uncreative. Have you observed? Any time when you are creative,
sex disappears.</p><p>If you are painting and totally absorbed in it, you don't have any
sexual desire. Sex simply does not cross the threshold of your mind; it
is simply not there.</p><p>Only in deep creativity are people celibate, in no other way. Your
saints, so- called saints, are not celibate -- because they are so
uncreative, they cannot be. It is impossible; it is just against the
very science of energy. They are doing nothing, sitting in the temples
and ashrams repeating Ram-Ram, Ram-Ram, or just stupidly playing with
their malas -- how can they be celibate? How can brahmacharya happen to
them? It happens only when creativity takes all your energy, and no
energy is left as a tension in you.</p><p>Poets can be celibate more, painters can be celibate more, dancers
can be celibate more, musicians can be celibate more. I am not saying
that they are all celibates, I am saying that whenever a poet is a poet,
he can be celibate -- because a poet is not twenty-four hours a day a
poet. It is very rare to find a poet who is twenty-four hours a day a
poet.</p><p>Then he becomes a seer, then he becomes a rishi, then he is no more
an ordinary poet.</p><p>It is from people like these who were for twenty-four hours poets
that great poems like the Upanishads, the Koran and the Gita were born.
It is not ordinary</p><p>poetry. Ordinary poets are only once in a while poets, otherwise they
are ordinary people -- maybe far worse. Ordinary painters are only once
in a while painters.</p><p>It is said about a great Indian poet, Rabindranath, that whenever he
was in the mood to create, he would close his doors and disappear into
his room for days together -- three or four days. No food, no bath, he
would not even come out. Only when his energy had moved into creativity
and he was unburdened would he open his door and come out. And people
who saw him coming out of his room after four days of fasting and
remaining lost in his creativity, all observed that his face was no more
the same. He looked as if he had gone to some other world. He looked so
delicate, like a roseflower; he looked so beautiful, so feminine, so
graceful, so buddhalike. But only for a few hours would that fragrance
surround him, and then it would disappear. And even for months together,
the mood might not come.</p><p>Poets are only once in a while poets. And when you read a whole poem,
the whole poem is not a poem either. Only a few lines here and there are
really poetry; the other lines are just managed by the poet, they did
not descend on him.</p><p>A great poet, Coleridge, died. He left forty thousand incomplete
poems. Many times in his life he was asked, "Why don't you complete
these things? They are so tremendously beautiful, and only one line is
missing. Just complete one line and the poem will be complete."</p><p>But Coleridge always refused. He said, "I will not complete it unless
it comes from the beyond. I am not going to do it. These lines have come
from the beyond, I have just noted them down. I am not the writer, I am
not the author, I am just a steno; I have simply noted down something
that has been dictated from the beyond. And that one line is missing. I
cannot add it, because many times I have tried to add it, and I have
always failed. It looks so ugly, it looks so different, so mundane, so
mediocre. It does not have that luminosity."</p><p>When Rabindranath for the first time translated his great book
Gitanjali into English, he was a little worried as to whether the
translation had come through or not. English was not his mother tongue,
in the first place. And secondly, to translate prose is one thing, it is
easy; to translate poetry is very difficult, and more so to translate
poetry from a language like Bengali which is so poetic. The</p><p>whole language is poetic, its flavor is of poetry.</p><p>He was worried: "Has the translation come true to the spirit of my
original?" He showed it to one great Englishman, C.F. Andrews. Andrews
went through it, and at just four points he said, "Four words have to be
changed, grammatically they are wrong."</p><p>Naturally, Rabindranath changed them.</p><p>Then when he read Gitanjali and his poems for the first time in a
poets' gathering in London, he was surprised, he could not believe his
ears. One English poet, Yeats, stood up and said, "Everything is
perfectly right, but at just four points something is very mundane,
something is not poetic. The whole poetry flows beautifully, but at four
points the river comes across rocks."</p><p>With a trembling in his heart, Rabindranath asked, "What are those
four points?" And they were exactly the same as those which C.F. Andrews
had suggested. Rabindranath told him, "These are C.F. Andrews' words, he
knows English better than me."</p><p>Yeats said, "That is right -- it is better English, but not better
poetry. The grammar is right, but poetry is not grammar. The language is
right, but poetry is not only language.</p><p>Poetry is something that hovers above language and grammar. Please go
back to your old words!"</p><p>Rabindranath got his Nobel prize with this book, Gitanjali.</p><p>All poets are not always poets, all poems are not poems. Hence you
may not be able to understand what I am trying to convey to you, but
whenever a poet is a poet, he is celibate. Sexuality simply disappears,
evaporates. And whenever a poem is born in a poet he is part of God, he
is a creator. In that moment it is impossible to give any object to your
desire. Sex gives an object to your desire. Sex is not pure, cannot be,
because the object is always there.</p><p>The moment sex becomes pure, it is samadhi.</p><p>The mind and the body both are sexual. The body has come out of sex,
and the mind is always hankering for objects, hence it is sexual. But
both can be purified</p><p>through creativity.</p><p>My message, my key, my golden key to transform your energies, is
creativity. Be more and more creative, and slowly slowly you will see a
transformation happening of its own accord. Your mind will disappear,
your body will have a totally different feel to it, and constantly you
will remain aware that you are separate, that you are a pure
witness.</p><p>And that pure witness is pure desire and nothing else.</p><p>I am not against desire. I am all for desire, but I am not for
desires with objects. Let objects disappear, and then you will have a
desire like a flame without any smoke. It brings great liberation.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 2</p><p>I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY, BUT WHY DOES MY LIFE</p><p>STILL REMAIN UNCHANGED?</p><p>Sudhas, to understand something intellectually is one thing, but to
understand something intellectually is not going to transform your life.
You will remain the same. To understand something intellectually is
really to deceive yourself. You have not understood, the mind has only
pretended to have understood. This is a trick, because if you really
understand it then change is bound to happen. And the mind does not want
any change.</p><p>The mind is very traditional, conventional, conformist, orthodox. The
mind is never revolutionary; it is against all change. And the change I
am talking about is a total change.</p><p>You say, "I understand everything that you say "</p><p>You only believe that you understand. You understand the words,
naturally. My words are simple, I don't know many words. In fact, if you
count, I must be</p><p>using not more than four hundred words. But see the turnout! I am not
a man of language. You can understand what I am saying as far as words
are concerned -- but do you comprehend it? That is the question, that is
the crux of the matter. Do you comprehend what is being imparted to
you?</p><p>Sudhas, you must have a very philosophical bent of mind. Meditate
over this anecdote: A patient of his, a great philosopher in his
thirties, eagerly responded at the beginning of therapy to each
interpretation his analyst made by saying, "I hear you, I hear you."</p><p>"I'm sorry," said the doctor. "I didn't know you were a little deaf."
"I'm not. I hear you. It means I comprehend," said the philosopher.
"Well, what is it that you comprehend?"</p><p>The philosopher paused. "Jesus," he finally replied, "I don't
know."</p><p>Understanding is not the question, but comprehension. Understanding
is of the head; comprehension is something deeper, of the heart. And if
it is really total then it is even deeper, of the being.</p><p>When you understand something then you have to do something about it.
When you comprehend something you need not do anything about it; the
very comprehension is enough to change you. If you comprehend something,
it has already changed you; there is no need to do anything about your
comprehensions.</p><p>Please don't try to understand me intellectually. I am not an
intellectual, in fact I am anti-intellectual. I am not a philosopher, I
am very anti-philosophic. Try to comprehend me.</p><p>And how does one try to comprehend? How does one try to understand in
the first place?</p><p>Understanding means listening with the head, continuously
interpreting, evaluating, judging: "This is right, this is wrong. Yes,
this is true, I have read about it. This must be right, because Jesus
also said it in the same way. This is also in the Gita and in the
Vedas."</p><p>This goes on, this constant chattering inside that you call
understanding. And then out of this hotch-potch you create a hypothesis,
and you think this is what I have been telling you. Comprehension cannot
come this way; this is the way to prevent comprehension.</p><p>Listen silently with no inner chattering, with no inner talk, without
evaluating. I am not saying believe what I say, I am not saying accept
what I say. I am saying there is no need to be in a hurry to accept or
reject. First at least listen -- why be in such a hurry? When you see a
roseflower, do you accept or reject it? When you see a beautiful sunset,
do you accept or reject it? You simply see it, and in that very seeing
is a meeting.</p><p>Don't let your mind wander. Listen silently, attuned, and then
something will stir in the heart. Truth has that quality, it stirs the
heart. Truth has the quality of being self-evident, it needs no
proofs.</p><p>If what I am saying has anything of truth in it, it will be
understood by your heart. But the mind has to give way. And then you
will not need to change your life according to it, it will be changed of
its own accord.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 3</p><p>WHAT? WHAT?? WHAT???</p><p>Patren, you remind me of a story. A man was troubled for many years
with a sore arm.</p><p>He had been to many doctors and could not find out what was causing
the problem.</p><p>Finally a friend urged him to see a doctor who was famous for his
ability to diagnose illnesses. The doctor was very expensive and he had
to wait a long time for an appointment. Finally he sat waiting in the
office. The doctor walked in, handed him a jar and told him to return it
the next day with his first morning's urine. Then he promptly left the
room.</p><p>The man was infuriated! "He did not even look at me," he thought.
"And how can he tell what is wrong with my arm from my urine?"</p><p>The next morning, the man, still angry, peed in the jar. Then he had
his wife pee in it, then he had his daughter pee in it. Then as he
walked out the door he saw his dog peeing on a tree and he got some of
that also. He gave the urine to the doctor and sat there laughing to
himself.</p><p>Just then, the doctor re-entered the room and exclaimed, "Please sir,
this is no laughing matter! Your wife has been fooling around on you,
your daughter is pregnant, your dog has worms, and if you don't stop
jerking off, your arm will never get better!"</p><p>Now, Patren, you ask me, "What? What?? WHAT???"</p><p>I am not this kind of doctor, you will have to go somewhere else. The
fourth question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 4</p><p>WHY CAN'T I FEEL ANY WONDER IN EXISTENCE?</p><p>Shivananda, you are too knowledgeable, you know too much. And all
that you know is just holy cow dung -- all knowledge always is. Wisdom
is a totally different matter.</p><p>Knowledge is all rot, junk; you gather it from here and there, it is
not your own. It has no authenticity, it has not grown in your being,
you have not given birth to it.</p><p>But it gives you a very gratified ego to feel "I know." And the more
you become settled in the idea of "I know," the less and less will you
feel wonder in life. How can a man of knowledge feel wonder? Knowledge
destroys wonder. And wonder is the source of wisdom, wonder is the
source of all that is beautiful, and wonder is the source for the
search, the real search. Wonder takes you on the adventure to know the
mysteries of life.</p><p>The knowledgeable person already knows -- knows nothing, but thinks
that he already knows. He has come to a full stop. He has not reached
anywhere, he has not known anything. He is a computer, his mind is
simply programmed. Maybe he has M.A.'s, Ph.D.'s, D.Litt.'s, maybe he has
been to the biggest education centers of the world and he has
accumulated much information, but that information is destroying his
sensitivity to feel the mystery of the flowers, the birds, the trees,
the sunlight and the moon, because he knows all the answers.</p><p>How can he see any beauty in the moon? He already knows everything
about the moon.</p><p>And if you say to him, "My beloved's face looks like the full moon,"
he will laugh. He will say, "You are simply foolish. How can you compare
the moon with your beloved's face? There is no comparison possible!"</p><p>He is mathematically right, scientifically right, but poetically
wrong. And life is not only science. Just as Jesus said, "Man cannot
live by bread alone," I say to you, "Man cannot live by science alone."
A few windows are to be left open for poetic experiences, so some sun,
some wind and some rain can come from real existence.</p><p>You cannot be thrilled by life if you are too full of knowledge.</p><p>I used to go for a long walk every evening when I was in the
university. A professor used to follow me. For two or three days I
tolerated it, and then I said, "Either you stop coming, or I will have
to stop coming."</p><p>He said, "Why?"</p><p>I said, "You are destroying my whole walk." He said, "How?"</p><p>He knew too much about everything, and he would talk. "This tree
belongs to that species." Now, who bothers? The tree is beautiful; it is
dancing in the wind, the foliage is so young, so fresh. The green of it,
the red of it, the gold of it, all is so beautiful -- and he is talking
about the species. He was a very very informed man about everything. A
bird on the wind, he would immediately label it. He was a great
labeler.</p><p>I said, "Please, either you stop coming -- you are destroying my
evening walk -- or I will have to stop."</p><p>Shivananda, you must be too burdened. You are, I know you. You are
burdened with great scriptures, mountains of scriptures; nothing can
ever surprise you.</p><p>A man comes into a bar, obviously nervous and obviously in a hurry,
walks over to the counter, picks up an empty glass and starts eating it.
When he is finished he goes over to the wall, walks up the wall, walks
along the ceiling, walks down the other wall and disappears out the
door.</p><p>The barkeeper can't believe his eyes. "What the hell," he says, "is
going on here?"</p><p>A man who has been sitting on a bar stool and seen the whole thing,
says with a shrug of his shoulders, "Don't worry, I know that guy. It's
always the same thing with him --</p><p>comes and goes without even saying hello."</p><p>There are millions of people who are living like this. Miracles are
happening all around but they can't see anything, they are blind with
their knowledge.</p><p>Drop your knowledge. Knowledge is worthless, wonder is precious.
Regain the wonder that you had when you were a child -- and the kingdom
of God belongs only to those who are able to become children again.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 5</p><p>I AM IN A JAM. I LOVE THREE WOMEN. THIS IS HELL, AND THIS HAS
BEEN</p><p>GOING ON FOR THREE MONTHS. NOW WHAT TO DO?</p><p>You must be something of a man! One woman is enough. You need legal
protection. But if you have tolerated it patiently for three months,
wait a little</p><p>more. Time settles everything. And women are always more perceptive
than men</p><p>-- if you cannot do anything, they are bound to do something.</p><p>John and Mary began making love in a railway cutting. As their
lovemaking progressed, they rolled down onto the railway tracks in the
path of the oncoming express.</p><p>The driver, seeing the two bodies ahead on the line, halted the train
just in time. Now, delaying the train is a serious offense, and at the
trial the judge demanded an explanation.</p><p>"Now look, John," he said, "I am a man of the world and I can
understand you and your girlfriend having a little fun. But why didn't
you get out of the way of the train?"</p><p>"Well, it's like this, Your Honor," said John. "I was coming, the
train was coming and Mary was coming, and I thought that whoever could
stop would stop!"</p><p>Enough for today. The Book of Wisdom Chapter #16</p><p>Chapter title: The University of Inner Alchemy 26 February 1979 am in
Buddha Hall</p><p>Archive code: 7902260</p><p>ShortTitle: WISDOM16</p><p>Audio: Yes</p><p>Video: No Length:</p><p>103</p><p>mins</p><p>The first question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 1 YES AND NO!</p><p>Prem Madhu, man is a dilemma, he is both yes and no. It is not
abnormal in you, it is the normal state of humankind. Man is half earth,
half sky; part matter, part consciousness; part dust, part divine. Man
is a tension. Friedrich Nietzsche says "a rope stretched between two
infinities."</p><p>The past is that of an animal and the future is that of God. And
between the two is man --</p><p>half animal, half angel. The no comes from the past, the yes is a
possibility for the future.</p><p>Doubt comes from darkness, trust is the by-product of light. The
higher self in you is always trusting, the lower is cunning and always
doubting. And you are both, as you are now.</p><p>Man is naturally schizophrenic. Schizophrenia is not a disease; it is
not pathology, it is the state of normal human beings. It starts looking
like a pathology only when it goes to the extreme, when yes and no are
so divided that there is not even an "and" to bridge them. When they
become unbridgeable, then it becomes pathological. Otherwise every human
being is always in a kind of duality, in a state of either/or. No other
animal is in that state. Dogs are simply dogs, and lions are lions, and
trees are trees, and rocks are rocks. They don't have any duality, there
is no division.</p><p>Man is dual, double, divided. It is his misery, but it is also the
possibility for his bliss. It is his agony, but out of this agony
ecstasy can be born. No animal can be ecstatic except man. Have you seen
any animal ecstatic -- ecstasy like a buddha, a Ramakrishna? There is no
possibility of coming across an animal which is so ecstatic. Even the
rosebush with so many beautiful flowers is not ecstatic in the sense
Jesus is. The rosebush is simply a rosebush; there is no exuberance,
there is no overflowing, there is no rejoicing. It is a matter of fact
-- not that something incredible is happening, not that something from
the beyond has descended, not that God has been realized, not that light
has come and penetrated to the deepest core of your being and you are
full of it and you are enlightened.</p><p>The bird on the wing is free, but knows nothing about freedom. Only
man, even though he may be imprisoned, knows about freedom. Hence the
misery; the bondage on one hand, and the vision of freedom on the other.
The reality, the ugly reality, and the tremendously luminous
possibility.</p><p>Man can be miserable as no other animal can ever be miserable. Have
you seen any animal crying its heart out, weeping, committing suicide?
Have you seen any animal laughing, a belly laughter that shakes the very
foundations? No, all these things are possible only for man. Hence the
grandeur of man, hence his dignity, and hence his anxiety too.</p><p>The anxiety is over whether you are going to make it or not, whether
this time it is going to happen or not. The anxiety is a natural
consequence of two diametrically opposite possibilities: one can fall
into hell, and one can rise into heaven.</p><p>Man is just a ladder, and you move on this ladder like a yo-yo. One
moment you are in heaven, another moment you are in hell. One moment
suddenly the sunlit peak, another moment the darkest valley that you
have ever come across. One moment love, sharing; another moment anger,
miserliness. One moment such an expanded heart that you can contain the
whole world, and another moment you are so mean that you cannot imagine
you had this possibility to be so mean. Man goes on moving between these
two infinities continuously like a pendulum.</p><p>Prem Madhu, your question is significant, because it is everybody's
question. It is not a question, it is far more existential. It is a
problem; no answer can help, some solution has to be searched for.</p><p>Now, there are two possibilities for the solution. One is to fall
back and be satisfied with your animalness. Be satisfied -- that's what
millions are trying to do; drink, eat, sleep, and forget all about the
greater challenges of life. Eat, drink and be merry, because tomorrow we
shall be no more. That's what the materialist says.</p><p>The materialist has accepted the lower self; he denies the higher
self just in sheer self-defense. He does not deny it because he knows
that it is not; no -- he knows nothing about it. He denies it because if
he does not deny it then that either/or opens up again.</p><p>Again one is in a problem, again something has to be done, again the
at-easeness is lost.</p><p>Again the journey, the wandering, and the discomfort and the
inconvenience and the insecurity of the journey.</p><p>It is better to say that the higher does not exist, that there is no
God, that there has never been any God, that there is no soul, that
there is nothing inner, that man has no interiority, that man is just
what he is from the outside, that man is his behavior and there is no
soul in him.</p><p>From Pavlov to B.F. Skinner, this is what is being taught to the
world by the so- called scientific psychologists, the behaviorists, that
man is only behavior. There is no one inside, just as there is no one
inside a machine. The machine is just a functional unity; it has no
organic unity in it, it has no soul. You can dismantle it, you can
rearrange it again.</p><p>That's what scientists hope, that sooner or later they will be able
to dismantle man and reassemble him. At least theoretically, it seems
possible for them. It is not possible. You cannot dismantle and
reassemble man, because there is something which is nonmechanical in
man. And that nonmechanical part is his glory. But it is better to deny
it; it makes life easier, it makes life less anxious, it makes life less
of a problem. You can go on living the shallow day-to-day life of
so-called pleasures -- eat, drink and be merry.</p><p>Those who decide for that are renouncing the opportunity Atisha is
talking about. They are renouncing the opportunity to become gods. They
are settling for something very low, they are settling for something
very cheap, they are missing something very essential.</p><p>Yes, you can be at ease with the lower self, you can settle with the
doubting self. But then there is no growth. And there will be no
ecstasy, because there will never be any buddha born in you. You will
never come to know anything of christ-consciousness. You will remain in
darkness -- of course at ease, but what is the point of being at
ease?</p><p>Far more valuable is creative discontent, far more valuable is the
insecurity of the unknown, far more valuable is a homeless wandering in
search of the real home.</p><p>Religion is for those who don't accept the lower as the be all and
end all. I am not saying deny the lower, remember, because there are
foolish people who go to the other extreme.</p><p>One stupid type of people denies the higher, says it does not exist,
and settles with the lower. The other stupid kind denies the lower, says
there is no lower, there is only the higher. One says God is illusion,
the world is truth. The other says the world is illusion, God is
truth.</p><p>In my approach, both are being stupid, because both are doing the
same thing. Both want to be at ease; both are denying the polar
opposite, both are denying the possibility of any inner tension. And
remember, it is the inner tension that gives you aliveness. And the
bigger the tension, the more alive you are.</p><p>You know, you have experienced it. Everybody has experienced it, more
or less -</p><p>- the attraction of the opposite. A man is attracted to a woman, and
vice versa -- why? The negative pole of electricity is attracted towards
the positive pole, and vice versa -- why?</p><p>Why the attraction for the opposite? Because in that very attraction,
life arises. In that tension, how can you remain dead? In that very
tension you start pulsating.</p><p>Those who settle and choose one against the other become stale,
become dead. The materialist becomes superficial, and your so-called
spiritualist also becomes phony. Your so-called materialist lives with
shallow pleasures, and your so- called spiritualist lives in
imagination, in fantasy. Both are missing life and its life-giving
tensions. Man has to live with both, and in such a way that neither is
denied and yet both become complementary to each other. Yes need not be
against no; there is no necessity that the no should be against the yes.
They can</p><p>define each other, they can nourish each other.</p><p>That's my whole effort here. I bring you a new dispensation, that the
earth and the sky have to be accepted together. Body and soul, the world
and God, have to be accepted together. Nothing is wrong in the lower,
the lower has to become the base for the higher.</p><p>The lower has to function as the foundation; if you deny it you won't
have any foundation.</p><p>That's why religious countries, for example India, became poorer and
poorer and poorer.</p><p>They lost their foundations and became very phony. How can you be
true if you deny something which is all around you and so real? If you
say the world is illusion, maya, how can you be true? You know it is
not.</p><p>Even the person who says that the world is maya does not try to pass
through the wall, he goes through the door. If both are maya, illusion,
what is the difference? Can you find any difference between two
illusions? Is one a little less an illusion and the other a little more?
Even the person who says the world is illusion does not start eating
stones. What is the difference between bread and stones then? Both are
illusions, both are dreams.</p><p>But by denying the world you lose contact with the reality. That's
what happened in the East, particularly in India. India became
disoriented from reality, it lost its roots in the earth. It became
unearthly, a little ghostly. That's my experience of India -- India is a
ghost, it has lost its body. And nobody else is responsible for it. It
could not gather courage to accept the polar opposites. It became poor,
it became ugly, it became ill.</p><p>India chose this so that it could be at ease with the higher. But the
higher can exist only with the lower; this is one thing more of great
importance to be remembered. The lower can exist without the higher --
it will remain unfulfilled, but it can exist. The higher cannot even
exist without the lower.</p><p>You cannot have a building -- a temple, a church -- without the
foundations. But you can have the foundations without making the temple.
That is possible because the lower comes first and the higher comes
later. The lower can come, and the higher may not come.</p><p>The East tried the higher without the lower, the temple without the
foundations. Now, such a temple can only be in your imagination, it
cannot exist in reality. And it creates hypocrisy. The greatest
hypocrisy possible in the world has happened in India. The hypocrisy is:
we have to live in the lower because the lower is the real, and we have
to deny it and talk about the higher. And because the lower is denied,
the higher cannot have any substance; it is dream stuff. So people are
very much obsessed with money, but they talk of God; obsessed with
politics and power, and they talk of God. That remains just talk.</p><p>In the West, just the opposite has happened. The lower was accepted,
for the same reason</p><p>-- because if there is only one, you can relax. You can drop the
creative discontent if there is only one. Hence the attraction for the
one; it is an attraction towards suicide.</p><p>Think of a world where only men exist and no women. There will be no
tension, certainly. There will be great brotherhood, everybody will be
gay -- literally gay! But life will lose something, something of immense
importance -- there will be no tension. It will be like having loose
strings on a sitar; you cannot create music. You have to make them tight
and tense, only then can you strike music out of them, only then can the
hidden become manifest. With loose strings on a sitar how can you create
music? They have to be tight, in a certain tension. Only great masters
know how much tension is the right tension. And in the right tension the
greatest melody is possible.</p><p>I teach you the right tension between the lower and the higher,
between the body and the soul, between the earth and heaven; a right
tension with no antagonism. The lower has not to be denied for the
higher, neither has the higher to be denied for the lower. They are
together, they are two aspects of the same reality, they
interpenetrate.</p><p>So I don't say drop your doubt, I don't say drop your no. I say let
your no become the tension for your yes, let your no become the
background for your yes. Let your no create the context in which the yes
will be more meaningful. Only in contrast does meaning arise. You write
with white chalk on a blackboard</p><p>-- why? Because only in contrast will the white show; it will be loud
and clear. Let no become the blackboard, and yes the white writing on
it.</p><p>Your trust should not be a blind trust, your trust should be a trust
which has eyes. Your trust should not be an impotent trust, a trust
which is trust because you are impotent to say no. Your trust should be
alive, strong and vital. Your trust will be capable of saying no. Say
yes and yet retain the capacity to say no, then you will be surprised --
your yes has such sharpness, such brilliance, such intelligence! Then it
is not blind, it has eyes to see.</p><p>Use no as a foundation for yes, use doubt as manure for the rosebush.
Use everything that God has given to you. Nothing, nothing at all, has
to be denied; all has to be absorbed, because nothing is unessential or
unimportant. Even though sometimes it looks unessential and unimportant,
even though sometimes it looks positively harmful and poisonous, it has
not to be denied. It has not to be thrown out, because later on, on the
way, as you become wiser you will repent if you threw something away,
because you will need it in some situation. There are moments when
poison is needed as medicine. There are moments of wisdom when just the
touch of the wise man and the poison becomes nectar.</p><p>I want you to become alchemists. This is an alchemical school, a
university for inner alchemy. We are trying to change the baser metal
into gold. So remember, I accept your no too, I love your no too. I
accept all that you are. I accept all that you are not, even that too.
You are accepted whatsoever you are, and you are accepted whatsoever you
are not.</p><p>You are accepted in totality.</p><p>From my side there is no question of denying anything, but of
transforming it. The second question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 2</p><p>WHAT IS THE EGO? REMAINING UNENLIGHTENED, ARE WE ALWAYS</p><p>FUNCTIONING THROUGH THE EGO OR ARE THERE MOMENTS WHEN WE</p><p>ARE FREE OF IT?</p><p>Prem parijat, man has no center separate from the center of the
whole. There is only one center in existence; the ancients used to call
it Tao, dhamma, God. Those words have become old now; you can call it
truth. There is only one center of existence. There are not many
centers, otherwise the universe would not be really a universe, it would
become a multiverse. It is a unity, hence it is called the "universe";
it has only one center.</p><p>But this is to be meditated upon a little. That one center is my
center, your center, everybody's center. That one center does not mean
that you are centerless, that one center simply means that you don't
have a separate center. Let us say it in different words. You can make
many concentric circles on one center, many circles. You can throw a
pebble in a silent lake: one center arises from the fall of the pebble
and then many concentric circles arise and they go on spreading to the
farthest shore -- millions of concentric circles, but they all have one
center.</p><p>Each can claim this center as his own. And in a way it is his center,
but it is not only his.</p><p>The ego arises with the claim, "The center is mine, separate. It is
not your center, it is my center; it is me." The idea of a separate
center is the root of the ego.</p><p>When a child is born he comes without a center of his own. For nine
months in the mother's womb he functions with the mother's center as his
center; he is not separate.</p><p>Then he is born. Then it is utilitarian to think of oneself as having
a separate center; otherwise life will become very difficult, almost
impossible. To survive, and to struggle for survival in the fight of
life, everybody needs a certain idea of who they are. And nobody has any
idea. In fact nobody can ever have any idea, because at the deepest core
you are a mystery. You can't have any idea of it. At the deepest core
you are not individual, you are universal.</p><p>That's why if you ask the Buddha, "Who are you?" he remains silent,
he does not answer it. He cannot, because now he is no more separate. He
is the whole. But in ordinary life even Buddha has to use the word 'I'.
If he feels thirsty he has to say, "I am thirsty.</p><p>Ananda, bring me a little water, I am thirsty."</p><p>To be exactly right, he should say, "Ananda, bring some water. The
universal</p><p>center is a little thirsty." But that will look a little odd. And to
say it again and again -- sometimes the universal center is hungry, and
sometimes the universal center is feeling a little cold, and sometimes
the universal center is tired -- it will be unnecessary, absolutely
unnecessary. So he continues to use the old meaningful word 'I'. It is
very meaningful; even though a fiction, it is still meaningful. But many
fictions are meaningful.</p><p>For example, you have a name. That is a fiction. You came without a
name, you did not bring a name with you, the name was given to you. Then
by constant repetition you start becoming identified with it. You know
your name is Rama or Rahim or Krishna. It goes so deep that if all you
three thousand sannyasins fall asleep here and somebody comes and calls,
"Rama, where are you?" nobody will hear except Rama. Rama will say, "Who
has come to disturb my sleep?" Even in sleep he knows his name; it has
reached to the unconscious, it has seeped through and through. But it is
a fiction.</p><p>But when I say it is a fiction I don't mean it is unnecessary. It is
necessary fiction, it is useful; otherwise how are you going to address
people? If you want to write a letter to somebody, to whom are you going
to write?</p><p>A small child once wrote a letter to God. His mother was ill and his
father had died and they had no money, so he asked God for fifty
rupees.</p><p>When the letter reached the post office they were at a loss -- what
to do with it? Where to send it? It was simply addressed to God. So they
opened it. They felt very sorry for the little boy and they decided to
collect some money and send it to him. They collected some money; he had
asked for fifty rupees but they could collect only forty.</p><p>The next letter came, again addressed to God, and the boy had
written, "Dear Sir, please next time when you send the money, send it
directly to me, don't send it through the post office. They have taken
their commission -- ten rupees!"</p><p>It will be difficult if nobody has a name. Although nobody has a name
in reality, still, it is a beautiful fiction, helpful. And nobody knows
it more than I do, because I don't think anybody in the whole history of
humanity has given as many names as I have given. You can count on
me!</p><p>Names are needed for others to call you, 'I' is needed for you to
call yourself, but it is just a fiction. If you go deep into yourself
you will find the name has</p><p>disappeared, the idea of</p><p>'I' has disappeared; there is left only a pure am-ness, is-ness,
existence, being.</p><p>And that being is not separate, it is not yours and mine; that being
is the being of all.</p><p>Rocks, rivers, mountains, trees, all are included. It is
all-inclusive, it excludes nothing.</p><p>The whole past, the whole future, this immense universe, everything
is included in it. The deeper you go into yourself, the more and more
you will find that persons don't exist, that individuals don't exist.
Then what exists is a pure universalness. On the circumference we have
names, egos, identities. When we jump from the circumference towards the
center, all those identities disappear.</p><p>The ego is just a useful fiction. Use it, but don't be deceived by
it.</p><p>Parijat, you also ask, "Remaining unenlightened, are we always
functioning through the ego or are there moments when we are free of
it?"</p><p>Because it is a fiction, there are moments when you are free of it.
Because it is a fiction, it can remain there only if you go on
maintaining it. A fiction needs great maintenance.</p><p>Truth needs no maintenance, that is the beauty of truth. But a
fiction? You have constantly to paint it, to give it a prop here and
there, and it is constantly collapsing. By the time you have managed to
prop up one side, the other side starts collapsing.</p><p>And that's what people go on doing their whole life, trying to make
the fiction seem as if it is the truth. Have more money, then you can
have a bigger ego, a little more solid than the ego of the poor man. The
poor man's ego is thin; he can't afford a thicker ego.</p><p>Become the prime minister or president of a country, and your ego is
puffed up to extremes. Then you don't walk on the earth.</p><p>Our whole life, the search for money, power, prestige, this and that,
is nothing but a search for new props, a search for new supports, to
somehow keep the fiction going. And all the time you know death is
coming. Whatsoever you make, death is going to destroy it. But still one
goes on hoping against hope -- maybe everybody else dies, but not
you.</p><p>And in a way it is true. You have always seen other people dying, you
have never seen yourself dying, so it seems true also, logical also.
This person dies, that person dies, and you never die. You are always
there to feel sorry for them, you always go with them to the cemetery to
say goodbye, and then you are back home again.</p><p>Don't be deceived by it, because all those people were doing the same
thing. And nobody is an exception. Death comes and destroys the whole
fiction of your name, your fame.</p><p>Death comes and simply effaces all; not even footprints are left.
Whatsoever we go on making out of our life is nothing but writing on
water -- not even on sand, but on water.</p><p>You have not even written it, and it is gone. You cannot even read
it; before you could have read it, it is gone.</p><p>But we go on trying to make these castles in the air. Because it is a
fiction, it needs constant maintenance, constant effort, day and night.
And nobody can be so careful for twenty-four hours. So sometimes, in
spite of you, there are moments when you have a glimpse of reality
without the ego functioning as a barrier. Without the screen of the ego,
there are moments -- in spite of you, remember. Everybody once in a
while has those moments.</p><p>For example, every night when you fall deeply into sleep, and the
sleep is so deep that you cannot even dream, then the ego is no more
found; all the fictions are gone. Deep dreamless sleep is a kind of
small death. In dreams there is a possibility that you may still manage
to remember it. People go on managing to maintain their ego even in
their dreams.</p><p>That's why psychoanalysis tries to go deep into your dreams, because
there is less possibility of you maintaining your identity; more
loopholes can be found there. In the daytime you are very alert and on
guard, continuously there with a shield to protect your ego. In dreams
sometimes you forget. But the people who</p><p>have been studying dreams say that even in dreams the protection
remains; it becomes a little more subtle.</p><p>For example, you see in a dream that you have killed your uncle. If
you go deep into it you will be surprised: you wanted to kill your
father, but you killed your uncle. You deceived yourself, the ego played
a game. You are such a good guy, how can you kill your own father? And
the uncle looks like your father, although nobody really wants to kill
their uncle. Uncles are always nice people -- who wants to kill one's
uncle? And who does not want to kill one's own father?</p><p>There is bound to be great antagonism between the father and the son.
The father has to discipline the son, he has to curb and cut his freedom
and order him and force him to obey. And nobody wants to obey and be
disciplined and given shoulds and should-nots.</p><p>The father is so powerful that the son feels jealous. And the
greatest jealousy is that the son wants the mother to be completely his
own, and this father always comes in between, he is always there. And
not only does the son feel jealous of the father, the father also feels
jealous of the son because he is always there between his wife and
him.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin's son got married. He came home with his wife and
with his friends and relatives; the whole house was full. He went out
for something and when he came back he was very much taken aback -- his
father was hugging his wife and kissing her. This was too much! This is
not allowed. He was very angry and said, "What are you doing?"</p><p>The father said, "And what have you been doing your whole life? You
have been kissing and hugging my wife -- and I never said anything to
you."</p><p>He may not have said anything, but he must have felt like it. There
is an antagonism between the father and the son, between the daughter
and the mother</p><p>-- a natural antagonism, a natural jealousy. The daughter wants to
possess the father but the mother is there; she looks like the
enemy.</p><p>Uncles are very beautiful people, but in a dream you will not kill
your own father. Your moral conscience, part of your ego, will prevent
you from doing such a thing. You will find a substitute; this is a
strategy.</p><p>If you minutely observe your dreams you will find many strategies the
ego is</p><p>still trying to play. The ego cannot accept the fact: "I am killing
my own father? I am such an obedient son, respectful towards my father,
loving him so much -- and I am trying to kill my father?" The ego won't
accept the idea; the ego shifts the idea a little bit to the side.</p><p>The uncle looks almost like the father; kill the uncle, that seems
easier. The uncle is only a substitute. This is what goes on even in
dreams.</p><p>But in dreamless sleep the ego completely disappears, because when
there is no thinking, no dreaming, how can you carry a fiction? But
dreamless sleep is very small. In eight hours of healthy sleep it is not
more than two hours. But only those two hours are revitalizing. If you
have two hours of deep dreamless sleep, in the morning you are new,
fresh, alive. Life again has a thrill to it, the day seems to be a gift.
Everything seems to be new, because you are new. And everything seems to
be beautiful, because you are in a beautiful space.</p><p>What happened in these two hours when you fell into deep sleep --
what Patanjali calls sushupti, dreamless sleep? The ego disappeared. And
the disappearance of the ego has revitalized you, rejuvenated you. With
the disappearance of the ego, even though in deep unconsciousness, you
had a taste of God.</p><p>Patanjali says there is not much difference between sushupti,
dreamless sleep, and samadhi, the ultimate state of buddhahood -- not
much difference, although there is a difference. The difference is that
of consciousness. In dreamless sleep you are unconscious, in samadhi you
are conscious, but the state is the same. You move into God, you move
into the universal center. You disappear from the circumference and you
go to the center. And just that contact with the center so rejuvenates
you.</p><p>People who cannot sleep are really miserable people, very miserable
people. They have lost a natural source of being in contact with God.
They have lost a natural passage into the universal; a door has
closed.</p><p>This century is the first century which is suffering from
sleeplessness. We have closed all the other doors; now we are closing
the last door, the door of sleep. That seems to be the last
disconnection from the universal energy -- the greatest danger. And now
there are foolish people in the world who are writing books, and with
very logical acumen, saying that sleep is not needed at all, it is a</p><p>wastage of time. They are right, it is a wastage of time. For people
who think in terms of money and work, people who are workaholics, for
them it is a wastage of time.</p><p>Just as there is now Alcoholics Anonymous, soon we will need
Workaholics Anonymous.</p><p>I propose Morarji Desai's name for the president of Workaholics
Anonymous.</p><p>People who are obsessed with work, they have to be constantly on the
go. They cannot rest, they cannot relax. Even when they are dying, they
will be doing something or other.</p><p>These people are now suggesting that sleep is unnecessary. They are
suggesting that sleep is really an unnecessary hangover from the past.
They say that in the past, when there was no electricity and no fire,
out of necessity people had to sleep. Now there is no need. It is just
an old habit imbibed in millions of years; it has to be dropped. Their
idea is that in the future sleep will disappear.</p><p>And the same is happening behind the iron curtain in Russia too. They
are creating new devices so that people can be taught things while they
are asleep -- a new kind of education, so time is not wasted. It is the
last torture that we are going to invent for children. We invented the
school; we are not satisfied with that. Small children, imprisoned in
schools.…</p><p>In India, schools and prisons used to be painted the same way, the
same color. And they were the same type of building -- ugly, with no
aesthetic sense, with no trees and birds and animals around them, so
that children would not be distracted. Otherwise, who will listen to the
foolish mathematics teacher when a cuckoo suddenly starts calling from
the window? Or a deer comes into the class, and the teacher is teaching
you geography or history.… Children will be distracted, so they have to
be taken away from nature, away from society. They have to be forced to
sit on hard benches for five hours, six hours, seven hours.</p><p>This goes on for years together. Almost one third of life is spent in
schools. You have made slaves of them. In their remaining life they will
remain workaholics; they will not be able to have a real holiday.</p><p>Now these people are thinking, why waste the night time? So children
can be put into night education. They will be asleep in bed but their
ears will be connected</p><p>to a central school, and in a very very subtle subliminal way,
messages will be put into their heads.</p><p>They will be programmed.</p><p>And it has been found that they can learn more easily in this way
than they learn while they are awake. Naturally, because when you are
awake, howsoever you are protected, a thousand and one things distract
your mind. And children are so full of energy that everything attracts
them; they are continuously distracted. That is just energy, nothing
else; there is no sin in it. They are not dead, that's why they are
distracted.</p><p>A dog starts barking, somebody starts fighting outside, somebody
plays a trick on the teacher or somebody tells a joke -- and there are a
thousand and one things which go on distracting them. But when a child
is asleep -- and deeply asleep, when dreams are not there -- there is no
distraction at all. Now that dreamless sleep can be used as part of
pedagogy.</p><p>It seems we are in every way ready to disconnect ourselves from the
universal source of being. Now, these children will be the ugliest
possible, because even when there was a possibility of being lost
completely beyond the ego, that has also been taken away. The last
possibility of ego disappearance is then no longer available. When they
could have been in contact with God, they will be taught some rubbish
history. The dates when Genghis Khan was born -- who bothers, who cares?
In fact if Genghis Khan had never been born, that would have been far
better. That's what I wrote in my paper, and my teacher was very angry.
I had to stand for twenty-four hours outside the class, because I had
written, "It is unfortunate that he was born. It would have been very
fortunate if he had not been born at all."</p><p>But kings and emperors, they go on and on being born just to torture
small children; they have to remember the dates and the names for no
reason at all. A better kind of education will drop all this crap.
Ninety percent of it is crap, and the remaining ten percent can be very
much improved. And then life can have more joy, more rest, more
relaxation.</p><p>Because the ego is a fiction, it disappears sometimes. The greatest
time is dreamless sleep. So make it a point that sleep is very valuable;
don't miss it for any reason. Slowly slowly, make sleep a regular thing.
Because the body is a</p><p>mechanism, if you follow a regular pattern of sleep the body will
find it easier and the mind will find it easier to disappear.</p><p>Go to bed at exactly the same time. Don't take it literally -- if one
day you are late you will not be sent to hell or anything! I have to be
cautious, because there are a few people here who are health freaks.
Their only disease is that they are continuously thinking of health. If
they stop thinking of health they will be perfectly well. But if you can
make your sleep a regular thing, going to bed at almost the same time
and getting up at almost the same time... the body is a mechanism, the
mind is too, and it simply slips into dreamless sleep at a certain
moment.</p><p>The second greatest source of egoless experiences is sex, love. That
too has been destroyed by the priests; they have condemned it, so it is
no longer such a great experience. Such a condemnation for so long, it
has conditioned the minds of people.</p><p>Even while they are making love, they know deep down that they are
doing something wrong. Some guilt is lurking somewhere. And this is so
even for the most modern, the most contemporary, even the younger
generation.</p><p>On the surface you may have revolted against the society, on the
surface you may be a conformist no more. But things have gone very deep;
it is not a question of revolting on the surface. You can grow long
hair, that won't help much. You can become a hippy and stop taking
baths, that won't help much. You can become a dropout in every possible
way that you can imagine and think of, but that won't help really,
because things have gone too deep and all these are superficial
measures.</p><p>For thousands of years we have been told that sex is the greatest
sin. It has become part of our blood, bone and marrow. So even if you
know consciously that there is nothing wrong in it, the unconscious
keeps you a little detached, afraid, guilt-ridden, and you cannot move
into it totally.</p><p>If you can move into lovemaking totally, the ego disappears, because
at the highest peak, at the highest climax of lovemaking, you are pure
energy. The mind cannot function.</p><p>With such joy, with such an outburst of energy, the mind simply
stops. It is such an upsurge of energy that the mind is at a loss, it
does not know what to do now.</p><p>It is perfectly capable of remaining in function in normal
situations, but when anything very new and very vital happens it stops.
And sex is the most vital thing.</p><p>If you can go deeply into lovemaking, the ego disappears. That is the
beauty of lovemaking, that it is another source of a glimpse of God --
just like deep sleep but far more valuable, because in deep sleep you
will be unconscious. In lovemaking you will be conscious -- conscious
yet without the mind.</p><p>Hence the great science of Tantra became possible. Patanjali and yoga
worked on the lines of deep sleep; they chose that path to transform
deep sleep into a conscious state so you know who you are, so you know
what you are at the center.</p><p>Tantra chose lovemaking as a window towards God. The path of yoga is
very long, because to transform unconscious sleep into consciousness is
very arduous; it may take many lives. And who knows, you may or may not
be able to persist for so long, persevere for so long, be patient for so
long. So the fate that has fallen on yoga is this, that the so-called
yogis go on only doing body postures. They never go deeper than that;
that takes their whole life. Of course they get better health, a longer
life -- but that is not the point!</p><p>You can have better health by jogging, running, swimming; you can
have a longer life through medical care. That is not the point.</p><p>The point was to become conscious in deep sleep. And your so-called
yogis go on teaching you how to stand on your head and how to distort
and contort your body. Yoga has become a kind of circus -- meaningless.
It has lost its real dimension.</p><p>In the new commune, I have the vision of reviving yoga again in its
true flavor, in its true dimension. And the goal is to become conscious
while you are deeply asleep. That is the essential thing in yoga, and if
any yogi is teaching anything else it is all useless.</p><p>But Tantra has chosen a far shorter way, the shortest, and far more
pleasant too!</p><p>Lovemaking can open the window. All that is needed is to uproot the
conditionings that the priests have put into you. The priests put those
conditionings into you so that they could become mediators and agents
between</p><p>you and God, so that your direct contact was cut. Naturally you would
need somebody else to connect you, and the priest would become powerful.
And the priest has been powerful down the ages.</p><p>Whosoever can put you in contact with power, real power, will become
powerful. God is real power, the source of all power. The priest
remained down the ages so powerful --</p><p>more powerful than kings. Now the scientist has taken the place of
the priest, because now he knows how to unlock the doors of the power
hidden in nature. The priest knew how to connect you with God, the
scientist knows how to connect you with nature. But the priest has to
disconnect you first, so no individual private line remains between you
and God. He has spoiled your inner sources, poisoned them. He became
very powerful but the whole humanity became lustless, loveless, full of
guilt.</p><p>My people have to drop that guilt completely. While making love,
think of prayer, meditation, God. While making love, burn incense,
chant, sing, dance. Your bedroom should be a temple, a sacred place. And
lovemaking should not be a hurried thing. Go deeper into it; savor it as
slowly and as gracefully as possible. And you will be surprised.</p><p>You have the key.</p><p>God has not sent you into the world without keys. But those keys have
to be used, you have to put them into the lock and turn them.</p><p>Love is another phenomenon, one of the most potential, where the ego
disappears and you are conscious, fully conscious, pulsating, vibrating.
You are no more an individual, you are lost into the energy of the
whole.</p><p>Then, slowly slowly, let this become your very way of life. What
happens at the peak of love has to become your discipline -- not just an
experience but a discipline. Then whatsoever you are doing and wherever
you are walking... early in the morning with the sun rising, have the
same feeling, the same merger with existence. Lying down on the ground,
the sky full of stars, have the same merger again. Lying down on the
earth, feel one with the earth.</p><p>Slowly slowly, lovemaking should give you the clue for how to be in
love with existence itself. And then the ego is known as a fiction, is
used as a fiction. And</p><p>if you use it as a fiction, there is no danger.</p><p>There are a few other moments when the ego slips of its own accord.
In moments of great danger: you are driving, and suddenly you see an
accident is going to happen. You have lost control of the car and there
seems to be no possibility of saving yourself. You are going to crash
into the tree or into the oncoming truck, or you are going to fall in
the river, it is absolutely certain. In those moments suddenly the ego
will disappear.</p><p>That's why there is a great attraction to move into dangerous
situations. People climb Everest. It is a deep meditation, although they
may or may not understand this.</p><p>Mountaineering is of great importance. Climbing mountains is
dangerous -- the more dangerous it is, the more beautiful. You will have
glimpses, great glimpses of egolessness. Whenever danger is very close,
the mind stops. Mind can think only when you are not in danger; it has
nothing to say in danger. Danger makes you spontaneous, and in that
spontaneity you suddenly know that you are not the ego.</p><p>Or -- these will be for different people, because people are
different -- if you have an aesthetic heart, then beauty will open the
doors. Just seeing a beautiful woman or a man passing by, just for a
single moment a flash of beauty, and suddenly the ego disappears.</p><p>You are overwhelmed.</p><p>Or seeing a lotus in the pond, or seeing the sunset or a bird on the
wing -- anything that triggers your inner sensitivity, anything that
possesses you for the moment so deeply that you forget yourself, that
you are and yet you are not, that you abandon yourself -- then too, the
ego slips. It is a fiction; you have to carry it. If you forget it for a
moment, it slips.</p><p>And it is good that there are a few moments when it slips and you
have a glimpse of the true and the real. It is because of these glimpses
that religion has not died. It is not because of the priests -- they
have done everything to kill it. It is not because of the so-called
religious, those who go to the church and the mosque and the temple.
They are not religious at all, they are pretenders.</p><p>Religion has not died because of these few moments which happen more
or less</p><p>to almost everybody. Take more note of them, imbibe the spirit of
those moments more, allow those moments more, create spaces for those
moments to happen more. This is the true way to seek God. Not to be in
the ego is to be in God.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 3</p><p>WHY DO YOU EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HERENOW SO MUCH?</p><p>Rahim, because there is nothing else. Here is the only space, now is
the only time.</p><p>Beyond the herenow, there is nothing. Two thousand years ago, a great
Jewish master, Hillel, wrote a little poem in Aramaic. The poem is
this:</p><p>"If I'm not for myself, Then who can be for me? And if I'm only for
myself, Then what am I?</p><p>And if not now, When?"</p><p>It is a beautiful statement: if not now, then when? Tomorrow? But the
tomorrow never comes.</p><p>Hence I emphasize the herenow. Don't let this moment slip by unused,
unlived, unpenetrated; squeeze all that you can out of it. Live it
passionately and with intensity, so you need not repent later on that
you missed your life.</p><p>It was after the Second World War; the war had ended. Joe Dink was
still in Japan waiting to be discharged. His wife, Irma Dink, was wild
with anxiety and</p><p>jealousy because she read about the goings on between the American
soldiers and the Japanese girls.</p><p>Finally she could stand it no longer, and she wrote her husband,
"Joe, hurry up and come back. What do those girls have, anyway, that the
American girls don't?"</p><p>"Not a thing," wrote back Joe. "But what they've got, they've got
here." And that is the most important thing. The question is of here and
now. And the last question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, WHAT IS A MIRACLE?</p><p>Sadhananda, it depends. To me, everything is a miracle. I never come
across anything that is not a miracle; only miracles exist. Everything
is such a surprise, it is so unbelievable! But if your eyes are closed,
if your eyes are full of dust, if your mind is too knowledgeable, if you
think you know all, then nothing is a miracle.</p><p>To know "I don't know anything" makes everything a miracle. It
depends on your inner state, it depends on you. And to live a life
without miracles is not to live at all. You can have a million miracles
every day, you are entitled to have them. But because you don't know how
to connect yourself with the miraculous, you are being cheated by stupid
people.</p><p>Somebody produces a Swiss-made watch and you think this is a miracle.
Then you become victims of ordinary magicians. Don't be befooled.</p><p>The seed sprouting into leaves is a miracle -- not somebody producing
a Swiss- made watch out of nothing. That is just a trick, a very
ordinary trick; street magicians are doing it all over the world. They
are just simple people, not cunning people, otherwise you would have
worshipped them.</p><p>While exploring the wilds of South America, a man was captured by
savages. They were dancing excitedly around before killing him when the
explorer had a bright idea. He would baffle them with magic. Taking a
cigarette-lighter from his</p><p>pocket, he shouted, "I make fire!"</p><p>With a flick of the thumb, the lighter burst into flame. The savages
fell back and gazed in wonder.</p><p>"Magic!" cried the explorer.</p><p>"It certainly is," said the chief. "It's the only time I ever saw a
lighter work on the first try."</p><p>It depends on you, what you call a miracle. As far as I am concerned,
there is nothing else except miracles. And drop these stupid kinds of
miracles.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin and his wife are sitting one Sunday listening to the
radio, when this faith healer comes on and he says, "If you have a part
of your body you want healed, place one hand on the radio and the other
hand on the afflicted part."</p><p>The wife placed one hand on the radio and the other on her heart. The
Mulla placed one hand on the radio and the other on his appendage.</p><p>So the wife said, "Mulla, he's trying to cure the sick, not raise the
dead." Enough for today.</p><p>The Book of Wisdom Chapter #17</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

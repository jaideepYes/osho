FIRST, LEARN THE PRELIMINARIES.
THINK THAT ALL PHENOMENA ARE LIKE DREAMS. EXAMINE THE NATURE OF UNBORN AWARENESS.
LET EVEN THE REMEDY ITSELF GO FREE ON ITS OWN. SETTLE IN THE NATURE OF BASIC COGNITION, THE ESSENCE. BETWEEN SESSIONS, CONSIDER PHENOMENA AS PHANTOMS.</description>

The first question:
BELOVED OSHO,
Question 1
WHAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT MISSING?

BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAKING WITH YOURSELF.
WHEN EVIL FILLS THE INANIMATE AND ANIMATE UNIVERSES CHANGE
BAD CONDITIONS TO THE BODHI PATH. DRIVE ALL BLAME INTO ONE.
BE GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE.

DEEPLY AND PERVASIVELY IN EVERYTHING. ALWAYS MEDITATE ON SPECIFIC OBJECTS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE NO CONCERN FOR OTHER FACTORS. THEREFORE, APPLY YOURSELF TO IMPORTANT MATTERS. DON&#39;T DO THINGS BACKWARDS.</description>

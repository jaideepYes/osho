Question 1
WHAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT MISSING?
Devaraj, it has a tremendous attraction, because it is only through missing that the ego can survive.

It is only through searching, seeking, desiring, that the ego exists; it exists in the tension between that which is and that which should be.\nThe moment the \"should\" disappears, the ego collapses. Hence all ethical\nsystems, all moralities, are nourishments for the ego. The moral man is the most egoistic man in the world. And the mechanism is very simple. Seeking, searching, you live in the future, which is not; and the ego can exist only with that which is not, because it itself is not.\nIf you are in the moment, in the present, the ego has no possibility of surviving even for a single moment. The present is and the ego is not, like light is and darkness is not. Bring light in, and darkness disappears. Even to say that it disappears is not right, because it was not there in the first place, so how can it disappear? It was a pure absence. The absence of light, that's what darkness is.\nThe absence of the present, that's what the ego is. Not to be herenow, that's what the ego is -- not to be herenow, to be somewhere else, seeking and searching for a faraway goal, looking at a faraway distant star. The farther away the goal, the bigger the ego.\nHence people who are not worldly have bigger egos than the so-called poor worldly people. Spiritual people have bigger egos, naturally; their goal is very far away, distant, beyond death, above the seven skies. God is their goal, or moksha or nirvana -- goals which look almost impossible.\nThe possible goal can give you only a small ego, and that too only for the time being.\nOnce the goal is achieved you will start feeling frustrated. That's what happens every day.\nYou wanted a beautiful house, now you have got it, and suddenly frustration sets in. The ego needs a new goal to survive; now it starts fantasizing about a bigger palace.\nYou were seeking and searching for a woman; now you have got her, and the moment you have got her you are finished with her. It may take a few days for you to recognize the fact, that is another matter, but you are finished with her. Now your ego needs another woman so that the journey can continue.\nThe ego is constantly journeying from the present to some nonexistential future. If you ask me, this is my definition of samsara, the world. The ego journeying from the present to the future is the world. And the ego not journeying at all, simply being herenow, is the end of samsara: you are in nirvana, samadhi,\nenlightenment. Hence enlightenment cannot be reduced to a goal. If you reduce it to a goal, you have missed the whole point.\nAll the buddhas of all the ages have been telling you a very simple fact: Be -- don't try to become. Within these two words, be and becoming, your whole life is contained. Being is enlightenment, becoming is ignorance. But you have been taught to become this, to become that. And the mind is so cunning, and the ways of the ego are so subtle that it even turns God, nirvana, enlightenment, truth, into goals; it starts asking how to achieve them. They are not to be achieved, they cannot be achieved; the achieving mind is the only barrier. They are already here. You have to drop the achieving mind, you have to forget journeying from this point to that, you simply have to relax and be, and all is attained.\nLao Tzu calls it wu-wei, action without action. You have not moved a single inch, and you have arrived; this is wu-wei. You have not gone anywhere, you have not even thought of going anywhere, and you are already there. Suddenly the recognition comes,\n\"I never lost the home, I only fell asleep and started dreaming about achieving.\"\nThose who give you goals are your enemies. Those who tell you what to become and how to become it, are the poisoners. The real master simply says, \"There is nothing to become. You are already that, it is already the case. Stop running after shadows. Sit silently and BE. Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself.\nThe second question:\nOSHO,\nQuestion 2\nBECAUSE I AM ONLY A BEGINNER IN THE SEARCH FOR REALITY, COULD\nYOU DEFINE FOR ME THE FOUR TERMS: TRUTH, GOD, SPIRITUAL, FACT.\nKen Jones, if you are only a beginner in the search, please come back, don't go ahead.\nDon't become more of an expert in the spiritual search, because the experts are the losers.\nDon't become more knowledgeable, become more innocent. Drop all that you know, forget all that you know. Remain wondering, but don't transform your wondering into questions, because once the wonder is changed into a question, sooner or later the question will bring knowledge. And knowledge is a false coin.\nFrom the state of wonder, there are two paths. One is of questioning -- the wrong path --\nit leads you into more and more knowledge. The other is not of questioning but enjoying.\nEnjoy the wonder, the wonder that life is, the wonder that existence is, the wonder of the sun and the sunlight and the trees bathed in its golden rays. Experience it. Don't put in a question mark, let it be as it is.\nRemain ignorant if you ever want to become enlightened. Remain innocent, childlike, if you ever want a communion with existence and reality. Remain in wonder if you want the mysteries to open up for you. Mysteries never open up for those who go on questioning. Questioners sooner or later end up in a library. Questioners sooner or later end up with scriptures, because scriptures are full of answers.\nAnd answers are dangerous, they kill your wonder. They are dangerous because they give you the feeling that you know, although you know not. They give you this misconception about yourself that now questions have been solved. \"I know what The Bible says, I know what the Koran says, I know what the Gita says. I have arrived.\" You will become a parrot; you will repeat things but you will not know anything. This is not the way to know -- knowledge is not the way to know.\nThen what is the way to know? Wonder. Let your heart dance with wonder. Be full of wonder: throb with it, breathe it in, breathe it out. Why be in such a hurry for the answer?\nCan't you allow a mystery to remain a mystery? I know there is a great temptation not to allow it to remain a mystery, to reduce it to knowledge. Why is\nthis temptation there? --\nbecause only if you are full of knowledge will you be in control.\nMystery will control you, knowledge will make you the controller. Mystery will possess you. You cannot possess the mysterious; it is so vast and your hands are so small. It is so infinite, you cannot possess it, you will have to be possessed by it -- and that is the fear.\nKnowledge you can possess, it is so trivial; knowledge you can control.\nThis temptation of the mind to reduce every wonder, every mystery, to a question, is basically fear-oriented. We are afraid, afraid of the tremendousness of life, of this incredible existence. We are afraid. Out of fear we create some small knowledge around ourselves as a protection, as an armor, as a defense.\nIt is only cowards who reduce the tremendously valuable capacity of wondering to questions. The really brave, the courageous person, leaves it as it is. Rather than changing it into a question, he jumps into the mystery. Rather than trying to control it, he allows the mystery to possess him.\nAnd the joy of being possessed, and the benediction of being possessed, is invaluable.\nYou cannot imagine what it is, you have never dreamt about it -- because to be possessed by the mystery is to be possessed by God.\nKen Jones, you say: \"Because I am only a beginner \"\nYou are fortunate that you are only a beginner. There are many who have become experts; they will have to come back home, and it is going to be a long long arduous journey. They have accumulated so much knowledge that dropping it is going to be a difficult task. If you are really a beginner, be happy. You have not gone far away, you are just beginning. Come back.\nThere is no need to define these beautiful words, because they are not only words. You want me to define truth. Do you know, has anybody ever defined truth? Is it definable at all? What is a definition? A definition means a tautology\n-- you put the same words in a different way. What are your definitions, in fact? Synonyms.\nJust look at your definitions and you will find you have been paraphrasing. But how can paraphrasing define anything? The second thing that you think is the definition, in its own turn needs another definition. Definitions are either tautologies or just stupid.\nFor example, ask what the mind is and the knowers, the knowledgeable, say, \"It is not matter.\" And then ask them, \"What is matter?\" And they say, \"It is not mind.\" What kind of defining is going on? Mind is not matter; this becomes a definition. Matter is not mind; this becomes a definition. Both remain indefinable; you have not defined anything, you have simply shifted the problem from one place to another.\nYou can befool only fools.\nAnd the truth means the whole, all that is, the total. All that is -- how can you define it? It is unbounded, infinite. Definition means drawing a line around it, locating it, saying,\n\"This is it.\" But there is no way to define truth, because there is no way to draw a line around it. It is infinite, it is eternal, it has no beginning, no end.\nPeople who have tried to define truth say, \"Truth is that which is.\" But that is tautology.\nThe question remains the same, the mystery remains unsolved. \"Truth is that which is\" --\nwhat have you added? Have you made it a little simpler than before? You can call it \"that which is\" or you can call it truth, or you can call it God, but you are simply using names, words, labels, for something which is basically indefinable.\nTruth cannot be defined, although it can certainly be experienced. But experience is not a definition. A definition is made by the mind, experience comes through participating. If somebody asks, \"What is a dance?\" how can you define it? But you can dance and you can know the inner feel of it.\nGod is the ultimate dance. You will have to learn ecstatic dancing to experience God.\nGod is the dance where the dancer disappears. Then the experience arrives,\nshowers on you, and you KNOW. But that knowing is not knowledge, that knowing is wisdom.\nTruth cannot be defined. Lao Tzu says if you define it you have already made it untrue.\nHe lived a long life; it must have been really long because the story is that for eighty-two years he lived in his mother's womb, so when he was born he was already eighty-two years old. Then if he lived for at least eighty-two more years, he must have lived very long. But he never wrote a single word.\nHis whole life his disciples were again and again asking, requesting, \"Write something.\nYou are getting older and older and older, and one day you will have to leave the body.\nLeave your last testament.\" But he would laugh and not say a thing, or he would keep silent as if he had not heard.\nThen when he became very old, he started moving towards the Himalayas. He said to his disciples, \"Now I am going to the Himalayas, never to return again. My whole life I have been a wanderer, and the Himalayas are the best place to die. I lived beautifully, I lived the most ecstatic life possible. I would also like to die most ecstatically, most aesthetically. I would like to die in the silence of the Himalayas, in those beautiful mountains.\"\nWhen he was leaving the border of China, the guard at the border prevented him. He said,\n\"I won't allow you to leave the country unless you write something.\" He must have been a very perceptive man, the guard. The world is in his debt for one of the greatest things that has ever been written -- the Tao Te Ching. There is no other book comparable to it.\nFinding no way to avoid it, because the guard wouldn't allow him to go and he wanted to leave the country as fast, as quickly, as possible -- death was coming closer and he wanted to die in the silence of the Himalayas -- compelled to write, he sat in the guard's room for three days and completed the book, Tao Te Ching.\nBut the first thing that he wrote was, \"Tao cannot be said. Once said, it is no more Tao.\"\nYou can understand what he means. He is saying that if you read the first statement, there is no need to go any further. \"Truth cannot be said. Once said, it is no more true\" -- this is his declaration. Now, if you understand, the book is finished. What can be said about the truth? Yes, it can be lived, experienced. You can love, live, be -- but definition is not possible. If you want definitions you will have to go to a university. Professors define what truth is, and each professor of philosophy defines it in his own way, and there are millions of definitions, and all are false. No definition can ever be true.\nWhat to say about truth -- even the small experiences of life cannot be defined. What is love? Or what is the taste of sugar on your tongue? How to define it? What is beauty when you see it in a lotus flower?\nOne of the greatest modern philosophers, G.E. Moore, has written a book, Principia Ethica, in which he tries to define what good is. Of course, that is the first question in the world of ethics: what is good? And for two hundred or two hundred and fifty pages, he tries hard this way and that, and cannot define it. And he was one of the most perceptive people this century has produced.\nDefeated, tired, exhausted, in the end he says good is indefinable. It is as indefinable as the color yellow. If somebody asks, \"What is yellow?\" -- there is a marigold flower, and somebody asks, \"You call it yellow? What is yellow?\" -- how are you going to define it?\nWhat more can you say? Yellow is yellow, good is good, beauty is beauty. But these are tautologies; you are not defining anything, you are simply repeating words.\nWhat is truth? There is no way to define it.\nI am not teaching philosophy to you, I am sharing my truth with you. Don't ask for definitions. If you have the courage, then take a plunge into the experience that is made available here: take a jump into meditation, and you will know. And still, even when you know, you will not be able to define it.\nAnd you ask, \"What is God?\"\nThat is another name for truth -- the lover's name. \"Truth\" is the name given by the meditator to totality. \"God\" is the name given to totality, to truth, by a lover, by a devotee. Both arrows point to the same phenomenon, but the lover can't think in terms of abstract words. \"Truth\" is very abstract: you cannot hug truth, can you? You cannot kiss truth -- or can you? You cannot say hello to truth, you cannot hold hands with truth.\n\"Truth\" is impersonal; it is the word given by the meditator who does not want to bring any personality into it.\n\"God\" is the name given out of love, out of a personal relationship with existence. The lover wants to say \"Thou,\" the lover wants to say \"Hi,\" the lover wants to have a communion, a dialogue. It is the same totality, but the lover makes it personal. Then truth becomes God.\nAnd you ask, \"What is spiritual?\"\nTo be in relationship with truth or God is to be spiritual. Remember, to be in relationship\n-- not to talk about spirituality, not to follow a certain creed, dogma, church, but to be in direct immediate relationship with existence is spirituality. To be in tune with the whole, to feel the harmony and the joy and the sheer celebration of being here, that is spirituality.\nIt has nothing to do with going to the church or the temple, it has nothing to do with reciting the Koran or The Bible or the Gita. It has nothing to do with any kind of worship ritual, it has something to do with communion -- communion with the trees, communion with the stars, communion with the rivers, communion with all that is. It is communion with this multidimensional expression of God, it is having a dialogue with the whole. The quality of mad love is needed, then you are spiritual. Spirituality is not a head trip; it is a heart- to-heart dialogue, and ultimately a being-to-being dialogue.\nAnd fourth, you ask, \"What is a fact?\"\nA fact is the truth seen with unawareness, seen with blindness, seen with closed eyes, seen unintelligently, unmeditatively. Then the truth becomes a fact.\nFor example, you come across a buddha. If you look at him unconsciously he is\njust a fact, a historical fact; he is born on a certain day and is going to die on a certain day. He is the body that you can see with your eyes; he is a certain person, a personality. History can take note of him, you can have a picture of him.\nBut if you look, not with unconsciousness but with great consciousness, with awareness, with great light, silence, then the fact is no longer there -- there is truth. Then Buddha is not somebody who is born on a certain date, he is somebody who is never born and is never going to die. Then Buddha is not the body, the body is just an abode. Then Buddha is not the confined being that appears to you, he represents the total, the whole. Then Buddha is a ray of the infinite, a gift of the beyond to the earth. Then suddenly the fact has disappeared; now there is truth.\nBut history can take no note of truth; history consists of facts. In India we have two different systems. One we call history; history takes note of the facts. Another we call purana, mythology; it takes note of the truth. We have not written histories about Buddha, Mahavira or Krishna, no. That would have been dragging something immensely beautiful into the muddy unconsciousness of humanity. We have not written histories about these people, we have written myths. What is a myth? A myth is a parable, a parable that only points to the moon but says nothing about it -- a finger pointing to the moon, an indication, an arrow, saying nothing.\nGo to a Jaina temple and you will be surprised. You will find twenty-four statues of twenty-four great enlightened masters, the twenty-four TIRTHANKARAS. And the most striking thing will be this, that they all look absolutely alike. This is impossible -- there are not even two persons absolutely alike in the world, not even twins are absolutely alike. So how was it possible -- and the time span is big, thousands of years -- for twenty-four tirthankaras to be exactly alike?\nThis is not history. These statues don't depict the real persons, no, not at all. They are not pictorial representations. Then what are they? They represent something of the inner, they represent something of meditativeness, they represent something of inner stillness, something of the being. Those twenty- four statues are just representations, visible representations, of something which is invisible.\nSitting before these statues, if you silently go on watching, you will be surprised.\nSomething starts happening inside you. The statue is a form of objective art; it synchronizes with the inner form of your being. The posture of the statue synchronizes with your posture. If you sit in the same posture -- with erect spine, half-opened eyes, just looking at the tip of your nose, doing nothing, as if you are also a marble statue, all white, within and without -- then you will know that you are not facing ordinary statues, you are confronting great symbols. This is mythology.\nMythology is bound to be poetic, because only poetry can give a few glimpses of the unknown.\nIt is said that wherever Buddha moved, trees would start blooming out of season. Now, this is poetry, pure poetry; it did not happen as a fact. But this shows something; there is no other way to say it. It says whenever Buddha is contacted, even trees start blooming out of season -- so what to say about man?\nIt is said that wherever Mohammed would move in the desert's hot sun, and there was fire everywhere, a small cloud, a white cloud, would go on moving above him just to give him shade like an umbrella. This is poetry, beautiful, but it is not a historical fact. A man like Mohammed is protected by existence, a man like Mohammed is in every way cared for by existence. One who has surrendered to existence is bound to be cared for by existence. One who has trusted totally, how can existence be uncaring about him? To say this, there is this metaphor of the cloud just hanging over his head wherever he would go.\nJesus dies on the cross, and then after three days is resurrected. This is poetry, not history.\nThis is not fact, this is truth. It simply says that those who die in God and for God attain to eternal life. Those who are ready to die for God are resurrected on another plane of being; they lose the physical body but they gain the luminous body. They are no more part of the earth but they become part of the sky; they disappear from time but they appear in eternity.\nBut all the religions have been trying to prove that these are facts. And in trying to prove that these are facts they have simply proved that they are fools. These are not facts, these are symbolic truths.\nWhatsoever you see around you is a fact. You see a tree, a green tree, full of sap and flowers -- it is a fact. But if you meditate and one day suddenly your eyes\nopen, open to the real, and the tree is no more just a tree -- the green of it is nothing but God green in it, and the sap running through it is no more a physical phenomenon but something spiritual\n-- if one day you can see the being of the tree, the God of the tree, that the tree is only a manifestation of the divine, you have seen the truth.\nTruth needs meditative eyes. If you don't have meditative eyes, then the whole of life is just dull dead facts, unrelated to each other, accidental, meaningless, a jumble, just a chance phenomenon. If you see the truth, everything falls into line, everything falls together in a harmony, everything starts having significance.\nRemember always, significance is the shadow of truth. And those who live only in facts live an utterly meaningless life.\nThe third question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 3\nYOU HAVE SAID THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS ALWAYS TOTAL, NEVER PARTIAL. STILL YOU COMPARE YOUR STATE OF NO-MIND WITH AN\nORCHESTRA WHILE THAT OF KRISHNAMURTI IS COMPARED WITH THAT\nOF A SINGLE FLUTE PLAYER. HAS NOT THE ENLIGHTENED ONE ACCESS TO\nALL KNOWLEDGE? WHY THAT TUNNEL VISION OF KRISHNAMURTI?\nHenk Faassen, enlightenment is always total. If it is an orchestra it is a total orchestra, if it is only a solo flute then it is an absolutely total solo flute. Existence is always total, so is enlightenment always total. The small flower is as total as the sun. Totality is a totally different phenomenon than quantity; it is concerned with quality.\nKrishnamurti's solo flute is as total as my orchestra, my orchestra is not more\ntotal.\nTotality cannot be more or less. You think in terms of quantity, that's why the question has arisen. I am talking about quality. Each act of the enlightened person is total. Whether he is drinking tea or painting a great painting, playing music or just sitting silently doing nothing, each act is total. Krishnamurti is a solo flute player -- and a few solo flute players are needed as much as orchestras are needed. They enhance the beauty of existence, they make life richer.\nDrop your mind that goes on comparing in terms of quantity. Raise your level of consciousness a little higher and start thinking of quality, and then there is no problem.\nKrishnamurti is doing what he can do best. I would not like him to become an orchestra, no. That would impoverish the world. He should go on doing what he is doing; that gives color to life, variety.\nI cannot become a solo flute player -- not that it is not beautiful, but it is simply not my way. I enjoy being an orchestra. I would like Atisha to play with me, and Bahauddin and Kabir and Nanak and Lao Tzu and Zarathustra and many many more. I would like to play with them all and become part of this orchestra.\nThis is my way. There is nothing higher or lower. Once you are enlightened, there is nothing higher or lower; there cannot be. If a lotus flower becomes enlightened it will be a lotus flower. If a rose becomes enlightened it will be a rose. They both have the same quality of being enlightened, but the rose will remain a rose and the lotus will remain a lotus.\nYou ask me, \"You have said that enlightenment is always total, never partial.\"\nYes, it is never partial. And Krishnamurti is not a partial flute player. He is a total flute player; he is totally in his act, utterly in his act. He says he is fortunate that he has not read the Vedas, The Bible, the Koran, the Upanishads, Tao Te Ching. Why? -- because they might have disturbed him, might have left a few traces behind, might have become part of his being. He wants to be simply himself, in utter purity.\nMy approach is totally different. I would like to have as big a company of enlightened people with me as possible. It is a difficult company, because they are all such different people; to become a host to all of them is troublesome. But\nI enjoy it. The more troublesome it is, the more I enjoy it. It is a beautiful challenge. You cannot understand how difficult it is to have Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed and Moses staying together with you. Mahavira stands naked, and Buddha does not like it at all. And because Buddha is not naked, Mahavira is not happy either. To have all these people stay with you is a great challenge.\nKrishnamurti lives alone. It has its own challenge, but that is not my choice. I am not saying that my choice has to be his choice, I am not saying that he has to do what I am doing. I am perfectly happy doing my thing, and I am perfectly happy that he is doing his thing.\nMany people have asked me questions saying that I have spoken on dead masters, so many, but why don't I sometimes speak on a living master?\nLet Krishnamurti die, then I will speak on him. There is a reason for it. I know how difficult it is even to keep so many dead masters together, but you can manage with dead masters -- if I tell Mahavira to stand in this corner, he has to stand in this corner. But a living master won't listen; he will start meddling, he will start arguing with others. And sometimes I need a little sleep too.\nYou say, \"Has not the enlightened one access to all knowledge?\"\nEnlightenment has nothing to do with knowledge at all. The enlightened one has no access to knowledge. Yes, he has every access to innocence -- and Krishnamurti playing his flute is as innocent as I am with my orchestra. It is not a question of knowledge, it is a question of wisdom. Wisdom is a totally different phenomenon -- wisdom is innocence.\nYou can even call it ignorance, that will do, but please don't call it knowledge. It is closer to ignorance than to knowledge.\nSocrates is reported to have said in his last days, \"I know only one thing, that I know nothing.\" This is enlightenment, knowing only one thing, \"I know nothing.\" The moment all knowledge disappears, the ego disappears, the personality disappears, then the separation between you and existence disappears. Again you are clean, pure, one with the whole.\nAnd you also ask, \"Why that tunnel vision of Krishnamurti?\"\nThat you have to ask Krishnamurti, not me. That is not my business. He loves it,\nthat's how he has grown. For centuries, for many many lives, he has been moving towards a tunnel vision. And the tunnel vision has its own beauties, because whatsoever you see, you see very clearly because your eyes are focused.\nHence the clarity of Krishnamurti. Nobody has ever been so clear, so crystal clear.\nNobody has ever been so logical, so rational; nobody has ever been so analytical. His profundity in going into things and their details is simply unbelievable. But that is part of his tunnel vision. You cannot have everything, remember. If you want clarity you will need tunnel vision; you will have to become more and more focused on less and less.\nThat's how they define science: \"Knowing more and more about less and less.\" And if science ever succeeds in its ultimate goal, then we will have to say, \"Knowing everything about nothing.\" That can be the only logical conclusion of knowing more and more about less and less. Where will it lead? It will lead to a point where you know all about nothing.\nScience is a tunnel vision. Krishnamurti is a scientific individuality, very scientific.\nHence his appeal for all those who love analysis, dissection, who love going into minute details. He is just the opposite of Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu says, \"Everybody seems to be so clear; only I am confused.\"\nA man of the quality of Lao Tzu, a man of ultimate enlightenment, saying this:\n\"Everybody seems to be so clear about everything, except me. I am so confused, I am so muddle-headed, that I don't know what is what. Everybody walks with such certainty, and I hesitate at each step. Everybody goes so straight, without looking sideways. And I walk like a man in winter crossing a cold, icy cold stream.\"\nLao Tzu is just the opposite of J. Krishnamurti. He has no tunnel vision. His vision is so wide, so spread out, it cannot be very clear. It is bound to be hazy, misty, but that too has its own beauty. Krishnamurti's statements have logic. Lao Tzu's statements have poetry.\nMy vision is even wider than Lao Tzu's. I include Lao Tzu and many more.\nObviously Lao Tzu could not have included me. Twenty-five centuries have passed; in those twenty-five centuries great enlightened people have happened on the earth. I claim the whole heritage, as nobody has ever claimed before.\nLao Tzu had never heard about Krishna, Lao Tzu had never heard about Patanjali.\nPatanjali had never heard about Lao Tzu or Chuang Tzu or Lieh Tzu. Buddha had no awareness of Zarathustra or Moses.\nNow the world has become a small village, a global village, and the whole history of humanity is ours. I am in a totally different situation. I know everything about Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Confucius, Mencius, Milarepa, Marpa, Tilopa, Naropa, Bodhidharma, Mahakashyap, Sariputra, Mahavira, Adinatha, Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Francis, Kabir, Nanak, Dadu, Meera, Rabiya -- all. The whole world is available to me.\nI see the whole sky, all the stars, all the constellations; my vision is bound to be the most poetic. But the deeper you go into poetry, the less and less logical it becomes. The deeper you go into poetry, it becomes more and more love-like and less and less like logic. At the very rock bottom of poetry, all clarity disappears. Nothing is clear, but everything is beautiful, everything is mysterious. Nothing is clear but everything is simply fantastic.\nKrishnamurti has his way, and I am happy that he is in the world. He is at the other extreme. If he is gone, I will miss him more than anybody else in the world.\nBut I can understand your question, Henk Faassen. This is not the only question; you have asked many more about the same thing. It seems it has hurt you deeply that I criticized Krishnamurti. You don't understand me yet. This is my way of paying respects to him. This is my way of declaring that there exists another enlightened person in the world.\nIf my orchestra does not suit you, then the only alternative possible is the solo flute-playing of J. Krishnamurti. There is no other, no third person who can be of any help to you. Either Krishnamurti or me -- there is no other alternative. Right now there is no other alternative.\nKrishnamurti is bound to criticize me; I can understand it. His standpoint is\nsimple and clear, my standpoint is a little more unclear. Sometimes I will appreciate him tremendously, because I would like him to also become part of my orchestra. And sometimes I will criticize him, because my own liking is not for solo flutes.\nThe last question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 4\nI FEEL YOU SHARE A LOT OF ESOTERIC POINTS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE\nNO WAY OF VALIDATING WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHAT IS THE\nIMPORTANCE OF HEARING ABOUT THE SIXTH OR THE SIXTEENTH JAINA TIRTHANKARA, OR OTHER ESOTERIC INFORMATION, TO THE PERSON IN\nOSHKOSH OR BROOKLYN GOING TO WORK ON THE CROWDED BUS OR\nSUBWAY EVERY DAY? WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF HEARING THAT JESUS\nWAS ONCE IN INDIA OR THAT A ROSICRUCIAN SECT OF SPIRITS WORKING\nFROM THE OTHER SIDE POSSESSED HITLER?\nDavid Light, fools are everywhere -- as much in Oshkosh and Brooklyn as they are in Bombay and Poona. No country has any claim on fools. And fools are always searching for something esoteric -- only nonsense appeals to them. And sometimes I talk nonsense, because I am not here only to help those who are not fools. I am also throwing my net wider and wider; some fools have to be caught by me too. They are good people!\nNow just look, David Light, from where have you come? How were you caught? Those stupid theories about the sixth or sixteenth tirthankaras, or the Rosicrucian\nsecret masters, Koothumi, K.H., directing Adolf Hitler and the whole Nazi movement.…\nThere is a deep urge in man to know things which are worthless, to know things which make you feel special -- because only you know those things and nobody else does. Man wants to be special, and nothing makes you more special than so- called esoteric knowledge. That is why esoteric knowledge remains important. All kinds of rubbish go on in the name of esoteric knowledge -- that the earth is hollow, that inside the earth there are great civilizations. And there are people who still believe in it, and in many more such stories.\nMan lives such a dull and drab life that he wants some sensation. Those who are a little wiser, they read scientific fiction or detective stories. Those who are not so wise, they read spiritual fiction.\nAnd these things were said by me when I was surrounded by a certain group of fools.\nThey were not interested in anything else. And I have to respond to you; as you grow, my responses will be higher and higher. The day you have understood the whole stupidity of the human mind I will not need to talk to you; just sitting silently will be more than enough.\nThese things were told by me to a certain group of people who were only interested in those things. It would have been absolutely pointless to talk about anything else with those people. Now that they have almost disappeared, and now that a totally different quality has come here, I can go more into the world of the truth. But still I have to use words, and words distort.\nOnly silence communicates the truth as it is. Please get ready as soon as possible, so that we can just be together, merging into each other's energies, being lost in each other. And miracles are possible. What I cannot say in years can be communicated in a single moment of silence, and what can never be said can transpire when between me and you there is no barrier of thought -- when my silence and your silence are just present to each other, mirroring each other just as two mirrors mirror each other.\nMy real work has not yet started. I am just preparing the ground, preparing the people who will be able to take part in the real work. This is just the preliminary stage. So don't waste time, get ready for great things, great things are waiting for\nyou. But the only readiness from your side will be a tremendous silence -- and then there will be no need to talk at all.\nIt is really a torture for me to talk to you. You cannot imagine how difficult it is for me to force myself to talk to you continuously. It is just like walking on a tightrope. Words have disappeared in me; I have to bring them back again and again. It is arduous, tiring.\nBut it cannot be stopped unless you say, \"I give up.\"\nThe day you are able to say, \"Now I am ready to be silent. I don't hope for anything, I am ready to renounce hoping. I am ready to renounce all ideas of spirituality, God, truth, nirvana, enlightenment, I would just like to enjoy being with you, this moment, here, now\" -- then miracles will start happening.\nYes, out of season you are going to bloom.\nAnd remember, you are entitled to all those miracles, they are your birthright. Enough for today.\nThe Book of Wisdom Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6600","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_wisdom/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_book_of_wisdom/>The Book of Wisdom</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Miracles are your Birthright</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6600 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Book_of_Wisdom/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

missing that the ego can survive. It is only through searching, seeking,
desiring, that the ego exists; it exists in the tension between that
which is and that which should be.</p><p>The moment the "should" disappears, the ego collapses. Hence all
ethical</p><p>systems, all moralities, are nourishments for the ego. The moral man
is the most egoistic man in the world. And the mechanism is very simple.
Seeking, searching, you live in the future, which is not; and the ego
can exist only with that which is not, because it itself is not.</p><p>If you are in the moment, in the present, the ego has no possibility
of surviving even for a single moment. The present is and the ego is
not, like light is and darkness is not. Bring light in, and darkness
disappears. Even to say that it disappears is not right, because it was
not there in the first place, so how can it disappear? It was a pure
absence. The absence of light, that's what darkness is.</p><p>The absence of the present, that's what the ego is. Not to be
herenow, that's what the ego is -- not to be herenow, to be somewhere
else, seeking and searching for a faraway goal, looking at a faraway
distant star. The farther away the goal, the bigger the ego.</p><p>Hence people who are not worldly have bigger egos than the so-called
poor worldly people. Spiritual people have bigger egos, naturally; their
goal is very far away, distant, beyond death, above the seven skies. God
is their goal, or moksha or nirvana -- goals which look almost
impossible.</p><p>The possible goal can give you only a small ego, and that too only
for the time being.</p><p>Once the goal is achieved you will start feeling frustrated. That's
what happens every day.</p><p>You wanted a beautiful house, now you have got it, and suddenly
frustration sets in. The ego needs a new goal to survive; now it starts
fantasizing about a bigger palace.</p><p>You were seeking and searching for a woman; now you have got her, and
the moment you have got her you are finished with her. It may take a few
days for you to recognize the fact, that is another matter, but you are
finished with her. Now your ego needs another woman so that the journey
can continue.</p><p>The ego is constantly journeying from the present to some
nonexistential future. If you ask me, this is my definition of samsara,
the world. The ego journeying from the present to the future is the
world. And the ego not journeying at all, simply being herenow, is the
end of samsara: you are in nirvana, samadhi,</p><p>enlightenment. Hence enlightenment cannot be reduced to a goal. If
you reduce it to a goal, you have missed the whole point.</p><p>All the buddhas of all the ages have been telling you a very simple
fact: Be -- don't try to become. Within these two words, be and
becoming, your whole life is contained. Being is enlightenment, becoming
is ignorance. But you have been taught to become this, to become that.
And the mind is so cunning, and the ways of the ego are so subtle that
it even turns God, nirvana, enlightenment, truth, into goals; it starts
asking how to achieve them. They are not to be achieved, they cannot be
achieved; the achieving mind is the only barrier. They are already here.
You have to drop the achieving mind, you have to forget journeying from
this point to that, you simply have to relax and be, and all is
attained.</p><p>Lao Tzu calls it wu-wei, action without action. You have not moved a
single inch, and you have arrived; this is wu-wei. You have not gone
anywhere, you have not even thought of going anywhere, and you are
already there. Suddenly the recognition comes,</p><p>"I never lost the home, I only fell asleep and started dreaming about
achieving."</p><p>Those who give you goals are your enemies. Those who tell you what to
become and how to become it, are the poisoners. The real master simply
says, "There is nothing to become. You are already that, it is already
the case. Stop running after shadows. Sit silently and BE. Sitting
silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by
itself.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>OSHO,</p><p>Question 2</p><p>BECAUSE I AM ONLY A BEGINNER IN THE SEARCH FOR REALITY, COULD</p><p>YOU DEFINE FOR ME THE FOUR TERMS: TRUTH, GOD, SPIRITUAL, FACT.</p><p>Ken Jones, if you are only a beginner in the search, please come
back, don't go ahead.</p><p>Don't become more of an expert in the spiritual search, because the
experts are the losers.</p><p>Don't become more knowledgeable, become more innocent. Drop all that
you know, forget all that you know. Remain wondering, but don't
transform your wondering into questions, because once the wonder is
changed into a question, sooner or later the question will bring
knowledge. And knowledge is a false coin.</p><p>From the state of wonder, there are two paths. One is of questioning
-- the wrong path --</p><p>it leads you into more and more knowledge. The other is not of
questioning but enjoying.</p><p>Enjoy the wonder, the wonder that life is, the wonder that existence
is, the wonder of the sun and the sunlight and the trees bathed in its
golden rays. Experience it. Don't put in a question mark, let it be as
it is.</p><p>Remain ignorant if you ever want to become enlightened. Remain
innocent, childlike, if you ever want a communion with existence and
reality. Remain in wonder if you want the mysteries to open up for you.
Mysteries never open up for those who go on questioning. Questioners
sooner or later end up in a library. Questioners sooner or later end up
with scriptures, because scriptures are full of answers.</p><p>And answers are dangerous, they kill your wonder. They are dangerous
because they give you the feeling that you know, although you know not.
They give you this misconception about yourself that now questions have
been solved. "I know what The Bible says, I know what the Koran says, I
know what the Gita says. I have arrived." You will become a parrot; you
will repeat things but you will not know anything. This is not the way
to know -- knowledge is not the way to know.</p><p>Then what is the way to know? Wonder. Let your heart dance with
wonder. Be full of wonder: throb with it, breathe it in, breathe it out.
Why be in such a hurry for the answer?</p><p>Can't you allow a mystery to remain a mystery? I know there is a
great temptation not to allow it to remain a mystery, to reduce it to
knowledge. Why is</p><p>this temptation there? --</p><p>because only if you are full of knowledge will you be in control.</p><p>Mystery will control you, knowledge will make you the controller.
Mystery will possess you. You cannot possess the mysterious; it is so
vast and your hands are so small. It is so infinite, you cannot possess
it, you will have to be possessed by it -- and that is the fear.</p><p>Knowledge you can possess, it is so trivial; knowledge you can
control.</p><p>This temptation of the mind to reduce every wonder, every mystery, to
a question, is basically fear-oriented. We are afraid, afraid of the
tremendousness of life, of this incredible existence. We are afraid. Out
of fear we create some small knowledge around ourselves as a protection,
as an armor, as a defense.</p><p>It is only cowards who reduce the tremendously valuable capacity of
wondering to questions. The really brave, the courageous person, leaves
it as it is. Rather than changing it into a question, he jumps into the
mystery. Rather than trying to control it, he allows the mystery to
possess him.</p><p>And the joy of being possessed, and the benediction of being
possessed, is invaluable.</p><p>You cannot imagine what it is, you have never dreamt about it --
because to be possessed by the mystery is to be possessed by God.</p><p>Ken Jones, you say: "Because I am only a beginner "</p><p>You are fortunate that you are only a beginner. There are many who
have become experts; they will have to come back home, and it is going
to be a long long arduous journey. They have accumulated so much
knowledge that dropping it is going to be a difficult task. If you are
really a beginner, be happy. You have not gone far away, you are just
beginning. Come back.</p><p>There is no need to define these beautiful words, because they are
not only words. You want me to define truth. Do you know, has anybody
ever defined truth? Is it definable at all? What is a definition? A
definition means a tautology</p><p>-- you put the same words in a different way. What are your
definitions, in fact? Synonyms.</p><p>Just look at your definitions and you will find you have been
paraphrasing. But how can paraphrasing define anything? The second thing
that you think is the definition, in its own turn needs another
definition. Definitions are either tautologies or just stupid.</p><p>For example, ask what the mind is and the knowers, the knowledgeable,
say, "It is not matter." And then ask them, "What is matter?" And they
say, "It is not mind." What kind of defining is going on? Mind is not
matter; this becomes a definition. Matter is not mind; this becomes a
definition. Both remain indefinable; you have not defined anything, you
have simply shifted the problem from one place to another.</p><p>You can befool only fools.</p><p>And the truth means the whole, all that is, the total. All that is --
how can you define it? It is unbounded, infinite. Definition means
drawing a line around it, locating it, saying,</p><p>"This is it." But there is no way to define truth, because there is
no way to draw a line around it. It is infinite, it is eternal, it has
no beginning, no end.</p><p>People who have tried to define truth say, "Truth is that which is."
But that is tautology.</p><p>The question remains the same, the mystery remains unsolved. "Truth
is that which is" --</p><p>what have you added? Have you made it a little simpler than before?
You can call it "that which is" or you can call it truth, or you can
call it God, but you are simply using names, words, labels, for
something which is basically indefinable.</p><p>Truth cannot be defined, although it can certainly be experienced.
But experience is not a definition. A definition is made by the mind,
experience comes through participating. If somebody asks, "What is a
dance?" how can you define it? But you can dance and you can know the
inner feel of it.</p><p>God is the ultimate dance. You will have to learn ecstatic dancing to
experience God.</p><p>God is the dance where the dancer disappears. Then the experience
arrives,</p><p>showers on you, and you KNOW. But that knowing is not knowledge, that
knowing is wisdom.</p><p>Truth cannot be defined. Lao Tzu says if you define it you have
already made it untrue.</p><p>He lived a long life; it must have been really long because the story
is that for eighty-two years he lived in his mother's womb, so when he
was born he was already eighty-two years old. Then if he lived for at
least eighty-two more years, he must have lived very long. But he never
wrote a single word.</p><p>His whole life his disciples were again and again asking, requesting,
"Write something.</p><p>You are getting older and older and older, and one day you will have
to leave the body.</p><p>Leave your last testament." But he would laugh and not say a thing,
or he would keep silent as if he had not heard.</p><p>Then when he became very old, he started moving towards the
Himalayas. He said to his disciples, "Now I am going to the Himalayas,
never to return again. My whole life I have been a wanderer, and the
Himalayas are the best place to die. I lived beautifully, I lived the
most ecstatic life possible. I would also like to die most ecstatically,
most aesthetically. I would like to die in the silence of the Himalayas,
in those beautiful mountains."</p><p>When he was leaving the border of China, the guard at the border
prevented him. He said,</p><p>"I won't allow you to leave the country unless you write something."
He must have been a very perceptive man, the guard. The world is in his
debt for one of the greatest things that has ever been written -- the
Tao Te Ching. There is no other book comparable to it.</p><p>Finding no way to avoid it, because the guard wouldn't allow him to
go and he wanted to leave the country as fast, as quickly, as possible
-- death was coming closer and he wanted to die in the silence of the
Himalayas -- compelled to write, he sat in the guard's room for three
days and completed the book, Tao Te Ching.</p><p>But the first thing that he wrote was, "Tao cannot be said. Once
said, it is no more Tao."</p><p>You can understand what he means. He is saying that if you read the
first statement, there is no need to go any further. "Truth cannot be
said. Once said, it is no more true" -- this is his declaration. Now, if
you understand, the book is finished. What can be said about the truth?
Yes, it can be lived, experienced. You can love, live, be -- but
definition is not possible. If you want definitions you will have to go
to a university. Professors define what truth is, and each professor of
philosophy defines it in his own way, and there are millions of
definitions, and all are false. No definition can ever be true.</p><p>What to say about truth -- even the small experiences of life cannot
be defined. What is love? Or what is the taste of sugar on your tongue?
How to define it? What is beauty when you see it in a lotus flower?</p><p>One of the greatest modern philosophers, G.E. Moore, has written a
book, Principia Ethica, in which he tries to define what good is. Of
course, that is the first question in the world of ethics: what is good?
And for two hundred or two hundred and fifty pages, he tries hard this
way and that, and cannot define it. And he was one of the most
perceptive people this century has produced.</p><p>Defeated, tired, exhausted, in the end he says good is indefinable.
It is as indefinable as the color yellow. If somebody asks, "What is
yellow?" -- there is a marigold flower, and somebody asks, "You call it
yellow? What is yellow?" -- how are you going to define it?</p><p>What more can you say? Yellow is yellow, good is good, beauty is
beauty. But these are tautologies; you are not defining anything, you
are simply repeating words.</p><p>What is truth? There is no way to define it.</p><p>I am not teaching philosophy to you, I am sharing my truth with you.
Don't ask for definitions. If you have the courage, then take a plunge
into the experience that is made available here: take a jump into
meditation, and you will know. And still, even when you know, you will
not be able to define it.</p><p>And you ask, "What is God?"</p><p>That is another name for truth -- the lover's name. "Truth" is the
name given by the meditator to totality. "God" is the name given to
totality, to truth, by a lover, by a devotee. Both arrows point to the
same phenomenon, but the lover can't think in terms of abstract words.
"Truth" is very abstract: you cannot hug truth, can you? You cannot kiss
truth -- or can you? You cannot say hello to truth, you cannot hold
hands with truth.</p><p>"Truth" is impersonal; it is the word given by the meditator who does
not want to bring any personality into it.</p><p>"God" is the name given out of love, out of a personal relationship
with existence. The lover wants to say "Thou," the lover wants to say
"Hi," the lover wants to have a communion, a dialogue. It is the same
totality, but the lover makes it personal. Then truth becomes God.</p><p>And you ask, "What is spiritual?"</p><p>To be in relationship with truth or God is to be spiritual. Remember,
to be in relationship</p><p>-- not to talk about spirituality, not to follow a certain creed,
dogma, church, but to be in direct immediate relationship with existence
is spirituality. To be in tune with the whole, to feel the harmony and
the joy and the sheer celebration of being here, that is
spirituality.</p><p>It has nothing to do with going to the church or the temple, it has
nothing to do with reciting the Koran or The Bible or the Gita. It has
nothing to do with any kind of worship ritual, it has something to do
with communion -- communion with the trees, communion with the stars,
communion with the rivers, communion with all that is. It is communion
with this multidimensional expression of God, it is having a dialogue
with the whole. The quality of mad love is needed, then you are
spiritual. Spirituality is not a head trip; it is a heart- to-heart
dialogue, and ultimately a being-to-being dialogue.</p><p>And fourth, you ask, "What is a fact?"</p><p>A fact is the truth seen with unawareness, seen with blindness, seen
with closed eyes, seen unintelligently, unmeditatively. Then the truth
becomes a fact.</p><p>For example, you come across a buddha. If you look at him
unconsciously he is</p><p>just a fact, a historical fact; he is born on a certain day and is
going to die on a certain day. He is the body that you can see with your
eyes; he is a certain person, a personality. History can take note of
him, you can have a picture of him.</p><p>But if you look, not with unconsciousness but with great
consciousness, with awareness, with great light, silence, then the fact
is no longer there -- there is truth. Then Buddha is not somebody who is
born on a certain date, he is somebody who is never born and is never
going to die. Then Buddha is not the body, the body is just an abode.
Then Buddha is not the confined being that appears to you, he represents
the total, the whole. Then Buddha is a ray of the infinite, a gift of
the beyond to the earth. Then suddenly the fact has disappeared; now
there is truth.</p><p>But history can take no note of truth; history consists of facts. In
India we have two different systems. One we call history; history takes
note of the facts. Another we call purana, mythology; it takes note of
the truth. We have not written histories about Buddha, Mahavira or
Krishna, no. That would have been dragging something immensely beautiful
into the muddy unconsciousness of humanity. We have not written
histories about these people, we have written myths. What is a myth? A
myth is a parable, a parable that only points to the moon but says
nothing about it -- a finger pointing to the moon, an indication, an
arrow, saying nothing.</p><p>Go to a Jaina temple and you will be surprised. You will find
twenty-four statues of twenty-four great enlightened masters, the
twenty-four TIRTHANKARAS. And the most striking thing will be this, that
they all look absolutely alike. This is impossible -- there are not even
two persons absolutely alike in the world, not even twins are absolutely
alike. So how was it possible -- and the time span is big, thousands of
years -- for twenty-four tirthankaras to be exactly alike?</p><p>This is not history. These statues don't depict the real persons, no,
not at all. They are not pictorial representations. Then what are they?
They represent something of the inner, they represent something of
meditativeness, they represent something of inner stillness, something
of the being. Those twenty- four statues are just representations,
visible representations, of something which is invisible.</p><p>Sitting before these statues, if you silently go on watching, you
will be surprised.</p><p>Something starts happening inside you. The statue is a form of
objective art; it synchronizes with the inner form of your being. The
posture of the statue synchronizes with your posture. If you sit in the
same posture -- with erect spine, half-opened eyes, just looking at the
tip of your nose, doing nothing, as if you are also a marble statue, all
white, within and without -- then you will know that you are not facing
ordinary statues, you are confronting great symbols. This is
mythology.</p><p>Mythology is bound to be poetic, because only poetry can give a few
glimpses of the unknown.</p><p>It is said that wherever Buddha moved, trees would start blooming out
of season. Now, this is poetry, pure poetry; it did not happen as a
fact. But this shows something; there is no other way to say it. It says
whenever Buddha is contacted, even trees start blooming out of season --
so what to say about man?</p><p>It is said that wherever Mohammed would move in the desert's hot sun,
and there was fire everywhere, a small cloud, a white cloud, would go on
moving above him just to give him shade like an umbrella. This is
poetry, beautiful, but it is not a historical fact. A man like Mohammed
is protected by existence, a man like Mohammed is in every way cared for
by existence. One who has surrendered to existence is bound to be cared
for by existence. One who has trusted totally, how can existence be
uncaring about him? To say this, there is this metaphor of the cloud
just hanging over his head wherever he would go.</p><p>Jesus dies on the cross, and then after three days is resurrected.
This is poetry, not history.</p><p>This is not fact, this is truth. It simply says that those who die in
God and for God attain to eternal life. Those who are ready to die for
God are resurrected on another plane of being; they lose the physical
body but they gain the luminous body. They are no more part of the earth
but they become part of the sky; they disappear from time but they
appear in eternity.</p><p>But all the religions have been trying to prove that these are facts.
And in trying to prove that these are facts they have simply proved that
they are fools. These are not facts, these are symbolic truths.</p><p>Whatsoever you see around you is a fact. You see a tree, a green
tree, full of sap and flowers -- it is a fact. But if you meditate and
one day suddenly your eyes</p><p>open, open to the real, and the tree is no more just a tree -- the
green of it is nothing but God green in it, and the sap running through
it is no more a physical phenomenon but something spiritual</p><p>-- if one day you can see the being of the tree, the God of the tree,
that the tree is only a manifestation of the divine, you have seen the
truth.</p><p>Truth needs meditative eyes. If you don't have meditative eyes, then
the whole of life is just dull dead facts, unrelated to each other,
accidental, meaningless, a jumble, just a chance phenomenon. If you see
the truth, everything falls into line, everything falls together in a
harmony, everything starts having significance.</p><p>Remember always, significance is the shadow of truth. And those who
live only in facts live an utterly meaningless life.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 3</p><p>YOU HAVE SAID THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS ALWAYS TOTAL, NEVER PARTIAL.
STILL YOU COMPARE YOUR STATE OF NO-MIND WITH AN</p><p>ORCHESTRA WHILE THAT OF KRISHNAMURTI IS COMPARED WITH THAT</p><p>OF A SINGLE FLUTE PLAYER. HAS NOT THE ENLIGHTENED ONE ACCESS TO</p><p>ALL KNOWLEDGE? WHY THAT TUNNEL VISION OF KRISHNAMURTI?</p><p>Henk Faassen, enlightenment is always total. If it is an orchestra it
is a total orchestra, if it is only a solo flute then it is an
absolutely total solo flute. Existence is always total, so is
enlightenment always total. The small flower is as total as the sun.
Totality is a totally different phenomenon than quantity; it is
concerned with quality.</p><p>Krishnamurti's solo flute is as total as my orchestra, my orchestra
is not more</p><p>total.</p><p>Totality cannot be more or less. You think in terms of quantity,
that's why the question has arisen. I am talking about quality. Each act
of the enlightened person is total. Whether he is drinking tea or
painting a great painting, playing music or just sitting silently doing
nothing, each act is total. Krishnamurti is a solo flute player -- and a
few solo flute players are needed as much as orchestras are needed. They
enhance the beauty of existence, they make life richer.</p><p>Drop your mind that goes on comparing in terms of quantity. Raise
your level of consciousness a little higher and start thinking of
quality, and then there is no problem.</p><p>Krishnamurti is doing what he can do best. I would not like him to
become an orchestra, no. That would impoverish the world. He should go
on doing what he is doing; that gives color to life, variety.</p><p>I cannot become a solo flute player -- not that it is not beautiful,
but it is simply not my way. I enjoy being an orchestra. I would like
Atisha to play with me, and Bahauddin and Kabir and Nanak and Lao Tzu
and Zarathustra and many many more. I would like to play with them all
and become part of this orchestra.</p><p>This is my way. There is nothing higher or lower. Once you are
enlightened, there is nothing higher or lower; there cannot be. If a
lotus flower becomes enlightened it will be a lotus flower. If a rose
becomes enlightened it will be a rose. They both have the same quality
of being enlightened, but the rose will remain a rose and the lotus will
remain a lotus.</p><p>You ask me, "You have said that enlightenment is always total, never
partial."</p><p>Yes, it is never partial. And Krishnamurti is not a partial flute
player. He is a total flute player; he is totally in his act, utterly in
his act. He says he is fortunate that he has not read the Vedas, The
Bible, the Koran, the Upanishads, Tao Te Ching. Why? -- because they
might have disturbed him, might have left a few traces behind, might
have become part of his being. He wants to be simply himself, in utter
purity.</p><p>My approach is totally different. I would like to have as big a
company of enlightened people with me as possible. It is a difficult
company, because they are all such different people; to become a host to
all of them is troublesome. But</p><p>I enjoy it. The more troublesome it is, the more I enjoy it. It is a
beautiful challenge. You cannot understand how difficult it is to have
Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed and Moses staying together with you. Mahavira
stands naked, and Buddha does not like it at all. And because Buddha is
not naked, Mahavira is not happy either. To have all these people stay
with you is a great challenge.</p><p>Krishnamurti lives alone. It has its own challenge, but that is not
my choice. I am not saying that my choice has to be his choice, I am not
saying that he has to do what I am doing. I am perfectly happy doing my
thing, and I am perfectly happy that he is doing his thing.</p><p>Many people have asked me questions saying that I have spoken on dead
masters, so many, but why don't I sometimes speak on a living
master?</p><p>Let Krishnamurti die, then I will speak on him. There is a reason for
it. I know how difficult it is even to keep so many dead masters
together, but you can manage with dead masters -- if I tell Mahavira to
stand in this corner, he has to stand in this corner. But a living
master won't listen; he will start meddling, he will start arguing with
others. And sometimes I need a little sleep too.</p><p>You say, "Has not the enlightened one access to all knowledge?"</p><p>Enlightenment has nothing to do with knowledge at all. The
enlightened one has no access to knowledge. Yes, he has every access to
innocence -- and Krishnamurti playing his flute is as innocent as I am
with my orchestra. It is not a question of knowledge, it is a question
of wisdom. Wisdom is a totally different phenomenon -- wisdom is
innocence.</p><p>You can even call it ignorance, that will do, but please don't call
it knowledge. It is closer to ignorance than to knowledge.</p><p>Socrates is reported to have said in his last days, "I know only one
thing, that I know nothing." This is enlightenment, knowing only one
thing, "I know nothing." The moment all knowledge disappears, the ego
disappears, the personality disappears, then the separation between you
and existence disappears. Again you are clean, pure, one with the
whole.</p><p>And you also ask, "Why that tunnel vision of Krishnamurti?"</p><p>That you have to ask Krishnamurti, not me. That is not my business.
He loves it,</p><p>that's how he has grown. For centuries, for many many lives, he has
been moving towards a tunnel vision. And the tunnel vision has its own
beauties, because whatsoever you see, you see very clearly because your
eyes are focused.</p><p>Hence the clarity of Krishnamurti. Nobody has ever been so clear, so
crystal clear.</p><p>Nobody has ever been so logical, so rational; nobody has ever been so
analytical. His profundity in going into things and their details is
simply unbelievable. But that is part of his tunnel vision. You cannot
have everything, remember. If you want clarity you will need tunnel
vision; you will have to become more and more focused on less and
less.</p><p>That's how they define science: "Knowing more and more about less and
less." And if science ever succeeds in its ultimate goal, then we will
have to say, "Knowing everything about nothing." That can be the only
logical conclusion of knowing more and more about less and less. Where
will it lead? It will lead to a point where you know all about
nothing.</p><p>Science is a tunnel vision. Krishnamurti is a scientific
individuality, very scientific.</p><p>Hence his appeal for all those who love analysis, dissection, who
love going into minute details. He is just the opposite of Lao Tzu. Lao
Tzu says, "Everybody seems to be so clear; only I am confused."</p><p>A man of the quality of Lao Tzu, a man of ultimate enlightenment,
saying this:</p><p>"Everybody seems to be so clear about everything, except me. I am so
confused, I am so muddle-headed, that I don't know what is what.
Everybody walks with such certainty, and I hesitate at each step.
Everybody goes so straight, without looking sideways. And I walk like a
man in winter crossing a cold, icy cold stream."</p><p>Lao Tzu is just the opposite of J. Krishnamurti. He has no tunnel
vision. His vision is so wide, so spread out, it cannot be very clear.
It is bound to be hazy, misty, but that too has its own beauty.
Krishnamurti's statements have logic. Lao Tzu's statements have
poetry.</p><p>My vision is even wider than Lao Tzu's. I include Lao Tzu and many
more.</p><p>Obviously Lao Tzu could not have included me. Twenty-five centuries
have passed; in those twenty-five centuries great enlightened people
have happened on the earth. I claim the whole heritage, as nobody has
ever claimed before.</p><p>Lao Tzu had never heard about Krishna, Lao Tzu had never heard about
Patanjali.</p><p>Patanjali had never heard about Lao Tzu or Chuang Tzu or Lieh Tzu.
Buddha had no awareness of Zarathustra or Moses.</p><p>Now the world has become a small village, a global village, and the
whole history of humanity is ours. I am in a totally different
situation. I know everything about Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu,
Confucius, Mencius, Milarepa, Marpa, Tilopa, Naropa, Bodhidharma,
Mahakashyap, Sariputra, Mahavira, Adinatha, Moses, Abraham, Jesus,
Francis, Kabir, Nanak, Dadu, Meera, Rabiya -- all. The whole world is
available to me.</p><p>I see the whole sky, all the stars, all the constellations; my vision
is bound to be the most poetic. But the deeper you go into poetry, the
less and less logical it becomes. The deeper you go into poetry, it
becomes more and more love-like and less and less like logic. At the
very rock bottom of poetry, all clarity disappears. Nothing is clear,
but everything is beautiful, everything is mysterious. Nothing is clear
but everything is simply fantastic.</p><p>Krishnamurti has his way, and I am happy that he is in the world. He
is at the other extreme. If he is gone, I will miss him more than
anybody else in the world.</p><p>But I can understand your question, Henk Faassen. This is not the
only question; you have asked many more about the same thing. It seems
it has hurt you deeply that I criticized Krishnamurti. You don't
understand me yet. This is my way of paying respects to him. This is my
way of declaring that there exists another enlightened person in the
world.</p><p>If my orchestra does not suit you, then the only alternative possible
is the solo flute-playing of J. Krishnamurti. There is no other, no
third person who can be of any help to you. Either Krishnamurti or me --
there is no other alternative. Right now there is no other
alternative.</p><p>Krishnamurti is bound to criticize me; I can understand it. His
standpoint is</p><p>simple and clear, my standpoint is a little more unclear. Sometimes I
will appreciate him tremendously, because I would like him to also
become part of my orchestra. And sometimes I will criticize him, because
my own liking is not for solo flutes.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 4</p><p>I FEEL YOU SHARE A LOT OF ESOTERIC POINTS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE</p><p>NO WAY OF VALIDATING WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHAT IS THE</p><p>IMPORTANCE OF HEARING ABOUT THE SIXTH OR THE SIXTEENTH JAINA
TIRTHANKARA, OR OTHER ESOTERIC INFORMATION, TO THE PERSON IN</p><p>OSHKOSH OR BROOKLYN GOING TO WORK ON THE CROWDED BUS OR</p><p>SUBWAY EVERY DAY? WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF HEARING THAT JESUS</p><p>WAS ONCE IN INDIA OR THAT A ROSICRUCIAN SECT OF SPIRITS WORKING</p><p>FROM THE OTHER SIDE POSSESSED HITLER?</p><p>David Light, fools are everywhere -- as much in Oshkosh and Brooklyn
as they are in Bombay and Poona. No country has any claim on fools. And
fools are always searching for something esoteric -- only nonsense
appeals to them. And sometimes I talk nonsense, because I am not here
only to help those who are not fools. I am also throwing my net wider
and wider; some fools have to be caught by me too. They are good
people!</p><p>Now just look, David Light, from where have you come? How were you
caught? Those stupid theories about the sixth or sixteenth tirthankaras,
or the Rosicrucian</p><p>secret masters, Koothumi, K.H., directing Adolf Hitler and the whole
Nazi movement.…</p><p>There is a deep urge in man to know things which are worthless, to
know things which make you feel special -- because only you know those
things and nobody else does. Man wants to be special, and nothing makes
you more special than so- called esoteric knowledge. That is why
esoteric knowledge remains important. All kinds of rubbish go on in the
name of esoteric knowledge -- that the earth is hollow, that inside the
earth there are great civilizations. And there are people who still
believe in it, and in many more such stories.</p><p>Man lives such a dull and drab life that he wants some sensation.
Those who are a little wiser, they read scientific fiction or detective
stories. Those who are not so wise, they read spiritual fiction.</p><p>And these things were said by me when I was surrounded by a certain
group of fools.</p><p>They were not interested in anything else. And I have to respond to
you; as you grow, my responses will be higher and higher. The day you
have understood the whole stupidity of the human mind I will not need to
talk to you; just sitting silently will be more than enough.</p><p>These things were told by me to a certain group of people who were
only interested in those things. It would have been absolutely pointless
to talk about anything else with those people. Now that they have almost
disappeared, and now that a totally different quality has come here, I
can go more into the world of the truth. But still I have to use words,
and words distort.</p><p>Only silence communicates the truth as it is. Please get ready as
soon as possible, so that we can just be together, merging into each
other's energies, being lost in each other. And miracles are possible.
What I cannot say in years can be communicated in a single moment of
silence, and what can never be said can transpire when between me and
you there is no barrier of thought -- when my silence and your silence
are just present to each other, mirroring each other just as two mirrors
mirror each other.</p><p>My real work has not yet started. I am just preparing the ground,
preparing the people who will be able to take part in the real work.
This is just the preliminary stage. So don't waste time, get ready for
great things, great things are waiting for</p><p>you. But the only readiness from your side will be a tremendous
silence -- and then there will be no need to talk at all.</p><p>It is really a torture for me to talk to you. You cannot imagine how
difficult it is for me to force myself to talk to you continuously. It
is just like walking on a tightrope. Words have disappeared in me; I
have to bring them back again and again. It is arduous, tiring.</p><p>But it cannot be stopped unless you say, "I give up."</p><p>The day you are able to say, "Now I am ready to be silent. I don't
hope for anything, I am ready to renounce hoping. I am ready to renounce
all ideas of spirituality, God, truth, nirvana, enlightenment, I would
just like to enjoy being with you, this moment, here, now" -- then
miracles will start happening.</p><p>Yes, out of season you are going to bloom.</p><p>And remember, you are entitled to all those miracles, they are your
birthright. Enough for today.</p><p>The Book of Wisdom Chapter #11</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

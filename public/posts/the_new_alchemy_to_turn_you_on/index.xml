‌CHAPTER 1
Surrendering to What Is
6 April 1973 pm in Bikaner Palace Hotel
Three sutras that are basic for life transformation, that are ultimate in a way. The first: Be nonambitious.
KILL OUT AMBITION TOTALLY.
UNLESS AMBITION IS KILLED, you will remain in misery. Ambition is the source of all miseries. What is ambition? ‘A’ wants to be ‘B’, the poor wants to be rich, the ugly wants to be beautiful.</description>

Obeying the Warrior Within

THESE ARE THE SUTRAS ACHIEVED BY ULTIMATE WISDOM. They are deep and sometimes very complex, even contradictory, but they are the ultimate flowering of wisdom. When a Buddha becomes a Buddha or a Christ becomes a Christ, these sutras are revealed. If you can understand them, even understanding will transform you.</description>

The Song of Life
11 April 1973 pm in Bikaner Palace Hotel
LISTEN TO THE SONG OF LIFE.
“Look for it and listen to it first in your own heart. At first you may say if is not there; when I search I find only discord. Look deeper. If again you are disappointed, pause and look deeper again. There is a natural melody, an obscure fount in every human heart.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Sense of Separateness
7 April 1973 am in Bikaner Palace Hotel
KILL OUT ALL SENSE OF SEPARATENESS.
MIND THINKS IN TERMS OF SEPARATENESS, division analysis. Through mind, life is divided into fragments. Life itself is not divided; life itself is a unity. Life itself remains undivided, but the mind thinks in terms of fragments so whatsoever the mind says is bound to be false.</description>

Desiring the Unattainable
8 April 1973 am in Bikaner Palace Hotel
DESIRE ONLY THAT WHICH IS WITHIN YOU.
IT LOOKS ABSURD, PARADOXICAL, ILLOGICAL: DESIRE ONLY THAT WHICH IS WITHIN YOU.
Desire is basically for that which is not within you. Desire means the desire for something that is not within you. If it is already within you, then what is the need to desire it?</description>

DESIRE POWER ARDENTLY.
... AND THAT POWER WHICH THE DISCIPLE SHALL COVET IS THAT WHICH SHALL MAKE HIM APPEAR AS NOTHING IN THE EYES OF MEN.

EACH MAN IS TO HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIGHT.… SEEK IT BY THE STUDY OF THE LAWS OF BEING, THE LAWS OF NATURE, THE LAWS OF THE SUPERNATURAL: AND SEEK IT BY MAKING THE PROFOUND OBEISANCE OF THE SOUL TO THE DIM STAR THAT BURNS WITHIN.</description>

The Silence That Follows the Storm
10 April 1973 am in Bikaner Palace Hotel
LOOK FOR THE FLOWER TO BLOOM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWS THE STORM: NOT TILL THEN.
ONE OF THE MOST BASIC laws of life has to be understood.
Life is based on polarity; everything exists with its polar opposite. Otherwise is not possible. Mind exists because of matter; mind is the polar opposite.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Thou Has Reaped
10 April 1973 pm in Bikaner Palace Hotel
THE SPIRITUAL SEARCH starts as a seeking for eternal bliss, as a seeking for eternal liberation, as a seeking for divine light and divine life. But the center remains with you. In the beginning it is a self-centered search. Whatsoever you are seeking you are seeking for yourself.
This self-centeredness ultimately will prove a barrier, because you cannot be in total ecstasy if you are self-centered.</description>

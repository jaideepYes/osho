But the center remains with you. In the beginning it is a self-centered search. Whatsoever you are seeking you are seeking for yourself.\nThis self-centeredness ultimately will prove a barrier, because you cannot be in total ecstasy if you are self-centered. This self-centeredness is a deep hindrance, but in the beginning it is bound to be so. It’s natural that one should start the search for himself. There is no other way. You cannot start for someone else.\nIt has to be self-centered in the beginning, but it must not be so in the end. In the beginning it is okay. In the end it is dangerous. A point comes where your self-centeredness must cease. Only then your being will flower into total bliss.\nIt is just like this: you take breath in, you inhale. This is half a breath. You also have to exhale. That is the other half. And both breaths – inhaling and exhaling – make it a circle, a total breath. If you think only to inhale, and you see no point in exhaling – “What is the use?” – you will die. Inhaling, which is necessary for life, will become dangerous for life if there is no exhaling. The breath must be released.\nThe same happens when you start receiving blissful moments, when you start receiving ecstatic moments, when the eternal starts pouring into you. The first thing is inhaling – you will inhale blissfulness – but then, exhale it. Otherwise, you will die of your own blissfulness. That blissfulness will become poisonous. Exhale it, distribute it, give it to others.\nWhen you feel that you are filled with bliss, express it. Share it; don’t try to conserve it within you. Don’t force it, don’t make it a point that it is your own. Don’t try to own it; allow it to be shared with everyone. Really, celebrate it in such a way that the whole existence shares it. A flower blooms and the perfume spreads. The winds take it away, far away, to the far comers of the earth. Allow your perfume, your bliss, to be taken far away from you, to be shared, to be shared by the existence itself.\nWhy? Because then bliss has become total: inhaling and exhaling both. It becomes a circle. And the more you distribute it, the more you get. The more you throw it away, the more you find it, because now you are in contact with the infinite source.\nDon’t be a miser. Otherwise you will kill the whole process. In the beginning it is okay if you are self-centered, but when the bliss starts happening, it is dangerous. This sutra is concerned with this exhaling.\nOUT OF THE SILENCE THAT IS PEACE A RESONANT VOICE SHALL ARISE. AND THIS VOICE WILL SAY, IT IS NOT WELL; THOU HAS REAPED, NOW THOU MUST SOW. AND KNOWING THIS VOICE TO BE THE SILENCE ITSELF THOU WILT OBEY.\nYou have reaped. You have reaped bliss, you have reaped ecstasy. Now sow it for others. In the world, you sow first and then you reap. In the spiritual dimension, everything is just the reverse. First you reap, and then you sow.\nYou have reaped what Buddha has sown, what Jesus, Krishna and Mohammed have sown. They have sown seeds and you have reaped them. Now, sow seeds for others. And remember well that sowing is just exhaling. It is part of the whole process. You will remain half, incomplete, imperfect, unless bliss has started flowing from you toward everything.\nThis is a very necessary law. When you become silent, you hear it No one else is saying it to you. Your own heart, your own innermost being, tells you this. This indication, this teaching, this message is not from without. It is from your own innermost self. That’s why THOU WILT OBEY. There’s no possibility of not obeying it; it is your own. But if you know it well, it will be easy.\nIt will be easy if you know that it is part of the process: that bliss should be distributed and shared; only then will it grow more. If you don’t know this law, your miserliness, your old self-centeredness may delay the completion of the process.\nIt can only be delayed; it cannot be disobeyed forever. But why delay it? So remember this: whenever you feel any moment of bliss happening, share it.\nThat’s why my insistence, so much insistence, that after meditation you must express your bliss; you must celebrate it. You must make it a point that whatsoever happens to you – allow it to be shared. Dance and sing. These are just symbolic; they are just to serve as a continuous remembrance.\nWhen you have gone from here, many things will happen to you if you continue meditation. But whenever something happens to you, don’t keep it to yourself. Share it. Even if you cannot do anything else, just smiling, smiling to some stranger, may be enough. Just taking the hand of some stranger in your hand and feeling the friend within him will do it. Or sharing anything, just as a token.\nOr if there is no one there and you are sitting under a tree, then dance and feel that you are dancing with the tree. Sing, and feel that you are singing with the birds. And sooner or later you will come to understand that when you share, even a tree is ready to share back with you.\nThey have done some recent research in a Russian university. Through many experiments, one psychoanalyst, Pushkin, has come to conclude that trees have similar emotions as man. Not only that – trees can be hypnotized. Not only that – if a person is hypnotized under a tree and under hypnosis it is suggested to him that “you are very sad,” the person will become sad and, simultaneously, the tree will become sad.\nThese are experimental conclusions. Now there are mechanical recording devices that can record whether you are sad or happy, whether you are depressed, whether you are angry, whether you are sexual. With every emotion, a different electrical wave is released from your mind. That electrical wave can be recorded.\nBut this has been a very strange conclusion: that the same wave is recorded from the tree also. You are dancing under a tree, happy. Your mind will give an indication that you are happy and it will be recorded. If the device is connected with the tree also, the tree also records the same wave. So Pushkin says that if you are dancing under a tree, very happy, the tree shares it. It is very happy, with you.\nAnd if a tree can share, why not birds? They are more alive. Why not animals? They are still more alive. And why not the whole existence? Sooner or later we will find that even stones share. Their soul may be hidden very deep, but it is there; and one day we are going to find out instruments which will give us indications that even a stone, a rock, has emotions.\nSo wherever you are, whenever you feel that some ecstatic emotion has happened to you, dance to its tune, sing to its tune, and share your happiness in whatsoever way it happens to you, in whatsoever way you feel to share it. But share it! It will grow more. With sharing, it grows. With miserliness – with not sharing – it dies down, it shrinks.\nDeath is a shrinkage. Shrinkage is death; life is expansion. Allow it to expand. And once you know the feeling of expansion you will allow it to happen, because it is your own innermost self dictating.\nTHOU WHO ARE NOW A DISCIPLE, ABLE TO STAND, ABLE TO HEAR, ABLE TO SEE, ABLE TO SPEAK; WHO HAST CONQUERED DESIRE AND ATTAINED TO SELF-KNOWLEDGE, WHO HAST SEEN THY SOUL IN ITS BLOOM AND RECOGNIZED IT, AND HEARD THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE, GO THOU TO THE HALL OF LEARNING AND READ WHAT IS WRITTEN THERE FOR THEE.\n“... to hear the voice of the silence is to understand that from within comes the only true guidance; to go to the Hall of Learning is to enter the state in which learning becomes possible. Then will many words be written there for thee, and written in fiery letters for thee easily to read. For when the disciple is ready the Master is ready also.”\n“To hear the voice of silence is to understand that from within comes the only true guidance.” When you are silent, really silent – after the storm has passed, when you have fallen into silence\nspontaneously – you have not cultivated it; it has come to you, it has arisen in you spontaneously – in this silence you will come to feel and understand and realize that now the true guidance is possible from your own innermost being. Now the master, the inner master will appear to you.\nYour own innermost center is your real master. Outer masters can help, but their help is basically directed toward finding the inner master. And when the inner one is found, there is no need for the outer master. You have become master in your own right.\nBut this happens only when you have come to realize a total inner silence, without any thoughts, without any words, without any imagination, without any ripples of any kind. When you have come to understand and feel a rippleless silence, a thoughtless, nonmoving silence – this silence becomes your inner master. Now, out of this silence, guidance will be given to you.\n“For when the disciple is ready the Master is also ready.” When you are ready to receive the inner guidance, the inner guidance comes naturally, automatically. But the disciple must be ready.\nWhat is meant by the disciple being ready? It means to become totally receptive, humble, egoless, surrendered, in a deep let-go. When you are not saying anything but are just receptive to listen, when you are not imposing any theories upon truth – you are naked, vacant and ready to allow the truth to reveal itself in its own way; you are not in any way, consciously or unconsciously, forcing anything upon the truth; you have stopped forcing; you are ready to be carried away to wheresoever the truth leads you – then, you are a disciple.\nThere is a difference between a student and a disciple. A student is hankering for information. A disciple is not hankering for information. His search is for knowledge, authentic experience. He is not interested in what others say. He is interested in what he can feel. The student will collect information; he will train his memory. And the more his memory is trained, the more information is accumulated, the more egoistic he will become. A student can never be humble, a scholar can never be humble. His basic search is egoistic.\nSomeone accumulates riches and someone else accumulates knowledge. There is no difference. Every accumulation feeds the ego. Whatsoever you accumulate – the greater the quantity, the more egoistic you will feel. So a student or a scholar is not a disciple. The very dimension is different. A disciple is not in search of accumulation. Rather, on the contrary, he is ready to throw all accumulations. If the.truth happens only in that emptiness, he is ready to throw all accumulations, all knowledge.\nIn his old age, Socrates is reported to have said, “Now I can say that I do not know anything. I am ignorant.” He was a disciple.\nIt happened that one seer declared Socrates to be the wisest man in Athens. Those who heard the seer came running to Socrates. They said, “Socrates, have you heard or not? The seer has said that you are the wisest man in Athens.”\nSocrates said, “There must have been some error. Go back and tell the seer that Socrates says he knows nothing. He is absolutely ignorant.”\nThe people went back to the seer and told him, “Your prophecy has been denied by Socrates himself. He says, ‘I do not know anything. I am ignorant.’”\nThe seer laughed. He said, “BECAUSE OF THIS I say he is the wisest man” – because only a perfectly wise man can say, “I do not know.”\nIgnorant people always claim knowledge. The more ignorant, the more they claim they know. This is part of ignorance. A student, a pundit, a scholar – they are all claiming knowledge. They are not disciples.\nAnd remember, if you are a student you can become a teacher but never a master. Only a disciple can become a master. If you are a student, a scholar, you can become a teacher – never a master. Only a disciple can become a master. Discipleship means egoless surrender. And once you surrender, your innermost self is revealed to you. That is the master who is waiting for you. He has been waiting for you for lives and lives.\nIn any moment of surrender, the master will be revealed to you. And that master is no one. It is your own innermost self, it is your own atman. So really, this can be said: when you are a perfect disciple you have become a master. You are no longer a disciple at all. Discipleship achieved, you are now transformed into a master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2291","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_alchemy_to_turn_you_on/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_alchemy_to_turn_you_on/>The New Alchemy.

life. But the center remains with you. In the beginning it is a
self-centered search. Whatsoever you are seeking you are seeking for
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This self-centeredness ultimately will prove a barrier, because you
cannot be in total ecstasy if you are self-centered. This

feel to share it. But share it! It will grow more. With sharing, it
grows. With miserliness – with not sharing – it dies down, it
shrinks.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is a shrinkage. Shrinkage is death; life is expansion. Allow it
to expand. And once you know the feeling of expansion you will allow it
to happen, because it is your own innermost self dictating.</p><p><br></p><p>THOU WHO ARE NOW A DISCIPLE, ABLE TO STAND, ABLE TO HEAR, ABLE TO
SEE, ABLE TO SPEAK; WHO HAST CONQUERED DESIRE AND ATTAINED TO
SELF-KNOWLEDGE, WHO HAST SEEN THY SOUL IN ITS BLOOM AND RECOGNIZED IT,
AND HEARD THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE, GO THOU TO THE HALL OF LEARNING AND
READ WHAT IS WRITTEN THERE FOR THEE.</p><p><br></p><p>“... to hear the voice of the silence is to understand that from
within comes the only true guidance; to go to the Hall of Learning is to
enter the state in which learning becomes possible. Then will many words
be written there for thee, and written in fiery letters for thee easily
to read. For when the disciple is ready the Master is ready also.”</p><p><br></p><p>“To hear the voice of silence is to understand that from within comes
the only true guidance.” When you are silent, really silent – after the
storm has passed, when you have fallen into silence</p><p><br></p><p>spontaneously – you have not cultivated it; it has come to you, it
has arisen in you spontaneously – in this silence you will come to feel
and understand and realize that now the true guidance is possible from
your own innermost being. Now the master, the inner master will appear
to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your own innermost center is your real master. Outer masters can
help, but their help is basically directed toward finding the inner
master. And when the inner one is found, there is no need for the outer
master. You have become master in your own right.</p><p><br></p><p>But this happens only when you have come to realize a total inner
silence, without any thoughts, without any words, without any
imagination, without any ripples of any kind. When you have come to
understand and feel a rippleless silence, a thoughtless, nonmoving
silence – this silence becomes your inner master. Now, out of this
silence, guidance will be given to you.</p><p><br></p><p>“For when the disciple is ready the Master is also ready.” When you
are ready to receive the inner guidance, the inner guidance comes
naturally, automatically. But the disciple must be ready.</p><p><br></p><p>What is meant by the disciple being ready? It means to become totally
receptive, humble, egoless, surrendered, in a deep let-go. When you are
not saying anything but are just receptive to listen, when you are not
imposing any theories upon truth – you are naked, vacant and ready to
allow the truth to reveal itself in its own way; you are not in any way,
consciously or unconsciously, forcing anything upon the truth; you have
stopped forcing; you are ready to be carried away to wheresoever the
truth leads you – then, you are a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a difference between a student and a disciple. A student is
hankering for information. A disciple is not hankering for information.
His search is for knowledge, authentic experience. He is not interested
in what others say. He is interested in what he can feel. The student
will collect information; he will train his memory. And the more his
memory is trained, the more information is accumulated, the more
egoistic he will become. A student can never be humble, a scholar can
never be humble. His basic search is egoistic.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone accumulates riches and someone else accumulates knowledge.
There is no difference. Every accumulation feeds the ego. Whatsoever you
accumulate – the greater the quantity, the more egoistic you will feel.
So a student or a scholar is not a disciple. The very dimension is
different. A disciple is not in search of accumulation. Rather, on the
contrary, he is ready to throw all accumulations. If the.truth happens
only in that emptiness, he is ready to throw all accumulations, all
knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>In his old age, Socrates is reported to have said, “Now I can say
that I do not know anything. I am ignorant.” He was a disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that one seer declared Socrates to be the wisest man in
Athens. Those who heard the seer came running to Socrates. They said,
“Socrates, have you heard or not? The seer has said that you are the
wisest man in Athens.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “There must have been some error. Go back and tell the
seer that Socrates says he knows nothing. He is absolutely
ignorant.”</p><p><br></p><p>The people went back to the seer and told him, “Your prophecy has
been denied by Socrates himself. He says, ‘I do not know anything. I am
ignorant.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The seer laughed. He said, “BECAUSE OF THIS I say he is the wisest
man” – because only a perfectly wise man can say, “I do not know.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ignorant people always claim knowledge. The more ignorant, the more
they claim they know. This is part of ignorance. A student, a pundit, a
scholar – they are all claiming knowledge. They are not disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, if you are a student you can become a teacher but never
a master. Only a disciple can become a master. If you are a student, a
scholar, you can become a teacher – never a master. Only a disciple can
become a master. Discipleship means egoless surrender. And once you
surrender, your innermost self is revealed to you. That is the master
who is waiting for you. He has been waiting for you for lives and
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>In any moment of surrender, the master will be revealed to you. And
that master is no one. It is your own innermost self, it is your own
atman. So really, this can be said: when you are a perfect disciple you
have become a master. You are no longer a disciple at all. Discipleship
achieved, you are now transformed into a master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

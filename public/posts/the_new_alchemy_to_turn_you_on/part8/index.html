Otherwise is not possible. Mind exists because of matter; mind is the polar opposite. Consciousness exists because of unconsciousness, the day exists because of the night, life exists because of death, happiness exists because of unhappiness, and so on and so forth. Everything exists because of its polar opposite. You cannot experience happiness unless you have deeply experienced unhappiness, and you cannot come to the ultimate ecstasy if you have not been thrown into ultimate agony. Hence the meaning of the world, hence this whole suffering. It is not meaningless.\nPeople come to me and ask why God created this suffering world. “Why is there so much suffering if God is compassion?” Yes, God is compassion. Therefore, there is so much suffering. Unless you pass through suffering, you will not reach the ultimate ecstasy. It is a basic training. Unhappiness is a basic training for the ultimate flowering of happiness.\nHow can you reach ecstasy if you have not known agony? If you reach the world of ecstasy without knowing what agony is, you will not be able to recognize it. The recognition is impossible. Only through darkness can light be recognized. You may be living in light, but if you don’t know darkness you cannot know that you are living in light. A fish in the sea cannot know that the sea exists. Only if the fish is thrown out of the sea does it come to recognize the sea. If it is thrown back into the sea\nagain, the fish will be totally different and the sea will be totally different. Now the fish will be able to recognize it. Sansar, the world, is just a training ground. You must be thrown deeply into matter. Only then can you come back to the other pole, to the peak of consciousness.\nThis sutra says LOOK FOR THE FLOWER TO BLOOM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWS THE\nSTORM: NOT TILL THEN. The real, authentic silence happens only after you have passed through a storm. Only when the storm is over can the silence explode within you, never before. You can create a false silence before the storm, but then you are just deluded. You can create a stillness – artificial, cultivated, forced from without – but it is not spontaneous, it is not of your inner being.\nThere are many tricks to still the mind. You can use a mantra. You can sit silently in a Buddha- posture and go on repeating AUM, AUM, AUM. If you go on and on and on repeating it, you will get bored. That boredom will look like stillness. When you get bored, the mantra will drop. A sort of sleep will be created within. Hypnosis – a sort of sleep. You will feel good, but that sleep is not dhyana, that sleep in not silence. That sleep is simply negative. You have become dull because of the repetition. Every repetition creates dullness. You have simply become dull. Through dullness you cannot experience misery, you cannot experience suffering. The dullness is an anaesthetic. It has made you unconscious.\nThis is negative. You will be less tense now, but not more alive. A silence, to be real, must be more alive and more sensitive. It must not be a sort of dullness. Through mantras you can create a silence on the periphery, a facade of silence, and you can live in that facade for lifetimes, but you are living a false silence. A real silence comes only after the storm.\nDon’t force the storm to disappear. Rather, live it; allow it to happen. Act it out, throw it out. Allow the storm to disappear from you, evaporate from you. Don’t suppress it. Suppressed, it will remain with you. Suppressed in the unconscious, it will persist; it will wait for the right moment to explode. You will always be afraid of it exploding, you will have to fight it continuously. And you can never be victorious, because that which is suppressed has to be fought again and again, has to be suppressed again and again. Your stillness will be resting on a volcano, and at any moment the volcano can erupt.\nThen you will always be afraid of life, because life can create situations in which the volcano can erupt. You will negate life, you will try to escape from life. You will want to go to the Himalayas, because no one is there to provide an opportunity for your volcano to erupt. But the volcano is still there, and the Himalayas cannot help unless the volcano is thrown out.\nAnd it is good to throw it out. You are missing a basic experience of throwing out the volcano completely, of releasing the madness totally, of acting out whatsoever is there: the storm within. Allow it to move without and don’t resist, don’t suppress. Allow it to move out completely. Then a moment will come when the storm has gone.\nIn that moment, real silence happens to you. Real in the sense that now it is not cultivated; it is spontaneous. The stream is flowing. It is not anything that you have created; it is not anything that is happening because of your effort. Rather, on the contrary, you are not there. Only the silence is. And this silence is fearless. Nothing can disturb it because that which could be a disturbance has been thrown out. The storm has disappeared.\nHence my insistence, so much insistence, on throwing your madness out. Within, it is dangerous. Thrown out, it disappears. Your heart becomes empty; a certain space is created. Only in that space can silence happen. Then you have room for it, you’re ready for it, open to it.\nLOOK FOR THE FLOWER TO BLOOM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWS THE STORM: NOT\nTILL THEN. What is the flower?\nThe flowering of your being will happen only when real silence has happened to you, never before. You cannot force the flower to open. It opens by itself. You cannot force your being to open; there is no possibility of it. You cannot rape it, you cannot be violent toward it. It will simply be destroyed.\nThe flower opens by itself. The only soil needed is authentic, real, spontaneous silence. With a cultivated silence the flower will never open. With cultivated silence you will simply become dull. Your being will be less alive, that’s all. With less life you will be in less trouble. That’s okay, but remember that trouble is a training. You should not try to have less troubles. Be with your troubles and move through them. Don’t leave them, don’t escape from them. A moment will come when you have gone beyond them, but that moment always comes from passing through them. Pass through the storm and allow a real silence to come. Then your being will flower, not till then.\nIT SHALL GROW, IT WILL SHOOT UP, IT WILL MAKE BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND FORM BUDS WHILE THE STORM CONTINUES, WHILE THE BATTLE LASTS. BUT NOT TILL THE WHOLE PERSONALITY OF THE MAN IS DISSOLVED AND MELTED... NOT UNTIL THE WHOLE NATURE HAS YIELDED AND HAS BECOME SUBJECT UNTO ITS HIGHER SELF, CAN THE BLOOM OPEN.\nDon’t think that the storm is your enemy. It is not. That storm is your greatest friend, because without it there will be no silence, without it there will be no flowering, without it there will be no liberation. So never think in terms of c. Nothing is an enemy to you: the whole existence is friendly. Even that which appears to be against you – even that is not your enemy. Jesus says, “Love your enemy.” The real enemy that you have to love is not your neighbor or the enemy of your country. They are not your real enemies. Your real enemies are the storm, the world, evil. Sexuality, anger, passion, hatred – these are the real enemies.\nJesus says, “Love thy enemies as thyself.” Why? Christianity could never understand it. Jesus’ teaching has been completely lost. Whatsoever exists in the name of Christianity doesn’t belong to Jesus Christ at all. It belongs to St. Paul. He is the real founder of the so-called Christianity that exists on earth.\nJesus is very esoteric. When he says, “Love thy enemies as thyself,” he means this: that through the polar opposite, through the enemy, the ultimate friend is reached. Experience the enemy in its totality so that you can transcend it. Any experience that is total becomes transcendental. Any experience I say. Experience with your totality and you have gone beyond it. It will never cling to you; you have moved above it. You have passed through it, you have learned everything about it. Knowing is revolutionary. It creates a mutation; it transforms you.\nWhile the storm lastsDon’t think that the storm is your enemy because meanwhile, underground,\nhidden in darkness, the flower will grow.\n... IT WILL SHOOT UP, IT WILL MAKE BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND FORM BUDS WHILE THE STORM CONTINUES, WHILE THE BATTLE LASTS. BUT NOT TILL THE WHOLE PERSONALITY OF THE MAN IS DISSOLVED AND MELTED – NOT UNTIL THE WHOLE NATURE HAS YIELDED AND BECOME SUBJECT UNTO ITS HIGHER SELF CAN THE BLOOM OPEN.\nWhen the storm has gone, the bloom will open. But it was getting ready while the storm was there. Through the storm it was getting ready to bloom. It was gathering energy, life, vitality. It was getting ready to burst forth. The storm is the soil. Without it the flower cannot bloom.\nTHEN WILL COME A CALM SUCH AS COMES IN A TROPICAL COUNTRY AFTER THE HEAVY RAIN.AND IN THE DEEP SILENCE THE MYSTERIOUS EVENT WILL OCCUR WHICH WILL\nPROVE THAT THE WAY HAS BEEN FOUND.\nOnly by passing through the storm will you come to a spot within you which comes IN A TROPICAL COUNTRY AFTER THE HEAVY RAIN. Remember this deeply. It will be of much help to you.\nWith every suffering, you are creating the possibility of some ecstasy. The ecstasy will follow right after it. But if you are too engaged with the suffering, you may miss it. If you are ill, after that illness a moment of health, a moment of well-being, will come to you. But you can be too concerned with the illness so that when the moment comes you may miss it – you are too involved with the past illness that is no more. The moment is momentary; you can miss it very easily. After every pain, the moment comes and visits you.\nAfter every suffering, ecstasy comes to your door and knocks; but you go on missing it because the past is so heavy. You are still ill even after the illness has gone. It continues in the memory, it clouds your mind, and you miss that atomic moment.\nRemember this: Whenever you are depressed, wait for the moment that the depression goes. Nothing lasts forever; the depression will go. And when it leaves you, wait – be aware and alert – because after the depression, after the night, there will be a dawn and the sun will rise. If you can be alert in that moment. you will he happy that you were depressed. You will be grateful that you are depressed because only through your depression was this mint of happiness possible\nBut what do we do? We move in an infinite regression We yet depressed. Then we yet depressed because of the depression: a second depression follows. If you are depressed. that’s okay! – nothing is wrong in it. It is beautiful because through it you will learn and mature. But then you feel badly. “Why do I get depressed? I should not get depressed.” Then you start fighting with the depression. The first depression is good, but the second depression is unreal. And this unreal depression will cloud your mind. You will miss the moment that would have followed the real depression.\nWhen depressed, be depressed. Simply be depressed. Don’t get depressed about your depression. When depressed, simply be depressed. Don’t fight it, don’t create any diversion, don’t force it to go. Just allow it to happen; it will go by itself. Life is a flux; nothing remains the same. You are not needed; the river moves by itself, you don’t have to push it. If you are trying to push it, you are simply foolish. The river flows by itself. Allow it to flow.\nWhen depression is there, allow it to be. Don’t get depressed about it. If you want to remove it sooner, you will get depressed. If you fight it, you will create a secondary depression that is dangerous. The first depression is beautiful, God-given. The second depression is your own. It is not God-given; it is mental. Then you will move in mental grooves. They are infinite.\nIf you get depressed, be happy that you are depressed and allow the depression to be. Then suddenly the depression will disappear and there will be a breakthrough. No clouds will be there and the sky will be clear. For a single moment, heaven opens for you. If you are not depressed about your depression you can contact, you can commune, you can enter this heavenly gate. And once you know it, you have learned one of the ultimate laws of life: that life uses the opposite as a teacher, as a back-ground.\nNothing is wrong; everything is for the good. This is what I call a religious attitude. You may not believe in God – that makes no difference. Buddha never believed in God. Mahavir never believed in God but they were religious. There is no need to believe in an afterlife no need. You can still be religious. There is no need even to believe in a soul. You can be religious without believing in it.\nThen what is religion? Religion means this trust: that everything is for the good. This trust that everything is for the good is a religious mind; this is religiousness.\nAnd if you trust that everything is for the good, you will come to realize the divine. The divine can be realized through such trust. Even the storm is for the sake of the silence. Evil exists for the sake of good; death exists for the sake of life; suffering and agony are just situations in which ecstasy can happen.\nLook at life in this way and the moment will not be far off when suffering will disappear completely, when pain will disappear completely, when death will disappear completely. One who knows that agony exists for the sake of ecstasy cannot be agonized. One who knows and feels and realizes that suffering exists for the sake of happiness cannot be made to suffer. It is impossible. He is using suffering itself to be more happy, he is using agony itself as a step toward ecstasy. He has gone beyond the clutches of the world, he has taken a jump out of the wheel of sansar.\n“The opening of the bloom is the glorious moment when perception awakes: with it comes confidence, knowledge, certainty.”\n“... When the disciple is ready to learn, then he is accepted, acknowledged, recognized. It must be so, for he has lit his lamp, and it cannot be hidden.”\nTHESE WRITTEN ABOVE ARE THE FIRST OF THE RULES WHICH ARE WRITTEN ON THE WALLS OF THE HALL OF LEARNING. THOSE THAT ASK SHALL HAVE. THOSE THAT DESIRE TO READ SHALL READ. THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN.\nPEACE BE WITH YOU.\nTwo things more to be understood: “The opening of the bloom is the glorious moment when perception awakes: with it comes confidence, knowledge, certainty. Unless you experience you cannot be certain. Unless you experience, you have not known. Unless you experience. there\ncannot be faith. Before you have experienced, all belief is false. all certainty is just a facade all knowledge is just information and nothing else. Remember. before you experience something for yourself, don’t be too certain about it, because too much certainty is just a trick of the mind to hide the uncertainty within. Before you experience something for yourself don’t say that you know it, because your knowledge is just a trick to hide your ignorance.\nYou may have read the Gita, you may have read the Koran, you may have read the Bible. Then you know ‘about’, but you don’t know. You can know much about God but it doesn’t mean anything unless you know God. To know ‘about’ is not knowledge. You can know what Jesus has said but this is borrowed, secondary, useless. You can repeat what Krishna has said but it’s just mechanical. You can memorize it, you can know it by heart, but it is never in the heart; it remains in the memory. Memory is mechanical; it is not knowledge. Knowledge comes only through your own experience. Insist on your own experience. If you insist, you will gain it.\nTHOSE THAT ASK SHALL HAVE. But you never ask; you become contented with borrowed knowledge. You never say, “I must be allowed to know myself.” If you ask, the existence is ready to give; but you are contented with books, with scriptures, with borrowed information. You never ask for the real.\nAsk for the real. And the real means your experience, your own. Buddhas are of no help. They can just show the way, but you have to travel by your own feet Insist on your own knowledge, your own experience. Never be contented before that.\nTHOSE THAT DESIRE TO READ SHALL READ. If you are very insistent on reading the ultimate laws, they will be opened unto you. The real Bible is not in the Bible, the real Koran is not in the Koran, the real Gita is not in the Gita. The real Bible or the Koran or the Gita is written in existence, in life itself. If you don’t believe in the scriptures, the real scriptures will be opened unto you.\nInsist that “I want to read in existence,” and the moment will be given to you. But if you don’t insist, if you carry a dead book and are content, then existence is not going to force. The existence is absolutely nonviolent; it will not force you. You can remain with your scriptures, and if you are happy it is okay. But you are living in a false world, you are living in words. Open the book of existence. Throw all scriptures so that the real scripture can be encountered.\nTHOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN. Learning is difficult because learning means yielding, learning means surrendering, learning means becoming like a womb, becoming feminine, allowing the existence to enter in you. But, THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN.\nWe also desire, but not to learn. We desire to collect more information. That’s not learning.\nMany people come to me and they say, “We come to the meditation camps because many new things become known to us here.” They collect information, they collect some words, and then they go away happy. They are stupid. And their happiness is suicidal because whatsoever I say is of no use unless you experience it.\nYou can carry my words. Then you are carrying a dead weight. You will be burdened by it; you will not be freed. My words cannot free you. They may even imprison you, they may become fetters for you.\nIt would have been better if you had not come. Whatsoever I am saying is not to be remembered. It is to be experienced. And if you experience it, it becomes your own. Then those words don’t belong to me anymore. Now that experience has become your own. Now you know something through your own eyes, now you feel something through your own heart. This is knowledge. And this gives certainty and this gives faith.\nPEACE BE WITH YOU – because only in peace the divine becomes possible.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3408","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_alchemy_to_turn_you_on/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_alchemy_to_turn_you_on/>The New Alchemy.

silence explode within you, never before. You can create a false silence
before the storm, but then you are just deluded. You can create a
stillness – artificial, cultivated, forced from without – but it is not
spontaneous, it is not of your inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many tricks to still the mind. You can use a mantra. You
can sit silently in a Buddha- posture and go on repeating AUM, AUM, AUM.
If you go on and on and on repeating it, you will get bored. That
boredom will look like stillness. When you get bored, the mantra will
drop. A sort of sleep will be created within. Hypnosis – a sort of
sleep. You will feel good, but that sleep is not dhyana, that sleep in
not silence. That sleep is simply negative. You have become dull because
of the repetition. Every repetition creates dullness. You have simply
become dull. Through dullness you cannot experience misery, you cannot
experience suffering. The dullness is an anaesthetic. It has made you
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>This is negative. You will be less tense now, but not more alive. A
silence, to be real, must be more alive and more sensitive. It must not
be a sort of dullness. Through mantras you can create a silence on the
periphery, a facade of silence, and you can live in that facade for
lifetimes, but you are living a false silence. A real silence comes only
after the storm.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t force the storm to disappear. Rather, live it; allow it to
happen. Act it out, throw it out. Allow the storm to disappear from you,
evaporate from you. Don’t suppress it. Suppressed, it will remain with
you. Suppressed in the unconscious, it will persist; it will wait for
the right moment to explode. You will always be afraid of it exploding,
you will have to fight it continuously. And you can never be victorious,
because that which is suppressed has to be fought again and again, has
to be suppressed again and again. Your stillness will be resting on a
volcano, and at any moment the volcano can erupt.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will always be afraid of life, because life can create
situations in which the volcano can erupt. You will negate life, you
will try to escape from life. You will want to go to the Himalayas,
because no one is there to provide an opportunity for your volcano to
erupt. But the volcano is still there, and the Himalayas cannot help
unless the volcano is thrown out.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is good to throw it out. You are missing a basic experience of
throwing out the volcano completely, of releasing the madness totally,
of acting out whatsoever is there: the storm within. Allow it to move
without and don’t resist, don’t suppress. Allow it to move out
completely. Then a moment will come when the storm has gone.</p><p><br></p><p>In that moment, real silence happens to you. Real in the sense that
now it is not cultivated; it is spontaneous. The stream is flowing. It
is not anything that you have created; it is not anything that is
happening because of your effort. Rather, on the contrary, you are not
there. Only the silence is. And this silence is fearless. Nothing can
disturb it because that which could be a disturbance has been thrown
out. The storm has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence my insistence, so much insistence, on throwing your madness
out. Within, it is dangerous. Thrown out, it disappears. Your heart
becomes empty; a certain space is created. Only in that space can
silence happen. Then you have room for it, you’re ready for it, open to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>LOOK FOR THE FLOWER TO BLOOM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWS THE STORM:
NOT</p><p>TILL THEN. What is the flower?</p><p><br></p><p>The flowering of your being will happen only when real silence has
happened to you, never before. You cannot force the flower to open. It
opens by itself. You cannot force your being to open; there is no
possibility of it. You cannot rape it, you cannot be violent toward it.
It will simply be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>The flower opens by itself. The only soil needed is authentic, real,
spontaneous silence. With a cultivated silence the flower will never
open. With cultivated silence you will simply become dull. Your being
will be less alive, that’s all. With less life you will be in less
trouble. That’s okay, but remember that trouble is a training. You
should not try to have less troubles. Be with your troubles and move
through them. Don’t leave them, don’t escape from them. A moment will
come when you have gone beyond them, but that moment always comes from
passing through them. Pass through the storm and allow a real silence to
come. Then your being will flower, not till then.</p><p><br></p><p>IT SHALL GROW, IT WILL SHOOT UP, IT WILL MAKE BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND
FORM BUDS WHILE THE STORM CONTINUES, WHILE THE BATTLE LASTS. BUT NOT
TILL THE WHOLE PERSONALITY OF THE MAN IS DISSOLVED AND MELTED... NOT
UNTIL THE WHOLE NATURE HAS YIELDED AND HAS BECOME SUBJECT UNTO ITS
HIGHER SELF, CAN THE BLOOM OPEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think that the storm is your enemy. It is not. That storm is
your greatest friend, because without it there will be no silence,
without it there will be no flowering, without it there will be no
liberation. So never think in terms of c. Nothing is an enemy to you:
the whole existence is friendly. Even that which appears to be against
you – even that is not your enemy. Jesus says, “Love your enemy.” The
real enemy that you have to love is not your neighbor or the enemy of
your country. They are not your real enemies. Your real enemies are the
storm, the world, evil. Sexuality, anger, passion, hatred – these are
the real enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Love thy enemies as thyself.” Why? Christianity could
never understand it. Jesus’ teaching has been completely lost.
Whatsoever exists in the name of Christianity doesn’t belong to Jesus
Christ at all. It belongs to St. Paul. He is the real founder of the
so-called Christianity that exists on earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is very esoteric. When he says, “Love thy enemies as thyself,”
he means this: that through the polar opposite, through the enemy, the
ultimate friend is reached. Experience the enemy in its totality so that
you can transcend it. Any experience that is total becomes
transcendental. Any experience I say. Experience with your totality and
you have gone beyond it. It will never cling to you; you have moved
above it. You have passed through it, you have learned everything about
it. Knowing is revolutionary. It creates a mutation; it transforms
you.</p><p><br></p><p>While the storm lasts<span class=s4></span>Don’t think that the
storm is your enemy because meanwhile, underground,</p><p>hidden in darkness, the flower will grow.</p><p><br></p><p>... IT WILL SHOOT UP, IT WILL MAKE BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND FORM BUDS
WHILE THE STORM CONTINUES, WHILE THE BATTLE LASTS. BUT NOT TILL THE
WHOLE PERSONALITY OF THE MAN IS DISSOLVED AND MELTED – NOT UNTIL THE
WHOLE NATURE HAS YIELDED AND BECOME SUBJECT UNTO ITS HIGHER SELF CAN THE
BLOOM OPEN.</p><p><br></p><p>When the storm has gone, the bloom will open. But it was getting
ready while the storm was there. Through the storm it was getting ready
to bloom. It was gathering energy, life, vitality. It was getting ready
to burst forth. The storm is the soil. Without it the flower cannot
bloom.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN WILL COME A CALM SUCH AS COMES IN A TROPICAL COUNTRY AFTER THE
HEAVY RAIN.<span class=s4></span>AND IN THE DEEP SILENCE THE
MYSTERIOUS EVENT WILL OCCUR WHICH WILL</p><p>PROVE THAT THE WAY HAS BEEN FOUND.</p><p><br></p><p>Only by passing through the storm will you come to a spot within you
which comes IN A TROPICAL COUNTRY AFTER THE HEAVY RAIN. Remember this
deeply. It will be of much help to you.</p><p><br></p><p>With every suffering, you are creating the possibility of some
ecstasy. The ecstasy will follow right after it. But if you are too
engaged with the suffering, you may miss it. If you are ill, after that
illness a moment of health, a moment of well-being, will come to you.
But you can be too concerned with the illness so that when the moment
comes you may miss it – you are too involved with the past illness that
is no more. The moment is momentary; you can miss it very easily. After
every pain, the moment comes and visits you.</p><p><br></p><p>After every suffering, ecstasy comes to your door and knocks; but you
go on missing it because the past is so heavy. You are still ill even
after the illness has gone. It continues in the memory, it clouds your
mind, and you miss that atomic moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this: Whenever you are depressed, wait for the moment that
the depression goes. Nothing lasts forever; the depression will go. And
when it leaves you, wait – be aware and alert – because after the
depression, after the night, there will be a dawn and the sun will rise.
If you can be alert in that moment. you will he happy that you were
depressed. You will be grateful that you are depressed because only
through your depression was this mint of happiness possible</p><p><br></p><p>But what do we do? We move in an infinite regression We yet
depressed. Then we yet depressed because of the depression: a second
depression follows. If you are depressed. that’s okay! – nothing is
wrong in it. It is beautiful because through it you will learn and
mature. But then you feel badly. “Why do I get depressed? I should not
get depressed.” Then you start fighting with the depression. The first
depression is good, but the second depression is unreal. And this unreal
depression will cloud your mind. You will miss the moment that would
have followed the real depression.</p><p><br></p><p>When depressed, be depressed. Simply be depressed. Don’t get
depressed about your depression. When depressed, simply be depressed.
Don’t fight it, don’t create any diversion, don’t force it to go. Just
allow it to happen; it will go by itself. Life is a flux; nothing
remains the same. You are not needed; the river moves by itself, you
don’t have to push it. If you are trying to push it, you are simply
foolish. The river flows by itself. Allow it to flow.</p><p><br></p><p>When depression is there, allow it to be. Don’t get depressed about
it. If you want to remove it sooner, you will get depressed. If you
fight it, you will create a secondary depression that is dangerous. The
first depression is beautiful, God-given. The second depression is your
own. It is not God-given; it is mental. Then you will move in mental
grooves. They are infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>If you get depressed, be happy that you are depressed and allow the
depression to be. Then suddenly the depression will disappear and there
will be a breakthrough. No clouds will be there and the sky will be
clear. For a single moment, heaven opens for you. If you are not
depressed about your depression you can contact, you can commune, you
can enter this heavenly gate. And once you know it, you have learned one
of the ultimate laws of life: that life uses the opposite as a teacher,
as a back-ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is wrong; everything is for the good. This is what I call a
religious attitude. You may not believe in God – that makes no
difference. Buddha never believed in God. Mahavir never believed in God
but they were religious. There is no need to believe in an afterlife no
need. You can still be religious. There is no need even to believe in a
soul. You can be religious without believing in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is religion? Religion means this trust: that everything is
for the good. This trust that everything is for the good is a religious
mind; this is religiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you trust that everything is for the good, you will come to
realize the divine. The divine can be realized through such trust. Even
the storm is for the sake of the silence. Evil exists for the sake of
good; death exists for the sake of life; suffering and agony are just
situations in which ecstasy can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at life in this way and the moment will not be far off when
suffering will disappear completely, when pain will disappear
completely, when death will disappear completely. One who knows that
agony exists for the sake of ecstasy cannot be agonized. One who knows
and feels and realizes that suffering exists for the sake of happiness
cannot be made to suffer. It is impossible. He is using suffering itself
to be more happy, he is using agony itself as a step toward ecstasy. He
has gone beyond the clutches of the world, he has taken a jump out of
the wheel of sansar.</p><p><br></p><p>“The opening of the bloom is the glorious moment when perception
awakes: with it comes confidence, knowledge, certainty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“... When the disciple is ready to learn, then he is accepted,
acknowledged, recognized. It must be so, for he has lit his lamp, and it
cannot be hidden.”</p><p><br></p><p>THESE WRITTEN ABOVE ARE THE FIRST OF THE RULES WHICH ARE WRITTEN ON
THE WALLS OF THE HALL OF LEARNING. THOSE THAT ASK SHALL HAVE. THOSE THAT
DESIRE TO READ SHALL READ. THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN.</p><p><br></p><p>PEACE BE WITH YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Two things more to be understood: “The opening of the bloom is the
glorious moment when perception awakes: with it comes confidence,
knowledge, certainty. Unless you experience you cannot be certain.
Unless you experience, you have not known. Unless you experience.
there</p><p><br></p><p>cannot be faith. Before you have experienced, all belief is false.
all certainty is just a facade all knowledge is just information and
nothing else. Remember. before you experience something for yourself,
don’t be too certain about it, because too much certainty is just a
trick of the mind to hide the uncertainty within. Before you experience
something for yourself don’t say that you know it, because your
knowledge is just a trick to hide your ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have read the Gita, you may have read the Koran, you may have
read the Bible. Then you know ‘about’, but you don’t know. You can know
much about God but it doesn’t mean anything unless you know God. To know
‘about’ is not knowledge. You can know what Jesus has said but this is
borrowed, secondary, useless. You can repeat what Krishna has said but
it’s just mechanical. You can memorize it, you can know it by heart, but
it is never in the heart; it remains in the memory. Memory is
mechanical; it is not knowledge. Knowledge comes only through your own
experience. Insist on your own experience. If you insist, you will gain
it.</p><p><br></p><p>THOSE THAT ASK SHALL HAVE. But you never ask; you become contented
with borrowed knowledge. You never say, “I must be allowed to know
myself.” If you ask, the existence is ready to give; but you are
contented with books, with scriptures, with borrowed information. You
never ask for the real.</p><p><br></p><p>Ask for the real. And the real means your experience, your own.
Buddhas are of no help. They can just show the way, but you have to
travel by your own feet Insist on your own knowledge, your own
experience. Never be contented before that.</p><p><br></p><p>THOSE THAT DESIRE TO READ SHALL READ. If you are very insistent on
reading the ultimate laws, they will be opened unto you. The real Bible
is not in the Bible, the real Koran is not in the Koran, the real Gita
is not in the Gita. The real Bible or the Koran or the Gita is written
in existence, in life itself. If you don’t believe in the scriptures,
the real scriptures will be opened unto you.</p><p><br></p><p>Insist that “I want to read in existence,” and the moment will be
given to you. But if you don’t insist, if you carry a dead book and are
content, then existence is not going to force. The existence is
absolutely nonviolent; it will not force you. You can remain with your
scriptures, and if you are happy it is okay. But you are living in a
false world, you are living in words. Open the book of existence. Throw
all scriptures so that the real scripture can be encountered.</p><p><br></p><p>THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN. Learning is difficult because
learning means yielding, learning means surrendering, learning means
becoming like a womb, becoming feminine, allowing the existence to enter
in you. But, THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LEARN SHALL LEARN.</p><p><br></p><p>We also desire, but not to learn. We desire to collect more
information. That’s not learning.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me and they say, “We come to the meditation camps
because many new things become known to us here.” They collect
information, they collect some words, and then they go away happy. They
are stupid. And their happiness is suicidal because whatsoever I say is
of no use unless you experience it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can carry my words. Then you are carrying a dead weight. You will
be burdened by it; you will not be freed. My words cannot free you. They
may even imprison you, they may become fetters for you.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been better if you had not come. Whatsoever I am saying
is not to be remembered. It is to be experienced. And if you experience
it, it becomes your own. Then those words don’t belong to me anymore.
Now that experience has become your own. Now you know something through
your own eyes, now you feel something through your own heart. This is
knowledge. And this gives certainty and this gives faith.</p><p><br></p><p>PEACE BE WITH YOU – because only in peace the divine becomes
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

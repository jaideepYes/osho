‌CHAPTER 1
Polishing the Mirror of the Heart
1 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
WE TRIED REASONING OUR WAY TO HIM:
IT DIDN’T WORK;
BUT THE MOMENT WE GAVE UP, NO OBSTACLE REMAINED.
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO US OUT OF KINDNESS: HOW ELSE COULD WE HAVE KNOWN HIM?
REASON TOOK US AS FAR AS THE DOOR; BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENCE THAT LET US IN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Something To Be Remembered
10 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE MASSES WERE AGAINST JESUS, THEY WERE AGAINST BUDDHA, THEY ARE AGAINST YOU. WHY?
The masses live in a kind of non-individual existence. They live like sheep. So whenever a man like Jesus or Buddha is there, asserting his individuality, his rebellion, his freedom, he is naturally disliked. The masses become afraid; their foundations are shaken.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
On the Altar of the Real
2 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
TODAY IN LECTURE I LOOKED AT YOU AND I FELT MYSELF SO SHALLOW AND PHONEY AND FALSE. THERE DOESN’T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING DEEPER INSIDE OF ME. DO THESE FEELINGS SHOW THAT I DON’T HAVE A CENTER YET? IT ALSO SHOCKS ME THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE MY FACE AT THE MOMENT.</description>

Crying For The Light
3 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
HE DOESN’T KNOW HIS OWN SELF:
HOW SHOULD HE KNOW THE SELF OF ANOTHER? HE KNOWS ONLY HIS HANDS AND FEET,
HOW SHOULD HE KNOW ABOUT GOD? THIS IS BEYOND THE SAGE’S GRASP: YOU MUST BE A FOOL
IF YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT. WHEN YOU CAN EXPOUND ON THIS,</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
A Pearl of Exceeding Beauty
4 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
BUDDHA DID NOT HAVE A MASTER, JESUS DID NOT HAVE A MASTER, YOU DID NOT HAVE A MASTER. WHY DO WE NEED A MASTER?
Devamo, because you are not yet capable of allowing life to be your master. Because you don’t know how to listen, how to learn.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The Fire Test
5 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE PURE MAN UNITES TWO IN ONE;
THE LOVER UNITES THREE IN ONE.
BUT I AM FRIGHTENED
LEST YOUR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY LEAVE YOU STRANDED ON THE BRIDGE. HE IS THE PROVIDER
OF BOTH FAITH AND WORLDLY GOODS; HE IS NONE OTHER
THAN THE DISPOSER OF OUR LIVES.
HE IS NO TYRANT:</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
The Bridge of Love and Laughter
6 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
BELOVED MASTER,
Question 1
WHAT IS CREATIVITY?
Deva Mohan, action is not creativity, inaction also is not creativity. Creativity is a very paradoxical state of consciousness and being: it is action through inaction, it is what Lao Tzu calls WEI-WU-WEI. It is allowing something to happen through you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Cooked and Burnt
7 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
A RUBY, THERE, IS JUST A PIECE OF STONE:
AND SPIRITUAL EXCELLENCE THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY. SILENCE IS PRAISE – HAVE DONE WITH SPEECH;
YOUR CHATTER WILL ONLY BRING YOU HARM AND SORROW – HAVE DONE!
BELIEF AND UNBELIEF BOTH HAVE THEIR ORIGIN
IN YOUR HYPOCRITE’S HEART; THE WAY IS ONLY LONG</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
The Great Palace of Consciousness
8 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
CAN COWARDICE AND HYPOCRISY ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL? CAN I ACCEPT EVEN MY COWARDICE, MY HYPOCRISY, MY MISERLINESS AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS PRIVACY THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE CALLED “IDIOCY”? AND IF I ACCEPT SUCH TENDENCIES, ALL OF WHICH TEND TO BOTTLE ME UP, HOW WILL I GET FREE?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
A Wedding and a Wake
9 November 1978 am in Buddha Hall
FOR THE WISE MAN EVIL AND GOOD
ARE BOTH EXCEEDING GOOD.
NO EVIL EVER COMES FROM GOD; WHENEVER YOU THINK TO SEE EVIL PROCEEDING FROM HIM,
YOU WERE BETTER TO LOOK ON IT AS GOOD.
I’M AFRAID THAT ON THE WAY OF FAITH,
YOU ARE LIKE A SQUINTER SEEING DOUBLE,</description>

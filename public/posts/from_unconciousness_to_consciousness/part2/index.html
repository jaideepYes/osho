JESUS SAYS, “COME FOLLOW ME.” YOU’RE AGAINST THIS STATEMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT?\nJesus says, “Come follow me.” It is not only Jesus who says it: Krishna says it too, Buddha says it too. All the old religions of the world are based on that statement. But that statement is a psychological exploitation of man. I cannot say, “Come follow me.”\nFirst, those who have said it have crippled humanity, have made humanity helpless. They certainly fulfilled a certain need. People don’t want to be on their own. They don’t have the guts to create their own path, to walk and create it. They want to be led. But they don’t know that if you are being led, slowly slowly, even if you have eyes, you will lose them. You will be seeing through the eyes of Jesus, Krishna, Mohammed. Your eyes will not be needed; in fact your eyes will cause a disturbance.\nThe leader wants you to surrender your eyes and see through his eyes; surrender your legs and walk with his legs; to not believe in yourself but believe in him. To me it is a crime; it is crippling you, paralyzing you, destroying you. And you can see it all over the world. The whole of humanity is destroyed by such statements and such people.\nI can say to you, “Come and share me,” but I cannot say, “Follow me.” Who am I that you have to follow?\nAnd you have to understand also that each individual is so unique that if you start following somebody you will be automatically imitating. You will lose your identity. You will start becoming phony, a hypocrite. You will not be yourself, but somebody else. You will become split.\nYou will have a mask: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. That will be just the mask that you and the person you have been following have created – it is not your authentic face. You are going against yourself, and you will be in suffering... and the whole of humanity is in suffering.\nIt sounds very strange to say that such statements are criminal, because they come from nice people like Jesus, Buddha, Confucius. You can understand my difficulty too. I have to say it the way it is.\nEvery child is trying to imitate his parents, his neighbors, his schoolfriends, his teachers... and they are all trying to enforce it.\nI remember in my own childhood. It was just an accident that I was born in a Jaina family. That is a very ancient religion in India, perhaps the ancientmost religion in the world. But my father was certainly a human being. He used to take me to the temple, but he told me that I need not imitate him. He had followed the ways of his forefathers and he had not found anything. He said to me, “I cannot force you to follow my ways. I can make you acquainted – that this is the way I have followed, these are the gods I have been bowing down to, these are the prayers I have been doing, but nothing has happened to me. I will not insist that you do it; on the contrary, I will insist that unless you feel to do something, never do it.\nI have never followed anybody and it has paid me tremendously.\nIt has been the greatest benediction to me that can be possible for a human being: not following. I have tried to remain just myself.\nYou will need courage. You will need intelligence. You will need a true search and seeking; then only can you risk. Otherwise there are people all around you, they are all salesmen.…\nNow, Jesus is just a salesman, saying, “Come follow me, because those who will follow me will find God, will find heaven and all the pleasures therein. And those who will not follow me will fall into dark hell for eternity.” Now, this man is not going to help anybody. He is exploiting your need for guidelines, your need to find a path; basically, your need to have a certain meaning in your life. And he is promising that, “I am ready to give it to you. All that you have to do is to believe in me, unquestionably, without any doubt. All that is needed on your part is absolute faith.”\nTo ask anybody to believe is to cripple his intelligence, is to make him mediocre, is to condemn him to remain an idiot forever.\nA Christian cannot ask, “What is God? What is all this nonsense about the holy ghost?” And he does not seem to be very holy either. He is a rapist; he rapes the virgin Mary. And this trinity: God, son and holy ghost – they have not allowed a single woman in it. Without a mother, the son is born.… In the trinity there is no possibility for a woman. Nobody has asked, “And what are the proofs that you are the only begotten son?” But you are not supposed to ask, you are supposed to believe. It\nis a bargain. He will give you, after death, all the pleasures of life; all imaginable fantasies will be fulfilled. And you will be surprised what kind of fantasies these religious people have been offering to fulfill.\nMohammed says in his paradise – and remember, the English word paradise comes from the Arabic firdous; it is basically Mohammedan – in his paradise, there are rivers of wine. “Drink as much as you want, drown yourself, swim in the wine.” And there are beautiful women available who remain always young, stuck at the age of sixteen. They are still sixteen. Whenever you will go, they will be sixteen; they don’t grow. And not only that – because in Mohammedan countries homosexuality has been a very long tradition Mohammed promises young, beautiful boys also, for the great saints.\nIt is a bargain. You remain crippled, unintelligent, mediocre, stupid – and after death you will achieve everything. And nobody knows what happens after death. Nobody has ever returned and told what happens after death. So they are doing such a fabulous business – they are selling such a commodity, which is invisible, intangible, and what they are taking in return is your whole humanity, your whole integrity. They are destroying you completely.\nI can say, “Come and share me.” That is a totally different standpoint. I have known something.\nI have seen something.\nI have lived something.\nAnd I can share it with you.\nAnd remember, I am not obliging you when I share it with you; you are obliging me, because when a cloud is heavy with rainwater, the earth is obliging it by receiving the water. I say to you: I am heavy with some ecstasy, some blissfulness. And it is not a question of a bargain after death. I am not promising you something in the future, and I am not asking you anything in return, not even a thank-you, because I am grateful to you that you shared with me.\nMy religion is a religion of sharing, not of following. It is a religion of love.\nThe very idea of following makes me sick. It is sickening. You have to be yourself, and when you blossom, you are not going to be like me or like Jesus or like Buddha. You are going to be just like you: you have never happened before, and you are not going to happen again. It is only possible with you. You are unrepeatable. If you start following somebody you are missing a great opportunity that existence has provided for you, and you will never be happy. No Christian is happy, no Hindu is happy, no Buddhist is happy; they cannot be. How can you be happy?\nJust think in this way: if the roseflower tries to become a lotus, the lotus tries to become a rose, both will be in tremendous suffering because neither can the rose become the lotus nor can the lotus become the rose. At the most they can pretend, and pretensions are not fulfilling. The roseflower can only be a roseflower. And the unfortunate thing is, when the roseflower starts trying to be a lotus, its energy goes into that effort of becoming a lotus. A lotus it can never become, it has no\npotential for it. It is not a lotus, and there is no need for it to be a lotus. If existence wanted a lotus there would have been a lotus. The existence needs a rose. Trying to be a lotus, the rose will be losing its energy in a fruitless, hopeless effort, and perhaps may not be able to even become a rose. From where will it find the energy to become a rose, the vitality to become a rose?\nIt is one of the most important psychological phenomena to understand: each individual is unique. There has never been that kind of individual before, and there will never be again that kind of individual.\nIf you follow somebody you are betraying existence because you are betraying your own innermost being. You are betraying your flowering. And why do people so easily become followers? Why is the whole world following somebody or other? And if sometimes one becomes fed up with Christianity, he becomes Hindu; the Hindu becomes fed up with Hinduism, he becomes a Buddhist... but the following continues. The whole pattern remains the same. The book changes, the leader changes, but the following, the follower... and the whole process remains the same, the same destructive suicidal process.\nI am against following because it is against the basic psychological principle of the uniqueness of the individual.\nYou should pay a little more attention to the word individual. It means indivisible – it cannot be divided. The moment you follow, you are dividing. You are something, you are trying to become something else; you are somewhere, you are trying to reach somewhere else. Now you are creating a tension in your being. Hence the anguish all over the world.\nMy religion is not the religion of following. I can only share with you whatever has happened to me. And I am not saying that the same will happen to you. I am simply saying that if I can see, you can also see. If I can feel, you can also feel. Certainly, you will feel in your own way and you will see in your own way. The poetry that will be born to you will be your poetry, it will not be mine.\nSo the people you see here around me are not my followers. I am nobody’s leader. That silly word leader is perfectly okay in politics, but not in religion. In politics, of course, you need idiots. The greater idiot leads the smaller idiots. But in religion, a flowering of intelligence is needed, not idiocy. So my work is basically of sharing. It is just... I would like to tell you an old, beautiful parable.\nA lioness gives birth to a child in a crowd of sheep. The child grows amongst the sheep and naturally believes that he is a sheep – what else can the young lion do? One day an old lion, just passing by the crowd of sheep, looks at this miracle: a young, beautiful lion just walking in the middle of a crowd of sheep. Neither the sheep are afraid of him, nor is he in any way behaving differently.\nThe old lion becomes interested. He runs after the young lion. It is with great difficulty that he catches hold of him because the young lion escapes, just like every other sheep escapes. But finally he catches hold of him. The young lion starts crying and weeping, like a sheep. And the old lion says, “Stop all this nonsense!” He takes him to a nearby pond, drags him by his side to the pond, forces him to look into the water... and suddenly the young lion roars like a lion.\nThe old lion has not done anything. He has just shown him his face, his real face, and he has recognized that he is a lion – he is not a sheep. And just that recognition is enough. It is transforming.\nThe old lion has not done anything at all. He has not told the young lion to “follow me,” to “imitate me,” and “These are the commandments for you, and this is the character you have to attain, and these are the principles, and these are the things you have not to do.” He has not done anything of that sort.\nThat is the function of the master: just to bring you so close to his own experience that something transpires in you.\nA sudden lion’s roar... and the transformation, and you are yourself – neither a Hindu, nor a Mohammedan, nor a Christian. But the world wants a mob, a crowd. It is afraid of the individual because every authentic individual is bound to be a rebel, because he will insist on being himself.\nAdolf Hitler would not like individuals, nor does Jesus like individuals. And the strange thing is that even Jesus cannot understand that he is not liked by the Jews. He was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew, he died as a Jew. Remember, he had never heard the word Christian in his life. He was never a Christian, because the word christ does not exist in the Aramaic language that he spoke, which was his mother tongue. Nor does the word exist in Hebrew, which was the language of the learned rabbis.\nIt was three hundred years after Jesus, when The Bible was translated into Greek, that the word messiah, from Hebrew, was translated as christ. It was after three hundred years that the word christ became significant, and after Christ of course the followers became Christians.\nBut Jesus was not a Christian, and his only crime was that he was himself an individual, trying to live authentically his own way of life, not bothering much about the tradition. That’s why the Jews were so very angry. They would have loved him, they would have made him a great rabbi, but he tried his individual way, not the traditional way. He had to die on the cross just because he insisted on being an individual.\nI am surprised that even such a man who suffered because of his individuality is again making the same mistake with other people: asking them to follow him. That’s what the rabbis were asking Jesus, “Follow us, don’t try to be on your own.” They were saying, “Follow Abraham, follow Moses, follow Ezekiel.” They were asking Jesus, “What is your authority?” And Jesus says, “I am my authority.”\nThis is how an individual should speak: “I am my authority – and I am before Abraham was.” Abraham was three thousand years before Christ, and he says, “I am before Abraham was.” He is simply proclaiming that he does not belong to the tradition, that he is a flowering on his own accord.\nBut even Jesus could not see that he is making the same mistake that the rabbis were making. And of course the popes have been repeating the same mistake. If Jesus could not see, then how can you hope that popes will be able to see? They are just blind followers. They are trying to convert the whole world into a Christian world; they are not satisfied that you already have so many Christians – and what have you attained? What has man gained through it?\nMore blood has been shed by Christians than by anybody else, more wars have been fought by Christians than by anybody else. People have been massacred, butchered, burned alive by\nChristians... and they are all following Jesus! They are really following those Jews who had crucified Jesus. They have been crucifying other individuals; whoever asserts his individuality, they have been crucifying him.\nMy way is not the way of following anybody.\nIt is just sick to be a follower. It is just sick to be a leader. The leader is somehow not certain about his authentic individuality. He wants followers because if he has followers then he becomes more certain he must be right. If so many people are following him, how can he be wrong? Alone he becomes suspicious. Alone doubts arise: Who knows whether he is right or wrong? He needs followers. It is his need that followers should be there. The greater the number of followers around him, the more satisfied and contented he is. He knows he is right; otherwise how can so many people be following him? That is the logic.\nAnd why are the followers with him? They are seeing his contented, authoritative statements, his determined effort, unwavering. Now, when Jesus says, “I am the only begotten son of God,” with authority, naturally the poor people.… Who were the people who followed him? Have you ever thought about it? The twelve apostles – who were these people? All uneducated: fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters. Only Judas was a little educated; so he betrayed him. All the others were absolutely uneducated, poor people in search of somebody who could hold their hand and could give them a certain strength that they were lacking in themselves.\nThe followers feel it is a mutual conspiracy. Perhaps both are unaware: the leader is unaware that he needs followers to feel comfortable with his own idea, with his own fiction, and the follower is unaware of why he is following this man. He is following because the leader looks so authoritative, and he himself, the follower, feels so wavering, so doubtful, so untrusting. He thinks it is better to be with a man who knows. They are supporting each other.\nI don’t need any followers because whatsoever I know, I know; and whatsoever I am, I am.\nEven if the whole world is against me it will not create a single doubt in me, not a single question in me. They have all disappeared.\nI am absolutely at ease with myself and with existence. I don’t need any followers, and I insist that knowingly or unknowingly you should not fall in the trap of being a follower, because then you will never be able to be authentically yourself, an individual flowering.\nCommunism has created an idea in the world that every man is equal, which is absolutely absurd. Every man is so unique that he cannot be equal to anybody else. That does not mean that he is higher or lower; that simply means everybody is unique. And there is no question of comparison, the comparison does not arise. The rose is perfectly beautiful being a rose; the lotus is perfectly beautiful being a lotus. The grass leaf is perfectly beautiful being a grass leaf.\nIf you remove man from the earth, the grass leaf, the rose, the lotus will not have different values. They will be all equally unique. The winds will not behave differently with them, the sun will not shine differently on them, the clouds will not rain differently on them. It is man and his stupidity that brings the idea of comparison, of higher, of lower; and then the question that – no, everybody is\nequal. Neither man is higher than anybody else, nor is he lower than anybody else, nor is he equal to anybody else.\nRemember, my third point is of utmost importance: everybody is unique. And I respect this uniqueness.\nHow can I say to you, “Come and follow me”? Out of respect I can only say, “Come and share with me. Share my abundance.”\nAnd the beauty is that the more you share the inner riches, the more you have them. The more you give, the more you have them. If you hoard them, you will lose them. So nobody who attains to inner blissfulness can hoard it. Hoarding kills it. He has to share it, it is an absolute necessity to share it. Only by sharing it remains alive and flowing. And more and more it goes on coming to you. One is simply amazed.\nOrdinary economics do not work here. If you have money and you give to people, of course you will have less money. That is ordinary economics. But if you have silence, peace, love, joy, ecstasy – give it and see what happens. The more you give it, the more existence goes on pouring it in you.\nSo you are not obliged to me, I am obliged to you. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?\nI do not believe in believing. That has to be understood first.\nNobody asks me, “Do you believe in the sun? Do you believe in the moon?” Nobody asks me that question. Millions of people I have met, and for thirty years continuously I have answered thousands of questions. Nobody asks me, “Do you believe in the roseflower?” There is no need. You can see: the roseflower is there or it is not there. Only fictions, not facts, have to be believed.\nGod is the greatest fiction that man has created. Hence you have to believe in him. And why does man have to create this fiction of God? There must be some inner necessity. I don’t have that necessity so there is no question. But let me explain to you why people have believed in God.\nOne of the significant things to understand about man’s mind is that the mind is always seeking and searching some meaning in life. If there is no meaning, suddenly you feel then what are you doing here? Then why go on living? Then why go on breathing? Then why tomorrow morning have you to get up again and go through the same routine – the tea, the breakfast, the same wife, the same children, the same phony kiss to the wife, and the same office, and the same work, and comes the evening, and bored, utterly bored, you are back home – why go on doing all this? The mind has a question: Is there any meaning in all this, or are you just vegetating?\nSo man has been searching for meaning. He created God as a fiction to fulfill his need for meaning. Without God, the world becomes accidental. It is no more a creation of a wise God who creates it\nfor your growth, for your development, or for something. Without God – remove God and the world is accidental, meaningless. And the mind has an intrinsic incapacity to live with meaninglessness, so it creates all kinds of fictions – God, nirvana, heaven, paradise, other life beyond death – and makes a whole system. But it is a fiction, to fulfill a certain psychological need.\nI cannot say, “There is God.” I cannot say, “There is not God.” To me the question is irrelevant. It is a fictitious phenomenon. My work is totally different.\nMy work is to make your mind so mature that you can live with meaningless life, and yet beautifully.\nWhat is the meaning of a rose, or a cloud floating in the sky? There is no meaning but there is such tremendous beauty. There is no meaning. The river goes on flowing but there is so much joy, meaning is not needed. And unless a man is able to live without asking for meaning, moment to moment, beautifully, blissfully, for no reason at all.Just to breathe is enough. Why should you ask\nfor what? Why do you make life a business?\nIs not love enough? Have you to ask what is the meaning of love? And if there is no meaning in love, then of course your life becomes loveless. You ask a wrong question. Love is in itself enough; it needs no other meaning to make it beautiful, a joy. The birds singing in the morning.what is the\nmeaning? The whole existence, to me, is meaningless. And the more I became silent and became attuned with the existence, the more it became clear that there is no need for meaning. It is enough as it is.\nDon’t create fictions. Once you create a fiction then you have to create a thousand and one other fictions to support it, because it has no support in reality.\nFor example: there are religions which believe in God, and there are religions which do not believe in God. So God is not a necessity for religion. Buddhism does not believe in God, Jainism does not believe in God. So try to understand, because in the West it is a problem. You are aware only of three religions which are all rooted in Judaism: Christianity, Judaism and Mohammedanism. All three believe in God. So you are not aware of Buddha. He never believed in God.\nI am reminded of H.G.Wells, his statement about Gautam Buddha. He said, “He is the most godless person, yet the most godly.” A godless person, and godly? Do you think there is any contradiction? There is no contradiction. Buddha never believed in God, there was no need. He was so utterly fulfilled that his whole fulfillment became a fragrance around him. Mahavira never believed in God, yet his life was as divine as life can be.\nSo when I say God is a fiction, please do not misunderstand me. God is a fiction but godliness is not a fiction; that is a quality. ‘God’ is a person.as a person it is a fiction. There is no God sitting in\nheaven creating the world. And do you think a God will create such a mess that you call the world? Then what is left for the devil? If anybody has created this world it must be the devil, it cannot be God.\nBut fictions – and old fictions, repeated millions of times – start taking a reality of their own. It has been repeated so much that you don’t even ask what kind of world God has created, what kind of man God has created. This mad humanityIn three thousand years man has fought five thousand\nwars. This is a creation of God? And still man is preparing for the total, suicidal, ultimate war. ‘God’ is behind it.\nAnd what kind of foolish fictions can become realities once you start believing in them! ‘God’ created the world – Christians think it was exactly four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ. Of course it must have been a Monday morning, the first of January, I assume – because The Bible says so. Now there are proofs, a thousand and one proofs, that this earth is millions of years old. We have found, hidden in the earth, animals millions of years old and even man’s fossilized bodies, thousands of years old. But what has the last pope said about it? He said, “The world was created exactly as it is said in The Bible.” Four thousand and four years before Jesus? That means six thousand years ago. All the evidence goes against it.\nIn India we have found cities which are seven thousand years old. In India we have the Vedas which are at least ten thousand years old, according to the very scientific approach. According to the Hindus they are ninety thousand years old, because in the Vedas there is a mention of a certain state of the stars which happened ninety thousand years ago. Now, how can that be described in the Vedas if they are not ninety thousand years old?\nBut what has the last pope said? He said, “God created the world with all these things. Everything is possible for him; he created the world four thousand and four years before Jesus, with animal bodies looking millions of years old.” Everything is possible for ‘God’. One fiction, then you have to support it with another fiction, and you can go to the point of absurdity. And why? Again and again man has asked this question.\nA simple, very simple argument has been behind it. You see an earthen pot. You know it cannot be created by itself; there must have been a potter. This has been the simple argument of all these religions: that if even a single earthen pot cannot be created by itself and needs a potter to create it, this vast universe needs a creator. And it has satisfied the simple human mind. But it cannot satisfy a sophisticated, rational mind.\nIf you say the universe needs a God to create it, then the question is bound to arise, “Who created God?” And then you fall into a regress absurdum. Then God one is created by God two, and God two is created by God three, and God three by God four, and then there can be no end. I don’t want to be absurd like that. It is better to stop the first fiction; otherwise you are sowing the seeds for other fictions.\nI say existence itself is enough, it needs no creator. It is creativity itself.\nSo rather than asking me do I believe in a creator, you should ask me what is my substitute for God, the creator. My substitute is the existential energy of creativity.\nAnd to me, to be creative is the most important religious quality.\nIf you create a song, if you create music, if you create a garden, you are being religious. Going to the church is foolish, but creating a garden is tremendously religious. That’s why here in my commune, work is called worship. We don’t pray in any other way, we pray only through creating something. To me, creativity is God. But it will be better if you allow me to change the word god\ninto godliness, because I don’t want to be misunderstood. There is no person like God, but there is tremendous energy – exploding, unending, expanding. This expanding, unending, exploding energy, this creativity, is divine.\nI know it; I don’t believe in it.\nI have tasted it; I don’t believe in it.\nI have touched it, I have breathed it.\nI have known it in the deepest core of my being.\nAnd it is as much in you as it is in me. Just a look inwards, just a little one hundred and eighty degree turn, and you become aware of a truth. Then you don’t ask for beliefs. Only blind people believe in light. Those who have eyes... they don’t believe in light; they simply see it.\nI don’t want you to believe in anything, I want you to have eyes; and when you can have eyes why be satisfied with a belief and remain blind? And you are not blind. Perhaps you are only keeping your eyes closed. Perhaps nobody has told you that you can open your eyes. Then you live in darkness, and in darkness you ask, “Does light exist?”\nI am reminded of a small story in Buddha’s life. A man was brought to Gautam Buddha who was blind, but was a very logical man. He was so logical that his village and the pundits of the village became utterly fed up with his logic. They could not prove to him that light exists. The whole village knew; everybody saw it, only the blind logician was unable to see it. But he was a very logical man. He said, “Anything that exists can be touched. Bring light – I would like to touch it. Anything that exists, you can hit it with something, it will make sound. Let me hear the sound of your light being hit by something. If it has any smell bring it to my nose, I can smell it. If it has any taste, I can taste it. These are the four possibilities with me.”\nNow, you cannot taste light, and you cannot create a sound out of it, and you cannot smell it, and you cannot touch it. And the blind logician would laugh and he would say, “You just want to prove me blind, hence you have created this fiction of light. There is no light. You are all blind just like me; you are befooling yourself.”\nBuddha was passing by the side of the village, so the villagers thought, “It is a good opportunity; let us take this logician to Gautam Buddha, perhaps he may be able to help.”\nBuddha listened to the whole story and he said, “The blind man is right, and you are all wrong, because what he needs is not argumentation; he needs medicine for his eyes to be cured. And you have brought him to the wrong person. Take him to a physician.”\nBuddha had his own personal physician who was provided by a great king, Bimbisara, to take care of Buddha’s body. So Buddha said, “You need not go far to find a great physician, I have one with me. You can show the blind man to him.” And he left the physician in the village and he moved on. In three months the blind man’s eyes were opened. He was not really blind – just a small disease; a small, thin layer was covering his vision. It was removed. He came dancing. He fell at Buddha’s\nfeet and he said, “If they had not brought me to you, my whole life I would have argued against light. And they would not have been able to prove it.”\nGodliness is not something that argument can prove or disprove. It is something that you can experience.\nYou will be surprised to know that the word medicine and the word meditation come from the same root. Medicine cures the body, meditation cures your being; it is the inner medicine.\nI have experienced godliness everywhere, because nothing else exists. But there is no God. And if you want to experience godliness – just a little bit of meditation, a little bit of becoming thoughtless and remaining aware. When your awareness is there and thoughts start dropping like leaves in the fall, and when there is only awareness and there is not a single thought there, you will have the taste, the very taste on your tongue, of what I am saying. And unless you have tasted, don’t believe me; don’t believe anyone, because belief can become a beggar. You may become satisfied with the belief, and you may never try.\nI just heard yesterday... Sheela told me President Reagan wants one minute’s silence in every school, college and institution. The idea is great, but I don’t know whether Reagan understands what it means, one minute’s silence. He must be meaning simply one minute keeping quiet, not speaking. Not speaking is not silence. You may not be speaking, you may not be uttering anything, but inside a thousand and one thoughts are running. There is a continuous flow of thoughts, day in, day out.\nI would like to tell President Reagan first to try one minute’s silence. That means for one minute no thought moves on the screen of awareness. It is not easy. It is one of the most difficult things in the world. But it can happen if you continue to try.\nAnd if it happens for one minute, that’s enough. If for one minute you can be in a state where no thought movesThis has been my whole life’s work, teaching people how to be silent.\nPeople have tried keeping a watch by their side: not even twenty seconds – one minute is too big, not even twenty seconds can they remain without thought. One thought after another, running.And\neven if they can remain for twenty seconds, the thought comes, “Aha! Twenty seconds!” Finished – the thought has come.\nIf you can be silent for one minute, you have learned the art. Then you can be silent for two minutes, because it is the same; the second minute is not different from the first. You can be silent for three minutes; all the minutes are the same.\nOnce you know the wayand the way is not something which can be told to you; you have to just\nsit with closed eyes and start watching your thoughts. In the beginning there will be a great rush hour, but slowly you will find the street is less and less crowded; less cars are passing, less thoughts are passing, less people are passing, gaps are becoming bigger. If one continues patiently, in three months’ time he will certainly be able to attain one minute’s silence.\nI don’t know if President Reagan has ever tasted it, because any man who can taste silence will not try to be a president of a country, cannot be in politics. It is not for meditators, it is for mediocres. It is for all kinds of fools and idiots.\nI have heard: before Reagan became president he used to have a monkey... I have just heard, I don’t know whether it is true or not. The day Ronald Reagan was elected president one of my American sannyasins brought a picture to me of Ronald Reagan with his monkey, and he said, “Reagan is declared president today – what is your comment?”\nI looked at the picture for a long time. The sannyasin appeared puzzled and asked, “What is the matter? What are you looking at in the picture?”\nI said to him, “I cannot figure out who is Reagan and who is the monkey. Out of these two fellows, who has been elected the president?”\nHe laughed and showed me a picture of Reagan, and I still remember my comment, that “It would have been better if the monkey had been chosen as president.” Surely the Kremlin would have followed immediately and would have chosen a monkey as their prime minister. They cannot tolerate America being ahead of them. And one thing is absolutely certain: that with a monkey in the White House and a monkey in the Kremlin, the world would be saved from a third world war, which is going to destroy the whole of humanity and the whole of life on earth.\nPoliticians are monkeys. In fact monkeys should forgive me – they are worse. But the idea is good; once in a while, even in a monkey’s mind a good idea can come. But if he really means it, I can provide the people who can teach every university, every college and school, how to be silent. I can send my sannyasins all over America to teach silence.\nOkay Sheela?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6478","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_unconciousness_to_consciousness/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_unconciousness_to_consciousness/>From Unconciousness to Consciousness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Don\'t Follow Me \-- Because I am Lost Myself</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6478 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Unconciousness_to_Consciousness/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WHAT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Come follow me.” It is not only Jesus who says it:
Krishna says it too, Buddha says it too. All the old religions of the
world are based on that statement. But that statement is a psychological
exploitation of man. I cannot say, “Come follow me.”</p><p><br></p><p>First, those who have said it have crippled humanity, have made
humanity helpless. They certainly fulfilled a certain need. People don’t
want to be on their own. They don’t have the guts to create their own
path, to walk and create it. They want to be led. But they don’t know
that if you are being led, slowly slowly, even if you have eyes, you
will lose them. You will be seeing through the eyes of Jesus, Krishna,
Mohammed. Your eyes will not be needed; in fact your eyes will cause a
disturbance.</p><p><br></p><p>The leader wants you to surrender your eyes and see through his eyes;
surrender your legs and walk with his legs; to not believe in yourself
but believe in him. To me it is a crime; it is crippling you, paralyzing
you, destroying you. And you can see it all over the world. The whole of
humanity is destroyed by such statements and such people.</p><p><br></p><p>I can say to you, “Come and share me,” but I cannot say, “Follow me.”
Who am I that you have to follow?</p><p>And you have to understand also that each individual is so unique
that if you start following somebody you will be automatically
imitating. You will lose your identity. You will start becoming phony, a
hypocrite. You will not be yourself, but somebody else. You will become
split.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have a mask: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Buddhist. That
will be just the mask that you and the person you have been following
have created – it is not your authentic face. You are going against
yourself, and you will be in suffering... and the whole of humanity is
in suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>It sounds very strange to say that such statements are criminal,
because they come from nice people like Jesus, Buddha, Confucius. You
can understand my difficulty too. I have to say it the way it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Every child is trying to imitate his parents, his neighbors, his
schoolfriends, his teachers... and they are all trying to enforce
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember in my own childhood. It was just an accident that I was
born in a Jaina family. That is a very ancient religion in India,
perhaps the ancientmost religion in the world. But my father was
certainly a human being. He used to take me to the temple, but he told
me that I need not imitate him. He had followed the ways of his
forefathers and he had not found anything. He said to me, “I cannot
force you to follow my ways. I can make you acquainted – that this is
the way I have followed, these are the gods I have been bowing down to,
these are the prayers I have been doing, but nothing has happened to me.
I will not insist that you do it; on the contrary, I will insist that
unless you feel to do something, never do it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never followed anybody and it has paid me tremendously.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been the greatest benediction to me that can be possible for a
human being: not following. I have tried to remain just myself.</p><p>You will need courage. You will need intelligence. You will need a
true search and seeking; then only can you risk. Otherwise there are
people all around you, they are all salesmen.…</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Jesus is just a salesman, saying, “Come follow me, because those
who will follow me will find God, will find heaven and all the pleasures
therein. And those who will not follow me will fall into dark hell for
eternity.” Now, this man is not going to help anybody. He is exploiting
your need for guidelines, your need to find a path; basically, your need
to have a certain meaning in your life. And he is promising that, “I am
ready to give it to you. All that you have to do is to believe in me,
unquestionably, without any doubt. All that is needed on your part is
absolute faith.”</p><p><br></p><p>To ask anybody to believe is to cripple his intelligence, is to make
him mediocre, is to condemn him to remain an idiot forever.</p><p><br></p><p>A Christian cannot ask, “What is God? What is all this nonsense about
the holy ghost?” And he does not seem to be very holy either. He is a
rapist; he rapes the virgin Mary. And this trinity: God, son and holy
ghost – they have not allowed a single woman in it. Without a mother,
the son is born.… In the trinity there is no possibility for a woman.
Nobody has asked, “And what are the proofs that you are the only
begotten son?” But you are not supposed to ask, you are supposed to
believe. It</p><p>is a bargain. He will give you, after death, all the pleasures of
life; all imaginable fantasies will be fulfilled. And you will be
surprised what kind of fantasies these religious people have been
offering to fulfill.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed says in his paradise – and remember, the English word
paradise comes from the Arabic firdous; it is basically Mohammedan – in
his paradise, there are rivers of wine. “Drink as much as you want,
drown yourself, swim in the wine.” And there are beautiful women
available who remain always young, stuck at the age of sixteen. They are
still sixteen. Whenever you will go, they will be sixteen; they don’t
grow. And not only that – because in Mohammedan countries homosexuality
has been a very long tradition Mohammed promises young, beautiful boys
also, for the great saints.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a bargain. You remain crippled, unintelligent, mediocre, stupid
– and after death you will achieve everything. And nobody knows what
happens after death. Nobody has ever returned and told what happens
after death. So they are doing such a fabulous business – they are
selling such a commodity, which is invisible, intangible, and what they
are taking in return is your whole humanity, your whole integrity. They
are destroying you completely.</p><p><br></p><p>I can say, “Come and share me.” That is a totally different
standpoint. I have known something.</p><p>I have seen something.</p><p><br></p><p>I have lived something.</p><p><br></p><p>And I can share it with you.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, I am not obliging you when I share it with you; you are
obliging me, because when a cloud is heavy with rainwater, the earth is
obliging it by receiving the water. I say to you: I am heavy with some
ecstasy, some blissfulness. And it is not a question of a bargain after
death. I am not promising you something in the future, and I am not
asking you anything in return, not even a thank-you, because I am
grateful to you that you shared with me.</p><p><br></p><p>My religion is a religion of sharing, not of following. It is a
religion of love.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of following makes me sick. It is sickening. You have
to be yourself, and when you blossom, you are not going to be like me or
like Jesus or like Buddha. You are going to be just like you: you have
never happened before, and you are not going to happen again. It is only
possible with you. You are unrepeatable. If you start following somebody
you are missing a great opportunity that existence has provided for you,
and you will never be happy. No Christian is happy, no Hindu is happy,
no Buddhist is happy; they cannot be. How can you be happy?</p><p><br></p><p>Just think in this way: if the roseflower tries to become a lotus,
the lotus tries to become a rose, both will be in tremendous suffering
because neither can the rose become the lotus nor can the lotus become
the rose. At the most they can pretend, and pretensions are not
fulfilling. The roseflower can only be a roseflower. And the unfortunate
thing is, when the roseflower starts trying to be a lotus, its energy
goes into that effort of becoming a lotus. A lotus it can never become,
it has no</p><p>potential for it. It is not a lotus, and there is no need for it to
be a lotus. If existence wanted a lotus there would have been a lotus.
The existence needs a rose. Trying to be a lotus, the rose will be
losing its energy in a fruitless, hopeless effort, and perhaps may not
be able to even become a rose. From where will it find the energy to
become a rose, the vitality to become a rose?</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the most important psychological phenomena to
understand: each individual is unique. There has never been that kind of
individual before, and there will never be again that kind of
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>If you follow somebody you are betraying existence because you are
betraying your own innermost being. You are betraying your flowering.
And why do people so easily become followers? Why is the whole world
following somebody or other? And if sometimes one becomes fed up with
Christianity, he becomes Hindu; the Hindu becomes fed up with Hinduism,
he becomes a Buddhist... but the following continues. The whole pattern
remains the same. The book changes, the leader changes, but the
following, the follower... and the whole process remains the same, the
same destructive suicidal process.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against following because it is against the basic psychological
principle of the uniqueness of the individual.</p><p><br></p><p>You should pay a little more attention to the word individual. It
means indivisible – it cannot be divided. The moment you follow, you are
dividing. You are something, you are trying to become something else;
you are somewhere, you are trying to reach somewhere else. Now you are
creating a tension in your being. Hence the anguish all over the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>My religion is not the religion of following. I can only share with
you whatever has happened to me. And I am not saying that the same will
happen to you. I am simply saying that if I can see, you can also see.
If I can feel, you can also feel. Certainly, you will feel in your own
way and you will see in your own way. The poetry that will be born to
you will be your poetry, it will not be mine.</p><p><br></p><p>So the people you see here around me are not my followers. I am
nobody’s leader. That silly word leader is perfectly okay in politics,
but not in religion. In politics, of course, you need idiots. The
greater idiot leads the smaller idiots. But in religion, a flowering of
intelligence is needed, not idiocy. So my work is basically of sharing.
It is just... I would like to tell you an old, beautiful parable.</p><p><br></p><p>A lioness gives birth to a child in a crowd of sheep. The child grows
amongst the sheep and naturally believes that he is a sheep – what else
can the young lion do? One day an old lion, just passing by the crowd of
sheep, looks at this miracle: a young, beautiful lion just walking in
the middle of a crowd of sheep. Neither the sheep are afraid of him, nor
is he in any way behaving differently.</p><p><br></p><p>The old lion becomes interested. He runs after the young lion. It is
with great difficulty that he catches hold of him because the young lion
escapes, just like every other sheep escapes. But finally he catches
hold of him. The young lion starts crying and weeping, like a sheep. And
the old lion says, “Stop all this nonsense!” He takes him to a nearby
pond, drags him by his side to the pond, forces him to look into the
water... and suddenly the young lion roars like a lion.</p><p><br></p><p>The old lion has not done anything. He has just shown him his face,
his real face, and he has recognized that he is a lion – he is not a
sheep. And just that recognition is enough. It is transforming.</p><p>The old lion has not done anything at all. He has not told the young
lion to “follow me,” to “imitate me,” and “These are the commandments
for you, and this is the character you have to attain, and these are the
principles, and these are the things you have not to do.” He has not
done anything of that sort.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the function of the master: just to bring you so close to his
own experience that something transpires in you.</p><p><br></p><p>A sudden lion’s roar... and the transformation, and you are yourself
– neither a Hindu, nor a Mohammedan, nor a Christian. But the world
wants a mob, a crowd. It is afraid of the individual because every
authentic individual is bound to be a rebel, because he will insist on
being himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Adolf Hitler would not like individuals, nor does Jesus like
individuals. And the strange thing is that even Jesus cannot understand
that he is not liked by the Jews. He was born a Jew, he lived as a Jew,
he died as a Jew. Remember, he had never heard the word Christian in his
life. He was never a Christian, because the word christ does not exist
in the Aramaic language that he spoke, which was his mother tongue. Nor
does the word exist in Hebrew, which was the language of the learned
rabbis.</p><p><br></p><p>It was three hundred years after Jesus, when The Bible was translated
into Greek, that the word messiah, from Hebrew, was translated as
christ. It was after three hundred years that the word christ became
significant, and after Christ of course the followers became
Christians.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jesus was not a Christian, and his only crime was that he was
himself an individual, trying to live authentically his own way of life,
not bothering much about the tradition. That’s why the Jews were so very
angry. They would have loved him, they would have made him a great
rabbi, but he tried his individual way, not the traditional way. He had
to die on the cross just because he insisted on being an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>I am surprised that even such a man who suffered because of his
individuality is again making the same mistake with other people: asking
them to follow him. That’s what the rabbis were asking Jesus, “Follow
us, don’t try to be on your own.” They were saying, “Follow Abraham,
follow Moses, follow Ezekiel.” They were asking Jesus, “What is your
authority?” And Jesus says, “I am my authority.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is how an individual should speak: “I am my authority – and I am
before Abraham was.” Abraham was three thousand years before Christ, and
he says, “I am before Abraham was.” He is simply proclaiming that he
does not belong to the tradition, that he is a flowering on his own
accord.</p><p><br></p><p>But even Jesus could not see that he is making the same mistake that
the rabbis were making. And of course the popes have been repeating the
same mistake. If Jesus could not see, then how can you hope that popes
will be able to see? They are just blind followers. They are trying to
convert the whole world into a Christian world; they are not satisfied
that you already have so many Christians – and what have you attained?
What has man gained through it?</p><p><br></p><p>More blood has been shed by Christians than by anybody else, more
wars have been fought by Christians than by anybody else. People have
been massacred, butchered, burned alive by</p><p>Christians... and they are all following Jesus! They are really
following those Jews who had crucified Jesus. They have been crucifying
other individuals; whoever asserts his individuality, they have been
crucifying him.</p><p><br></p><p>My way is not the way of following anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just sick to be a follower. It is just sick to be a leader. The
leader is somehow not certain about his authentic individuality. He
wants followers because if he has followers then he becomes more certain
he must be right. If so many people are following him, how can he be
wrong? Alone he becomes suspicious. Alone doubts arise: Who knows
whether he is right or wrong? He needs followers. It is his need that
followers should be there. The greater the number of followers around
him, the more satisfied and contented he is. He knows he is right;
otherwise how can so many people be following him? That is the
logic.</p><p><br></p><p>And why are the followers with him? They are seeing his contented,
authoritative statements, his determined effort, unwavering. Now, when
Jesus says, “I am the only begotten son of God,” with authority,
naturally the poor people.… Who were the people who followed him? Have
you ever thought about it? The twelve apostles – who were these people?
All uneducated: fishermen, farmers, woodcutters, carpenters. Only Judas
was a little educated; so he betrayed him. All the others were
absolutely uneducated, poor people in search of somebody who could hold
their hand and could give them a certain strength that they were lacking
in themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The followers feel it is a mutual conspiracy. Perhaps both are
unaware: the leader is unaware that he needs followers to feel
comfortable with his own idea, with his own fiction, and the follower is
unaware of why he is following this man. He is following because the
leader looks so authoritative, and he himself, the follower, feels so
wavering, so doubtful, so untrusting. He thinks it is better to be with
a man who knows. They are supporting each other.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t need any followers because whatsoever I know, I know; and
whatsoever I am, I am.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if the whole world is against me it will not create a single
doubt in me, not a single question in me. They have all disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>I am absolutely at ease with myself and with existence. I don’t need
any followers, and I insist that knowingly or unknowingly you should not
fall in the trap of being a follower, because then you will never be
able to be authentically yourself, an individual flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>Communism has created an idea in the world that every man is equal,
which is absolutely absurd. Every man is so unique that he cannot be
equal to anybody else. That does not mean that he is higher or lower;
that simply means everybody is unique. And there is no question of
comparison, the comparison does not arise. The rose is perfectly
beautiful being a rose; the lotus is perfectly beautiful being a lotus.
The grass leaf is perfectly beautiful being a grass leaf.</p><p><br></p><p>If you remove man from the earth, the grass leaf, the rose, the lotus
will not have different values. They will be all equally unique. The
winds will not behave differently with them, the sun will not shine
differently on them, the clouds will not rain differently on them. It is
man and his stupidity that brings the idea of comparison, of higher, of
lower; and then the question that – no, everybody is</p><p>equal. Neither man is higher than anybody else, nor is he lower than
anybody else, nor is he equal to anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, my third point is of utmost importance: everybody is
unique. And I respect this uniqueness.</p><p><br></p><p>How can I say to you, “Come and follow me”? Out of respect I can only
say, “Come and share with me. Share my abundance.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the beauty is that the more you share the inner riches, the more
you have them. The more you give, the more you have them. If you hoard
them, you will lose them. So nobody who attains to inner blissfulness
can hoard it. Hoarding kills it. He has to share it, it is an absolute
necessity to share it. Only by sharing it remains alive and flowing. And
more and more it goes on coming to you. One is simply amazed.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinary economics do not work here. If you have money and you give
to people, of course you will have less money. That is ordinary
economics. But if you have silence, peace, love, joy, ecstasy – give it
and see what happens. The more you give it, the more existence goes on
pouring it in you.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are not obliged to me, I am obliged to you. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not believe in believing. That has to be understood first.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody asks me, “Do you believe in the sun? Do you believe in the
moon?” Nobody asks me that question. Millions of people I have met, and
for thirty years continuously I have answered thousands of questions.
Nobody asks me, “Do you believe in the roseflower?” There is no need.
You can see: the roseflower is there or it is not there. Only fictions,
not facts, have to be believed.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the greatest fiction that man has created. Hence you have to
believe in him. And why does man have to create this fiction of God?
There must be some inner necessity. I don’t have that necessity so there
is no question. But let me explain to you why people have believed in
God.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the significant things to understand about man’s mind is that
the mind is always seeking and searching some meaning in life. If there
is no meaning, suddenly you feel then what are you doing here? Then why
go on living? Then why go on breathing? Then why tomorrow morning have
you to get up again and go through the same routine – the tea, the
breakfast, the same wife, the same children, the same phony kiss to the
wife, and the same office, and the same work, and comes the evening, and
bored, utterly bored, you are back home – why go on doing all this? The
mind has a question: Is there any meaning in all this, or are you just
vegetating?</p><p><br></p><p>So man has been searching for meaning. He created God as a fiction to
fulfill his need for meaning. Without God, the world becomes accidental.
It is no more a creation of a wise God who creates it</p><p>for your growth, for your development, or for something. Without God
– remove God and the world is accidental, meaningless. And the mind has
an intrinsic incapacity to live with meaninglessness, so it creates all
kinds of fictions – God, nirvana, heaven, paradise, other life beyond
death – and makes a whole system. But it is a fiction, to fulfill a
certain psychological need.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot say, “There is God.” I cannot say, “There is not God.” To me
the question is irrelevant. It is a fictitious phenomenon. My work is
totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>My work is to make your mind so mature that you can live with
meaningless life, and yet beautifully.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the meaning of a rose, or a cloud floating in the sky? There
is no meaning but there is such tremendous beauty. There is no meaning.
The river goes on flowing but there is so much joy, meaning is not
needed. And unless a man is able to live without asking for meaning,
moment to moment, beautifully, blissfully, for no reason at all.<span class=s4></span>Just to breathe is enough. Why should you ask</p><p>for what? Why do you make life a business?</p><p><br></p><p>Is not love enough? Have you to ask what is the meaning of love? And
if there is no meaning in love, then of course your life becomes
loveless. You ask a wrong question. Love is in itself enough; it needs
no other meaning to make it beautiful, a joy. The birds singing in the
morning.<span class=s4></span>what is the</p><p>meaning? The whole existence, to me, is meaningless. And the more I
became silent and became attuned with the existence, the more it became
clear that there is no need for meaning. It is enough as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t create fictions. Once you create a fiction then you have to
create a thousand and one other fictions to support it, because it has
no support in reality.</p><p><br></p><p>For example: there are religions which believe in God, and there are
religions which do not believe in God. So God is not a necessity for
religion. Buddhism does not believe in God, Jainism does not believe in
God. So try to understand, because in the West it is a problem. You are
aware only of three religions which are all rooted in Judaism:
Christianity, Judaism and Mohammedanism. All three believe in God. So
you are not aware of Buddha. He never believed in God.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of H.G.Wells, his statement about Gautam Buddha. He
said, “He is the most godless person, yet the most godly.” A godless
person, and godly? Do you think there is any contradiction? There is no
contradiction. Buddha never believed in God, there was no need. He was
so utterly fulfilled that his whole fulfillment became a fragrance
around him. Mahavira never believed in God, yet his life was as divine
as life can be.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I say God is a fiction, please do not misunderstand me. God
is a fiction but godliness is not a fiction; that is a quality. ‘God’ is
a person.<span class=s4></span>as a person it is a fiction. There is
no God sitting in</p><p>heaven creating the world. And do you think a God will create such a
mess that you call the world? Then what is left for the devil? If
anybody has created this world it must be the devil, it cannot be
God.</p><p><br></p><p>But fictions – and old fictions, repeated millions of times – start
taking a reality of their own. It has been repeated so much that you
don’t even ask what kind of world God has created, what kind of man God
has created. This mad humanity<span class=s4></span>In three thousand
years man has fought five thousand</p><p>wars. This is a creation of God? And still man is preparing for the
total, suicidal, ultimate war. ‘God’ is behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>And what kind of foolish fictions can become realities once you start
believing in them! ‘God’ created the world – Christians think it was
exactly four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ. Of course it
must have been a Monday morning, the first of January, I assume –
because The Bible says so. Now there are proofs, a thousand and one
proofs, that this earth is millions of years old. We have found, hidden
in the earth, animals millions of years old and even man’s fossilized
bodies, thousands of years old. But what has the last pope said about
it? He said, “The world was created exactly as it is said in The Bible.”
Four thousand and four years before Jesus? That means six thousand years
ago. All the evidence goes against it.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we have found cities which are seven thousand years old. In
India we have the Vedas which are at least ten thousand years old,
according to the very scientific approach. According to the Hindus they
are ninety thousand years old, because in the Vedas there is a mention
of a certain state of the stars which happened ninety thousand years
ago. Now, how can that be described in the Vedas if they are not ninety
thousand years old?</p><p><br></p><p>But what has the last pope said? He said, “God created the world with
all these things. Everything is possible for him; he created the world
four thousand and four years before Jesus, with animal bodies looking
millions of years old.” Everything is possible for ‘God’. One fiction,
then you have to support it with another fiction, and you can go to the
point of absurdity. And why? Again and again man has asked this
question.</p><p><br></p><p>A simple, very simple argument has been behind it. You see an earthen
pot. You know it cannot be created by itself; there must have been a
potter. This has been the simple argument of all these religions: that
if even a single earthen pot cannot be created by itself and needs a
potter to create it, this vast universe needs a creator. And it has
satisfied the simple human mind. But it cannot satisfy a sophisticated,
rational mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If you say the universe needs a God to create it, then the question
is bound to arise, “Who created God?” And then you fall into a regress
absurdum. Then God one is created by God two, and God two is created by
God three, and God three by God four, and then there can be no end. I
don’t want to be absurd like that. It is better to stop the first
fiction; otherwise you are sowing the seeds for other fictions.</p><p><br></p><p>I say existence itself is enough, it needs no creator. It is
creativity itself.</p><p><br></p><p>So rather than asking me do I believe in a creator, you should ask me
what is my substitute for God, the creator. My substitute is the
existential energy of creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>And to me, to be creative is the most important religious
quality.</p><p><br></p><p>If you create a song, if you create music, if you create a garden,
you are being religious. Going to the church is foolish, but creating a
garden is tremendously religious. That’s why here in my commune, work is
called worship. We don’t pray in any other way, we pray only through
creating something. To me, creativity is God. But it will be better if
you allow me to change the word god</p><p>into godliness, because I don’t want to be misunderstood. There is no
person like God, but there is tremendous energy – exploding, unending,
expanding. This expanding, unending, exploding energy, this creativity,
is divine.</p><p><br></p><p>I know it; I don’t believe in it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have tasted it; I don’t believe in it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have touched it, I have breathed it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known it in the deepest core of my being.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is as much in you as it is in me. Just a look inwards, just a
little one hundred and eighty degree turn, and you become aware of a
truth. Then you don’t ask for beliefs. Only blind people believe in
light. Those who have eyes... they don’t believe in light; they simply
see it.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want you to believe in anything, I want you to have eyes; and
when you can have eyes why be satisfied with a belief and remain blind?
And you are not blind. Perhaps you are only keeping your eyes closed.
Perhaps nobody has told you that you can open your eyes. Then you live
in darkness, and in darkness you ask, “Does light exist?”</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a small story in Buddha’s life. A man was brought to
Gautam Buddha who was blind, but was a very logical man. He was so
logical that his village and the pundits of the village became utterly
fed up with his logic. They could not prove to him that light exists.
The whole village knew; everybody saw it, only the blind logician was
unable to see it. But he was a very logical man. He said, “Anything that
exists can be touched. Bring light – I would like to touch it. Anything
that exists, you can hit it with something, it will make sound. Let me
hear the sound of your light being hit by something. If it has any smell
bring it to my nose, I can smell it. If it has any taste, I can taste
it. These are the four possibilities with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you cannot taste light, and you cannot create a sound out of it,
and you cannot smell it, and you cannot touch it. And the blind logician
would laugh and he would say, “You just want to prove me blind, hence
you have created this fiction of light. There is no light. You are all
blind just like me; you are befooling yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was passing by the side of the village, so the villagers
thought, “It is a good opportunity; let us take this logician to Gautam
Buddha, perhaps he may be able to help.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha listened to the whole story and he said, “The blind man is
right, and you are all wrong, because what he needs is not
argumentation; he needs medicine for his eyes to be cured. And you have
brought him to the wrong person. Take him to a physician.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha had his own personal physician who was provided by a great
king, Bimbisara, to take care of Buddha’s body. So Buddha said, “You
need not go far to find a great physician, I have one with me. You can
show the blind man to him.” And he left the physician in the village and
he moved on. In three months the blind man’s eyes were opened. He was
not really blind – just a small disease; a small, thin layer was
covering his vision. It was removed. He came dancing. He fell at
Buddha’s</p><p>feet and he said, “If they had not brought me to you, my whole life I
would have argued against light. And they would not have been able to
prove it.”</p><p>Godliness is not something that argument can prove or disprove. It is
something that you can experience.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that the word medicine and the word
meditation come from the same root. Medicine cures the body, meditation
cures your being; it is the inner medicine.</p><p>I have experienced godliness everywhere, because nothing else exists.
But there is no God. And if you want to experience godliness – just a
little bit of meditation, a little bit of becoming thoughtless and
remaining aware. When your awareness is there and thoughts start
dropping like leaves in the fall, and when there is only awareness and
there is not a single thought there, you will have the taste, the very
taste on your tongue, of what I am saying. And unless you have tasted,
don’t believe me; don’t believe anyone, because belief can become a
beggar. You may become satisfied with the belief, and you may never
try.</p><p>I just heard yesterday... Sheela told me President Reagan wants one
minute’s silence in every school, college and institution. The idea is
great, but I don’t know whether Reagan understands what it means, one
minute’s silence. He must be meaning simply one minute keeping quiet,
not speaking. Not speaking is not silence. You may not be speaking, you
may not be uttering anything, but inside a thousand and one thoughts are
running. There is a continuous flow of thoughts, day in, day out.</p><p>I would like to tell President Reagan first to try one minute’s
silence. That means for one minute no thought moves on the screen of
awareness. It is not easy. It is one of the most difficult things in the
world. But it can happen if you continue to try.</p><p>And if it happens for one minute, that’s enough. If for one minute
you can be in a state where no thought moves<span class=s4></span>This
has been my whole life’s work, teaching people how to be silent.</p><p>People have tried keeping a watch by their side: not even twenty
seconds – one minute is too big, not even twenty seconds can they remain
without thought. One thought after another, running.<span class=s4></span>And</p><p>even if they can remain for twenty seconds, the thought comes, “Aha!
Twenty seconds!” Finished – the thought has come.</p><p>If you can be silent for one minute, you have learned the art. Then
you can be silent for two minutes, because it is the same; the second
minute is not different from the first. You can be silent for three
minutes; all the minutes are the same.</p><p>Once you know the way<span class=s4></span>and the way is not
something which can be told to you; you have to just</p><p>sit with closed eyes and start watching your thoughts. In the
beginning there will be a great rush hour, but slowly you will find the
street is less and less crowded; less cars are passing, less thoughts
are passing, less people are passing, gaps are becoming bigger. If one
continues patiently, in three months’ time he will certainly be able to
attain one minute’s silence.</p><p>I don’t know if President Reagan has ever tasted it, because any man
who can taste silence will not try to be a president of a country,
cannot be in politics. It is not for meditators, it is for mediocres. It
is for all kinds of fools and idiots.</p><p>I have heard: before Reagan became president he used to have a
monkey... I have just heard, I don’t know whether it is true or not. The
day Ronald Reagan was elected president one of my American sannyasins
brought a picture to me of Ronald Reagan with his monkey, and he said,
“Reagan is declared president today – what is your comment?”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at the picture for a long time. The sannyasin appeared
puzzled and asked, “What is the matter? What are you looking at in the
picture?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “I cannot figure out who is Reagan and who is the
monkey. Out of these two fellows, who has been elected the
president?”</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed and showed me a picture of Reagan, and I still remember my
comment, that “It would have been better if the monkey had been chosen
as president.” Surely the Kremlin would have followed immediately and
would have chosen a monkey as their prime minister. They cannot tolerate
America being ahead of them. And one thing is absolutely certain: that
with a monkey in the White House and a monkey in the Kremlin, the world
would be saved from a third world war, which is going to destroy the
whole of humanity and the whole of life on earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians are monkeys. In fact monkeys should forgive me – they are
worse. But the idea is good; once in a while, even in a monkey’s mind a
good idea can come. But if he really means it, I can provide the people
who can teach every university, every college and school, how to be
silent. I can send my sannyasins all over America to teach silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay Sheela?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

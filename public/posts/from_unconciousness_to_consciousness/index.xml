Silence, the Pull of the Innermost Zero
30 October 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO YOU CALL YOUR RELIGION THE FIRST AND THE LAST RELIGION?
It is a little difficult for me to speak again. It has been difficult always, because I have been trying to speak the unspeakable. Now it is even more so.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Your Childhood – an Education in Psychological Slavery
8 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELIEF IN A MESSIAH AND TRUST IN A SPIRITUAL MASTER?
Belief is blind. It has no rational proofs for it. It is based in your psychological need, it has no objective proof. You want to believe because without belief you feel empty, just a driftwood going nowhere.</description>

Yes, I Teach You Selfishness
9 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU TEACH YOUR SANNYASINS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY TRY TO TAKE CARE OF OTHERS. THIS SEEMS TO GO AGAINST MANY OF THE RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD THAT TEACH SERVICE TO HUMANITY AND IT MUST APPEAR A VERY SELFISH ATTITUDE TO THEM. CAN YOU SPEAK ON THIS?</description>

Live Now, Pray Later
10 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
JEWS, CHRISTIANS, HINDUS, JAINAS, MOHAMMEDANS, PUT THEIR HOPE IN A FUTURE LIFE, BUT I DON’T SEE THE SAME HOPE AMONG PEOPLE AROUND YOU. WHY IS IT SO?
There are three ways to live. Only one is authentic; two are pseudo.
First, let me explain to you the pseudo ways, then it will be easier to understand the right way.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Ready-to-wear Religion at the Secondhand Store
11 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU TRYING TO DESTROY ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS IDEAS ABOUT RELIGION?
There is no other way to be religious. All that you have heard about religion, read about religion, has to be totally dropped. Unless you are clean, with no writing on your consciousness, you will never know what religion is.</description>

I am a gnostic
12 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO YOU SPOKE TO US OF THREE CATEGORIES OF BELIEF: THEIST, ATHEIST, AND AGNOSTIC. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT GNOSTIC?
I do not consider ‘gnostic’ a category of belief. The theist believes in God, without knowing, without any experience. His belief is just an escape from doubt.</description>

The Priest and the Politician – the Mafia of the Soul
13 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY IS THE WORLD SO SICK TODAY? WHY ARE MISERY AND TENSION INCREASING?
It is the outcome of all the idiotic ideas that have dominated humanity in the past. It was bound to happen. All the religions are responsible for it.</description>

God Is the Greatest Fiction Ever
14 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHERE DID THE DEVIL COME FROM WHEN HE APPEARED TO ADAM AND EVE AS A SERPENT?
A very simple principle has to be understood. If you lie once, then you will have to lie a thousand and one times to protect the first lie.</description>

‌CHAPTER 17
The Immaculate Deception
15 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DID THE HOLY BOOKS HAVE TO INVENT THE IDEA OF THE DEVIL?
There are no holy books. All books are human, but each religion has been deceiving people that their book is the only holy book. And by saying, “This is the only holy book,” they are saying that it is written by God.</description>

Marriage – the Coffin of Love
16 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR DISCIPLES SEEMS TO BE UNIQUE AMONG THE RELIGIONS. WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?
It is unique, for the simple reason that it is not a relationship at all. We will have to go deep into the very idea of relationship, then only will we be able to understand what is transpiring between me and you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 19
Meditation – the Science of Awareness
17 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCIENCE, ART AND RELIGION?
Science discovers, art invents, religion does both. The true religion discovers; the pseudo-religion invents.
And down the ages it is the pseudo-religion that has prevailed over the human mind. It is nothing but fiction. It is closer to art, and absolutely against science.</description>

Don’t Follow Me – Because I am Lost Myself
31 October 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
JESUS SAYS, “COME FOLLOW ME.” YOU’RE AGAINST THIS STATEMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT?
Jesus says, “Come follow me.” It is not only Jesus who says it: Krishna says it too, Buddha says it too. All the old religions of the world are based on that statement.</description>

You Cannot Manufacture Enlightenment
18 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU THE WORLD TEACHER?
I am not even a primary school teacher, and you are asking about being a world teacher.
But this foolish idea of being a world teacher is very ancient in India. Shankara, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbaraka, and hundreds of others down the ages have claimed that they are the world teachers.</description>

19 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT? HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND THE IDEA OF ENLIGHTENMENT EVOLVED WITH TIME?
Enlightenment is not something special, it is one of the most simple, natural phenomena. Just because it is so simple and natural it has become extraordinarily difficult for man to understand.</description>

Theology – The Jungle of Lies
20 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAY THERE IS NO GOD. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY MAN HAS VENTURED INTO THE SPIRITUAL REALM IN SEARCH OF GOD?
Existence as such has no meaning. Nor is it meaningless. Meaning is simply irrelevant to existence. There is no goal existence is trying to achieve.</description>

It is impossible to fail me. It is not in your hands. You can fail Moses, if you don’t follow his ten commandments. I have not given you any commandments.</description>

The mind is the most complex phenomenon in the whole of existence.

23 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WITH NO GOD, NO DEVIL, WHAT IS RELIGION ALL ABOUT? DOES A SANNYASIN NEED A RELIGION?
Religion has nothing to do with God, the devil, heaven and hell.
The word religion has to be understood. The word is significant: it means putting the parts together, so that the parts are no longer parts but become whole.</description>

24 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN YOUR RELIGION IS THERE SUCH A THING AS SIN?
Sin is a technique of the pseudo-religions. A true religion has no need of the concept at all. The pseudo-religion cannot live without the concept of sin, because sin is the technique of creating guilt in people.</description>

25 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS? ISN’T RELIGION SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY NEEDED BY MAN?
Yes, I am against all the religions, because I am for religion.
The very fact that there are so many religions is enough to prove that something is basically wrong, that we have not been able to discover the truth about religion, because the truth can only be one – lies can be hundreds.</description>

Moses is one of the most charismatic leaders that the world has known, but he is not a religious man. He is a lawgiver. But to be a law giver is one thing, and to be religious is totally different.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
From Crossianity to Jonestown
5 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE BEEN ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS: ‘IS THERE SOME POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER JONESTOWN IN YOUR COMMUNE?’
It is absolutely impossible. Even to think of it is absurd, because my whole philosophy of life is just the very opposite of Jim Jones’.</description>

Will-to-power: The Cancer of the Soul
6 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY ARE YOU AGAINST THE POLITICIANS?
I am not against anybody. I have no grudge, no competition, no jealousy. Why should I be against the politicians? I am not a politician. But my statements can be misunderstood.
I am against the disease called wilI-to-power.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Just to be Born is Not Enough to be Alive
7 November 1984 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE PEOPLE VISITING THE COMMUNE ASK US AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHY DO WE LEAD SUCH A RICH LIFE?
I wonder why they do not ask why we live at all. That should be the right question.
Life means abundance, richness, in every possible dimension.</description>

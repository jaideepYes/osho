WHY IS IT SO?\nThere are three ways to live. Only one is authentic; two are pseudo.\nFirst, let me explain to you the pseudo ways, then it will be easier to understand the right way. These are the two pseudo ways most people have lived and are living: the first is in the yesterday, the past; the second is in the tomorrow, the future. Both are really ways of deceiving yourself. The yesterday is no more, and the tomorrow has not come yet.\nThe yesterday cannot be lived. Yes, only in imagination, but not truly. It is dead. There is no way to make it alive again. You cannot move backwards in time. That which is gone is gone forever. But millions of people, ninety-nine point nine percent of people, have chosen to live either in the yesterday or in the tomorrow.\nThe tomorrow is not there and is not going to be there ever. It never comes, by its very nature. It is always coming, coming, coming... but it never comes. It is only a hope which is not going to be fulfilled. But hope is the most ancient psychological drug.\nFirst let us look into the yesterdays, because at least they have been there. They cannot be again, but they have been there. Hindus have deliberated most in their philosophy about the life of yesterdays, because that is the most philosophical of all the religions.\nHindus have divided time into four ages. The first is called sat yuga, the age of truth. That was in the very beginning of time. No historical record exists about it, no other kind of evidence exists for it; in fact, everything that exists gives evidence against it, because a man like Krishna, whom Hindus worship as the descendant of God in all his aspects, in his totality, even this man is not a man of truth. He lies.\nHe is a politician. He changes very easily. He promises – and goes against the promise. And this is their idea of God in his perfection! And to lie, for Krishna, is so easy... even your third class politicians – of course, they are all third class; I should not use third class, because there is no other class of politicians – even they feel ashamed to lie. And when they are caught, they feel that they have acted not in good faith. Not so with Krishna, he is a perfect politician. He is not a perfect God, but a perfect politician. Lying is his business, deception is his whole game. And this age Hindus call the age of truth! And if this is the situation with their greatest man, what about the ordinary masses?\nThere has never been such a time as the age of truth where everybody was authentic, honest, true to himself and to existence. But Hinduism is a very old religion, so you have to understand this psychological phenomenon. The child has no past, he has only a future. The old man has no future, but only the past. So all the old religions are past-oriented. They live in their yesterdays, naturally.\nThe new religions live in the future, they don’t have any past to fall back upon. They have to project a future. The latest religion, communism.… Remember, I count communism in with all the other religions because it fulfills every criterion of being a religion. It asks you to be faithful to the dogma. It asks you to believe in the trinity of Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, Lenin. It demands that you believe in the absolute truth of Das Kapital, the book that Marx wrote. No doubt is allowed, no argument is possible. With Marx the religion has come to its completion; now nothing is going to be added.\nBut this is so with all the new religions. Mohammedanism is only fourteen hundred years old; Sikhism, five hundred years old; Christianity, two thousand years old. To the Indian mind, two thousand years mean nothing. Hinduism is at least ten thousand years old. That is the very dogmatic, scientific attitude. The Hindu himself calls his religion sanatan dharma; it means eternal religion – there is no question of time, it has always been there. So you cannot count it in years, or even in light years.\nYou will be surprised to know that ‘Hinduism’ is not the name given by Hindus themselves. They call their religion sanatan dharma, the eternal religion. Hinduism is the name given by the enemies of Hindus. But it happens many times that you become known by the name the enemies give to you, and slowly you adopt it. It was given by people who went on conquering India for almost three thousand years. On the frontier, there is one of the most beautiful and biggest rivers of the world – Sindhu. The first conquerors were Hunas, a very barbarous community, very violent, almost cannibals. I say ‘almost’, because a few of them still were eating other human beings.\nWhen Hunas, three thousand years ago, conquered India, in their alphabet there was no word, no letter equivalent to ‘s’. The closest was ‘h’. So they called Sindhu, the river, Hindu River. There was\nno other way because they had no ‘s’ in their alphabet. So the closest word had to be used. Sindhu became Hindu, and the people who lived beyond Hindu River they called Hindus.\nAll the words about India are derived from that time. When Greeks came, they had no equivalent to ‘h’; the closest was ‘i’. So they called Sindhu, Indu, which later on became Indus, and from Indus is India. Strangely they all came from the River Sindhu. Now the whole West knows the country as India, the name given by the Westerners, or as Hindu, the name given by Hunas and Mohammedans. Nobody calls it Aryawarda – that is the name of the country used by the people who lived there: the country of the Aryans. And their religion was called sanatan dharma.\nIt is certainly far more ancient than ten thousand years. But there is no proof that there has ever been an age of truth; that is imagination. That is the old man, the old country, the old religion. It cannot project in the future; in the future is only death. The future is dark, it can only glorify the past. So the first age, the best, the golden age, is sat yuga, the age of truth.\nYou will be also surprised... Charles Darwin was not acquainted with the idea. When he started to work on the theory of evolution, it would have been of great help if he had been aware of the Hindu concept of devolution, not evolution: man has been falling down, not growing up. There is no evolution, because evolution means future. What evolution is there for a dying man, for an old man? Of course for a child there is evolution, but for the old man everything is shrinking, drowning in darkness. So before the word evolution ever became prominent in the world of thought, Hindus had already made another word – just the opposite of it – very significant: involution. Things are going down every day.\nThe second stage they call treta yuga. Treta means the third... because what I have called the first stage, sat yuga, they call the fourth stage – the highest. If you call it the first, then the second will be evolution, then the third will be evolution, then the fourth will be evolution. Hindus are very philosophically minded. They have called the first – the oldest – the fourth; the second they have called the third; the third – the second: the fourth – the first, the lowest.\nSat yuga is the best, the golden age, when everything is just as it should be, nothing can be improved upon. There is no crime, there is no immorality, there is no death, there is no sickness, there is no poverty. You name anything bad, and it is not there. They also call it the fourth stage because it is absolutely balanced, just like a table with four legs. It is completely balanced, there is no possibility of falling from it. People don’t lock their doors. They don’t have locks because nobody steals – that’s what they are projecting. It is not true. But if you hurt anybody’s imagination, on which he is living, which is his only joy, he becomes angry. When I started telling them that there were not locks because locks need a certain technology to develop, and there was no technology to make a lock... and people were so poor there was nothing to be stolen from them anyway.…\nWe know even Rama’s wife, one of the other Hindu incarnations of God, is stolen. So if even the incarnation of God’s wife is stolen, what about other people’s wives? And we know about Krishna who stole sixteen thousand wives from other people. They were wives, mothers. They were taken away from their husbands, their children, forcibly. And you call this sat yuga?\nWe know – I have told you – Parasurama murdered his own mother, and you say there was no crime? And Parasurama was one of the incarnations of God. And not only did he murder his own\nmother, his father had ordered it. The father must have been like an ordinary, mediocre husband, who is always suspicious. Perhaps he was getting old and impotent, and the wife was young and beautiful, and he was suspicious. And there was every reason to be suspicious too, because Hindu scriptures themselves describe that even gods – and remember, for Hindus there is not only one God, there are thirty-three million gods – become interested in women of the earth, because they get tired with plastic beauty.\nIn heaven there is plastic beauty. Those girls there never grow old. They don’t perspire. They remain just the same always. And they are immensely beautiful, but something is inhuman about them. You can have a plastic girl, absolutely beautiful; even arrangements can be made that she breathes. Arrangements can be made that she smiles, says hello – at least till the battery runs out – she kisses you, she says, “I love you.” Everything can be recorded. And that’s how it is, recorded. It is just that the battery is running for seventy years, that’s the only thing. But we can make batteries, even better batteries, which can run a hundred years, two hundred years. Only once in a while you may have to go to the repair shop, change the battery or something.\nThose girls in heaven are plastic. So naturally people must be getting bored. You may not have thought about it, that you can be bored by beauty too. How long can you see a beautiful face? And those gods are living eternally with those girls... the same faces. They must be utterly bored. If anything can be said with certainty about heaven, it is that it must be boring, utterly boring. And not only of one religion, of all religions. I will discuss each. Their heavens are bound to be boring. To keep you unbored, to keep you excited and alive, change is needed. Nothing changes there, everything is permanent. So gods come in disguise and rape women on the earth. Of course, they are gods. It seems all the gods of all the religions are rapists. And if they can be caught, they should be either punished or cured.\nSo gods used to come, in Hindu PURANAS – that is their ancient stories – and the rishis, the sages, of course had the lion’s share. The greater the sage, the more beautiful the woman he could get. Hindu sages of the past were not bachelors. They were not Catholics, they were not Jainas, they were not Buddhists. This idea of remaining bachelors, celibate, is a very new addition. Hindu sages – they were far, far away from this idea. This idea had not occurred yet. And because somebody was a sage, wise, well-known, respected, naturally he would get the best, the most beautiful woman of the society. Even kings would offer their daughters to them. So Parasurama’s father was a great sage, he may have got a most beautiful woman. And he was suspicious. And these gods used to come in disguise – gods can do any kind of miracle.\nJust the other day I have received a Christian woman’s angry letter to me saying, “Do you understand, you are here in a Christian country and you are saying such dangerous things, that the holy ghost was a rapist – and the holy ghost is part of God, it makes God a rapist. And it was not a rape with virgin Mary, it was a miracle,” she writes. Yes, it was a miracle to deceive that poor girl. It must have been a miracle. Perhaps the holy ghost has come as Joseph, and Mary must have thought, “He is my husband.”\nAnd that’s the way Hindu gods have been doing it. They come when the sage has gone, because the sage has to go early in the morning at three o’clock to the Ganges to take his bath, and do a long prayer and ritual and everything before sunrise. So at three o’clock he goes to the Ganges, and at three o’clock the god comes disguised as her husband. And the poor woman cannot even say\nno. She cannot say, “I have a headache today.” That is not allowed in Hinduism. A Hindu woman has to worship her husband as a god. His order is an order, it has to be fulfilled – no question of disobedience.\nSo Parasurama’s father must have been suspicious, and he may have had some grounds for it. He told Parasurama, “You go and cut off the head of your mother. Bring your mother’s head before me.” And Parasurama went and cut off his mother’s head! Obedience to fatherAnd then begins his\nhistory of violence.\nHis father ordered him, “Destroy the whole warrior race from the earth,” because there was a conflict between the brahmins and the warriors, brahmins and kshatriyas, a conflict which always is there: who is to be on top? – the intellectual, the scientist, the brahmin, the wise man, the sage, or the politician, the soldier, the general – who is? The conflict still continues. It must have been there.…\nParasurama was ordered to destroy all the warriors once and for all. It is said – the story must be exaggerated, but some truth must be there to be exaggerated – it is said that thirty-six times he destroyed all the warriors, erased them all from the earth. But there was one difficulty, and that was that his father has not said to destroy the women of the warriors. The women were there. And Hinduism allows a woman to go to a sage and ask to be made pregnant by him, and the sage cannot refuse. That is his religious duty.\nSo all those women must have been going to the sages. India is full of sages – and at that time it must have been fuller. So they were getting pregnant again and there were warriors again – thirty- six times. By the time Parasurama became very old and was not able to kill any more, he had done as much violence as one man can do. And now these people say, “There was no violence,” and their own books describe nothing but violence.\nIn Mahabharata, the great Indian war – that is the meaning of MAHABHARATA.… It must have happened somewhere around five to seven thousand years ago, or perhaps ten thousand years. It certainly happened – there is evidence – and it destroyed the whole backbone of the country forever. It was certainly a great world war: almost all the known nations participated in it. It was a family war in a way: cousin-brothers were quarreling over the kingdom. They were brothers, and all their relatives had to divide up: some relatives with one party, some relatives with another party – and they were all related. And they were so important that all other, smaller nations participated in the war, either from this side or from that side.\nAnd it killed millions of people. It seems, by the description in the mahabharata, that perhaps they had come to know something similar to nuclear weapons, because the destruction was so vast, so immense. By the time the war was over and one party, the Pandavas, had won it, they saw it was worthless to win it, because now, over whom to rule? There were only corpses and more corpses all over the country.\nThey became so frustrated that they renounced the world and went to the Himalayas. It was not worth this victory. What kind of victory was this? And they had lost all their people, either from the other side – they were their friends, their relatives – or on their side also there were their friends, their relatives, and the other party’s friends and relatives too. And they had destroyed them all. Yes, they were victorious, but over whom? Over these corpses. That’s what will happen if a third world\nwar happens. The one who wins will weep and cry. The one who dies and is finished, has lost the war, may be in a better position. At least he has not to see the ugliness of victory. You are victorious, but there was nobody even to applaud your victory.\nAnd then the Pandavas realized, “It was absolutely worthless. We should not have fought, we should have given the kingdom to the other party; at least people would have lived. And now we are going to the Himalayas. We could have gone before; now we are going in utter frustration, in deep despair and anguish. Then we would have gone rejoicing.”\nBut it is not true that there was not violence, that there was not war, that there was not stealing. It is not true. But Hindus look at sat yuga as the golden age. And then began the fall. Treta yuga has only three legs. The sat yuga had four, like a table with four legs. Now it is a tripod with three legs, not so balanced. It can topple over very easily, it is crippled. One essential part of humanity is lost.\nIf you want to understand it psychologically, the Hindu psychology explains it. In the sat yuga there was the collective unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, the conscious mind and the superconscious mind, and the superconscious mind was in power. All the three lower minds followed it. These are the four legs.\nIn treta yuga – treta means three, the third; the English word third comes from the same root as treta, three, that has become three – the superconscious disappeared, the best part in man. Now there was conscious, subconscious, unconscious. Still, things were good... not that good. Before that time they were just divine; now they were human, but good, tolerably good. But a few things started happening which were not good. It is in the treta that Hindus think Jainism, Buddhism – this type of religion – arose, because to them these religions are very destructive. They destroyed the belief in God; they destroyed their very foundation, they destroyed the belief in the Vedas as created by God. They started joking and laughing about the Vedas, criticizing, and started asking for proof. They started creating doubt. Doubt enters into humanity, faith disappears. And doubt, to the faithful, is one of the greatest diseases; it destroys his belief. So Jainas and Buddhists are called atheists by Hindus. They are not accepted as theists or religious people, no; they are the cause of destroying the religion. But still, although they denied God and they denied the Vedas, they valued immensely the qualities of truth, nonviolence, nonstealing, nonpossessiveness. So things went down, but still there was something valuable.\nThen that age also disappeared. Man fell still more. Then comes dwapar. Dwapar means the second. dwa is exactly twa, two. The word has the same root. English has almost thirty percent of its roots in Sanskrit. It is a Sanskrit-oriented language; so is German, so is Swedish, so is French, so is Italian, so is Russian. All European languages have from thirty to seventy percent Sanskrit roots.\nIn dwapar, only two legs remained. Man became really sick. Now the table has lost two legs and on only two legs, how can you make it balanced? It became almost impossible to have balance. In dwapar man lives subconsciously. The conscious mind has disappeared; now he lives instinctively. He does not know why he is doing it, why this desire is in him, why a certain thing makes him happy or unhappy, but he goes on groping in the dark. But the dark is still not too thick; there is a little light, hence subconscious... a candlelight perhaps in the dark night.\nBut most of it is covered with darkness. There is just a little light that you call your intelligence, rationality – but just a little light which can be gone within a second; just a blow of the wind and it is gone. Somebody hits you and your intelligence has gone, and you are behaving completely like an animal. Somebody steps on your feet – and that’s enough, your intelligence has gone, and you are holding the man by the neck to kill him. Your intelligence is just a flickering light, at the mercy of any accident; it can go.\nThen comes the last, kali yuga – the age of darkness, in which we are living now. According to Hindus this is the most fallen stage. Man is absolutely unconscious, drunk, insane. There is no future; there will be more and more darkness. All the best has passed.\nSo old religions look towards the yesterdays. Those yesterdays were not there really, they never happened. They are projected on the screen of yesterdays by the human mind because the human mind cannot live unless one feels something beautiful, ecstatic, blissful. How can he live? And he is so empty that he finds it easy to fill that emptiness with a long, beautiful past.\nThat is true about the old countries and old religions. Jainas have the same status: the past. The future holds no hope – in this world. The future holds hope for them in the other world, after life, in heaven and paradise, but not here. Here everything is finished. That’s the reason why countries like India and China – the oldest civilizations in the world, the greatest civilizations in the world, the ancientmost cultured civilizations in the world – have remained in suffering... because they accepted that nothing better can be possible here, only after death. So the past... cling to the past – that is a treasure. Keep your eyes focused on the past and prepare for a future in the other life, not in this life; this life holds no hope.\nFor the new religions, there is no past in which to spread their wings of imagination and dreaming. They have only the future, and that future is in the other world. Or, a communism-type religion has it here, but not today – somewhere tomorrow, which is always hanging there like the horizon. But the more you come closer to it, the farther away it goes on moving.\nIn 1917 Lenin was absolutely certain that within ten years we will achieve utopia. More than sixty years have passed; utopia is farther away than it was in 1917. Now, nobody talks about utopia. No communist leader in Russia talks about it because they know that it is not going to happen. It was just a hope that you drug people with. Hence I call it the ancientmost drug, far more dangerous than any LSD, marijuana, or anything that science is going to discover: hope for the future. And that is beyond life, so there is no way to find out whether it happens or not.\nPeople go on dying; nobody gives any sign from the other shore, any indication, that what you were hoping for is really here. At least one person in millions and millions of people... and such beautiful people have died: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Mohammed, a Krishna.Can’t they make any effort, in\nsome way, to give a little indication? And now many scientists have died – Einstein... people of immense intelligence – they can find some way to signal, to give us an indication: “Keep up your courage – we have arrived safely.” At least this much of a telegram would do. But in millions of years, not a single indication from the other shore.\nSo it is very beautiful for the priest that there is no indication from the other shore, otherwise there would be immediate trouble. He can go on exploiting you because nothing can be said about\nwhat happens after death. So whatsoever he says, on the authority of the other priests, other old scriptures, that is the only thing there is; you have to believe in it. And you have to believe because otherwise you feel ungrounded, uprooted.\nThen there is only death. Life you have never known, and death is coming every moment closer. Nobody knows whether he will be here tomorrow or not. Death is going to happen some day or other, and it is going to be some tomorrow, for you, for me, for somebody else. Millions of people are dying every day: before death they have not thought about it, that they are going to die. Project... otherwise your life is so dull, so boring, so unfulfilled. Not a single flower has blossomed in you – no fruitfulness. You cannot feel anything worthwhile in you. That is the reason why all the religions go on giving hope, and all the so-called religious people live on hope.\nHope is the opium... but very psychological.\nIt is natural that in my commune you will not find anybody bothering about the future, bothering about what happens after death, because so much is happening right now: who cares about death! So much joy and so much peace and so much silence is available right now, who has time to think about tomorrow? The tomorrow will take care of itself.\nWe are so busy living here and now – that’s why you don’t see my people talking about the past, or the future. They don’t bother about the past. If it was not, no harm to us. If all these people had not happened at all... if all these history books are just inventions and fictions, so what? If there has been no past, no yesterday, so what? It does not take anything from us; we are not living on it, we are not in any way rooted in it, we are free of it. If it all disappears – so far, so good! It carries no meaning for us.\nAnd why should we be bothered about the future? If you know the art of living... and that’s what I call religion – real, authentic religion – the art of living. If you know the art of living... and it consists of small things, not of big, great commandments... very small things... just sipping your tea joyfully, meditatively, tasting each sip as if this is the last sip. Perhaps you may not be able again to hold the cup in your hands – there is no guarantee.\nWhen you are meeting a friend – meet. Who knows, you may not be meeting again. Then you will repent. Then that unfulfilled past will haunt you, that you wanted to say something and you could not say it. There are people who want to say to somebody, “I love you,” and they are waiting for years and have not said it. And the person one day may die, and then they will cry and weep and they will say, “I wanted to say to the person, ‘I love you,’ but I could not even say that.”\nMy people are living, living so fully that there is no space for any tomorrow, for any yesterday.\nAnd only fools bother about death. In fact, only people who don’t know how to live bother about death. They are afraid. They know they have missed the train of life. Now only death is there. Now, what is death? What happens after death? They are thinking to catch the train after death. Here they have missed! These fools who can miss here, do you think they will be able to catch the train after death? While they were living, fully alive, and they missed the train.When they are dead, I\ndon’t think they will be able to catch the train.\nBut if you are living fully, joyously, there is no reason at all to think of the future. It does not arise at all in your being. And your contentment, moment to moment, goes on making you more and more fulfilled, so fulfilled that you could not have imagined, dreamed of it.\nWith this fulfillment, if death comes you will live that death-moment too, with joy and ecstasy, because it will be opening a new door, a new possibility. You will be thrilled. It will be an adventure and a challenge. And you will not be afraid of death because what can death take from you? What can death disturb? What can death stop? But a person who has not lived, he is afraid of death, and trembling.\nAn ancient story: Yayati, a famous Indian king, became one hundred years old. It was enough, more than enough. He had hundreds of wives, one hundred sons. His death came. The story is immensely significant. Yayati, seeing death, said “What! So soon? So many things are incomplete – I have not done this, I have not done that. I have done only half, a part. Some things I have just begun, and many things I have not even started. What! Is this the time to come? I need one hundred years more, at least. Be kind enough.”\nDeath said, “I have no problem. You do one thing... but I have to take someone – just the bureaucracy. If you are not going, then I will take somebody else, and fill in the file and the forms and be finished – but somebody I have to take. You have one hundred sons; ask any one of them. Give one of your sons, and I am ready to trade for it. I give you a hundred years more, you give me one son.”\nYayati looked at his sons. Some were seventy years old, some were sixty-five, sixty-eight, sixty, fiftythe youngest was twenty. The youngest son stood up. All the others started looking at each\nother: “Naturally, when you have not completed your living in a hundred years, how can I complete my living in seventy years? And why should I die for you? I have yet thirty years left for me” And\nthe man who was fifty, he said, “I have lived only half my life, and if you are unsatisfied, what about me?” They all looked at each other. They had so many times told the father, “If there is a need, we are ready to die for you.” But when the need comes, then it is very difficult.\nThe youngest, the most innocent, who had no experience, stood up and told death, “I am ready. You can take me.”\nEven death felt sorry for the boy, because all these ninety-nine older sons, whose death is not far away anyway, they are not willing. And this young boyeven death said to the son, “It is not right\nfor you. You are too young. And can’t you see not one of your other brothers has stood up? Your father does not want to die – at the age of a hundred!”\nThe boy laughed and he said, “That’s why I am ready. If at the age of a hundred he is begging, what is the point? That’s why I am ready, because I can see my ninety-nine brothers: if they have not been able to taste life in seventy years, sixty-five years, sixty years, fifty years, how am I going to manage? At least I have lived twenty years. And I have really lived. And it has been such a fulfillment that I don’t think that any more time is needed.\n“I have tasted the cup of life. Perhaps they have forgotten when they were young. And I am fresh; I can still feel the taste on my tongue of youthfulness, of life. You can take me without feeling sad for\nme. I am not sad; in fact I am thrilled by the very adventure. Life I have known, it was beautiful. Let me know death too. And if life is so beautiful, how can death be anything else? – because death is the crescendo of life, the very peak of life. It is not the end. It is the highest, the omega point. Don’t waste time. I am so excited to know death, to feel death, to taste it.”\nThe story is so significant. The boy was taken away. Death was absolutely certain that this is not the type of person who dies, ever. He cannot die, death is impossible for him. He is ready to live death – then how can he die?\nDeath happens only to cowards, to those who have not tasted life, whose cup is empty. Death does not happen to those whose cup is overflowing. Yes, there is a tremendous opening, but it is not death. It is a door that opens to the beyond, to the unknown, to the unexplored, uncharted.\nA hundred years again passed and death came back. And Yayati said, “What! A hundred years have passed? But I am still where I was.”\nDeath said, “You will be the same, but I will give you a chance. Let it be an example to all. Just give me another of your sons, and after a hundred years I will come back.”\nThis happens for one thousand years continuously. The last time death comes, Yayati says, “I am still at the same point, but I am ready to go, because one thing I have understood: I don’t know how to live. And how long can I postpone? And how long can I go on begging you? And I am tired, utterly tired – one thousand years of sheer wastage. I have not tasted a single moment, so what is the point now? And anyway, anytime, whenever I will have to go, things will be incomplete. Many things will be done half-way, many things will be just started, many things not even started but only an idea. I have seen this in these one thousand years.\n“I am jealous of those sons of mine who had the courage to go with you. I am jealous. They proved.… Courage, intelligence – now I understand – my sons were slapping my face each time one of them was taken. They were saying, ‘You are a fool. You don’t know how to live, and you are postponing death. You will remain afraid of death till you start living.’ But I don’t know how to live, so it is better to die. Let others live.”\nDeath said to Yayati, “This is the first sign of intelligence in you. And not only are you jealous of your sons that I have taken, even I have been jealous. They were rare, unique, really alive people. I have not been able to destroy them. They have moved from life to more life. They have moved from life to abundant life.”\nAnd that’s what I am teaching here: Live so totally that you transform even that phenomenon of death into a door, a new opening for more abundant life. That life is just waiting, but only for those who know how to experience it, how to live it. And this is the time. Only today is the time. Neither yesterday nor tomorrow is the time to live life – only today.\nThis moment, here and now, is the time to taste life; then there is no death.\nYes, a kind of death will happen. Your body and you will be separated, but you will not be dying, you will be expanding. You will be throwing away the bondage of your body, the imprisonment of your body, and you will be coming in contact with the unlimited, the unbounded, the universal.\nThat universal life is godliness.

FUTURE LIFE, BUT I DON’T SEE THE SAME HOPE AMONG PEOPLE AROUND YOU. WHY
IS IT SO?</p><p><br></p><p>There are three ways to live. Only one is authentic; two are
pseudo.</p><p><br></p><p>First, let me explain to you the pseudo ways, then it will be easier
to understand the right way. These are the two pseudo ways most people
have lived and are living: the first is in the yesterday, the past; the
second is in the tomorrow, the future. Both are really ways of deceiving
yourself. The yesterday is no more, and the tomorrow has not come
yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The yesterday cannot be lived. Yes, only in imagination, but not
truly. It is dead. There is no way to make it alive again. You cannot
move backwards in time. That which is gone is gone forever. But millions
of people, ninety-nine point nine percent of people, have chosen to live
either in the yesterday or in the tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>The tomorrow is not there and is not going to be there ever. It never
comes, by its very nature. It is always coming, coming, coming... but it
never comes. It is only a hope which is not going to be fulfilled. But
hope is the most ancient psychological drug.</p><p>First let us look into the yesterdays, because at least they have
been there. They cannot be again, but they have been there. Hindus have
deliberated most in their philosophy about the life of yesterdays,
because that is the most philosophical of all the religions.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus have divided time into four ages. The first is called sat
yuga, the age of truth. That was in the very beginning of time. No
historical record exists about it, no other kind of evidence exists for
it; in fact, everything that exists gives evidence against it, because a
man like Krishna, whom Hindus worship as the descendant of God in all
his aspects, in his totality, even this man is not a man of truth. He
lies.</p><p><br></p><p>He is a politician. He changes very easily. He promises – and goes
against the promise. And this is their idea of God in his perfection!
And to lie, for Krishna, is so easy... even your third class politicians
– of course, they are all third class; I should not use third class,
because there is no other class of politicians – even they feel ashamed
to lie. And when they are caught, they feel that they have acted not in
good faith. Not so with Krishna, he is a perfect politician. He is not a
perfect God, but a perfect politician. Lying is his business, deception
is his whole game. And this age Hindus call the age of truth! And if
this is the situation with their greatest man, what about the ordinary
masses?</p><p><br></p><p>There has never been such a time as the age of truth where everybody
was authentic, honest, true to himself and to existence. But Hinduism is
a very old religion, so you have to understand this psychological
phenomenon. The child has no past, he has only a future. The old man has
no future, but only the past. So all the old religions are
past-oriented. They live in their yesterdays, naturally.</p><p><br></p><p>The new religions live in the future, they don’t have any past to
fall back upon. They have to project a future. The latest religion,
communism.… Remember, I count communism in with all the other religions
because it fulfills every criterion of being a religion. It asks you to
be faithful to the dogma. It asks you to believe in the trinity of Karl
Marx, Frederick Engels, Lenin. It demands that you believe in the
absolute truth of Das Kapital, the book that Marx wrote. No doubt is
allowed, no argument is possible. With Marx the religion has come to its
completion; now nothing is going to be added.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is so with all the new religions. Mohammedanism is only
fourteen hundred years old; Sikhism, five hundred years old;
Christianity, two thousand years old. To the Indian mind, two thousand
years mean nothing. Hinduism is at least ten thousand years old. That is
the very dogmatic, scientific attitude. The Hindu himself calls his
religion sanatan dharma; it means eternal religion – there is no
question of time, it has always been there. So you cannot count it in
years, or even in light years.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that ‘Hinduism’ is not the name given
by Hindus themselves. They call their religion sanatan dharma, the
eternal religion. Hinduism is the name given by the enemies of Hindus.
But it happens many times that you become known by the name the enemies
give to you, and slowly you adopt it. It was given by people who went on
conquering India for almost three thousand years. On the frontier, there
is one of the most beautiful and biggest rivers of the world – Sindhu.
The first conquerors were Hunas, a very barbarous community, very
violent, almost cannibals. I say ‘almost’, because a few of them still
were eating other human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>When Hunas, three thousand years ago, conquered India, in their
alphabet there was no word, no letter equivalent to ‘s’. The closest was
‘h’. So they called Sindhu, the river, Hindu River. There was</p><p>no other way because they had no ‘s’ in their alphabet. So the
closest word had to be used. Sindhu became Hindu, and the people who
lived beyond Hindu River they called Hindus.</p><p><br></p><p>All the words about India are derived from that time. When Greeks
came, they had no equivalent to ‘h’; the closest was ‘i’. So they called
Sindhu, Indu, which later on became Indus, and from Indus is India.
Strangely they all came from the River Sindhu. Now the whole West knows
the country as India, the name given by the Westerners, or as Hindu, the
name given by Hunas and Mohammedans. Nobody calls it Aryawarda – that is
the name of the country used by the people who lived there: the country
of the Aryans. And their religion was called sanatan dharma.</p><p><br></p><p>It is certainly far more ancient than ten thousand years. But there
is no proof that there has ever been an age of truth; that is
imagination. That is the old man, the old country, the old religion. It
cannot project in the future; in the future is only death. The future is
dark, it can only glorify the past. So the first age, the best, the
golden age, is sat yuga, the age of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be also surprised... Charles Darwin was not acquainted with
the idea. When he started to work on the theory of evolution, it would
have been of great help if he had been aware of the Hindu concept of
devolution, not evolution: man has been falling down, not growing up.
There is no evolution, because evolution means future. What evolution is
there for a dying man, for an old man? Of course for a child there is
evolution, but for the old man everything is shrinking, drowning in
darkness. So before the word evolution ever became prominent in the
world of thought, Hindus had already made another word – just the
opposite of it – very significant: involution. Things are going down
every day.</p><p><br></p><p>The second stage they call treta yuga. Treta means the third...
because what I have called the first stage, sat yuga, they call the
fourth stage – the highest. If you call it the first, then the second
will be evolution, then the third will be evolution, then the fourth
will be evolution. Hindus are very philosophically minded. They have
called the first – the oldest – the fourth; the second they have called
the third; the third – the second: the fourth – the first, the
lowest.</p><p><br></p><p>Sat yuga is the best, the golden age, when everything is just as it
should be, nothing can be improved upon. There is no crime, there is no
immorality, there is no death, there is no sickness, there is no
poverty. You name anything bad, and it is not there. They also call it
the fourth stage because it is absolutely balanced, just like a table
with four legs. It is completely balanced, there is no possibility of
falling from it. People don’t lock their doors. They don’t have locks
because nobody steals – that’s what they are projecting. It is not true.
But if you hurt anybody’s imagination, on which he is living, which is
his only joy, he becomes angry. When I started telling them that there
were not locks because locks need a certain technology to develop, and
there was no technology to make a lock... and people were so poor there
was nothing to be stolen from them anyway.…</p><p><br></p><p>We know even Rama’s wife, one of the other Hindu incarnations of God,
is stolen. So if even the incarnation of God’s wife is stolen, what
about other people’s wives? And we know about Krishna who stole sixteen
thousand wives from other people. They were wives, mothers. They were
taken away from their husbands, their children, forcibly. And you call
this sat yuga?</p><p><br></p><p>We know – I have told you – Parasurama murdered his own mother, and
you say there was no crime? And Parasurama was one of the incarnations
of God. And not only did he murder his own</p><p>mother, his father had ordered it. The father must have been like an
ordinary, mediocre husband, who is always suspicious. Perhaps he was
getting old and impotent, and the wife was young and beautiful, and he
was suspicious. And there was every reason to be suspicious too, because
Hindu scriptures themselves describe that even gods – and remember, for
Hindus there is not only one God, there are thirty-three million gods –
become interested in women of the earth, because they get tired with
plastic beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>In heaven there is plastic beauty. Those girls there never grow old.
They don’t perspire. They remain just the same always. And they are
immensely beautiful, but something is inhuman about them. You can have a
plastic girl, absolutely beautiful; even arrangements can be made that
she breathes. Arrangements can be made that she smiles, says hello – at
least till the battery runs out – she kisses you, she says, “I love
you.” Everything can be recorded. And that’s how it is, recorded. It is
just that the battery is running for seventy years, that’s the only
thing. But we can make batteries, even better batteries, which can run a
hundred years, two hundred years. Only once in a while you may have to
go to the repair shop, change the battery or something.</p><p><br></p><p>Those girls in heaven are plastic. So naturally people must be
getting bored. You may not have thought about it, that you can be bored
by beauty too. How long can you see a beautiful face? And those gods are
living eternally with those girls... the same faces. They must be
utterly bored. If anything can be said with certainty about heaven, it
is that it must be boring, utterly boring. And not only of one religion,
of all religions. I will discuss each. Their heavens are bound to be
boring. To keep you unbored, to keep you excited and alive, change is
needed. Nothing changes there, everything is permanent. So gods come in
disguise and rape women on the earth. Of course, they are gods. It seems
all the gods of all the religions are rapists. And if they can be
caught, they should be either punished or cured.</p><p><br></p><p>So gods used to come, in Hindu PURANAS – that is their ancient
stories – and the rishis, the sages, of course had the lion’s share. The
greater the sage, the more beautiful the woman he could get. Hindu sages
of the past were not bachelors. They were not Catholics, they were not
Jainas, they were not Buddhists. This idea of remaining bachelors,
celibate, is a very new addition. Hindu sages – they were far, far away
from this idea. This idea had not occurred yet. And because somebody was
a sage, wise, well-known, respected, naturally he would get the best,
the most beautiful woman of the society. Even kings would offer their
daughters to them. So Parasurama’s father was a great sage, he may have
got a most beautiful woman. And he was suspicious. And these gods used
to come in disguise – gods can do any kind of miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I have received a Christian woman’s angry letter
to me saying, “Do you understand, you are here in a Christian country
and you are saying such dangerous things, that the holy ghost was a
rapist – and the holy ghost is part of God, it makes God a rapist. And
it was not a rape with virgin Mary, it was a miracle,” she writes. Yes,
it was a miracle to deceive that poor girl. It must have been a miracle.
Perhaps the holy ghost has come as Joseph, and Mary must have thought,
“He is my husband.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s the way Hindu gods have been doing it. They come when the
sage has gone, because the sage has to go early in the morning at three
o’clock to the Ganges to take his bath, and do a long prayer and ritual
and everything before sunrise. So at three o’clock he goes to the
Ganges, and at three o’clock the god comes disguised as her husband. And
the poor woman cannot even say</p><p>no. She cannot say, “I have a headache today.” That is not allowed in
Hinduism. A Hindu woman has to worship her husband as a god. His order
is an order, it has to be fulfilled – no question of disobedience.</p><p><br></p><p>So Parasurama’s father must have been suspicious, and he may have had
some grounds for it. He told Parasurama, “You go and cut off the head of
your mother. Bring your mother’s head before me.” And Parasurama went
and cut off his mother’s head! Obedience to father<span class=s4></span>And then begins his</p><p>history of violence.</p><p><br></p><p>His father ordered him, “Destroy the whole warrior race from the
earth,” because there was a conflict between the brahmins and the
warriors, brahmins and kshatriyas, a conflict which always is there: who
is to be on top? – the intellectual, the scientist, the brahmin, the
wise man, the sage, or the politician, the soldier, the general – who
is? The conflict still continues. It must have been there.…</p><p><br></p><p>Parasurama was ordered to destroy all the warriors once and for all.
It is said – the story must be exaggerated, but some truth must be there
to be exaggerated – it is said that thirty-six times he destroyed all
the warriors, erased them all from the earth. But there was one
difficulty, and that was that his father has not said to destroy the
women of the warriors. The women were there. And Hinduism allows a woman
to go to a sage and ask to be made pregnant by him, and the sage cannot
refuse. That is his religious duty.</p><p><br></p><p>So all those women must have been going to the sages. India is full
of sages – and at that time it must have been fuller. So they were
getting pregnant again and there were warriors again – thirty- six
times. By the time Parasurama became very old and was not able to kill
any more, he had done as much violence as one man can do. And now these
people say, “There was no violence,” and their own books describe
nothing but violence.</p><p><br></p><p>In Mahabharata, the great Indian war – that is the meaning of
MAHABHARATA.… It must have happened somewhere around five to seven
thousand years ago, or perhaps ten thousand years. It certainly happened
– there is evidence – and it destroyed the whole backbone of the country
forever. It was certainly a great world war: almost all the known
nations participated in it. It was a family war in a way:
cousin-brothers were quarreling over the kingdom. They were brothers,
and all their relatives had to divide up: some relatives with one party,
some relatives with another party – and they were all related. And they
were so important that all other, smaller nations participated in the
war, either from this side or from that side.</p><p><br></p><p>And it killed millions of people. It seems, by the description in the
mahabharata, that perhaps they had come to know something similar to
nuclear weapons, because the destruction was so vast, so immense. By the
time the war was over and one party, the Pandavas, had won it, they saw
it was worthless to win it, because now, over whom to rule? There were
only corpses and more corpses all over the country.</p><p><br></p><p>They became so frustrated that they renounced the world and went to
the Himalayas. It was not worth this victory. What kind of victory was
this? And they had lost all their people, either from the other side –
they were their friends, their relatives – or on their side also there
were their friends, their relatives, and the other party’s friends and
relatives too. And they had destroyed them all. Yes, they were
victorious, but over whom? Over these corpses. That’s what will happen
if a third world</p><p>war happens. The one who wins will weep and cry. The one who dies and
is finished, has lost the war, may be in a better position. At least he
has not to see the ugliness of victory. You are victorious, but there
was nobody even to applaud your victory.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the Pandavas realized, “It was absolutely worthless. We
should not have fought, we should have given the kingdom to the other
party; at least people would have lived. And now we are going to the
Himalayas. We could have gone before; now we are going in utter
frustration, in deep despair and anguish. Then we would have gone
rejoicing.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not true that there was not violence, that there was not
war, that there was not stealing. It is not true. But Hindus look at sat
yuga as the golden age. And then began the fall. Treta yuga has only
three legs. The sat yuga had four, like a table with four legs. Now it
is a tripod with three legs, not so balanced. It can topple over very
easily, it is crippled. One essential part of humanity is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to understand it psychologically, the Hindu psychology
explains it. In the sat yuga there was the collective unconscious mind,
the subconscious mind, the conscious mind and the superconscious mind,
and the superconscious mind was in power. All the three lower minds
followed it. These are the four legs.</p><p><br></p><p>In treta yuga – treta means three, the third; the English word third
comes from the same root as treta, three, that has become three – the
superconscious disappeared, the best part in man. Now there was
conscious, subconscious, unconscious. Still, things were good... not
that good. Before that time they were just divine; now they were human,
but good, tolerably good. But a few things started happening which were
not good. It is in the treta that Hindus think Jainism, Buddhism – this
type of religion – arose, because to them these religions are very
destructive. They destroyed the belief in God; they destroyed their very
foundation, they destroyed the belief in the Vedas as created by God.
They started joking and laughing about the Vedas, criticizing, and
started asking for proof. They started creating doubt. Doubt enters into
humanity, faith disappears. And doubt, to the faithful, is one of the
greatest diseases; it destroys his belief. So Jainas and Buddhists are
called atheists by Hindus. They are not accepted as theists or religious
people, no; they are the cause of destroying the religion. But still,
although they denied God and they denied the Vedas, they valued
immensely the qualities of truth, nonviolence, nonstealing,
nonpossessiveness. So things went down, but still there was something
valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>Then that age also disappeared. Man fell still more. Then comes
dwapar. Dwapar means the second. dwa is exactly twa, two. The word has
the same root. English has almost thirty percent of its roots in
Sanskrit. It is a Sanskrit-oriented language; so is German, so is
Swedish, so is French, so is Italian, so is Russian. All European
languages have from thirty to seventy percent Sanskrit roots.</p><p><br></p><p>In dwapar, only two legs remained. Man became really sick. Now the
table has lost two legs and on only two legs, how can you make it
balanced? It became almost impossible to have balance. In dwapar man
lives subconsciously. The conscious mind has disappeared; now he lives
instinctively. He does not know why he is doing it, why this desire is
in him, why a certain thing makes him happy or unhappy, but he goes on
groping in the dark. But the dark is still not too thick; there is a
little light, hence subconscious... a candlelight perhaps in the dark
night.</p><p>But most of it is covered with darkness. There is just a little light
that you call your intelligence, rationality – but just a little light
which can be gone within a second; just a blow of the wind and it is
gone. Somebody hits you and your intelligence has gone, and you are
behaving completely like an animal. Somebody steps on your feet – and
that’s enough, your intelligence has gone, and you are holding the man
by the neck to kill him. Your intelligence is just a flickering light,
at the mercy of any accident; it can go.</p><p><br></p><p>Then comes the last, kali yuga – the age of darkness, in which we are
living now. According to Hindus this is the most fallen stage. Man is
absolutely unconscious, drunk, insane. There is no future; there will be
more and more darkness. All the best has passed.</p><p><br></p><p>So old religions look towards the yesterdays. Those yesterdays were
not there really, they never happened. They are projected on the screen
of yesterdays by the human mind because the human mind cannot live
unless one feels something beautiful, ecstatic, blissful. How can he
live? And he is so empty that he finds it easy to fill that emptiness
with a long, beautiful past.</p><p><br></p><p>That is true about the old countries and old religions. Jainas have
the same status: the past. The future holds no hope – in this world. The
future holds hope for them in the other world, after life, in heaven and
paradise, but not here. Here everything is finished. That’s the reason
why countries like India and China – the oldest civilizations in the
world, the greatest civilizations in the world, the ancientmost cultured
civilizations in the world – have remained in suffering... because they
accepted that nothing better can be possible here, only after death. So
the past... cling to the past – that is a treasure. Keep your eyes
focused on the past and prepare for a future in the other life, not in
this life; this life holds no hope.</p><p><br></p><p>For the new religions, there is no past in which to spread their
wings of imagination and dreaming. They have only the future, and that
future is in the other world. Or, a communism-type religion has it here,
but not today – somewhere tomorrow, which is always hanging there like
the horizon. But the more you come closer to it, the farther away it
goes on moving.</p><p><br></p><p>In 1917 Lenin was absolutely certain that within ten years we will
achieve utopia. More than sixty years have passed; utopia is farther
away than it was in 1917. Now, nobody talks about utopia. No communist
leader in Russia talks about it because they know that it is not going
to happen. It was just a hope that you drug people with. Hence I call it
the ancientmost drug, far more dangerous than any LSD, marijuana, or
anything that science is going to discover: hope for the future. And
that is beyond life, so there is no way to find out whether it happens
or not.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on dying; nobody gives any sign from the other shore, any
indication, that what you were hoping for is really here. At least one
person in millions and millions of people... and such beautiful people
have died: a Buddha, a Jesus, a Mohammed, a Krishna.<span class=s4></span>Can’t they make any effort, in</p><p>some way, to give a little indication? And now many scientists have
died – Einstein... people of immense intelligence – they can find some
way to signal, to give us an indication: “Keep up your courage – we have
arrived safely.” At least this much of a telegram would do. But in
millions of years, not a single indication from the other shore.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is very beautiful for the priest that there is no indication
from the other shore, otherwise there would be immediate trouble. He can
go on exploiting you because nothing can be said about</p><p>what happens after death. So whatsoever he says, on the authority of
the other priests, other old scriptures, that is the only thing there
is; you have to believe in it. And you have to believe because otherwise
you feel ungrounded, uprooted.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is only death. Life you have never known, and death is
coming every moment closer. Nobody knows whether he will be here
tomorrow or not. Death is going to happen some day or other, and it is
going to be some tomorrow, for you, for me, for somebody else. Millions
of people are dying every day: before death they have not thought about
it, that they are going to die. Project... otherwise your life is so
dull, so boring, so unfulfilled. Not a single flower has blossomed in
you – no fruitfulness. You cannot feel anything worthwhile in you. That
is the reason why all the religions go on giving hope, and all the
so-called religious people live on hope.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope is the opium... but very psychological.</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural that in my commune you will not find anybody bothering
about the future, bothering about what happens after death, because so
much is happening right now: who cares about death! So much joy and so
much peace and so much silence is available right now, who has time to
think about tomorrow? The tomorrow will take care of itself.</p><p><br></p><p>We are so busy living here and now – that’s why you don’t see my
people talking about the past, or the future. They don’t bother about
the past. If it was not, no harm to us. If all these people had not
happened at all... if all these history books are just inventions and
fictions, so what? If there has been no past, no yesterday, so what? It
does not take anything from us; we are not living on it, we are not in
any way rooted in it, we are free of it. If it all disappears – so far,
so good! It carries no meaning for us.</p><p><br></p><p>And why should we be bothered about the future? If you know the art
of living... and that’s what I call religion – real, authentic religion
– the art of living. If you know the art of living... and it consists of
small things, not of big, great commandments... very small things...
just sipping your tea joyfully, meditatively, tasting each sip as if
this is the last sip. Perhaps you may not be able again to hold the cup
in your hands – there is no guarantee.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are meeting a friend – meet. Who knows, you may not be
meeting again. Then you will repent. Then that unfulfilled past will
haunt you, that you wanted to say something and you could not say it.
There are people who want to say to somebody, “I love you,” and they are
waiting for years and have not said it. And the person one day may die,
and then they will cry and weep and they will say, “I wanted to say to
the person, ‘I love you,’ but I could not even say that.”</p><p><br></p><p>My people are living, living so fully that there is no space for any
tomorrow, for any yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>And only fools bother about death. In fact, only people who don’t
know how to live bother about death. They are afraid. They know they
have missed the train of life. Now only death is there. Now, what is
death? What happens after death? They are thinking to catch the train
after death. Here they have missed! These fools who can miss here, do
you think they will be able to catch the train after death? While they
were living, fully alive, and they missed the train.<span class=s4></span>When they are dead, I</p><p>don’t think they will be able to catch the train.</p><p>But if you are living fully, joyously, there is no reason at all to
think of the future. It does not arise at all in your being. And your
contentment, moment to moment, goes on making you more and more
fulfilled, so fulfilled that you could not have imagined, dreamed of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>With this fulfillment, if death comes you will live that death-moment
too, with joy and ecstasy, because it will be opening a new door, a new
possibility. You will be thrilled. It will be an adventure and a
challenge. And you will not be afraid of death because what can death
take from you? What can death disturb? What can death stop? But a person
who has not lived, he is afraid of death, and trembling.</p><p><br></p><p>An ancient story: Yayati, a famous Indian king, became one hundred
years old. It was enough, more than enough. He had hundreds of wives,
one hundred sons. His death came. The story is immensely significant.
Yayati, seeing death, said “What! So soon? So many things are incomplete
– I have not done this, I have not done that. I have done only half, a
part. Some things I have just begun, and many things I have not even
started. What! Is this the time to come? I need one hundred years more,
at least. Be kind enough.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “I have no problem. You do one thing... but I have to
take someone – just the bureaucracy. If you are not going, then I will
take somebody else, and fill in the file and the forms and be finished –
but somebody I have to take. You have one hundred sons; ask any one of
them. Give one of your sons, and I am ready to trade for it. I give you
a hundred years more, you give me one son.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yayati looked at his sons. Some were seventy years old, some were
sixty-five, sixty-eight, sixty, fifty<span class=s4></span>the
youngest was twenty. The youngest son stood up. All the others started
looking at each</p><p>other: “Naturally, when you have not completed your living in a
hundred years, how can I complete my living in seventy years? And why
should I die for you? I have yet thirty years left for me<span class=s4></span>” And</p><p>the man who was fifty, he said, “I have lived only half my life, and
if you are unsatisfied, what about me?” They all looked at each other.
They had so many times told the father, “If there is a need, we are
ready to die for you.” But when the need comes, then it is very
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>The youngest, the most innocent, who had no experience, stood up and
told death, “I am ready. You can take me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even death felt sorry for the boy, because all these ninety-nine
older sons, whose death is not far away anyway, they are not willing.
And this young boy<span class=s4></span>even death said to the son,
“It is not right</p><p>for you. You are too young. And can’t you see not one of your other
brothers has stood up? Your father does not want to die – at the age of
a hundred!”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy laughed and he said, “That’s why I am ready. If at the age of
a hundred he is begging, what is the point? That’s why I am ready,
because I can see my ninety-nine brothers: if they have not been able to
taste life in seventy years, sixty-five years, sixty years, fifty years,
how am I going to manage? At least I have lived twenty years. And I have
really lived. And it has been such a fulfillment that I don’t think that
any more time is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have tasted the cup of life. Perhaps they have forgotten when they
were young. And I am fresh; I can still feel the taste on my tongue of
youthfulness, of life. You can take me without feeling sad for</p><p>me. I am not sad; in fact I am thrilled by the very adventure. Life I
have known, it was beautiful. Let me know death too. And if life is so
beautiful, how can death be anything else? – because death is the
crescendo of life, the very peak of life. It is not the end. It is the
highest, the omega point. Don’t waste time. I am so excited to know
death, to feel death, to taste it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The story is so significant. The boy was taken away. Death was
absolutely certain that this is not the type of person who dies, ever.
He cannot die, death is impossible for him. He is ready to live death –
then how can he die?</p><p><br></p><p>Death happens only to cowards, to those who have not tasted life,
whose cup is empty. Death does not happen to those whose cup is
overflowing. Yes, there is a tremendous opening, but it is not death. It
is a door that opens to the beyond, to the unknown, to the unexplored,
uncharted.</p><p><br></p><p>A hundred years again passed and death came back. And Yayati said,
“What! A hundred years have passed? But I am still where I was.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “You will be the same, but I will give you a chance. Let
it be an example to all. Just give me another of your sons, and after a
hundred years I will come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>This happens for one thousand years continuously. The last time death
comes, Yayati says, “I am still at the same point, but I am ready to go,
because one thing I have understood: I don’t know how to live. And how
long can I postpone? And how long can I go on begging you? And I am
tired, utterly tired – one thousand years of sheer wastage. I have not
tasted a single moment, so what is the point now? And anyway, anytime,
whenever I will have to go, things will be incomplete. Many things will
be done half-way, many things will be just started, many things not even
started but only an idea. I have seen this in these one thousand
years.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am jealous of those sons of mine who had the courage to go with
you. I am jealous. They proved.… Courage, intelligence – now I
understand – my sons were slapping my face each time one of them was
taken. They were saying, ‘You are a fool. You don’t know how to live,
and you are postponing death. You will remain afraid of death till you
start living.’ But I don’t know how to live, so it is better to die. Let
others live.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said to Yayati, “This is the first sign of intelligence in you.
And not only are you jealous of your sons that I have taken, even I have
been jealous. They were rare, unique, really alive people. I have not
been able to destroy them. They have moved from life to more life. They
have moved from life to abundant life.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I am teaching here: Live so totally that you
transform even that phenomenon of death into a door, a new opening for
more abundant life. That life is just waiting, but only for those who
know how to experience it, how to live it. And this is the time. Only
today is the time. Neither yesterday nor tomorrow is the time to live
life – only today.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment, here and now, is the time to taste life; then there is
no death.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a kind of death will happen. Your body and you will be
separated, but you will not be dying, you will be expanding. You will be
throwing away the bondage of your body, the imprisonment of your body,
and you will be coming in contact with the unlimited, the unbounded, the
universal.</p><p>That universal life is godliness. Okay Sheela?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

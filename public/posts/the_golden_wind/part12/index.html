It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan has lost grace, animals still have it -- wild animals, more so. In a zoo they start losing grace and beauty, they start becoming perverted. The association with man is poisonous.\nThis is something very significant to understand, that man has no being like other animals. The dog has a certain being, the wolf has a certain being; a settled centre is there. The dog is born as a dog and will die as a dog. He will neither fall below it nor will he rise above it. His life is a certainty.\nMan has no certain being, he has only a potential; hence both alternatives are open: he can fall below the animals, he can rise above the gods. He can become an Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, Tamerlaine; he can become a Gautam Buddha, a Jesus Christ, a Lao Tzu.\nMan is a ladder -- there are many possibilities in him; hence it is both a danger and a dignity, a glory and an agony. It is easier to fall; falling is always easier, no effort is needed for it. To rise needs effort. The higher you want to rise, the more effort is needed. If you want to reach the peaks of consciousness you will have to risk all.\nOne should not take one's being for granted because man has no being at all -- just a spectrum of possibilities, the whole spectrum. That is the beauty of man, and his misery too. He is the only anxious animal in existence, the only animal who feels anguish. This is the root cause of his anguish: he is always at a crossroads; he has to choose every moment to be or not to be, to be this or to be that. He is torn apart.\nSannyas is a decision, a commitment towards rising to the ultimate peaks.\nThe most divine duality in man arises through meditation. Meditation is the door to the divine. Nothing is more godly than meditation, because in meditation you slip out of the mind; you disappear from the outside, you exist only at your innermost core. And your innermost core is rooted in god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nJust as every tree is rooted in the earth, every consciousness is rooted in god; god means the ultimate consciousness. And meditation is the bridge that takes you to the very source of your being. Once you have tasted the joy of being at the source, then everything else in life becomes meaningless. Then you can go on living the ordinary life but it is all acting, it is a beautiful drama. Play it as well as you can, but you know now that you are not part of it. It's just a role, it is not your existence. You can have all kinds of relationships in the world yet you know the beauty of your being alone, you know the bliss of being, of being at the centre in solitude.\nOnce that window opens your life is transformed. And that's the whole purpose of sannyas: to open that window so that you can really know you are godly.\nMisery needs no intelligence, no courage, no rebellion; you simply have to adjust yourself to society and you will be miserable, because the whole society is miserable. If you want to be blissful you have to rebel against many things which create misery: you have to be on guard not to fall a victim of all kinds of superstitions that surround everybody. They are ancient, very ancient, and we\nhave accepted them almost as if they are truths. They are not. They are the cause of our misery.\nBut society wants you to be miserable. This has to be very clearly understood, that the society is interested in your being miserable. There are reasons why the society is interested in your being miserable: a miserable person is manageable; a miserable person is always in such a low state of energy that he can be enslaved. Misery functions almost like a spiritual castration.\nBulls cannot be harnessed to bullock carts; first they have to be castrated. And have you seen the difference between a bull and an ox? There is a tremendous difference. the bull has grace, beauty, power, strength, and the ox is just poor. He was also born to be a bull but he has been cut from his very roots, his energy has been destroyed. Now it is possible to harness him to a cart.\nIf you harness a bull to a cart you will be in danger; he will take you anywhere. You will not be bale to manage him; it will be impossible to keep him on the road. And if he meets a beautiful cow on the road he will forget all about you and the cart! He is alive -- the ox is dead.\nAnd the same has been done to man. It is a very subtle strategy: from the very beginning the child is slowly, spiritually castrated, is made spiritually impotent. He is forced to be obedient to all kinds of stupidities. Things are imposed on him and he is helpless; he depends on the parents. He knows that he cannot exist without their support so he has to compromise. And slowly slowly he completely forgets that he has compromised too much. By the time he is able to stand on his own feet he has completely forgotten what freedom is, what rebellion is, what the beauty of being intelligent is -- he has become a slave.\nHitherto this society -- and when I say 'this society' I mean all the societies of the world. I make no distinctions -- Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, they are all alike. Different brands of castration of course, but the base is the same: they have all done one thing, they have destroyed the spirit of man.\nMy effort here is to make you alive once more, to call you forth from the grave. My sannyasins have to be rebellious, intelligent, only then can they be blissful. Risk everything to be blissful, because nothing is more precious than bliss. Let that be the only goal in life; everything else is secondary, insignificant.\nThe two qualities of being courageous and being blissful prepare the ground for\ngod to descend in you.\nYou have to be courageous because god is unknown. And whatsoever you have heard about god, when you really come to know god you will be surprised: all that you heard about him was sheer nonsense, bullshit!\nThere is no way to describe the experience. God remains indefinable, inexpressible. It is so unknown, even those who have experienced him cannot relate their experience to anybody else; one simply becomes dumb.\nThe English word 'mystic' is very beautiful. Its original meaning is: one who has become dumb through experiencing, one who has come across such a truth that he can only say it is mysterious, that it is a mystery\n-- which is saying nothing.\nOne needs to be courageous enough to enter into the unknown. Cowards live in the known, courageous people explore unknown. And one needs to be blissful for god to enter into your being, because unless you are dancing and singing and celebrating you are not ready for god. God is celebration, god is a dance, god is a song. God cannot happen to people who are sad and serious, god cannot happen to miserable people.\nMisery makes people shrink, bliss makes them expand, bliss makes them spacious -- and god needs all the space, only then can that ultimate sky enter you. You have to become almost as vast as the sky -- and this is possible only in absolute blissfulness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPrepare these two qualities and god is yours. This is the price one has to pay for god-realisation.\nMeditation is not a seasonal flower. It is like a cedar of Lebanon -- a big, vast\ntree -- because it is the most ambitious project. It is an effort to touch the stars! It needs time, devotion, patience, and an infinite capacity to wait, because one can never be certain when it is going to happen. It can happen this moment, it may happen after years. It is unpredictable.\nOnly one thing can be said: the more patient you are, the quicker it happens. If your patience is absolute then it can happen even this moment, but if your patience is not enough, then it will take a longer time.\nMany people start meditations but they will do them for a few days and then they will drop the whole idea saying 'Nothing is happening -- why bother?'\nDo meditation without thinking of any result, enjoy meditating as an end in itself. and then some day the light explodes, the ego disappears. And with the ego death disappears. And with the ego death disappears and you enter into eternity.\nJesus calls that eternity 'the kingdom of god.'\nCowards, weaklings cannot be religious, although temples and churches and mosques are full of those people -- so much so that they have contaminated the whole of religion with fear. In almost all the languages of the world there are words like 'god-fearing' for the religious person. Now, the religious person is absolutely fearless; he is not god-fearing, he is god-loving. His religion is out of love, not out of fear.\nHow can you pray out of fear? How can you love out of fear? You can hate out of fear.\nThis whole accumulated hatred finally exploded in Friedrich Nietzsche when he said 'God is dead and man is free.' That statement is symbolic, very symbolic. It represents our century, it represents modern man more than anything else. For thousands of years man has been told to be afraid of god, man has been crippled, paralysed with fear; and man has been told to be greedy. Fear and greed go together, they are two aspects of the same coin. Fear has created hell and greed has created heaven; they are projections of fear and greed.\nThe religious person has nothing to do with greed and fear. The religious person lives in love and bliss.\nHe is strong enough not to be afraid of anything. He is not afraid of death. Why should one be afraid of anything? One day you are not. Just think of a few years ago: you were not -- were you missing anything?\nSo even after death you won't be missing anything. It is such a simple thing. Just a few years ago you were not in the world and you were not missing anything; I think you were perfectly happy! You were not even aware of happiness, so how could you miss anything? At the most, whatsoever is going to happen in death you will be the same: you will move back to the same original state that was before birth, so why fear? For what? What has life given to you that death can take away? Nothing has been given, nothing can be taken away.\nThe religious man lives joyously: there is nothing to be afraid of. And out of that fearless ness a rocklike spirit arises, and on that rocklike spirit one can make a temple for god -- that's the only possibility.\nThese two things, love and meditation, have always been separated by the so- called religious -- not only separated and divided, but almost made as if to be opposite to each other. For centuries religions have been teaching people: if you love you will miss meditation, so drop out of all love relationships, move into a monastery, remain bachelors, become a monk. The word 'monk' means living alone; the word 'monk' itself means one who lives alone, unrelated to anybody.\nFrom the same root from which comes 'monk' come words like 'monopoly', 'monotony', 'monogamy'.\n'Become a monk or become a nun. Avoid love, escape from love, only then can you attain to meditation' --\nthis has been the teaching for centuries. Or if you want to move into the dimension of love then forget all about meditation.\nSo the world has been divided by religious people; they have created a kind of schizophrenia. And the problem is that man needs both and he cannot be contented with one; it is impossible to be contented with one. There is a certain need for love and there is a certain need for meditation too.\nMeditation fulfils something, love fulfils something else. It is like telling a person 'Either you can eat or you can drink. If you eat, then you cannot be allowed to drink anything; if you want to drink anything then you cannot eat.\nChoose one -- whatsoever you want.' Now, you will drive that man crazy! He needs both.\nYou tell somebody 'Either you can remain awake or you can go to sleep -- choose.' These are opposite activities, and you cannot choose opposite things because that will create troubles for you, so either be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nawake or be asleep.' Now, nobody can choose one. You will need a certain rhythm between waking and sleeping; you will have to move from one to the other. Waking you will create the necessity for sleep, sleep will create the necessity for waking.\nThe same is true about love and meditation: if you love it creates the need for meditation. People don't understand it, because they have been told just stupid things. Whenever you love somebody sooner or later you will feel a deep need to be alone, to have your own space, and because you don't understand the inner psychology, the inner rhythm, you start thinking, 'What has happened? Has my love died? Am I betraying my love? What is happening to my love affair?' And the person you love also starts thinking 'You want to be alone? You want your own space? That means you don't love me anymore?' Both are absolutely unconscious of the inner mechanism.\nAnd when you are alone soon you will see that you need somebody to share your joy, to be with, and then you feel guilty again, as if you are betraying your meditation. This whole nonsense has been created by the priests.\nMy effort here is to drop this whole schizophrenic culture and make you capable of both together: be a lover and a meditator. And remember the rhythm, that both are enrichening forces; they support each other, they are not contradictory, they are complementaries.\nThis is something new; it is being tried for the first time in the world of religion. My sannyasins are a totally new phenomenon in the history of man; they are trying to bridge something that has been broken for centuries. But once you\nunderstand the inner mechanism, the inner rhythm... It is like breathing: the breath goes out, then it comes in. If somebody says 'Why don't you choose? -- either throw the breath out and stop, or take it in and stop. What is the point of continuously breathing in and out? -- it is unnecessary trouble.\nEither keep it in or keep it out -- make it simple.' His advice may look logical, but he will kill you.\nThe same has happened with love and meditation. Love is like exhalation: your energies go out to meet the other person. Meditation is like inhalation your energies go in to the deepest core of your being. The most alive man is one who is capable of both without any contradiction. If we can make man aware of this, out of one hundred mind-problems, almost ninety-nine per cent will disappear automatically.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #13\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2710","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2710 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

what the beauty of being intelligent is -- he has become a slave.</p><p>Hitherto this society -- and when I say 'this society' I mean
<em>all</em> the societies of the world. I make no distinctions --
Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, they are all alike. Different brands of
castration of course, but the base is the same: they have all done one
thing, they have destroyed the spirit of man.</p><p>My effort here is to make you alive once more, to call you forth from
the grave. My sannyasins have to be rebellious, intelligent, only then
can they be blissful. Risk everything to be blissful, because nothing is
more precious than bliss. Let that be the only goal in life; everything
else is secondary, insignificant.</p><p>The two qualities of being courageous and being blissful prepare the
ground for</p><p>god to descend in you.</p><p>You have to be courageous because god is unknown. And whatsoever you
have heard about god, when you really come to know god you will be
surprised: all that you heard about him was sheer nonsense,
bullshit!</p><p>There is no way to describe the experience. God remains indefinable,
inexpressible. It is so unknown, even those who have experienced him
cannot relate their experience to anybody else; one simply becomes
dumb.</p><p>The English word 'mystic' is very beautiful. Its original meaning is:
one who has become dumb through experiencing, one who has come across
such a truth that he can only say it is mysterious, that it is a
mystery</p><p>-- which is saying nothing.</p><p>One needs to be courageous enough to enter into the unknown. Cowards
live in the known, courageous people explore unknown. And one needs to
be blissful for god to enter into your being, because unless you are
dancing and singing and celebrating you are not ready for god. God
<em>is</em> celebration, god <em>is</em> a dance, god <em>is</em> a
song. God cannot happen to people who are sad and serious, god cannot
happen to miserable people.</p><p>Misery makes people shrink, bliss makes them expand, bliss makes them
spacious -- and god needs all the space, only then can that ultimate sky
enter you. You have to become almost as vast as the sky -- and this is
possible only in absolute blissfulness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

has to pay for god-realisation.</p><p>Meditation is not a seasonal flower. It is like a cedar of Lebanon --
a big, vast</p><p>tree -- because it is the most ambitious project. It is an effort to
touch the stars! It needs time, devotion, patience, and an infinite
capacity to wait, because one can never be certain when it is going to
happen. It can happen <em>this</em> moment, it may happen after years.
It is unpredictable.</p><p>Only one thing can be said: the more patient you are, the quicker it
happens. If your patience is absolute then it can happen even this
moment, but if your patience is not enough, then it will take a longer
time.</p><p>Many people start meditations but they will do them for a few days
and then they will drop the whole idea saying 'Nothing is happening --
why bother?'</p><p>Do meditation without thinking of any result, enjoy meditating as an
end in itself. and then some day the light explodes, the ego disappears.
And with the ego death disappears. And with the ego death disappears and
you enter into eternity.</p><p>Jesus calls that eternity 'the kingdom of god.'</p><p>Cowards, weaklings cannot be religious, although temples and churches
and mosques are full of those people -- so much so that they have
contaminated the whole of religion with fear. In almost all the
languages of the world there are words like 'god-fearing' for the
religious person. Now, the religious person is absolutely fearless; he
is not god-fearing, he is god-loving. His religion is out of love, not
out of fear.</p><p>How can you pray out of fear? How can you love out of fear? You can
hate out of fear.</p><p>This whole accumulated hatred finally exploded in Friedrich Nietzsche
when he said 'God is dead and man is free.' That statement is symbolic,
very symbolic. It represents our century, it represents modern man more
than anything else. For thousands of years man has been told to be
afraid of god, man has been crippled, paralysed with fear; and man has
been told to be greedy. Fear and greed go together, they are two aspects
of the same coin. Fear has created hell and greed has created heaven;
they are projections of fear and greed.</p><p>The religious person has nothing to do with greed and fear. The
religious person lives in love and bliss.</p><p>He is strong enough not to be afraid of anything. He is not afraid of
death. Why should one be afraid of anything? One day you are not. Just
think of a few years ago: you were not -- were you missing anything?</p><p>So even after death you won't be missing anything. It is such a
simple thing. Just a few years ago you were not in the world and you
were not missing anything; I think you were perfectly happy! You were
not even aware of happiness, so how could you miss anything? At the
most, whatsoever is going to happen in death you will be the same: you
will move back to the same original state that was before birth, so why
fear? For what? What has life given to you that death can take away?
Nothing has been given, nothing can be taken away.</p><p>The religious man lives joyously: there is nothing to be afraid of.
And out of that fearless ness a rocklike spirit arises, and on that
rocklike spirit one can make a temple for god -- that's the only
possibility.</p><p>These two things, love and meditation, have always been separated by
the so- called religious -- not only separated and divided, but almost
made as if to be opposite to each other. For centuries religions have
been teaching people: if you love you will miss meditation, so drop out
of all love relationships, move into a monastery, remain bachelors,
become a monk. The word 'monk' means living alone; the word 'monk'
itself means one who lives alone, unrelated to anybody.</p><p>From the same root from which comes 'monk' come words like
'monopoly', 'monotony', 'monogamy'.</p><p>'Become a monk or become a nun. Avoid love, escape from love, only
then can you attain to meditation' --</p><p>this has been the teaching for centuries. Or if you want to move into
the dimension of love then forget all about meditation.</p><p>So the world has been divided by religious people; they have created
a kind of schizophrenia. And the problem is that man needs both and he
cannot be contented with one; it is impossible to be contented with one.
There is a certain need for love and there is a certain need for
meditation too.</p><p>Meditation fulfils something, love fulfils something else. It is like
telling a person 'Either you can eat or you can drink. If you eat, then
you cannot be allowed to drink anything; if you want to drink anything
then you cannot eat.</p><p>Choose one -- whatsoever you want.' Now, you will drive that man
crazy! He needs both.</p><p>You tell somebody 'Either you can remain awake or you can go to sleep
-- choose.' These are opposite activities, and you cannot choose
opposite things because that will create troubles for you, so either be

certain rhythm between waking and sleeping; you will have to move from
one to the other. Waking you will create the necessity for sleep, sleep
will create the necessity for waking.</p><p>The same is true about love and meditation: if you love it creates
the need for meditation. People don't understand it, because they have
been told just stupid things. Whenever you love somebody sooner or later
you will feel a deep need to be alone, to have your own space, and
because you don't understand the inner psychology, the inner rhythm, you
start thinking, 'What has happened? Has my love died? Am I betraying my
love? What is happening to my love affair?' And the person you love also
starts thinking 'You want to be alone? You want your own space? That
means you don't love me anymore?' Both are absolutely unconscious of the
inner mechanism.</p><p>And when you are alone soon you will see that you need somebody to
share your joy, to be with, and then you feel guilty again, as if you
are betraying your meditation. This whole nonsense has been created by
the priests.</p><p>My effort here is to drop this whole schizophrenic culture and make
you capable of both together: be a lover <em>and</em> a meditator. And
remember the rhythm, that both are enrichening forces; they support each
other, they are not contradictory, they are complementaries.</p><p>This is something new; it is being tried for the first time in the
world of religion. My sannyasins are a totally new phenomenon in the
history of man; they are trying to bridge something that has been broken
for centuries. But once you</p><p>understand the inner mechanism, the inner rhythm... It is like
breathing: the breath goes out, then it comes in. If somebody says 'Why
don't you choose? -- either throw the breath out and stop, or take it in
and stop. What is the point of continuously breathing in and out? -- it
is unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Either keep it in or keep it out -- make it simple.' His advice may
look logical, but he will kill you.</p><p>The same has happened with love and meditation. Love is like
exhalation: your energies go out to meet the other person. Meditation is
like inhalation your energies go in to the deepest core of your being.
The most alive man is one who is capable of both without any
contradiction. If we can make man aware of this, out of one hundred
mind-problems, almost ninety-nine per cent will disappear
automatically.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #13</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

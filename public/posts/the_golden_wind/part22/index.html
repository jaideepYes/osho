It is for reference purposes only.]\nMind is always mediocre. Mind is never bright, never brilliant. By its very nature it cannot be so. Mind is a dust-collector. Mind means the past. It is always dead; it is nothing but an accumulation of memories.\nAnd how can dust be brilliant? How can the past be intelligent? It is dead. Only the living can have the quality of intelligence, brilliance.\nMeditation is bright, brilliant, original. Mind is always repetitive, old; it is a junkyard. Through mind nothing has been achieved. All that has been achieved has been achieved through meditation -- not only in religion but even in science. Of course in science meditation is unconscious; meditative moments are just accidental in science, but all the breakthroughs have happened through intuitive\ngaps. They have not come through the mind but beyond the mind.\nThis is a confession by all of the great scientists; they are puzzled by it, that whatsoever original contribution they have been able to make is not really their own. It comes from somewhere they know not.\nThey are only vehicles, at the most mediums. But in religion meditation is very deliberate and conscious.\nReligion practises meditation. In science it is accidental, in religion it is deliberate.\nThe whole effort of religion is concentrated on a single point: how to help you to be meditative. And that means how to help you to put the mind aside so that you can look into reality directly, without mind as a mediator. If you look through the mind, mind always distorts. You are never able to see that which is through the mind. When the mind is not functioning you see reality as it is. And that's what god is all about: seeing reality as it is.\nGod simply means that which is. But to know it you need to be utterly silent; and mind is a constant chatterer -- mind is crazy, noisy. Silence is original, intelligent. Whatsoever happens out of silence is good, is beautiful, is divine.\nChristopher is a very beautiful name. The ordinary dictionary meaning is a Christian, a follower of Christ. But that is not its true meaning. Its true meaning is: one who carries Christ in the heart -- he may be a Christian, he may not be a Christian.\nChrist himself was not a Christian. Even if he wanted to be he could not have been because there was no Christian church at all, there was no creed, no dogma. He was born as a Jew, he lived as a Jew and died as a Jew. But he was a Christ, he was not a Christian. His name is not Christ, his name is Jesus. In fact to call him Jesus Christ is not right; Christians go on doing that. But in the East we have never done that. We never say Gautam Buddha, we say Gautam the Buddha. Buddha is not his name is only one of the Buddhas --\nGautam; the Buddha. There have been many before him and there will be many after him. Buddhahood is a quality, a realisation, a flowering.\nSo is Christhood: Jesus the Christ... Jesus Christ is not right. But that is a\nChristian strategy. Their whole effort is to make Jesus the only begotten son of god. It is monopolistic, they want the monopoly. The very idea is ugly and unchristian.\nEverybody can be a Christ because everybody is carrying the seed of Christhood in his heart. That is the meaning of Christopher: a Christ-bearer. But we are only potential Christs. That potentiality can be transformed into an actuality and then you don't become a Christian, you simply become a Christ, another Christ. Then Christ becomes equivalent to Buddha -- that's exactly what it is.\nThe word 'christ' means the crowned one, one who has achieved the ultimate goal of being totally conscious -- he becomes the crowned one. All the glories of god are his, the whole kingdom of god belongs to him; hence he is called the crowned one. The word 'buddha' means the awakened one -- it is the same.\nJainas have another name 'jina'; Mahavira the Jina; Jina means the conqueror, the victorious.\nThese are different ways of saying the same thing: one who has arrived, one who has reached the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nultimate beyond which nothing exists, one who has come home. Call him Christ, Buddha, Jina, it doesn't matter; these words are just words. Good, if you understand their meaning but dangerous if you cling to them as dogmas.\nNobody need be a Christian, nobody need be a Buddhist. Everybody needs to be a Christ, but in being a Christ you become a Buddha and a Jina at the same time; you can become a Buddha, then you become a Christ and a Jina at the same time. They are different facets of the same truth. But the whole secret is in becoming more and more aware, alert.\nBy becoming a sannyasin one enters into the world of consciousness. I don't teach any creed, I only help my people to be more conscious of everything that is within and without. That contains my whole teaching: be conscious, be aware\nand live out of your awareness. Let your awareness be decisive. Don't impose any discipline from the outside; let it spring from within, let it well up. And then it is always fresh, young, alive.\nAnd life becomes more and more intense, passionate. It becomes tremendously aflame with joy, with bliss benediction.\nMartina means a loyal spirit. It has other meanings too but they are all ugly.\nThe most ancient meaning is god of war -- that is an ugly meaning. God and war? -- that doesn't fit at all. God can only be a god of love, never of war.\nThe other meaning is warlike, a warrior. A sannyasin is not warlike, he is not a warrior; he is not fighting with anybody. A sannyasin in fact becomes a sannyasin by dropping all fights. He is in love with the whole existence -- there is no need to fight. Hence I have chosen a meaning which is only metaphorically so.\nThis is my choice; this is one of the meanings and not the more prominent one: a loyal spirit... because it has something to do with sannyas and something to do with bliss too.\nA man can live life either as a no or as a yes. If you live your life as a no you become a warrior; you are constantly fighting. Then life is just a struggle, a war, and you are fighting against everybody else. Of course it is a losing war, you are bound to lose. One cannot win against the whole; the whole idea is stupid.\nBut it appeals to the ego. The ego always wants to say no. No is a nourishment for the ego.\nLove wants to say yes; yes is a nourishment for living. And love and ego are just polar opposites: if you say no you grow your ego bigger and bigger, and the more ego you have, the less is the possibility of love.\nAnd without love there is no joy, without love there is no music, without love there is no poetry in life.\nWithout love life is a desert. One can fight as much as one wants but it is self- destructive.\nYes is creative, yes is the way of the creator, the way of the lover. Yes means surrender. If no means war then yes means surrender: surrendering to the whole, trusting the whole as a friend -- there is no need to fight -- trusting life and existence.\nThe moment you trust you can relax, you can be in a let-go. And that's exactly what sannyas is: a let-go, an unburdening of all tensions. There is no need to carry an unnecessary burden. One can relax with the whole and the whole takes care. All that is needed is a trusting heart. That's what a loyal spirit means.\nLearn to say yes, learn to be yes, and a total yes -- don't hold back anything and don't make any conditions on the yes. And you will be surprised: life starts growing in leaps and bounds, life starts becoming such a splendour, such a beauty, such a grace that one cannot even imagine it.\nLife can become an unending ecstasy. All that is needed on your part is to open your doors and windows.\nSay yes to the winds, to the sun, to the moon, to the rain, to the whole.\nWe know songs which are composed of words, but they are not real songs. There are songs which are composed of silence and they are the real songs. Once you have heard the song of silence then all the great poets just look childish. Then Shakespeares and Miltons and Byrons simply fade away; they are just playing with toys. India -- and I think it is only in India that it is so -- we have two words for a poet. One is kavi, which Can be exactly translated as 'a poet'. The other is rishi, which is untranslatable. A poet moans one who composes songs with words and a rishi is a poet who has heard the song of silence. And it is the rishi who has really known the harmony of existence, who has seen the beauty of that which is. And not only has he seen it -- because the only way to see it is to become it -- he has become it, it is his own heartbeart.\nYou have to go deep within yourself to hear the song of silence. You have to leave all words far away, far behind.\nThe greatest barrier is that of words. You can enter Russia because they have only an iron wall; and 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nChina is even easier -- they have only a bamboo wall. But the real problem arises when you try to enter yourself. And the wall is very delicate. It is not made of steel, it is not even made of bricks; it is only made of words, but a thick jungle of words -- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- millions of words. And when you start penetrating yourself you go on finding words and words and words.\nThe meditator has to go on peeling himself like an onion. Peel one layer, another layer comes up, but go on peeling till you come to the point where nothing is left in your hand. So go on peeling within yourself; when nothing is left , that nothing is the song of silence.\nOnce hoard it transforms your life. You go beyond time, you become deathless. All fear disappears and there is only freedom. All misery disappears and there is only rejoicing and celebration.\nThe only victory worth calling victory is to become absolutely blissful. Not even a trace of misery should be left, because if even a trace of misery is left it will grow again. It is like cancer: if even a small piece of some canceric growth remains inside you it will start growing again. It has to be totally removed.\nAnd misery is cancer of the soul. Bliss is the health of the soul. Just as there is a well-being of the body, there is a well-being of the soul.\nTo attain to that well-being is real victory. It cannot be purchased with money, it cannot be conquered by power; the only way to it is through becoming more and more silent and watchful. These two things have to be remembered: become calm, silent and watchful. Just go on watching what goes on happening inside you -- the thoughts, the emotions, the sentiments. Just go on watching the whole procession of all kinds of things within you, without in any way stopping that procession, without creating any fight with it, without any interference.\nIt is just like you are sitting on the bank of a river and the river flows by; you are not doing anything just sitting on the bank, watching the river watch the river of your mind, sitting silently, doing nothing. And a miracle happens one day: you are sitting there doing nothing and the river disappears. When it happens for the first time one cannot believe one's eyes; one looks around and there is not a\nsingle thought. One starts feeling afraid, scared -- where has all that company gone?\nThat first shock makes you feel like you are dying because that's what you had always known as your life. Your very identity has disappeared as if the earth beneath your feet has suddenly disappeared: you look and there is no earth and you are falling into an abyss. But soon -- and you cannot do anything you have to go on falling, there is nothing to do -- soon you start feeling a great joy instead of fear. The shock disappears, and instead of the fear a great joy arises in you because now for the first time there is space for the joy to happen. It needs space, and thoughts are occupying your inner space so much that it is impossible for bliss to happen.\nMy sannyasins have to do only one thing, that is, they have to become watchers of the mind, not controllers, just watchers. and then allow the process to take its own course.\nWhenever you have time, just sit silently and watch with no motive. Don't wait for any result, don't think that now great light will arise or a one-thousand- petalled lotus will open inside you and chakras and the energy will rise upwards. Don't be worried about these things. Even if they happen, watch them; they are part of the mind.\nEverything that you can watch is part of the mind -- that's the very key to unlock the door. Everything that can be watched -- kundalini arising, lotuses opening, beautiful fragrances and light inside... all can be watched, so that simply means they are subtle processes of thought. Mind is playing, trying to play its last tricks, trying to enchant you that 'Look, what are you doing? Trying to drop me? I can supply such a good circus and I contain so many mysteries. What are you doing? Trying to go beyond me? Then watch this light, watch this energy and see: your third eye is opening. These are all tricks of the mind, subtle tricks.\nOne has to remain absolutely unaffected.\nThose are the real temptations. There is no devil other than the mind. If one can go on watching and enjoying these temptations: 'Yes, you go on playing your tricks -- I am ready to watch, I will watch everything. I will watch even nothing...' Because that is the final and ultimate strategy. The mind says\n'Okay, you are interested in nothing? Have it!' If you cling to nothing you are\nback in the mind; the mind has conquered you, you have been defeated.\nSo you say 'Okay, I will even watch nothing. I am not going to be entangled in anything again, even by nothing.' And then the real nothing happens; it is no more a thought. You don't see it, you can't hold it, you can't touch it. All has disappeared; even the idea of nothing is no more there. You are not feeling a great joy, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n'Look, now I have achieved nothing. That's what happens when a man becomes a Buddha.' Even that is not there; hence Buddha says 'If you meet me on the way, kill me immediately.' That's what he means: even if you come to the idea 'Now I have become the Buddha'. kill it immediately. That is the last temptation of the mind.\nGo on watching and watching and watching till there is nothing to watch, not even nothing to watch.\nThen the watcher is left alone, then there is no object, when subjectivity is left alone, in that absolute silence is the revolution.\nLove is not something static, it is dynamic. It is not a stagnant pool, it is not a pond. It is a river, always flowing. The moment you stop a river, it starts becoming dirty. It is pure and clean only in flowing. And the same is true about love: love should be a constant flow. But our minds are always trying to make it something static.\nWe are clingers. We try to make love also something permanent. We destroy all possibilities of change.\nWe are afraid of change. We are afraid that if something changes who knows where that change will lead?\nSo we want our tomorrow to be exactly like today. That is trying to destroy the future and that is trying to destroy all possibilities of growth.\nTomorrow should be tomorrow, never today. You should not expect it to be the same. That very expectation is dangerous because in the first place it is never going to be so; hence you feel frustrated. And if by chance, by accident it happens to be just like today, then you will be bored, but neither frustration is joy nor is joy.\nLet the future be open. Don't put any expectations on it. Leave it unknown, unpredictable and don't try in any way to make things permanent. The nature of life is change, and we have to flow with nature, with tao, with the ultimate law of existence.\nBe in tune with it without any expectation on your part and you will be enriched\n-- tremendously. Each moment will bring new joy, new life, new light, a new god. And a person whose love is always flowing and who is never confined by anything becomes vast, as vast as the sky itself. In that vastness one knows what god is. That vastness is god.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #23\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3091","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3091 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

right; Christians go on doing that. But in the East we have never done
that. We never say Gautam Buddha, we say Gautam the Buddha. Buddha is
not his name is only one of the Buddhas --</p><p>Gautam; the Buddha. There have been many before him and there will be
many after him. Buddhahood is a quality, a realisation, a flowering.</p><p>So is Christhood: Jesus <em>the</em> Christ... Jesus Christ is not
right. But that is a</p><p>Christian strategy. Their whole effort is to make Jesus the
<em>only</em> begotten son of god. It is monopolistic, they want the
monopoly. The very idea is ugly and unchristian.</p><p>Everybody can be a Christ because everybody is carrying the seed of
Christhood in his heart. That is the meaning of Christopher: a
Christ-bearer. But we are only potential Christs. That potentiality can
be transformed into an actuality and then you don't become a Christian,
you simply become a Christ, another Christ. Then Christ becomes
equivalent to Buddha -- that's exactly what it is.</p><p>The word 'christ' means the crowned one, one who has achieved the
ultimate goal of being totally conscious -- he becomes the crowned one.
All the glories of god are his, the whole kingdom of god belongs to him;
hence he is called the crowned one. The word 'buddha' means the awakened
one -- it is the same.</p><p>Jainas have another name 'jina'; Mahavira the Jina; Jina means the
conqueror, the victorious.</p><p>These are different ways of saying the same thing: one who has
arrived, one who has reached the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

Christ, Buddha, Jina, it doesn't matter; these words are just words.
Good, if you understand their meaning but dangerous if you cling to them
as dogmas.</p><p>Nobody need be a Christian, nobody need be a Buddhist. Everybody
needs to be a Christ, but in being a Christ you become a Buddha and a
Jina at the same time; you can become a Buddha, then you become a Christ
and a Jina at the same time. They are different facets of the same
truth. But the whole secret is in becoming more and more aware,
alert.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin one enters into the world of consciousness. I
don't teach any creed, I only help my people to be more conscious of
everything that is within and without. That contains my whole teaching:
be conscious, be aware</p><p>and live out of your awareness. Let your awareness be decisive. Don't
impose any discipline from the outside; let it spring from within, let
it well up. And then it is always fresh, young, alive.</p><p>And life becomes more and more intense, passionate. It becomes
tremendously aflame with joy, with bliss benediction.</p><p>Martina means a loyal spirit. It has other meanings too but they are
all ugly.</p><p>The most ancient meaning is god of war -- that is an ugly meaning.
God and war? -- that doesn't fit at all. God can only be a god of love,
never of war.</p><p>The other meaning is warlike, a warrior. A sannyasin is not warlike,
he is not a warrior; he is not fighting with anybody. A sannyasin in
fact becomes a sannyasin by dropping all fights. He is in love with the
whole existence -- there is no need to fight. Hence I have chosen a
meaning which is only metaphorically so.</p><p>This is my choice; this is one of the meanings and not the more
prominent one: a loyal spirit... because it has something to do with
sannyas and something to do with bliss too.</p><p>A man can live life either as a no or as a yes. If you live your life
as a no you become a warrior; you are constantly fighting. Then life is
just a struggle, a war, and you are fighting against everybody else. Of
course it is a losing war, you are bound to lose. One cannot win against
the whole; the whole idea is stupid.</p><p>But it appeals to the ego. The ego always wants to say no. No is a
nourishment for the ego.</p><p>Love wants to say yes; yes is a nourishment for living. And love and
ego are just polar opposites: if you say no you grow your ego bigger and
bigger, and the more ego you have, the less is the possibility of
love.</p><p>And without love there is no joy, without love there is no music,
without love there is no poetry in life.</p><p>Without love life is a desert. One can fight as much as one wants but
it is self- destructive.</p><p>Yes is creative, yes is the way of the creator, the way of the lover.
Yes means surrender. If no means war then yes means surrender:
surrendering to the whole, trusting the whole as a friend -- there is no
need to fight -- trusting life and existence.</p><p>The moment you trust you can relax, you can be in a let-go. And
that's exactly what sannyas is: a let-go, an unburdening of all
tensions. There is no need to carry an unnecessary burden. One can relax
with the whole and the whole takes care. All that is needed is a
trusting heart. That's what a loyal spirit means.</p><p>Learn to say yes, learn to be yes, and a total yes -- don't hold back
anything and don't make any conditions on the yes. And you will be
surprised: life starts growing in leaps and bounds, life starts becoming
such a splendour, such a beauty, such a grace that one cannot even
imagine it.</p><p>Life can become an unending ecstasy. All that is needed on your part
is to open your doors and windows.</p><p>Say yes to the winds, to the sun, to the moon, to the rain, to the
whole.</p><p>We know songs which are composed of words, but they are not real
songs. There are songs which are composed of silence and they are the
real songs. Once you have heard the song of silence then all the great
poets just look childish. Then Shakespeares and Miltons and Byrons
simply fade away; they are just playing with toys. India -- and I think
it is only in India that it is so -- we have two words for a poet. One
is kavi, which Can be exactly translated as 'a poet'. The other is
rishi, which is untranslatable. A poet moans one who composes songs with
words and a rishi is a poet who has heard the song of silence. And it is
the rishi who has really known the harmony of existence, who has seen
the beauty of that which is. And not only has he seen it -- because the
only way to see it is to become it -- he has become it, it is his own
heartbeart.</p><p>You have to go deep within yourself to hear the song of silence. You
have to leave all words far away, far behind.</p><p>The greatest barrier is that of words. You can enter Russia because
they have only an iron wall; and 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

problem arises when you try to enter yourself. And the wall is very
delicate. It is not made of steel, it is not even made of bricks; it is
only made of words, but a thick jungle of words -- Christian, Hindu,
Mohammedan -- millions of words. And when you start penetrating yourself
you go on finding words and words and words.</p><p>The meditator has to go on peeling himself like an onion. Peel one
layer, another layer comes up, but go on peeling till you come to the
point where nothing is left in your hand. So go on peeling within
yourself; when nothing is left , that nothing is the song of
silence.</p><p>Once hoard it transforms your life. You go beyond time, you become
deathless. All fear disappears and there is only freedom. All misery
disappears and there is only rejoicing and celebration.</p><p>The only victory worth calling victory is to become absolutely
blissful. Not even a trace of misery should be left, because if even a
trace of misery is left it will grow again. It is like cancer: if even a
small piece of some canceric growth remains inside you it will start
growing again. It has to be totally removed.</p><p>And misery is cancer of the soul. Bliss is the health of the soul.
Just as there is a well-being of the body, there is a well-being of the
soul.</p><p>To attain to that well-being is real victory. It cannot be purchased
with money, it cannot be conquered by power; the only way to it is
through becoming more and more silent and watchful. These two things
have to be remembered: become calm, silent and watchful. Just go on
watching what goes on happening inside you -- the thoughts, the
emotions, the sentiments. Just go on watching the whole procession of
all kinds of things within you, without in any way stopping that
procession, without creating any fight with it, without any
interference.</p><p>It is just like you are sitting on the bank of a river and the river
flows by; you are not doing anything just sitting on the bank, watching
the river watch the river of your mind, sitting silently, doing nothing.
And a miracle happens one day: you are sitting there doing nothing and
the river disappears. When it happens for the first time one cannot
believe one's eyes; one looks around and there is not a</p><p>single thought. One starts feeling afraid, scared -- where has all
that company gone?</p><p>That first shock makes you feel like you are dying because that's
what you had always known as your life. Your very identity has
disappeared as if the earth beneath your feet has suddenly disappeared:
you look and there is no earth and you are falling into an abyss. But
soon -- and you cannot do anything you have to go on falling, there is
nothing to do -- soon you start feeling a great joy instead of fear. The
shock disappears, and instead of the fear a great joy arises in you
because now for the first time there is space for the joy to happen. It
needs space, and thoughts are occupying your inner space so much that it
is impossible for bliss to happen.</p><p>My sannyasins have to do only one thing, that is, they have to become
watchers of the mind, not controllers, just watchers. and then allow the
process to take its own course.</p><p>Whenever you have time, just sit silently and watch with no motive.
Don't wait for any result, don't think that now great light will arise
or a one-thousand- petalled lotus will open inside you and chakras and
the energy will rise upwards. Don't be worried about these things. Even
if they happen, watch them; they are part of the mind.</p><p>Everything that you can watch is part of the mind -- that's the very
key to unlock the door. Everything that can be watched -- kundalini
arising, lotuses opening, beautiful fragrances and light inside... all
can be watched, so that simply means they are subtle processes of
thought. Mind is playing, trying to play its last tricks, trying to
enchant you that 'Look, what are you doing? Trying to drop me? I can
supply such a good circus and I contain so many mysteries. What are you
doing? Trying to go beyond me? Then watch this light, watch this energy
and see: your third eye is opening. These are all tricks of the mind,
subtle tricks.</p><p>One has to remain absolutely unaffected.</p><p>Those are the real temptations. There is no devil other than the
mind. If one can go on watching and enjoying these temptations: 'Yes,
you go on playing your tricks -- I am ready to watch, I will watch
everything. I will watch even nothing...' Because that is the final and
ultimate strategy. The mind says</p><p>'Okay, you are interested in nothing? Have it!' If you cling to
nothing you are</p><p>back in the mind; the mind has conquered you, you have been
defeated.</p><p>So you say 'Okay, I will even watch nothing. I am not going to be
entangled in anything again, even by nothing.' And then the real nothing
happens; it is no more a thought. You don't see it, you can't hold it,
you can't touch it. All has disappeared; even the idea of nothing is no
more there. You are not feeling a great joy, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

becomes a Buddha.' Even that is not there; hence Buddha says 'If you
meet me on the way, kill me immediately.' That's what he means: even if
you come to the idea 'Now I have become the Buddha'. kill it
immediately. That is the last temptation of the mind.</p><p>Go on watching and watching and watching till there is nothing to
watch, not even nothing to watch.</p><p>Then the watcher is left alone, then there is no object, when
subjectivity is left alone, in that absolute silence is the
revolution.</p><p>Love is not something static, it is dynamic. It is not a stagnant
pool, it is not a pond. It is a river, always flowing. The moment you
stop a river, it starts becoming dirty. It is pure and clean only in
flowing. And the same is true about love: love should be a constant
flow. But our minds are always trying to make it something static.</p><p>We are clingers. We try to make love also something permanent. We
destroy all possibilities of change.</p><p>We are afraid of change. We are afraid that if something changes who
knows where that change will lead?</p><p>So we want our tomorrow to be exactly like today. That is trying to
destroy the future and that is trying to destroy all possibilities of
growth.</p><p>Tomorrow should be tomorrow, never today. You should not expect it to
be the same. That very expectation is dangerous because in the first
place it is never going to be so; hence you feel frustrated. And if by
chance, by accident it happens to be just like today, then you will be
bored, but neither frustration is joy nor is joy.</p><p>Let the future be open. Don't put any expectations on it. Leave it
unknown, unpredictable and don't try in any way to make things
permanent. The nature of life is change, and we have to flow with
nature, with tao, with the ultimate law of existence.</p><p>Be in tune with it without any expectation on your part and you will
be enriched</p><p>-- tremendously. Each moment will bring new joy, new life, new light,
a new god. And a person whose love is always flowing and who is never
confined by anything becomes vast, as vast as the sky itself. In that
vastness one knows what god is. That vastness is god.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #23</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

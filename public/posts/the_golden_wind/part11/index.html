It is for reference purposes only.]\nThere is a great difference between a student and a disciple. The student communicates with the teacher through the mind. His relationship is that of communication, head to head, intellect to intellect. He knows nothing of the master, he can know only about the teacher. The teacher is one who teaches something; the master is one who transmits something, he doesn't teach. He has no doctrine to teach but a life to give, a bliss to share, a truth to transpire. It is a totally different kind of relationship: it is from heart to heart, it is a love relationship.\nThe disciple discovers the master because the disciple approaches through the heart. The whole gestalt is different. To approach through the head is very superficial. One can learn many things through the head too, one can become\nvery knowledgeable but one cannot know oneself. One can know everything else except oneself -- and that is the very foundation of true knowledge. And if the foundation is missing you are making a house in the sand, is is going to collapse. Not only is it going to collapse, it will crush you too, because you will start living in it.\nThe scholar lives in the house of knowledge which can crumble any moment -- it has no foundation. The disciple is not a scholar. The student, when successful, becomes a scholar. The disciple, when successful, becomes a devotee. His love changes its quality, it becomes more prayerlike, it becomes more unearthly, it becomes absolutely pure and innocent. It asks nothing.\nLove is the door from where the disciple enters and discovers the master. To discover the master is one of the greatest blessings in life, because without discovering the master it is next to impossible to attain to truth. You will need somebody who has already attained to trigger the process in you, to function as a catalytic agent. But it needs great courage to be a disciple.\nIt needs no courage to be a student. All that it needs is greeds greed for knowledge, information. It is very ego-fulfilling: the more knowledge you accumulate, the more your ego feels decorated, crowned;it has many degrees and gold medals and certificates.\nThe disciple has to risk his ego. The very thing that is enhanced by knowledge has to be dropped and surrendered. It is almost like committing hara-kiri, committing suicide. In a sense it is suicide. In a sense it is the beginning of the real life. The unreal life disappears and the real life begins. The unreal life is lived around the centre of the ego; and the real life needs no ego, being is enough.\nTo be a disciple means to surrender your ego. Sannyas is surrender, sannyas is love. Sannyas is a device to attain to disciplehood, and ultimately to the purest form of love, devotion, prayer. It is only through this that one becomes aware that existence is full of godliness.\nThe student can learn much about god but he knows nothing. Words, cliches, theories ... many he accumulates, but all is sheer junk, an unnecessary burden. He is like a donkey carrying Encyclopaedia Brittanica.\nThe disciple is absolutely unburdened. He grows wings. He loses the grip of\ngreed, the clinging to any kind of accumulation -- whether it is of money or knowledge. He simply loses all grip on anything whatsoever. He lives in an unclinging way, unattached. But in that state of unattachment, unclinging, tremendous mysteries open their doors, great flowers bloom. The imprisoned splendour is released.\nDaniel is the name of an ancient Old Testament prophet who was thrown into a den of lions because he refused to drop his commitment towards his faith.\nThe story is beautiful -- whether it happened or not is not the point: he came out unharmed, the lions did not harm him at all. The story is beautiful because it says two things.\nOne is that whenever there is a man who devotes his life to a certain attitude, approach, who endeavours to discover truth, society immediately becomes inimical towards him. It starts taking revenge. It cannot forgive him because society lives on lies -- and the man committed to truth becomes a danger to all the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nvested interests he has to be killed.\nMan has been doing that all along. He has not changed a little bit, even today he is the same. Much progress has happened in other fields -- technologically, scientifically man is far advanced today, but psychologically he is as primitive as ever. He still behaves with Daniel in the same old way.\nThe second point in the story is that even wild lions are far more intelligent than man, far more compassionate and loving than man, far more human than so- called human beings. They could not harm Daniel; they could see that this man was worth saving.\nSuch stories have existed in all mythologies. A mad elephant was set loose to kill Buddha. He had killed many people. He was so mad that he had to be kept in chains continuously, but his chains were removed and he was left loose. When\nhe came to Buddha he looked at Buddha, bowed down and touched his feet! Sat there for half an hour! The people who left him were puzzled -- what had happened? What had gone wrong?\nThe story is the same: even a mad elephant is not as mad as the so-called sane human beings. These may not be historical facts. I don't insist on their being historical. They are far more valuable than historical facts, they are eternal truths. They contain something immensely significant. They are not just facts but truths.\nFacts are momentary, facts are events in time. Truths are not events in time, they have something eternal about them. So these are symbolic stories.\nThis is going to happen to my disciples too -- it has already started happening. They will be tortured in every possible way, they will be harrassed in every possible way. But one thing is beautiful about this whole thing, that the more you are harassed for truth, the deeper becomes your love for it. You start becoming more crystallised, you start becoming a soul, you start having a centre. The more you are tortured, harassed, the more you become committed to your truth, the more you become rooted in it, the more certain you become of its validity, because if it were not true then people would not bother about you at all. If so many people are worried and are unable to tolerate you it simply shows that you have stumbled upon something significant.\nPeople are only afraid of truth and of nothing else.\nThe last words of Gautam the Buddha to his disciples were 'Be a lamp unto yourself.' This is the most pregnant message ever. The whole philosophy of meditation is contained in it.\nMeditation means that no outer light is going to help, no outer treasure is going to make you rich, no outer conquest is going to make you a real conqueror. The real treasure is within you and the real conquest has to be made there. It is such a ridiculous thing that we go on searching for something which we have already got, but we never look within. We look everywhere else we can go to the very corners of the earth or even to the moon in search of some illusory pleasure -- just one territory we never enter, and that is our own being.\nMeditation is a simple technique of entering it. Meditation means awareness, alertness, watchfulness, witnessing. Witness your actions, witness your thoughts\nwitness your feelings so that slowly slow you can see you are neither the body nor the mind nor heart -- that you are the witness of it all.\nThe moment you know that you are only a witness, a pure mirror reflecting everything, and you are not identified with any reflection, suddenly you discover your inner light. It is already there, but we have to shift our consciousness. A one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn is needed, and it happens only by witnessing, there is no other method. When you are witnessing, anything one thing becomes clear, that you are not the thing that you are witnessing, obviously; you are the witness of it.\nGo on, deeper and deeper. When nothing is left to witness, you have witnessed all objects that you can witness and you have rejected them knowing 'I am not that,' when everything is eliminated, only you are left\n-- just the mirror and nothing else; suddenly the shift: consciousness turns upon itself.\nThat moment of turning in is the greatest moment in life. In that very moment you know who you are and you know what god is, and you know what bliss is, you know what truth is, freedom is, what eternity is.\nAll that is worth knowing is known -- immediately, instantly. And then you can go on living in the world but you will be living with a totally different centre, with a totally different perspective: you will be in the world but absolutely out of it.\nThat's the way of sannyas: to be in the world and absolutely out of it.\nEvery sannyasin has to become a song of meditation. I insist on the fact that you have to become a song, a celebration, because for centuries meditation has become associated with seriousness. That has proved a calamity, the greatest disaster; it has colored the whole world of meditation in a wrong way. And because of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthis wrong association only sad and pathological people become interested in meditation.\nPeople think that religion is for those who are already dead or almost dead. It is for old people, people who are in despair, people who have failed in life and need some kind of consolation, people who could not make it. Karl Marx says, religion is the opium of the people. It is for failures who need some kind of drug to keep them away from their failures and the pain of their failures so that they can forget their miseries.\nKarl Marx is certainly right about this wrong kind of religion, but he is not right about the religion I am talking about.\nMy religion has a totally different flavor. It has the flavor of joy, of dance, of song, of celebration. It has the color of spring. In the East orange symbolizes spring. In spring, when all the flowers bloom, the whole forest becomes orange. They all become sannyasins. They become afire with color.\nIt is not for dead people, it is for the most fresh young people. It is for those who are totally alive and want to be more alive.\nMy sannyasins have to change the very definition of religion in the world. It is a great task, a great challenge, but now the time has come for it to be done, otherwise religion will die. That sad and serious kind of religion has no more future.\nNow we need a laughing religion, a dancing religion, a religion which loves life, which loves love; a religion which rejoices in small things. A religion which is not against life but totally for it.\nMeditation is the ultimate magic. It changes dust into gold; it transforms the lowest forms of energies into the highest form of energies. It is an alchemical process of transformation.\nMan comes with all the potential of being a god and remains only an animal for the simple reason that he remains confined to raw energies. He never tries to change those raw energies into some refined form.\nThey can be changed: anger can become compassion -- it just has to pass through meditation; sex can become samadhi -- it just has to pass through\nmeditation, greed can become sharing, lust can become love, love can become prayer. And we live at the lowest rung of the ladder, we live where we are born. We never think of ourselves as potential beings, we take life for granted, as if we are already born entire, complete, perfect. That's not so. We are born with the capacity to be perfect, we are born with all the potential to reach to the highest peak. But it is only a potential -- it has to be made actual. And to make it actual you will need a certain methodology.\nIt is just as gold is found in the mines and then it goes through many processes of refinement. It is just as diamonds are to be found in the mines, but then they are just stones. Only jewellers can recognise them ordinary people will not be able to recognise that they are diamonds.\nI know one jeweller, one of my friends. He has his house full of so many diamonds that he cannot count them, he has to weigh them. He keeps them in heaps. When he took me to show his collection I only saw ordinary stones. I said 'What are you talking about? You were saying that you have thousands of diamonds\n-- are these diamonds?' He said 'These are diamonds, but they will need much processing; then only will you be able to see what they are. Right now, they are just ordinary stones, and I purchased them for nothing because the people who brought them to me thought they were just coloured stones.'\nMan also is a rare diamond, but ordinarily you will find in him anger, greed, hatred, lust -- all kinds of poisons -- and you will not be able to see any Buddha, any Christ at all. You will not be able to see Krishna anywhere, you will not hear the flute of Krishna inside him, and you will not see the purity and the innocence of Buddha. But he contains the purity of Buddha, the innocence of Mahavira, the rebellion of Jesus, the song and the dance of Krishna, and the infinite wisdom of Lao Tzu. He contains everything that has ever happened to any human being in the world.\nBut a certain science is needed, and that's the science of meditation. It is not a complicated science at all, very simple, but sometimes it happens that we go on missing the simplest thing in life. We miss the obvious because we are always looking far away. We are always attracted by the distant, by the far away, and the closest always remains available. But because it is always available, who cares about it?\nI was reading that once a survey was made in London of how many people had not visited the Tower of London. It was a surprise, a great surprise for the surveyors, that there were thousands of people who had not visited the tower. They had been passing by the side of the tower for their whole life, but they were thinking 'Any day, any time, we can go and see it.' And there are people who come from the farthest corner of the world to see the Tower of London!\nIn Agra there are thousands of people who have not visited the Taj Mahal -- and they may die without visiting it, unless somebody declares that 'Tomorrow an atom bomb is going to be dropped on Agra.' Then 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthey will rush to see the Taj Mahal because that would be the last day. Otherwise they will go on living, postponing: it is so obvious, it is so close by, they can visit it any time.\nOur own being is even closer, and the method of meditation is so simple -- that's why millions of people miss it.\nOnce you start going in you will be surprised that it is such a simple phenomenon but it has tremendous beauty, the greatest joy possible, the greatest flowering possible. How had you missed it for so long? You will not be able to explain to yourself why and how you waited so long. And it can transform your whole being into gold.\nSo being a sannyasin make it a point... I don't ask for any other formalities, the whole emphasis is on meditation. Make it a point that from this moment meditation has to be your focus, your whole life, everything else is secondary. Sacrifice everything for meditation and you will never repent.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #12\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2849","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part11/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2849 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part11.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

even today he is the same. Much progress has happened in other fields --
technologically, scientifically man is far advanced today, but
psychologically he is as primitive as ever. He still behaves with Daniel
in the same old way.</p><p>The second point in the story is that even wild lions are far more
intelligent than man, far more compassionate and loving than man, far
more human than so- called human beings. They could not harm Daniel;
they could see that this man was worth saving.</p><p>Such stories have existed in all mythologies. A mad elephant was set
loose to kill Buddha. He had killed many people. He was so mad that he
had to be kept in chains continuously, but his chains were removed and
he was left loose. When</p><p>he came to Buddha he looked at Buddha, bowed down and touched his
feet! Sat there for half an hour! The people who left him were puzzled
-- what had happened? What had gone wrong?</p><p>The story is the same: even a mad elephant is not as mad as the
so-called sane human beings. These may not be historical facts. I don't
insist on their being historical. They are far more valuable than
historical facts, they are eternal truths. They contain something
immensely significant. They are not just facts but truths.</p><p>Facts are momentary, facts are events in time. Truths are not events
in time, they have something eternal about them. So these are symbolic
stories.</p><p>This is going to happen to my disciples too -- it has already started
happening. They will be tortured in every possible way, they will be
harrassed in every possible way. But one thing is beautiful about this
whole thing, that the more you are harassed for truth, the deeper
becomes your love for it. You start becoming more crystallised, you
start becoming a soul, you start having a centre. The more you are
tortured, harassed, the more you become committed to your truth, the
more you become rooted in it, the more certain you become of its
validity, because if it were not true then people would not bother about
you at all. If so many people are worried and are unable to tolerate you
it simply shows that you have stumbled upon something significant.</p><p>People are only afraid of truth and of nothing else.</p><p>The last words of Gautam the Buddha to his disciples were 'Be a lamp
unto yourself.' This is the most pregnant message ever. The whole
philosophy of meditation is contained in it.</p><p>Meditation means that no outer light is going to help, no outer
treasure is going to make you rich, no outer conquest is going to make
you a real conqueror. The real treasure is within you and the real
conquest has to be made there. It is such a ridiculous thing that we go
on searching for something which we have already got, but we never look
within. We look everywhere else we can go to the very corners of the
earth or even to the moon in search of some illusory pleasure -- just
one territory we never enter, and that is our own being.</p><p>Meditation is a simple technique of entering it. Meditation means
awareness, alertness, watchfulness, witnessing. Witness your actions,
witness your thoughts</p><p>witness your feelings so that slowly slow you can see you are neither
the body nor the mind nor heart -- that you are the witness of it
all.</p><p>The moment you know that you are only a witness, a pure mirror
reflecting everything, and you are not identified with any reflection,
suddenly you discover your inner light. It is already there, but we have
to shift our consciousness. A one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn is
needed, and it happens only by witnessing, there is no other method.
When you are witnessing, anything one thing becomes clear, that you are
not the thing that you are witnessing, obviously; you are the witness of
it.</p><p>Go on, deeper and deeper. When nothing is left to witness, you have
witnessed all objects that you can witness and you have rejected them
knowing 'I am not that,' when everything is eliminated, only
<em>you</em> are left</p><p>-- just the mirror and nothing else; suddenly the shift:
consciousness turns upon itself.</p><p>That moment of turning in is the greatest moment in life. In that
very moment you know who you are and you know what god is, and you know
what bliss is, you know what truth is, freedom is, what eternity is.</p><p>All that is worth knowing is known -- immediately, instantly. And
then you can go on living in the world but you will be living with a
totally different centre, with a totally different perspective: you will
be in the world but absolutely out of it.</p><p>That's the way of sannyas: to be in the world and absolutely out of
it.</p><p>Every sannyasin has to become a song of meditation. I insist on the
fact that you have to become a song, a celebration, because for
centuries meditation has become associated with seriousness. That has
proved a calamity, the greatest disaster; it has colored the whole world
of meditation in a wrong way. And because of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>this wrong association only sad and pathological people become
interested in meditation.</p><p>People think that religion is for those who are already dead or
almost dead. It is for old people, people who are in despair, people who
have failed in life and need some kind of consolation, people who could
not make it. Karl Marx says, religion is the opium of the people. It is
for failures who need some kind of drug to keep them away from their
failures and the pain of their failures so that they can forget their
miseries.</p><p>Karl Marx is certainly right about this wrong kind of religion, but
he is not right about the religion I am talking about.</p><p>My religion has a totally different flavor. It has the flavor of joy,
of dance, of song, of celebration. It has the color of spring. In the
East orange symbolizes spring. In spring, when all the flowers bloom,
the whole forest becomes orange. They all become sannyasins. They become
afire with color.</p><p>It is not for dead people, it is for the most fresh young people. It
is for those who are totally alive and want to be more alive.</p><p>My sannyasins have to change the very definition of religion in the
world. It is a great task, a great challenge, but now the time has come
for it to be done, otherwise religion will die. That sad and serious
kind of religion has no more future.</p><p>Now we need a laughing religion, a dancing religion, a religion which
loves life, which loves love; a religion which rejoices in small things.
A religion which is not against life but totally for it.</p><p>Meditation is the ultimate magic. It changes dust into gold; it
transforms the lowest forms of energies into the highest form of
energies. It is an alchemical process of transformation.</p><p>Man comes with all the potential of being a god and remains only an
animal for the simple reason that he remains confined to raw energies.
He never tries to change those raw energies into some refined form.</p><p>They <em>can</em> be changed: anger can become compassion -- it just
has to pass through meditation; sex can become samadhi -- it just has to
pass through</p><p>meditation, greed can become sharing, lust can become love, love can
become prayer. And we live at the lowest rung of the ladder, we live
where we are born. We never think of ourselves as <em>potential</em>
beings, we take life for granted, as if we are already born entire,
complete, perfect. That's not so. We are born with the capacity to be
perfect, we are born with all the potential to reach to the highest
peak. But it is only a potential -- it has to be made actual. And to
make it actual you will need a certain methodology.</p><p>It is just as gold is found in the mines and then it goes through
many processes of refinement. It is just as diamonds are to be found in
the mines, but then they are just stones. Only jewellers can recognise
them ordinary people will not be able to recognise that they are
diamonds.</p><p>I know one jeweller, one of my friends. He has his house full of so
many diamonds that he cannot count them, he has to weigh them. He keeps
them in heaps. When he took me to show his collection I only saw
ordinary stones. I said 'What are you talking about? You were saying
that you have thousands of diamonds</p><p>-- are these diamonds?' He said 'These are diamonds, but they will
need much processing; then only will you be able to see what they are.
Right now, they are just ordinary stones, and I purchased them for
nothing because the people who brought them to me thought they were just
coloured stones.'</p><p>Man also is a rare diamond, but ordinarily you will find in him
anger, greed, hatred, lust -- all kinds of poisons -- and you will not
be able to see any Buddha, any Christ at all. You will not be able to
see Krishna anywhere, you will not hear the flute of Krishna inside him,
and you will not see the purity and the innocence of Buddha. But he
contains the purity of Buddha, the innocence of Mahavira, the rebellion
of Jesus, the song and the dance of Krishna, and the infinite wisdom of
Lao Tzu. He contains <em>everything</em> that has ever happened to any
human being in the world.</p><p>But a certain science is needed, and that's the science of
meditation. It is not a complicated science at all, very simple, but
sometimes it happens that we go on missing the simplest thing in life.
We miss the obvious because we are always looking far away. We are
always attracted by the distant, by the far away, and the closest always
remains available. But because it is always available, who cares about
it?</p><p>I was reading that once a survey was made in London of how many
people had not visited the Tower of London. It was a surprise, a great
surprise for the surveyors, that there were thousands of people who had
not visited the tower. They had been passing by the side of the tower
for their whole life, but they were thinking 'Any day, any time, we can
go and see it.' And there are people who come from the farthest corner
of the world to see the Tower of London!</p><p>In Agra there are thousands of people who have not visited the Taj
Mahal -- and they may die without visiting it, unless somebody declares
that 'Tomorrow an atom bomb is going to be dropped on Agra.' Then
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

day. Otherwise they will go on living, postponing: it is so obvious, it
is so close by, they can visit it any time.</p><p>Our own being is even closer, and the method of meditation is so
simple -- that's why millions of people miss it.</p><p>Once you start going in you will be surprised that it is such a
simple phenomenon but it has tremendous beauty, the greatest joy
possible, the greatest flowering possible. How had you missed it for so
long? You will not be able to explain to yourself why and how you waited
so long. And it can transform your whole being into gold.</p><p>So being a sannyasin make it a point... I don't ask for any other
formalities, the whole emphasis is on meditation. Make it a point that
from this moment meditation has to be your focus, your whole life,
everything else is secondary. Sacrifice everything for meditation and
you will never repent.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #12</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

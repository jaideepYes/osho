It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan lives in misery because of cowardliness. There is no other cause for it. It is fear of the unknown that keeps man clinging to his misery, because misery is known, well-known. We are born in it, we are brought up in it, we see it all around -- everybody is miserable, the whole crowd is miserable. It is the climate, the atmosphere. To be blissful means to transcend this climate, this atmosphere, to go beyond the limits of the crowd, to move into the unknown and the unacquainted and the uncharted.\nIt is the fear of the unknown that keeps us clinging to all kinds of suffering. The suffering is not clinging to you, you cling to it. People prefer suffering more than nothing.\nSannyas begins with changing your preference. Nothing is not only better that suffering, it is better than everything, it is better than the whole. To be nothing, to be a nobody, to be an utter non entity certainly needs guts. It is moving to the farthest shore without knowing whether it exists or not. It is losing this shore, which has become very well-known, and taking a quantum leap towards something which may be, may not be -- there is no guarantee.\nThat's why a master is needed. A master is not a guarantee of the unknown, for\nthe unknown, but a witness. He cannot guarantee truth for you. We can only share: 'It is -- I have known it, I am a witness to it.'\nAnd if, looking into his eyes, you can feel the trust, if you can feel his love and your love for him, then something starts transpiring, then something mysterious starts happening. That mysterious relationship is disciplehood, that is sannyas. It is the most mysterious experience of life. Even the experience of love is nothing compared to it.\nMan lives in bondage because man lives in the mind. Mind is a bondage. Mind is not yours, remember.\nMind is implanted in you by the society; hence there are as many minds as there are societies, cultures, religions.\nA Christian mind is different from a Jewish mind, a Hindu mind is different from a Mohammedan mind, an atheist mind is certainly different from a theist mind. And these minds are cultivated by others; they are impositions by others on you. But the imposition is so subtle that you are not even aware of it, that you are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeing forced by your parents and the society to be a Christian or a Hindu or a Communist, that this is not your own choice, that you have not chosen it out of freedom. So freedom was never given to you; you were not even asked, your permission has not even been taken. But for years it has been forced, repeatedly, so it becomes a deep conditioning in you.\nMeditation means dropping the identity with the mind, knowing that 'I am not the mind that I have always supposed myself to be, that I am separate from my mind, that I am just a witness, a consciousness, that I am neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian, that I don't belong to any country, to any church, to any ideology.' The moment this becomes your experience you start living in freedom.\nMeditation brings freedom. It releases you from the subtlest kind of bondage. A meditator is simply religious. He does not believe in any dogma. He knows by his experience that the world does not end in matter, that there are higher realms than matter, that the whole existence is immersed in godliness.\nWhen this is your experience it is a totally different thing: it is not a belief, it is knowing, it is wisdom, it is a light within your being. It makes you totally free from the past, from all kinds of societies and cultures.\nFor the first time you know who you are; you become an independent soul. That is real birth, a resurrection.\nThat's the whole purpose of sannyas -- it is a process of being reborn.\nLove is the greatest rebellion known to man, because it is rebellion against the ego. It's way very few people love. Very few people ever gather enough courage to move into the world of love for the simple reason that they cannot drop their ego -- and it is a prerequisite. Love happens only when you can merge your ego, when you can put it aside, when you can say 'I am not -- you are.' This is the beginning of love when one says 'I am not- you are.' And when the 'you' also disappears that is the end of love, that is the climax of love, the highest peak, where I and thou both disappear. And there is an organic unity where duality disappears.\nIt can happen between two individuals. That is just like learning swimming in shallow water. Naturally when one learns, one learns in shallow water, in a swimming pool. You don't start learning in the ocean, you don't start going into the deep waters. But once you know how to swim then you can go. It doesn't matter whether the water is one mile deep or five miles deep; it can be infinitely deep -- it makes no difference.\nLove between two persons is only a lesson for the ultimate love: love between you and the whole existence.\nBut those people who have never even loved individuals cannot hope to love god: god means the whole.\nAnd there are stupid people all over the world who think they love god, although they don't love their wives, they don't love their husbands, they don't love their children. In fact their whole idea is that if you want to love god, you have to\ndrop loving everybody else; you have to renounce all love relationships, then you can love god. Their god is a very jealous god, like a jealous wife or like a jealous husband. Their god is as stupid as they are. It is bound to be because your god is always your projection; it is as stupid or as intelligent as you are. In fact god is always a mirror: it only reflects your face. If you have a monkey face it cannot reflect any angel in it.\nSo monkeys have monkey-gods -- Hanuman. And in India you will find many Hanuman. Those are monkey gods. That simply shows one thing, that there are many monkeys in India, otherwise how is a man going to worship a monkey? Something monkeyish must be there.\nDarwin never came to know about it, otherwise he would have incorporated it in his theory of the evolution of humanity. Hanuman could have become a part in proving his theory. That Hanuman seems to be an ancestral god; people still remember something of the past -- he is a very ancient god. The very idea of god is always a reflection of your mind.\nThe people who think against love, who renounce love, cannot love god either. Their god is only a strategy to avoid love. And god is so abstract that you can pretend you love god without any trouble, without any problem; there is no risk in it. To love a woman or a man is risky: it creates trouble, it brings a thousand and one agonies. Of course it also brings ecstasies, but they are always balanced: the deeper the ecstasies, the deeper will be the agonies. If you want to avoid the ecstasies then you can avoid the agonies too. Then you can have a smooth wife- husband relationship -- the normal, the traditional, the orthodox, the polite British type. Then there is no problem. But if you want a real love relationship in which there is some possibility of ecstasy then there is always a similar possibility of agony. If you reach peaks then you will have to have valleys too; the higher the peaks, the deeper will be the valleys. It will be in the same proportion, exactly balancing.\nBut with the love of god you don't have anything -- it is just an abstract idea. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy idea of love is not abstract, it is very pragmatic, realistic. I am not an idealist at all, I am very down-to-earth. Start loving people make it your foundation, and then slowly move towards higher realities.\nIf you can love human beings, if you can love animals, if you can love trees and rocks, then only are you capable of loving god. And then your god will not be an abstraction, then your god will be simply the totality of existence. Then it will be the whole universe -- the stars and the moon and the sun. Then it will be simply the total of all. And that love needs only one thing: slowly slowly you have to die as an ego. And the more you die as an ego, the more you are born as a soul.\nThis I call a rebellion. All other rebellions are not rebellions; they are just small things -- political revolutions, reforms but not rebellions.\nThe only revolution worth calling rebellion is when you are capable of discarding the whole idea of the ego and you are ready to disappear into love just like a dewdrop disappears into the ocean and becomes the ocean.\nEvery man is born with a divine treasure within him. And in fact we are searching for it for our whole life, but we go on searching in wrong directions. We go on searching for it outside, and it is not there so it cannot be found.\nIt is within you, it is your very nature, so unless one explores withinwards one never finds it.\nThe people who have searched for it on the outside have never found it. There is not a single exception; without any exception they have all failed. Still, man is so stupid, he goes on doing the same thing again and again.\nAnd the people who have explored within have always found it -- that too, without exception. A Jesus, a Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu -- anybody who has ever gone in has always found it. Nobody has ever failed there. But such is the stupidity of man that he never listens to these people.\nIt is good that you are here and you are ready to move into sannyas. It can become a tremendously significant decision in your life. If you really make it a commitment, if you really get involved in this pilgrimage you will be tremendously enriched, you will be able to find the kingdom of god. And that is\nthe only thing worth finding -- everything else is futile.\nIt is contentment that brings bliss. We live in discontentment, we axe never contented with anything.\nThe mind always goes on asking for more that is the nature of the mind -- and those who follow mind will remain in misery. They can even become great emperors -- they will be beggars. Even Alexander the Great lived like a beggar and died like a beggar.\nBy beggar I mean a person who is always begging for more. By emperor I mean a person who is immensely contented with whatsoever he has got. It is a change of gestalt, a shift of our total consciousness.\nJust look at all that god has already given to you... and it is inestimable, it is so much that nobody is worthy of it. We have not earned it, we don't deserve it -- god gives out of his abundance but we never feel grateful.\nIn this ungratefulness misery lives and becomes stronger every day. Discontentment is food for misery, and contentment is nourishment for bliss.\nChange your energy from discontentment to contentment and you will be surprised by the transformation: immediately there is gratitude, thankfulness. And whatsoever one has got one feels so happy with it that small thing of life start bringing tremendous joy. Just a cup of tea can be as bliss-giving as the whole of paradise; a cup of tea can contain the whole of paradise. It all depends on you, on how you look at it. Otherwise the whole of paradise will not be capable of satisfying you; you will start finding faults there.\nThe way of sannyas is the way of contentment.\nMeditation opens your inner consciousness like the sun opens the flowers. The sun does not make any effort; it does not force the petals of the flowers to open up -- just the presence is enough, the warmth is enough. The presence of the sun functions like a catalytic agent. Something inside the flower immediately starts opening up, as if the flower suddenly feels a deep trust, there is no need to hides it can open up, it can open all the doors and all the windows.\nThe same, exactly the same happens in meditation. Meditation simply creates an inner warmth. The non-meditative person is ice-cold inside. He has no heart, he\nis just mind, and mind is ice-cold. The meditative person's energy starts moving from the head to the heart; the heart starts becoming warmer. You actually start feeling the warmth inside, and in that warmth your being opens up like a flower. And that opening is the fulfilment. In that opening one feels one has come home. In that opening one knows how 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnothing is missing -- this is it!\nA man without love is like a plastic flower, a paper flower with no perfume. He looks like a flower, he looks like a man, but he is not really a man. A man becomes a man only when his heart starts throbbing with love. With love man is no more an ordinary animal, he starts becoming extraordinary; he starts moving upwards. Otherwise he is just like other animals. He has a bigger mind, more efficient -- that's the only difference. The difference is quantitative, and a quantitative difference is not a difference at all.\nThe real difference is only when there is a difference of quality. And love is the only thing that brings a new quality to you, otherwise everything else is available to animals also.\nSex is available to them, but no love. They also have a certain kind of intelligence. For example, some animals have a very good memory. There are some species of snakes which have such a memory that for years they will remember to take revenge; they will not forget. Elephants have a very good memory. For years they will remember; even after a ten, twelve-year gap, they will be able to recognise the friend and the enemy, immediately.\nOnce I went to visit a fort of a maharaja -- he himself had not gone to the fort for eight years. Just to show me he went with me, and at least a dozen peacocks came and started dancing. I asked him 'What is the matter?\" And he said 'They recognise us. Whenever anybody of my family comes they will receive us with dance. After eight years I have come but they have not forgotten.'\nJust to experiment, the next year when I went there I took his wife with me, and\nthe same thing happened. I enquired of the servant, they said 'They won't dance with anybody else -- only the royal family.\nThey recognise who the royal persons are. For only a few people... if the maharaja, his wife, his son, if these three persons come they will dance, otherwise they won't dance. No effort can persuade them to dance. And they have been here for many centuries: their parents were dancing, the parents of their parents were dancing. It is as if they have inherited the memory and they continue the tradition.'\nNow the maharaja is no more a maharaja, because maharajas and their states have disappeared. Nobody recognises him any more, but those peacocks do.\nAnimals have their own memory system, they have a certain intelligence of their own. Only one thing is missing: they don't know what love is, they can't know. Even out of one hundred men, ninety-nine never know what love is. The rare individual comes to know love.\nMy vision of a real man requires two things: love and meditation. But love is needed far more essentially, because if man can love he is bound to find, sooner or later, the way to meditation, because love itself gives you certain glimpses of meditation. It makes you silent. Then two lovers meet, if they are really in love, they have nothing to say to each other. They may hold hands and they will sit silently. The silence is too significant to disturb by anything else.\nLove gives a few glimpses of meditation, naturally. Love is a natural kind of meditation, and because it is a natural kind it can become a good jumping board for meditation.\nSo begin with love. Love as deeply as possible, as widely as possible, because the wider the love, the more rich your inner being becomes. Love as many people as possible, because each person is unique and each experience unique. And love not only man, love animals, because they have a different plane of existence. Your love of them will make you aware of their plane of existence. Love trees too, birds too, then you become multi-dimensional and your life becomes more and more enriched.\nThat enrichment is what religions have called the birth of the soul. I call it the perfume of love. And then one day out of that perfume you will start moving into meditation naturally.\nMeditation is a transcendence, a transcendence of all identities. We are identified with the body. The first step of meditation destroys that identity; we become aware that we are not the body. Then we become aware that we are identified with the mind, with the thought process. That is the second step of meditation: it destroys that identity and makes us aware that we are not minds either. And the third and the most important and the deepest step is that we are identified with the heart, with our feelings, emotions.\nMeditation destroys that too.\nThese are the three steps, the three great negations, and out of these three negations comes the most positive phenomenon in existence: suddenly you become aware of who you are. But you become perfectly aware of who you are not.\nTo know the false as false is the beginning of knowing the true as true. So real religion starts in negation and ends in absolute affirmation. It starts with no, three no ss no to the body, no to the mind, no to the heart.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd then a miracle happens: out of these three no's you suddenly attain to the biggest yes that you have ever seen in your life, ever experienced in your life -- a total yes, an absolute yes. That yes is the transcendence of all misery, all bondage, all ignorance, all darkness, all death. You become part of eternity, you become part of god. You become god himself! That is the ultimate goal of sannyas. How long will you be here?\n-- Probably for four weeks.\nGood. Four weeks are enough: three for three no's. The next time come for four months and then for four years and then for forever!\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #15\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3353","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3353 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

minds as there are societies, cultures, religions.</p><p>A Christian mind is different from a Jewish mind, a Hindu mind is
different from a Mohammedan mind, an atheist mind is certainly different
from a theist mind. And these minds are cultivated by others; they are
impositions by others on you. But the imposition is so subtle that you

Hindu or a Communist, that this is not your own choice, that you have
not chosen it out of freedom. So freedom was never given to you; you
were not even asked, your permission has not even been taken. But for
years it has been forced, repeatedly, so it becomes a deep conditioning
in you.</p><p>Meditation means dropping the identity with the mind, knowing that 'I
am not the mind that I have always supposed myself to be, that I am
separate from my mind, that I am just a witness, a consciousness, that I
am neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian, that I don't belong to
any country, to any church, to any ideology.' The moment this becomes
your experience you start living in freedom.</p><p>Meditation brings freedom. It releases you from the subtlest kind of
bondage. A meditator is simply religious. He does not believe in any
dogma. He knows by his experience that the world does not end in matter,
that there are higher realms than matter, that the whole existence is
immersed in godliness.</p><p>When this is <em>your</em> experience it is a totally different
thing: it is not a belief, it is knowing, it is wisdom, it is a light
within your being. It makes you totally free from the past, from all
kinds of societies and cultures.</p><p>For the first time you know who you are; you become an independent
soul. That is real birth, a resurrection.</p><p>That's the whole purpose of sannyas -- it is a process of being
reborn.</p><p>Love is the greatest rebellion known to man, because it is rebellion
against the ego. It's way very few people love. Very few people ever
gather enough courage to move into the world of love for the simple
reason that they cannot drop their ego -- and it is a prerequisite. Love
happens only when you can merge your ego, when you can put it aside,
when you can say 'I am not -- you are.' This is the beginning of love
when one says 'I am not- you are.' And when the 'you' also disappears
that is the end of love, that is the climax of love, the highest peak,
where I and thou both disappear. And there is an organic unity where
duality disappears.</p><p>It can happen between two individuals. That is just like learning
swimming in shallow water. Naturally when one learns, one learns in
shallow water, in a swimming pool. You don't start learning in the
ocean, you don't start going into the deep waters. But once you know how
to swim then you can go. It doesn't matter whether the water is one mile
deep or five miles deep; it can be infinitely deep -- it makes no
difference.</p><p>Love between two persons is only a lesson for the ultimate love: love
between you and the whole existence.</p><p>But those people who have never even loved individuals cannot hope to
love god: god means the whole.</p><p>And there are stupid people all over the world who think they love
god, although they don't love their wives, they don't love their
husbands, they don't love their children. In fact their whole idea is
that if you want to love god, you have to</p><p>drop loving everybody else; you have to renounce all love
relationships, then you can love god. Their god is a very jealous god,
like a jealous wife or like a jealous husband. Their god is as stupid as
they are. It is bound to be because your god is always your projection;
it is as stupid or as intelligent as you are. In fact god is always a
mirror: it only reflects your face. If you have a monkey face it cannot
reflect any angel in it.</p><p>So monkeys have monkey-gods -- Hanuman. And in India you will find
many Hanuman. Those are monkey gods. That simply shows one thing, that
there are many monkeys in India, otherwise how is a man going to worship
a monkey? Something monkeyish must be there.</p><p>Darwin never came to know about it, otherwise he would have
incorporated it in his theory of the evolution of humanity. Hanuman
could have become a part in proving his theory. That Hanuman seems to be
an ancestral god; people still remember something of the past -- he is a
very ancient god. The very idea of god is always a reflection of your
mind.</p><p>The people who think against love, who renounce love, cannot love god
either. Their god is only a strategy to avoid love. And god is so
abstract that you can pretend you love god without any trouble, without
any problem; there is no risk in it. To love a woman or a man is risky:
it creates trouble, it brings a thousand and one agonies. Of course it
also brings ecstasies, but they are always balanced: the deeper the
ecstasies, the deeper will be the agonies. If you want to avoid the
ecstasies then you can avoid the agonies too. Then you can have a smooth
wife- husband relationship -- the normal, the traditional, the orthodox,
the polite British type. Then there is no problem. But if you want a
<em>real</em> love relationship in which there is some possibility of
ecstasy then there is always a similar possibility of agony. If you
reach peaks then you will have to have valleys too; the higher the
peaks, the deeper will be the valleys. It will be in the same
proportion, exactly balancing.</p><p>But with the love of god you don't have anything -- it is just an
abstract idea. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

pragmatic, realistic. I am not an idealist at all, I am very
down-to-earth. Start loving people make it your foundation, and then
slowly move towards higher realities.</span></p><p>If you can love human beings, if you can love animals, if you can
love trees and rocks, then only are you capable of loving god. And then
your god will not be an abstraction, then your god will be simply the
totality of existence. Then it will be the whole universe -- the stars
and the moon and the sun. Then it will be simply the total of all. And
that love needs only one thing: slowly slowly you have to die as an ego.
And the more you die as an ego, the more you are born as a soul.</p><p>This I call a rebellion. All other rebellions are not rebellions;
they are just small things -- political revolutions, reforms but not
rebellions.</p><p>The only revolution worth calling rebellion is when you are capable
of discarding the whole idea of the ego and you are ready to disappear
into love just like a dewdrop disappears into the ocean and becomes the
ocean.</p><p>Every man is born with a divine treasure within him. And in fact we
are searching for it for our whole life, but we go on searching in wrong
directions. We go on searching for it outside, and it is not there so it
cannot be found.</p><p>It is within you, it is your very nature, so unless one explores
withinwards one never finds it.</p><p>The people who have searched for it on the outside have never found
it. There is not a single exception; without any exception they have all
failed. Still, man is so stupid, he goes on doing the same thing again
and again.</p><p>And the people who have explored within have <em>always</em> found it
-- that too, without exception. A Jesus, a Buddha, a Zarathustra, a Lao
Tzu -- anybody who has ever gone in has always found it. Nobody has ever
failed there. But such is the stupidity of man that he never listens to
these people.</p><p>It is good that you are here and you are ready to move into sannyas.
It can become a tremendously significant decision in your life. If you
really make it a commitment, if you really get involved in this
pilgrimage you will be tremendously enriched, you will be able to find
the kingdom of god. And that is</p><p>the only thing worth finding -- everything else is futile.</p><p>It is contentment that brings bliss. We live in discontentment, we
axe never contented with anything.</p><p>The mind always goes on asking for more that is the nature of the
mind -- and those who follow mind will remain in misery. They can even
become great emperors -- they will be beggars. Even Alexander the Great
lived like a beggar and died like a beggar.</p><p>By beggar I mean a person who is always begging for more. By emperor
I mean a person who is immensely contented with whatsoever he has got.
It is a change of gestalt, a shift of our total consciousness.</p><p>Just look at all that god has already given to you... and it is
inestimable, it is so much that nobody is worthy of it. We have not
earned it, we don't deserve it -- god gives out of his abundance but we
never feel grateful.</p><p>In this ungratefulness misery lives and becomes stronger every day.
Discontentment is food for misery, and contentment is nourishment for
bliss.</p><p>Change your energy from discontentment to contentment and you will be
surprised by the transformation: immediately there is gratitude,
thankfulness. And whatsoever one has got one feels so happy with it that
small thing of life start bringing tremendous joy. Just a cup of tea can
be as bliss-giving as the whole of paradise; a cup of tea can contain
the whole of paradise. It all depends on you, on how you look at it.
Otherwise the whole of paradise will not be capable of satisfying you;
you will start finding faults there.</p><p>The way of sannyas is the way of contentment.</p><p>Meditation opens your inner consciousness like the sun opens the
flowers. The sun does not make any effort; it does not force the petals
of the flowers to open up -- just the presence is enough, the warmth is
enough. The presence of the sun functions like a catalytic agent.
Something inside the flower immediately starts opening up, as if the
flower suddenly feels a deep trust, there is no need to hides it can
open up, it can open all the doors and all the windows.</p><p>The same, exactly the same happens in meditation. Meditation simply
creates an inner warmth. The non-meditative person is ice-cold inside.
He has no heart, he</p><p>is just mind, and mind is ice-cold. The meditative person's energy
starts moving from the head to the heart; the heart starts becoming
warmer. You actually start feeling the warmth inside, and in that warmth
your being opens up like a flower. And that opening is the fulfilment.
In that opening one feels one has come home. In that opening one knows

perfume. He looks like a flower, he looks like a man, but he is not
really a man. A man becomes a man only when his heart starts throbbing
with love. With love man is no more an ordinary animal, he starts
becoming extraordinary; he starts moving upwards. Otherwise he is just
like other animals. He has a bigger mind, more efficient -- that's the
only difference. The difference is quantitative, and a quantitative
difference is not a difference at all.</p><p>The real difference is only when there is a difference of quality.
And love is the only thing that brings a new quality to you, otherwise
everything else is available to animals also.</p><p>Sex is available to them, but no love. They also have a certain kind
of intelligence. For example, some animals have a very good memory.
There are some species of snakes which have such a memory that for years
they will remember to take revenge; they will not forget. Elephants have
a very good memory. For years they will remember; even after a ten,
twelve-year gap, they will be able to recognise the friend and the
enemy, immediately.</p><p>Once I went to visit a fort of a maharaja -- he himself had not gone
to the fort for eight years. Just to show me he went with me, and at
least a dozen peacocks came and started dancing. I asked him 'What is
the matter?" And he said 'They recognise us. Whenever anybody of my
family comes they will receive us with dance. After eight years I have
come but they have not forgotten.'</p><p>Just to experiment, the next year when I went there I took his wife
with me, and</p><p>the same thing happened. I enquired of the servant, they said 'They
won't dance with anybody else -- only the royal family.</p><p>They recognise who the royal persons are. For only a few people... if
the maharaja, his wife, his son, if these three persons come they will
dance, otherwise they won't dance. No effort can persuade them to dance.
And they have been here for many centuries: their parents were dancing,
the parents of their parents were dancing. It is as if they have
inherited the memory and they continue the tradition.'</p><p>Now the maharaja is no more a maharaja, because maharajas and their
states have disappeared. Nobody recognises him any more, but those
peacocks do.</p><p>Animals have their own memory system, they have a certain
intelligence of their own. Only one thing is missing: they don't know
what love is, they can't know. Even out of one hundred men, ninety-nine
never know what love is. The rare individual comes to know love.</p><p>My vision of a real man requires two things: love and meditation. But
love is needed far more essentially, because if man can love he is bound
to find, sooner or later, the way to meditation, because love itself
gives you certain glimpses of meditation. It makes you silent. Then two
lovers meet, if they are really in love, they have nothing to say to
each other. They may hold hands and they will sit silently. The silence
is too significant to disturb by anything else.</p><p>Love gives a few glimpses of meditation, naturally. Love is a natural
kind of meditation, and because it is a natural kind it can become a
good jumping board for meditation.</p><p>So begin with love. Love as deeply as possible, as widely as
possible, because the wider the love, the more rich your inner being
becomes. Love as many people as possible, because each person is unique
and each experience unique. And love not only man, love animals, because
they have a different plane of existence. Your love of them will make
you aware of <em>their</em> plane of existence. Love trees too, birds
too, then you become multi-dimensional and your life becomes more and
more enriched.</p><p>That enrichment is what religions have called the birth of the soul.
I call it the perfume of love. And then one day out of that perfume you
will start moving into meditation naturally.</p><p>Meditation is a transcendence, a transcendence of all identities. We
are identified with the body. The first step of meditation destroys that
identity; we become aware that we are not the body. Then we become aware
that we are identified with the mind, with the thought process. That is
the second step of meditation: it destroys that identity and makes us
aware that we are not minds either. And the third and the most important
and the deepest step is that we are identified with the heart, with our
feelings, emotions.</p><p>Meditation destroys that too.</p><p>These are the three steps, the three great negations, and out of
these three negations comes the most positive phenomenon in existence:
suddenly you become aware of who you are. But you become perfectly aware
of who you are <em>not</em>.</p><p>To know the false as false is the beginning of knowing the true as
true. So real religion starts in negation and ends in absolute
affirmation. It starts with no, three no ss no to the body, no to the
mind, no to the heart.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

attain to the biggest yes that you have ever seen in your life, ever
experienced in your life -- a total yes, an absolute yes. That yes is
the transcendence of all misery, all bondage, all ignorance, all
darkness, all death. You become part of eternity, you become part of
god. You become god himself! That is the ultimate goal of sannyas. How
long will you be here?</p><p>-- Probably for four weeks.</p><p>Good. Four weeks are enough: three for three no's. The next time come

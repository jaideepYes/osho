It is for reference purposes only.]\nTruth is achieved not by thinking, truth is achieved by a state of no-thought, because only when you are in a state of no-thought is there clarity. Thoughts are like clouds around you: they make your consciousness dim, unclear. When all thoughts are put aside, your eyes are clean. Then there is nothing to distort your vision, then you can see that which is -- and that is truth.\nTruth is not a conclusion of mind but an experience of no-mind; hence philosophy cannot deliver truth; only religion -- because philosophy remains confined in the world of the mind. It goes on jumping from one cloud to another cloud. It remains in constant hesitation, unclarity, indecisiveness.\nPhilosophy is non-conclusive, it never comes to a conclusion; it cannot by its very nature. It is only religion that can help one to see. And seeing needs all thoughts to be put aside, good and bad, both. Seeing means you have to be as innocent as a child, knowing nothing. In that state of not-knowing, knowing happens, real knowing happens.\nThat's what meditation is all about: attaining to clarity.\nIt is only through bliss that one becomes a messenger of god. The moment you\nare blissful you become a vehicle, a passage for god to descends into the world. you become an opening for god to pour into the world.\nEvery blissful person becomes a blessing to the world because he becomes a proof that god exists. There is no other proof; only the presence of a blissful person is an indirect proof that something more than the mundane exists, that something more than the so-called life exists.\nIt is only through a man like Jesus or Buddha or Krishna that the world becomes aware that god cannot be denied. Philosophers have argued much to prove god but they have not been able to, they have not succeeded at all. Their whole effort has been an utter failure. But mystics have proved it without any effort; their presence was enough.\nEvery blissful person is a gabriele, a messenger of god. And that's my whole effort heres to create as many blissful people as possible, because the world needs now as many proofs for god's existence as we can manage, otherwise god is disappearing. The misery is becoming too heavy and the night is becoming too dark, and man is losing all contact with the transcendental My sannyasins have to become bridges between this and that, between the ordinary world and the extraordinary world -- which is hidden within the ordinary. And the only way, and I repeat, the only way, is to become a dance of joy, a song of joy, a celebration. -- How long will you be here?\n-- Forever.\n-- Be here forever' All Gabrieles are needed here' Good, Gabriele.\nMan can live in two ways either he becomes a stagnant pool of energy or he can become a dynamic flow, a river of energy. The stagnant pool never knows anything beyond itself because it never moves beyond its boundaries. The stagnant pool of energy becomes the ego.\nThe riverlike flow helps you always to go beyond yourself. It is a constant transcendence. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmovement towards the oceanic, towards the infinite, towards the unbounded. That is the way of a sannyasin.\nthe way of a meditator. Life should be like a river, always moving, never clinging, always ready to go into the unknown, always ready to risk the familiar for the unfamiliar.\nThe constant adventuring consciousness makes a man a sannyasin. It is the greatest adventure there is.\nAnd this is the right time and the right age (she is fifteen) to become aware of this alternative possibility, otherwise slowly slowly people become so accustomed to being stagnant that they forget completely. they become oblivious that they could have been rivers. That's why people live small lives, very ordinary, of no significance and meaning, of no joy, of no surprise. They simply go on moving in a repetitive circle. doing the same thing again and again every day from birth to death.\nThat is not the right way to live. That is a slow way of committing suicide. The right way to live is to live dangerously, always exploring and always reaching for the stars. Then life becomes naturally meditative because each moment brings so much surprise and each moment is so new, you cannot think anything, you have to encounter it.\nThe repetitive person can think about his life, can plan his life, because he is predictable. Everybody knows what he is going to do tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. But the meditative person is unpredictable; not only to others, to himself also. He does not know what is going to happen in the next moment; hence there is no question of planning thinking. He lives an open life, he welcomes every moment... fresh, young. And with that welcoming heart one becomes aware slowly slowly of something which has been called god, truth, nirvana, enlightenment -- different names for the same thing But the best name has been used by Lao Tzu; he calls it tao.\nHe says 'It has no name, hence I have chosen an arbitrary name: I will call it tao.' He is very clear about it. He says 'It is an arbitrary name, t has no name -- I will call it tao' Tao means nothing. You can call it XYZ.\nMy message is love, my religion is love. In a way it is very simple. it has no complexity about it -- no rituals, no dogmas, no hypothetical philosophy. It is a very simple and direct approach towards life. The small word 'love' can contain it.\nMy sannyasins have to be constantly in a love affair with existence. It is not a question of whom you love -- it is immaterial to whom your love is addressed. The thing that matters is that you should love twenty-four hours a day, just as you breathe. As breathing needs no object, love needs no object. Sometimes you are breathing with a friend and sometimes you are breathing by the side of a tree and sometimes you are breathing swimming in a pool. In the same way you should love. Love should be your interior core of breathing, it should be as natural as breathing. In fact love has the same relationship to the soul as breathing has to the body.\nThe body lives through breathing; once the breathing stops the body dies. The soul exists through loving, but many people don't have any soul because they never started loving. They only assume that they have souls -- they don't Potentially of course they do; if they start loving it will become a reality. Love transforms your potential soul into an actual phenomenon. It is the greatest miracle, the greatest magic, the greatest mystery of life. there is nothing higher than love.\nBut when I use the word 'love' I am using it in a very special sense. It has no ordinary connotations to it.\nIt is just a loving relationship tot he whole, a friendship with everything, even with things which ordinarily are thought to be dead.\nA Buddha treats even the chair as if it is alive. It is not a question of whether it is alive or not; the point is that the Buddha cannot be unloving, so whatsoever he does there is love. and that has to be the constant remembrance of my sannyasins. Remember it again and again because you will lose track of love.\nWe are not prepared for it, the society does not prepare us for it -- just the contrary: it prepares us for hatred, ambition, jealousy, possessiveness, domination, all kinds of ego trips and numbers. But it doesn't prepare you for love. Love goes against all these things. A loving person cannot be ambitious, a loving person cannot be egoistic, a loving person cannot be political, a loving\nperson cannot be dominating, a loving person cannot be possessive. These are poisons to love, they will kill the very spirit of love. A loving person can only be loving. He exists as love.\nAnd one need not be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan to be religious. All that one needs to be religious is to be loving, and through love slowly the soul is born. And you become aware when you become pregnant with soul. It is just as when a woman becomes pregnant: she soon becomes aware of the presence of the child. As the child starts growing in her womb she knows -- she even starts feeling the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmovements of the child. she starts becoming more and more alert and aware of another life within her.\nIn exactly the same way it happens when you become pregnant with soul: you suddenly start feeling a new quality inside your being, a new interiority, as if a door has opened and now you can see your innermost core, the very shrine where your centre of life exists. And it radiates with light. Slowly slowly it fills your whole being with life, love, light. Then one is reborn -- then one is really born.\nThat's the goal of sannyas rebirth, resurrection.\nThere is a vast difference between knowledge and knowing. Knowledge is always borrowed and acquired from others, knowing is yours. And that which is yours is true, and that which is not yours cannot be true.\nTruth cannot be transferred -- that is one of the intrinsic qualities of truth. My truth cannot become your truth. The moment I give it to you, in that very moment it becomes false. It is like uprooting a tree: the moment you uproot it, it is dead. It is alive only when it is rooted. And the tree of truth cannot be transplanted, you cannot put it in other soil.\nSo Buddha's truth dies with Buddha and Jesus' truth dies with Jesus. Christianity\nis a false phenomenon, so is Buddhism. Each person has to discover his own truth. Learn from Buddha the possibility of truth, learn from Buddha the hope, learn from Buddha the confidence that 'Yes, it is possible. If it is possible for one person, why not me?' But don't try to borrow because whatsoever you borrow is nothing but words; it won't have any meaning in your life. Meaning comes from experience.\nThat's the difference between knowledge and knowings knowing is beautiful, knowledge is ugly.\nKnowledge makes you a scholar, a pundit; knowing makes you a mystic Knowledge never makes you a knower, it makes you knowledgeable. Knowing makes you a knower but never makes you knowledgeable.\nAnd bliss comes only through knowing.\nHumanity now knows much more than it has ever known before; knowledge goes on accumulating. In fact you know more than Jesus. If you meet Jesus you can teach him many things. He will not know a thousand and one things. I don't think he will be able to pass the matriculation examination -- impossible!\nBut that does not mean that he is not a knower -- he knows, but in a totally different way. His experience has transformed his being. He is not as informed as you are but he is transformed, and that is the real thing.\nInformation means nothing. A computer can have more information than you have but the computer can never become a Christ or a Buddha. Or do you think a computer can become enlightened some day? That is impossible.\nA computer can know everything possible but it will remain a computer and it will repeat only that which is fed into it. It cannot be blissful either -- what bliss can a machine have? It cannot be loving either --\nhow can a machine be loving? It may say 'I love you, I love you very much, I am ready to die for you' -- it may say beautiful things, but they will be simply words. It can be taught to hug you and kiss you but there will be no love at all. And you will know that this is just foolish -- a machine kissing you and hugging you.\nYou will look all around, embarrassed!\nA machine can be taught these things and the machine can do these things very efficiently. But millions of people are doing exactly that: functioning like machines, computers. They repeat cliche's -- Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- beautiful words but all dead.\nWith me it is not a question of becoming more informed. I am not a teacher, I am not here to teach you anything. I am here to help you, on the contrary, to unlearn\n-- not to learn but to unlearn, so that you can be unburdened and you can start seeing on your own.\nThe moment you start seeing on your own, your life takes a quantum leap into a new dimension the dimension of eternity. the dimension of godliness, the dimension of bliss, truth, freedom.\nBliss and love are two aspects of sannyas, just like two aspects of a coin, be blissful within and be loving without.\nOne can be blissful and miserly -- then bliss starts dying. It has to be shared to keep it alive and flowing, to keep it fresh and young.\nThe old tradition of the so-called religious people has been very miserly; there was no place for love in it Of course they were all searching for bliss and they could find little bits of blissfulness here and there, but they were very greedy and miserly. And in their greed and miserliness whatsoever they found was killed, destroyed, poisoned, hence they remained sad. All the old saints look sad, they have long faces -- with no 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlaughter, with no love, with no sharing.\nThis is something very fundamental, that bliss grows as you share it, otherwise it dies. Even if by chance you discover a source of it, soon it will be exhausted. If you want it to become inexhaustible, then share, then share as much as possible. And never think whether the other person is worthy or not. Those are the considerations of a greedy person, a miserly person.\nA person who wants to share never thinks whether the other is worthy or not. Who cares? The whole point is to share. If he is ready to share, that's enough. Be thankful that he allows you to share your joy.\nThe sharing of bliss is love, and it is through love that bliss grows. The more you love, the more blissful you become; the more blissful you become the more you love. They feed each other, they help each other.\nAnd between the two you become an integrated being.\nBliss is a fragrance. You cannot achieve it directly. You have to grow rose bushes; when the roses arrive there will be fragrance automatically. Bliss is a fragrance of meditation. Meditation means becoming more and more silent.\nThe noisy person cannot be blissful -- one needs the music of silence. And our minds are too noisy. We are carrying almost a whole marketplace in our heads, all kinds of rubbish. And we are not one, we are a crowd inside, many people and they are constantly quarrelling, fighting with each other, trying to dominate.\nEach fragment of our mind wants to become the most powerful one. There is constant inner politics. You cannot find bliss in this constant inner war.\nBliss is possible only if this continuous war ceases. And it can cease; it is not very difficult to get beyond it. All that is needed is awareness. We are not aware of this whole phenomenon that goes on. It goes on inside like an undercurrent. We are almost oblivious of it. It is always there, day in, day out, but we are not conscious of it.\nBring consciousness to it. Slowly, watch the subtle layers of noisiness, and slowly slowly you will become aware of so much chattering that it appears almost as if a madhouse is inside the head. And we are living in this nightmare!\nThrough watching a miracle happens whatsoever you can watch starts evaporating. And the moment it evaporates you are left with a deep silence. In the beginning there are only intervals, small gaps when thoughts cease, when you can look through small windows into reality. But slowly those gaps become bigger they start coming more often, then they start staying longer.\nIt has been calculated by the ancient mystics, and I totally agree with them, that if a person can remain totally silent for forty-eight minutes he attains to\nenlightenment, he becomes absolutely blissful. And then it lasts forever, then there is no going back. You have gone into the beyond, you have reached beyond time and its constant shifting sands. You have reached the rock of eternity. That's where one comes to realise one's immortality.\nThat is the ultimate target of sannyas.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2938","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2938 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

repetitive circle. doing the same thing again and again every day from
birth to death.</p><p>That is not the right way to live. That is a slow way of committing
suicide. The right way to live is to live dangerously, always exploring
and always reaching for the stars. Then life becomes naturally
meditative because each moment brings so much surprise and each moment
is so new, you cannot think anything, you have to encounter it.</p><p>The repetitive person can think about his life, can plan his life,
because he is predictable. Everybody knows what he is going to do
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. But the meditative person is
unpredictable; not only to others, to himself also. He does not know
what is going to happen in the next moment; hence there is no question
of planning thinking. He lives an open life, he welcomes every moment...
fresh, young. And with that welcoming heart one becomes aware slowly
slowly of something which has been called god, truth, nirvana,
enlightenment -- different names for the same thing But the best name
has been used by Lao Tzu; he calls it tao.</p><p>He says 'It has no name, hence I have chosen an arbitrary name: I
will call it tao.' He is very clear about it. He says 'It is an
arbitrary name, t has no name -- I will call it tao' Tao means nothing.
You can call it XYZ.</p><p>My message is love, my religion is love. In a way it is very simple.
it has no complexity about it -- no rituals, no dogmas, no hypothetical
philosophy. It is a very simple and direct approach towards life. The
small word 'love' can contain it.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be constantly in a love affair with existence.
It is not a question of whom you love -- it is immaterial to whom your
love is addressed. The thing that matters is that you should love
twenty-four hours a day, just as you breathe. As breathing needs no
object, love needs no object. Sometimes you are breathing with a friend
and sometimes you are breathing by the side of a tree and sometimes you
are breathing swimming in a pool. In the same way you should love. Love
should be your interior core of breathing, it should be as natural as
breathing. In fact love has the same relationship to the soul as
breathing has to the body.</p><p>The body lives through breathing; once the breathing stops the body
dies. The soul exists through loving, but many people don't have any
soul because they never started loving. They only assume that they have
souls -- they don't Potentially of course they do; if they start loving
it will become a reality. Love transforms your potential soul into an
actual phenomenon. It is the greatest miracle, the greatest magic, the
greatest mystery of life. there is nothing higher than love.</p><p>But when I use the word 'love' I am using it in a very special sense.
It has no ordinary connotations to it.</p><p>It is just a loving relationship tot he whole, a friendship with
everything, even with things which ordinarily are thought to be
dead.</p><p>A Buddha treats even the chair as if it is alive. It is not a
question of whether it is alive or not; the point is that the Buddha
cannot be unloving, so whatsoever he does there is love. and that has to
be the constant remembrance of my sannyasins. Remember it again and
again because you will lose track of love.</p><p>We are not prepared for it, the society does not prepare us for it --
just the contrary: it prepares us for hatred, ambition, jealousy,
possessiveness, domination, all kinds of ego trips and numbers. But it
doesn't prepare you for love. Love goes against all these things. A
loving person cannot be ambitious, a loving person cannot be egoistic, a
loving person cannot be political, a loving</p><p>person cannot be dominating, a loving person cannot be possessive.
These are poisons to love, they will kill the very spirit of love. A
loving person can only be loving. He exists as love.</p><p>And one need not be a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan to be
religious. All that one needs to be religious is to be loving, and
through love slowly the soul is born. And you become aware when you
become pregnant with soul. It is just as when a woman becomes pregnant:
she soon becomes aware of the presence of the child. As the child starts
growing in her womb she knows -- she even starts feeling the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

aware of another life within her.</p><p>In exactly the same way it happens when you become pregnant with
soul: you suddenly start feeling a new quality inside your being, a new
interiority, as if a door has opened and now you can see your innermost
core, the very shrine where your centre of life exists. And it radiates
with light. Slowly slowly it fills your whole being with life, love,
light. Then one is reborn -- then one is really born.</p><p>That's the goal of sannyas rebirth, resurrection.</p><p>There is a vast difference between knowledge and knowing. Knowledge
is always borrowed and acquired from others, knowing is yours. And that
which is yours is true, and that which is not yours cannot be true.</p><p>Truth cannot be transferred -- that is one of the intrinsic qualities
of truth. <em>My</em> truth cannot become your truth. The moment I give
it to you, in that very moment it becomes false. It is like uprooting a
tree: the moment you uproot it, it is dead. It is alive only when it is
rooted. And the tree of truth cannot be transplanted, you cannot put it
in other soil.</p><p>So Buddha's truth dies with Buddha and Jesus' truth dies with Jesus.
Christianity</p><p>is a false phenomenon, so is Buddhism. Each person has to discover
his own truth. Learn from Buddha the possibility of truth, learn from
Buddha the hope, learn from Buddha the confidence that 'Yes, it is
possible. If it is possible for one person, why not me?' But don't try
to borrow because whatsoever you borrow is nothing but words; it won't
have any meaning in your life. Meaning comes from experience.</p><p>That's the difference between knowledge and knowings knowing is
beautiful, knowledge is ugly.</p><p>Knowledge makes you a scholar, a pundit; knowing makes you a mystic
Knowledge never makes you a knower, it makes you knowledgeable. Knowing
makes you a knower but never makes you knowledgeable.</p><p>And bliss comes only through knowing.</p><p>Humanity now knows much more than it has ever known before; knowledge
goes on accumulating. In fact you know more than Jesus. If you meet
Jesus you can teach him many things. He will not know a thousand and one
things. I don't think he will be able to pass the matriculation
examination -- impossible!</p><p>But that does not mean that he is not a knower -- he knows, but in a
totally different way. His experience has transformed his being. He is
not as informed as you are but he is transformed, and that is the real
thing.</p><p>Information means nothing. A computer can have more information than
you have but the computer can never become a Christ or a Buddha. Or do
you think a computer can become enlightened some day? That is
impossible.</p><p>A computer can know everything possible but it will remain a computer
and it will repeat only that which is fed into it. It cannot be blissful
either -- what bliss can a machine have? It cannot be loving either
--</p><p>how can a machine be loving? It may say 'I love you, I love you very
much, I am ready to die for you' -- it may say beautiful things, but
they will be simply words. It can be taught to hug you and kiss you but
there will be no love at all. And you will know that this is just
foolish -- a machine kissing you and hugging you.</p><p>You will look all around, embarrassed!</p><p>A machine can be taught these things and the machine can do these
things very efficiently. But millions of people are doing exactly that:
functioning like machines, computers. They repeat cliche's -- Christian,
Hindu, Mohammedan -- beautiful words but all dead.</p><p>With me it is not a question of becoming more informed. I am not a
teacher, I am not here to teach you anything. I am here to help you, on
the contrary, to unlearn</p><p>-- not to learn but to unlearn, so that you can be unburdened and you
can start seeing on your own.</p><p>The moment you start seeing on your own, your life takes a quantum
leap into a new dimension the dimension of eternity. the dimension of
godliness, the dimension of bliss, truth, freedom.</p><p>Bliss and love are two aspects of sannyas, just like two aspects of a
coin, be blissful within and be loving without.</p><p>One can be blissful and miserly -- then bliss starts dying. It has to
be shared to keep it alive and flowing, to keep it fresh and young.</p><p>The old tradition of the so-called religious people has been very
miserly; there was no place for love in it Of course they were all
searching for bliss and they could find little bits of blissfulness here
and there, but they were very greedy and miserly. And in their greed and
miserliness whatsoever they found was killed, destroyed, poisoned, hence
they remained sad. All the old saints look sad, they have long faces --

otherwise it dies. Even if by chance you discover a source of it, soon
it will be exhausted. If you want it to become inexhaustible, then
share, then share as much as possible. And never think whether the other
person is worthy or not. Those are the considerations of a greedy
person, a miserly person.</p><p>A person who wants to share never thinks whether the other is worthy
or not. Who cares? The whole point is to share. If he is ready to share,
that's enough. Be thankful that he allows you to share your joy.</p><p>The sharing of bliss is love, and it is through love that bliss
grows. The more you love, the more blissful you become; the more
blissful you become the more you love. They feed each other, they help
each other.</p><p>And between the two you become an integrated being.</p><p>Bliss is a fragrance. You cannot achieve it directly. You have to
grow rose bushes; when the roses arrive there will be fragrance
automatically. Bliss is a fragrance of meditation. Meditation means
becoming more and more silent.</p><p>The noisy person cannot be blissful -- one needs the music of
silence. And our minds are too noisy. We are carrying almost a whole
marketplace in our heads, all kinds of rubbish. And we are not one, we
are a crowd inside, many people and they are constantly quarrelling,
fighting with each other, trying to dominate.</p><p>Each fragment of our mind wants to become the most powerful one.
There is constant inner politics. You cannot find bliss in this constant
inner war.</p><p>Bliss is possible only if this continuous war ceases. And it
<em>can</em> cease; it is not very difficult to get beyond it. All that
is needed is awareness. We are not aware of this whole phenomenon that
goes on. It goes on inside like an undercurrent. We are almost oblivious
of it. It is always there, day in, day out, but we are not conscious of
it.</p><p>Bring consciousness to it. Slowly, watch the subtle layers of
noisiness, and slowly slowly you will become aware of so much chattering
that it appears almost as if a madhouse is inside the head. And we are
living in this nightmare!</p><p>Through watching a miracle happens whatsoever you can watch starts
evaporating. And the moment it evaporates you are left with a deep
silence. In the beginning there are only intervals, small gaps when
thoughts cease, when you can look through small windows into reality.
But slowly those gaps become bigger they start coming more often, then
they start staying longer.</p><p>It has been calculated by the ancient mystics, and I totally agree
with them, that if a person can remain totally silent for forty-eight
minutes he attains to</p><p>enlightenment, he becomes absolutely blissful. And then it lasts
forever, then there is no going back. You have gone into the beyond, you
have reached beyond time and its constant shifting sands. You have
reached the rock of eternity. That's where one comes to realise one's
immortality.</p><p>That is the ultimate target of sannyas.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #21</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

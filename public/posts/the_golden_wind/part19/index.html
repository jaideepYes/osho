It is for reference purposes only.]\nMisery is something like going downhill: it is so easy, no intelligence is needed, no work upon yourself is needed. You can simply go on rolling down, under the influence of the magnetic field of the earth, by gravitation. But if you want to go uphill then intelligence will be needed, work upon yourself will be needed\n-- and not a hectic kind of work but something constant. One never knows at what point the breakthrough happens; one has just to go on hammering.\nSometimes it happens that you stop just before it was going to happen; just one more step and the goal would have been achieved. So one has to go on -- it is unpredictable. Because it happens differently to each person, there is no way to predict it. A few people need a little effort, a few people a little less; it depends\non many past lives. If you have worked upon your inner being in your past lives, that work is never lost, it remains with you. Whenever you start working again for your spiritual growth, it becomes a stepping stone.\nBut there are people who have not worked at all. They may be just beginning in this life, this time. A few may have worked hard enough and just a little crust is left to be broken; and a few may be carrying big hard walls of ego -- they will need constant hammering. But one thing is certain and predictable, that if one goes on working it happens, it is bound to happen, it is inevitable. One has to be patient and industrious, only then can one rise above misery.\nMillions of people are miserable it needs no effort, and very few have attained to bliss because very few have put their energies together and worked hard, patiently, without bothering about the result, without hankering at all for the result to be quick.\nBliss is not like a seasonal flower; it can't be quick in that way. It is a big huge thing; it takes its time; its course.\nThe miserable person is miserable because he has not sharpened his intelligence. He allows dust to gather upon his intelligence, and intelligence is like a mirror, if you allow dust to gather upon it, it loses its essential quality of being reflective. It functions like a mirror no more. And when dust is too thick you completely lose track of the mirror, you even forget all about it. And that's how people have been livings they allow the dust to gather. That's what we call past, memories. And when I say memories I mean psychological memories, not factual memories. Factual memories are perfectly good; they are simple information accumulated by the brain.\nPsychological memories... Somebody insulted you twenty years ago and it is still there, it still hurts. It still affects you. If you see that person you can't see him as he is; that hurt stands between you and him. It affects your visions you look through that feeling. It may have become absolutely unconscious. You may say 'Hello' to him and 'How are you?' and you will even smile. but if you watch and observe your smile you will see there is some feeling which is holding your smile back, which is poisoning it. You say 'Hello', but reluctantly it is simply formal, it has no heart in it. You enquire how he is because it is part of etiquette, mannerism, but you don't mean it, you are not interested at all. In fact, deep down you are still wanting to take revenge. And if some opportunity arises you\nwill take revenges you have not forgotten, you have not forgiven.\nThese psychological memories accumulate on the intelligence like dust and they don't allow you to see reality as it is Otherwise it is blissful, tremendously blissful. Each moment can be an ecstasy. you just need a bright mirror to reflect it in its totality, in its intensity. Then each moment brings so much grace of god, it is immeasurable; we cannot be thankful enough for it. But very few people become aware of the beauty of existence, of the beauty of people, of the grace of the animals, of the green and the gold of the trees, of the redness and liveliness of the flowers. Very few people are aware of the music of the rain falling on the roof, the song, the dance of it...\nAnd because they are not aware of it all they remain imprisoned in the very small dark hole of their psychological memories, which is just like a tunnel, very dark, and it accumulates all kinds of negativities.\nA person may have done a thousand and one good things for you and you will not remember, but if he hurts you once that you will remember. He may have been a friend for years, may have done many things for you -- they will all be effaced, erased completely by a single thing that you think is wrong. It may not be 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwrong at all. He may not have done it knowingly, he may not have wanted to do any harm to you. It may have happened by chance, or it may be just a wrong interpretation on your part. But just a single wound is enough to destroy all that the person has done... as if we are hankering to collect all that is negative, dark, ugly.\nWe don't collect flowers, we collect thorns -- this is the stupidity of human beings and hence the hell.\nHell is not somewhere else; we create it. And heaven also is not somewhere else; we can create. We have as much capacity to create heaven around our being as we can create hell. It is the same energy which accumulates flowers, which\naccumulates thorns. It is the same being; just a little different perspective, just a little change of understanding, of looking at things, and the whole world changes.\nSannyas is nothing but that little change. It is a very small thing but it makes a lot of difference. It transforms the whole vision. It creates a totally new existence for you and then life is a joy.\nA sannyasin has to live life joyously. He has to transform small things into great rejoicings. He has to transform the mundane into the sacred.\nI am not against the mundane. I am all for transforming it because it contains the sacred. The old religions were creating a division between the mundane and the sacred. I don't create any division. The change is not needed on the outside; you are not to leave the marketplace and go to a monastery. The change is needed in your way of seeing. Then the mundane becomes sacred, the marketplace becomes more beautiful that any monastery can be. And that is real work.\nI am not an escapist and I am against all religious attitudes which are escapist. I believe in life and I believe in living life totally, but it can be lived in such a beautiful way that slowly slowly matter disappears and there is only godliness surrounding you. And that is truth, that's how it is.\nMeditation is the only experience that gives you solid proof of god's existence. Logic is of no help.\nPhilosophy cannot produce a single proof although for centuries philosophers have tried -- but all in vain.\nThey have made very articulate, complicated theories, theologies, philosophies, trying to prove god -- but they have all failed. All their proofs are, without any exception, childish and rooted in some flaw, in some fallacy. They can befool only people who want to be befooled, otherwise anybody of ordinary intelligence can see that all their arguments are fallacious.\nFor example, all the philosophers of the world have tried to prove that god is a must because existence needs a creator. Now this is good if you are talking to small children, otherwise it is stupid. If creation needs a creator, then the creator itself will need a creator in its own turn. And then you fall into an infinite regress: A creates B. B creates C, C creates D -- where is it going to end?\nHence a man like Gautam Buddha simply said 'Forget all about this nonsense. The whole metaphysics is nonsense,' he said. And he has a great insight about that thing; he says 'Don't argue about god, don't ask about god, because there is no way to prove or disprove.' He simply puts aside all arguments, for and against. He says 'Rather put your energies into meditation and then see whatsoever is. There is no need to believe -- when we can experience, why believe?'\nAnd that's precisely my approach too I don't want you to believe in god, I want you to know that which is -- and that is godly.\nYou may not come to know god as a person because there is nobody as a person, but in meditation you will certainly come to know existence as divine, as godly. The quality will be felt; you will see the whole existence radiant with godliness. In that radiance you are included. It is not that only others radiate god, you also radiate gods everything becomes part of a divine organic unity. But it is not to be believed in.\nOne need not be a theist or an atheists both are foolish. A really religious person is neither. He is an enquirer, he says 'I don't know but I am ready to enquire.' And the only way to enquire is meditation, because meditation takes you beyond thoughts. If you remain in thoughts you remain within the boundary of philosophy; when you move beyond thoughts, you go beyond philosophy -- and that's where religion begins. Where philosophy ends, religion begins; where mind ends meditation begins. And meditation is the only religious phenomenon. Remember it: the only, hence it is the only door towards godliness, the only bridge.\nIt is only through meditation that you become a servant of god. The moment you know the godliness of existence you naturally become a servant. It is not something imposed upon you by somebody else, it is out of your love for existence.\nMeditation is golden. Gold represents the highest peak of consciousness in man; it is an alchemical 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsymbol. Alchemists were known all over the world as people who were interested in changing the baser metals into gold. Really they were interested in changing the baser energies of man into golden energies.\nMan comes with many energies but in a raw form; like diamonds just taken out of the mine. Only a jeweller can recognize them; to others they will look like ordinary stones. But once they have been purified, cut, once the unnecessary parts have been dropped and their hidden glory becomes expressed, then you know that it was not an ordinary stone; it was carrying a hidden treasure within it.\nSo is the case with every human being. Becoming a sannyasin means entering into an alchemical school.\nThe whole effort here is to make gold out of you. We are born with it -- just a little cleansing is needed and it starts shining forth. And when one realizes one's glory then gratitude arises, and gratitude is prayer.\nMeditation transforms you, and the ultimate result is gratitude, prayer. That is the fragrance of the flower of meditation.\nHow long will you be here? I don't know.\nBe here. There is no need to know -- be here. Real Italians never go back!\nLove is the surest way to real victory but it is a very strange way, very paradoxical, because love begins in surrender and ends in victory. That's its paradox: love does not want to be victorious but it becomes victorious. Love wants to surrender, but surrender brings victory.\nAnd the people who try to be victorious remain failures. They may become victorious in the eyes of the world but that is not true victory because death will take it away. True victory is that which even death cannot destroy.\nThink of yourself as victorious only when you have gained something of immortality. Love gives you the first glimpse of immortality, love opens the first\nwindow beyond death. One who knows love is bound to know god sooner or later, one just has to go on deepening one's love.\nBe in love with love itself, then victory is going to be yours!\nSannyas is a dance of bliss. It is not renunciation, it is rejoicing. It is not life- negative, it is a tremendous love affair with life itself. It is not the old idea of sannyas, monkhood. I am totally against the old idea. It has poisoned the whole humanity, it has made people's lives more miserable.\nRather than helping people to be blissful, it has been a curse rather than a blessing, for the simple reason that it created negativity in peoples' minds: life is wrong -- if you want to achieve god you have to renounce it; joys of life are not good, they are temptations from the devil -- you have to escape from all temptations of life. You have to go on shrinking, shrinking, you have to move away from all relationships, you have to live in a cave in the mountains or in a monastery.\nIt created so much fear in people that people became pathological. Those who escape, lived in utter misery. Their only solace was that people thought that they were saints and people respected them and honoured them. That was very ego- fulfilling, that was their only solace, otherwise there was nothing in it.\nTheir life was like a desert, with no greenery, with no oasis at all. But it was a tremendously powerful ego trip. And people can do anything for the fulfilment of the ego; any absurd thing, any stupid thing, if it is ego-fulfilling they are ready to do it.\nAnd if you look into the history of monks and nuns you will be surprised: in the name of religion they have been doing such stupid things all over the world, in the world, that coming generations are simply going to laugh at the whole idea of religion. It was so unintelligent, so stupid and mediocre, in fact insane.\nAnd the people who did not go that far also suffered because they could not enjoy life with totality. They could not escape -- they were not that extreme either -- but they could not live life with totality, with joy; their joy was poisoned. They lived in the world feeling guilty.\nThe people who escaped suffered because they became uprooted. They starved, they were undernourished because life is a nourishment, relationship is a\nnourishment. To be with people and to be in many loving relationships, friendships, is an absolute necessity to make your life rich. They became beggars, and the people who lived in life became very guilty; they started thinking they are sinners. The saints were those who had escaped. so of course, logically, the people who were not capable enough.\ncourageous enough. thought 'We are not brave enough. We are guilty people, sinners, and we are going to suffer in hell.'\nThis is how the whole world has been dominated by the wrong kind of religion. It is good that the modern is getting freer every day of all that rubbish. But sometimes it happens that when you throw the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nrubbish you can also throw the diamonds. You can throw out the baby with the bathwater -- that is the danger.\nThe old fools were doing one thing -- they were throwing out the baby and saving the bathwater. Now the new fools can do this -- they can throw both, but both ways the baby is gone.\nMy effort here is to save the baby and throw the bathwater. And if the bathwater can also be used somewhere in the garden, it should be used. There is no need to throw is it should be put to some use.\nLife is not to be renounced but experienced, lived, loved, because it is only at the innermost core of life that you will feel the presence of god. Hence my sannyasins have to be lovers of life, and they have to be dancers, singers, musicians, poets, creators, because the fundamental of my religion is, if you want to come closer to the creative energy of existence you have to be creators yourself. That's the only way to come close to the creative energy, or call it the creator.\nBy your becoming creative, you start participating in god's creation.\nCelebrate -- don't miss a single opportunity to celebrate. Go on searching for opportunities to celebrate.\nIf you cannot find them, invent them, because the whole point is celebration, not whether there is a real opportunity or a fictitious opportunity -- that doesn't matter. What matters is celebration because it is through celebration that you will flower, that you will come to your higher peaks of consciousness, sensitivity, creativity.\nIt is the celebrating person who really lives others only die a slow kind of death. It takes seventy years for a few people to die, for a few it takes even longer, eighty, ninety -- they are slow diers. They don't know how to finish a job quickly; they go on and on, they go on dragging. There are many people who go on dragging posthumously; they should have died decades ago but somehow they manage. There are ghosts' --\nthere are the people who are ghosts, who live a posthumous kind of existence.\nIn fact it is near-about the age of four that people die -- then it is all posthumous existence, then they simply go on dragging. Just look at a child of three and you will see what liveliness should be, how joyous he is and how sensitive to everything that goes on happening around him, how alert, watchful; nothing misses his eye. And how intense in everything: if he is angry, he is just anger, pure anger. It is beautiful to see a child in anger, because old people are always half-hearted, even if they are angry they are not totally in it, they are holding back. They don't love totally, they are not angry totally, they don't do anything in totality, they are always calculating. Their life has become lukewarm. It never comes to that intensity of one hundred degrees where things evaporate, where something happens, where revolution becomes possible.\nBut a child always lives at one hundred degrees -- whatsoever he does. If he hates you he hates you totally, and he loves you he loves you totally; and in a single moment he can change. He is so quick, he does not take time, he does not brood over it. Just one moment before, he was sitting in your lap and telling you how much he loves you. And then something happens -- you say something and something goes wrong between you and him -- and he jumps out of your lap and says 'I never want to see you again.' And see in his eyes the totality of it'\nAnd because it is total it does not leave a trace behind. That's the beauty of\ntotality: it does not accumulate psychological memory. Psychological memory is created only by partial living. Then everything that you have lived only in part hangs around you, the hang-over continues for your whole life. And thousands of things are there, hanging unfinished.\nThat's the whole theory of karma, unfinished jobs, unfinished actions go on waiting to be finished, to be completed, and they go on goading you 'Complete me' because every action wants to be fulfilled.\nBut if you live totally, intensely, then you are free of it, you have lived the moment and it is finished.\nYou don't look back and you don't look ahead. you simply remain herenow, there is no past. no future.\nThat's what I mean by celebration. In a real moment of celebration only the present exists. And to be in the present is to be a sannyasin. and to be in the present is to be blissful.\nThe Golden Wind 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3516","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3516 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

knows at what point the breakthrough happens; one has just to go on
hammering.</p><p>Sometimes it happens that you stop just before it was going to
happen; just one more step and the goal would have been achieved. So one
has to go on -- it is unpredictable. Because it happens differently to
each person, there is no way to predict it. A few people need a little
effort, a few people a little less; it depends</p><p>on many past lives. If you have worked upon your inner being in your
past lives, that work is never lost, it remains with you. Whenever you
start working again for your spiritual growth, it becomes a stepping
stone.</p><p>But there are people who have not worked at all. They may be just
beginning in this life, this time. A few may have worked hard enough and
just a little crust is left to be broken; and a few may be carrying big
hard walls of ego -- they will need constant hammering. But one thing is
certain and predictable, that if one goes on working it happens, it is
bound to happen, it is inevitable. One has to be patient and
industrious, only then can one rise above misery.</p><p>Millions of people are miserable it needs no effort, and very few
have attained to bliss because very few have put their energies together
and worked hard, patiently, without bothering about the result, without
hankering at all for the result to be quick.</p><p>Bliss is not like a seasonal flower; it can't be quick in that way.
It is a big huge thing; it takes its time; its course.</p><p>The miserable person is miserable because he has not sharpened his
intelligence. He allows dust to gather upon his intelligence, and
intelligence is like a mirror, if you allow dust to gather upon it, it
loses its essential quality of being reflective. It functions like a
mirror no more. And when dust is too thick you completely lose track of
the mirror, you even forget all about it. And that's how people have
been livings they allow the dust to gather. That's what we call past,
memories. And when I say memories I mean psychological memories, not
factual memories. Factual memories are perfectly good; they are simple
information accumulated by the brain.</p><p>Psychological memories... Somebody insulted you twenty years ago and
it is still there, it still hurts. It still affects you. If you see that
person you can't see him as he is; that hurt stands between you and him.
It affects your visions you look through that feeling. It may have
become absolutely unconscious. You may say 'Hello' to him and 'How are
you?' and you will even smile. but if you watch and observe your smile
you will see there is some feeling which is holding your smile back,
which is poisoning it. You say 'Hello', but reluctantly it is simply
formal, it has no heart in it. You enquire how he is because it is part
of etiquette, mannerism, but you don't mean it, you are not interested
at all. In fact, deep down you are still wanting to take revenge. And if
some opportunity arises you</p><p>will <span class=p>take revenges you have not forgotten, you have
not forgiven.</span></p><p>These psychological memories accumulate on the intelligence like dust
and they don't allow you to see reality as it is Otherwise it is
blissful, tremendously blissful. Each moment can be an ecstasy. you just
need a bright mirror to reflect it in its totality, in its intensity.
Then each moment brings so much grace of god, it is immeasurable; we
cannot be thankful enough for it. But very few people become aware of
the beauty of existence, of the beauty of people, of the grace of the
animals, of the green and the gold of the trees, of the redness and
liveliness of the flowers. Very few people are aware of the music of the
rain falling on the roof, the song, the dance of it...</p><p>And because they are not aware of it all they remain imprisoned in
the very small dark hole of their psychological memories, which is just
like a tunnel, very dark, and it accumulates all kinds of
negativities.</p><p>A person may have done a thousand and one good things for you and you
will not remember, but if he hurts you once <em>that</em> you will
remember. He may have been a friend for years, may have done many things
for you -- they will all be effaced, erased completely by a single thing

wanted to do any harm to you. It may have happened by chance, or it may
be just a wrong interpretation on your part. But just a single wound is
enough to destroy all that the person has done... as if we are hankering
to collect all that is negative, dark, ugly.</p><p>We don't collect flowers, we collect thorns -- this is the stupidity
of human beings and hence the hell.</p><p>Hell is not somewhere else; we create it. And heaven also is not
somewhere else; we can create. We have as much capacity to create heaven
around our being as we can create hell. It is the same energy which
accumulates flowers, which</p><p>accumulates thorns. It is the same being; just a little different
perspective, just a little change of understanding, of looking at
things, and the whole world changes.</p><p>Sannyas is nothing but that little change. It is a very small thing
but it makes a lot of difference. It transforms the whole vision. It
creates a totally new existence for you and then life is a joy.</p><p>A sannyasin has to live life joyously. He has to transform small
things into great rejoicings. He has to transform the mundane into the
sacred.</p><p>I am not against the mundane. I am all for transforming it because it
contains the sacred. The old religions were creating a division between
the mundane and the sacred. I don't create any division. The change is
not needed on the outside; you are not to leave the marketplace and go
to a monastery. The change is needed in your way of seeing. Then the
mundane becomes sacred, the marketplace becomes more beautiful that any
monastery can be. And that is <em>real</em> work.</p><p>I am not an escapist and I am against all religious attitudes which
are escapist. I believe in life and I believe in living life totally,
but it can be lived in such a beautiful way that slowly slowly matter
disappears and there is only godliness surrounding you. And that is
truth, that's how it is.</p><p>Meditation is the only experience that gives you solid proof of god's
existence. Logic is of no help.</p><p>Philosophy cannot produce a single proof although for centuries
philosophers have tried -- but all in vain.</p><p>They have made very articulate, complicated theories, theologies,
philosophies, trying to prove god -- but they have all failed. All their
proofs are, without any exception, childish and rooted in some flaw, in
some fallacy. They can befool only people who want to be befooled,
otherwise anybody of ordinary intelligence can see that all their
arguments are fallacious.</p><p>For example, all the philosophers of the world have tried to prove
that god is a must because existence needs a creator. Now this is good
if you are talking to small children, otherwise it is stupid. If
creation needs a creator, then the creator itself will need a creator in
its own turn. And then you fall into an infinite regress: A creates B. B
creates C, C creates D -- where is it going to end?</p><p>Hence a man like Gautam Buddha simply said 'Forget all about this
nonsense. The whole metaphysics is nonsense,' he said. And he has a
great insight about that thing; he says 'Don't argue about god, don't
ask about god, because there is no way to prove <em>or</em> disprove.'
He simply puts aside all arguments, for and against. He says 'Rather put
your energies into meditation and then see whatsoever is. There is no
need to believe -- when we can experience, why believe?'</p><p>And that's precisely my approach too I don't want you to believe in
god, I want you to know that which is -- and that is godly.</p><p>You may not come to know god as a person because there is nobody as a
person, but in meditation you will certainly come to know existence as
divine, as godly. The <em>quality</em> will be felt; you will see the
whole existence radiant with godliness. In that radiance you are
included. It is not that only others radiate god, you also radiate gods
everything becomes part of a divine organic unity. But it is not to be
believed in.</p><p>One need not be a theist or an atheists both are foolish. A really
religious person is neither. He is an enquirer, he says 'I don't know
but I am ready to enquire.' And the only way to enquire is meditation,
because meditation takes you beyond thoughts. If you remain in thoughts
you remain within the boundary of philosophy; when you move beyond
thoughts, you go beyond philosophy -- and that's where religion begins.
Where philosophy ends, religion begins; where mind ends meditation
begins. And meditation is the only religious phenomenon. Remember it:
the only, hence it is the only door towards godliness, the only
bridge.</p><p>It is only through meditation that you become a servant of god. The
moment you know the godliness of existence you naturally become a
servant. It is not something imposed upon you by somebody else, it is
out of your love for existence.</p><p>Meditation is golden. Gold represents the highest peak of
consciousness in man; it is an alchemical 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

interested in changing the baser metals into gold. Really they were
interested in changing the baser energies of man into golden
energies.</p><p>Man comes with many energies but in a raw form; like diamonds just
taken out of the mine. Only a jeweller can recognize them; to others
they will look like ordinary stones. But once they have been purified,
cut, once the unnecessary parts have been dropped and their hidden glory
becomes expressed, then you know that it was not an ordinary stone; it
was carrying a hidden treasure within it.</p><p>So is the case with every human being. Becoming a sannyasin means
entering into an alchemical school.</p><p>The whole effort here is to make gold out of you. We are born with it
-- just a little cleansing is needed and it starts shining forth. And
when one realizes one's glory then gratitude arises, and gratitude is
prayer.</p><p>Meditation transforms you, and the ultimate result is gratitude,
prayer. That is the fragrance of the flower of meditation.</p><p>How long will you be here? I don't know.</p><p>Be here. There is no need to know -- be here. Real Italians never go
back!</p><p>Love is the surest way to real victory but it is a very strange way,
very paradoxical, because love begins in surrender and ends in victory.
That's its paradox: love does not want to be victorious but it becomes
victorious. Love wants to surrender, but surrender brings victory.</p><p>And the people who try to be victorious remain failures. They may
become victorious in the eyes of the world but that is not true victory
because death will take it away. True victory is that which even death
cannot destroy.</p><p>Think of yourself as victorious only when you have gained something
of immortality. Love gives you the first glimpse of immortality, love
opens the first</p><p>window beyond death. One who knows love is bound to know god sooner
or later, one just has to go on deepening one's love.</p><p>Be in love with love itself, then victory is going to be yours!</p><p>Sannyas is a dance of bliss. It is not renunciation, it is rejoicing.
It is not life- negative, it is a tremendous love affair with life
itself. It is not the old idea of sannyas, monkhood. I am totally
against the old idea. It has poisoned the whole humanity, it has made
people's lives more miserable.</p><p>Rather than helping people to be blissful, it has been a curse rather
than a blessing, for the simple reason that it created negativity in
peoples' minds: life is wrong -- if you want to achieve god you have to
renounce it; joys of life are not good, they are temptations from the
devil -- you have to escape from all temptations of life. You have to go
on shrinking, shrinking, you have to move away from all relationships,
you have to live in a cave in the mountains or in a monastery.</p><p>It created so much fear in people that people became pathological.
Those who escape, lived in utter misery. Their only solace was that
people thought that they were saints and people respected them and
honoured them. That was very ego- fulfilling, that was their only
solace, otherwise there was nothing in it.</p><p>Their life was like a desert, with no greenery, with no oasis at all.
But it was a tremendously powerful ego trip. And people can do anything
for the fulfilment of the ego; <em>any</em> absurd thing, any stupid
thing, if it is ego-fulfilling they are ready to do it.</p><p>And if you look into the history of monks and nuns you will be
surprised: in the name of religion they have been doing such stupid
things all over the world, in the world, that coming generations are
simply going to laugh at the whole idea of religion. It was so
unintelligent, so stupid and mediocre, in fact insane.</p><p>And the people who did not go that far also suffered because they
could not enjoy life with totality. They could not escape -- they were
not that extreme either -- but they could not live life with totality,
with joy; their joy was poisoned. They lived in the world feeling
guilty.</p><p>The people who escaped suffered because they became uprooted. They
starved, they were undernourished because life is a nourishment,
relationship is a</p><p>nourishment. To be with people and to be in many loving
relationships, friendships, is an absolute necessity to make your life
rich. They became beggars, and the people who lived in life became very
guilty; they started thinking they are sinners. The saints were those
who had escaped. so of course, logically, the people who were not
capable enough.</p><p>courageous enough. thought 'We are not brave enough. We are guilty
people, sinners, and we are going to suffer in hell.'</p><p>This is how the whole world has been dominated by the wrong kind of
religion. It is good that the modern is getting freer every day of all
that rubbish. But sometimes it happens that when you throw the

with the bathwater -- that is the danger.</p><p>The old fools were doing one thing -- they were throwing out the baby
and saving the bathwater. Now the new fools can do this -- they can
throw both, but both ways the baby is gone.</p><p>My effort here is to save the baby and throw the bathwater. And if
the bathwater can also be used somewhere in the garden, it should be
used. There is no need to throw is it should be put to some use.</p><p>Life is not to be renounced but experienced, lived, loved, because it
is only at the innermost core of life that you will feel the presence of
god. Hence my sannyasins have to be lovers of life, and they have to be
dancers, singers, musicians, poets, creators, because the fundamental of
my religion is, if you want to come closer to the creative energy of
existence you have to be creators yourself. That's the only way to come
close to the creative energy, or call it the creator.</p><p>By your becoming creative, you start participating in god's
creation.</p><p>Celebrate -- don't miss a single opportunity to celebrate. Go on
searching for opportunities to celebrate.</p><p>If you cannot find them, invent them, because the whole point is
celebration, not whether there is a real opportunity or a fictitious
opportunity -- that doesn't matter. What matters is celebration because
it is through celebration that you will flower, that you will come to
your higher peaks of consciousness, sensitivity, creativity.</p><p>It is the celebrating person who really lives others only die a slow
kind of death. It takes seventy years for a few people to die, for a few
it takes even longer, eighty, ninety -- they are slow diers. They don't
know how to finish a job quickly; they go on and on, they go on
dragging. There are many people who go on dragging posthumously; they
should have died decades ago but somehow they manage. There are ghosts'
--</p><p>there are the people who are ghosts, who live a posthumous kind of
existence.</p><p>In fact it is near-about the age of four that people die -- then it
is all posthumous existence, then they simply go on dragging. Just look
at a child of three and you will see what liveliness should be, how
joyous he is and how sensitive to everything that goes on happening
around him, how alert, watchful; nothing misses his eye. And how intense
in everything: if he is angry, he is just anger, pure anger. It is
beautiful to see a child in anger, because old people are always
half-hearted, even if they are angry they are not totally in it, they
are holding back. They don't love totally, they are not angry totally,
they don't do anything in totality, they are always calculating. Their
life has become lukewarm. It never comes to that intensity of one
hundred degrees where things evaporate, where something happens, where
revolution becomes possible.</p><p>But a child always lives at one hundred degrees -- whatsoever he
does. If he hates you he hates you totally, and he loves you he loves
you totally; and in a single moment he can change. He is so quick, he
does not take time, he does not brood over it. Just one moment before,
he was sitting in your lap and telling you how much he loves you. And
then something happens -- you say something and something goes wrong
between you and him -- and he jumps out of your lap and says 'I never
want to see you again.' And see in his eyes the totality of it'</p><p>And because it is total it does not leave a trace behind. That's the
beauty of</p><p>totality: it does not accumulate psychological memory. Psychological
memory is created only by partial living. Then everything that you have
lived only in part hangs around you, the hang-over continues for your
whole life. And thousands of things are there, hanging unfinished.</p><p>That's the whole theory of karma, unfinished jobs, unfinished actions
go on waiting to be finished, to be completed, and they go on goading
you 'Complete me' because every action wants to be fulfilled.</p><p>But if you live totally, intensely, then you are free of it, you have
lived the moment and it is finished.</p><p>You don't look back and you don't look ahead. you simply remain
herenow, there is no past. no future.</p><p>That's what I mean by celebration. In a real moment of celebration
only the present exists. And to be in the present is to be a sannyasin.
and to be in the present is to be blissful.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

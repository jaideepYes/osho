It is for reference purposes only.]\nFor centuries religions all over the world have been telling people to serve humanity, but it has not produced any effect, it has not served any purpose. On the contrary, it has created hypocrites. People who are not blissful themselves are absolutely unable to help anybody. Those who have not attained cannot share; they don't have it to share. You can give light to others only if you have it in the first place.\nBlind people trying to lead other blind people -- that's what has been happening. It is a very dangerous game, because if the blind person knows nobody is leading him, he tries to find his own way, he tries to grope. He remains careful, cautious, very cautious. But the moment he finds that somebody is leading him, guiding him, that he has found a leader he relaxes; he need not be so alert, he need not be\non guard so much.\nHe is completely unaware that the guide is as blind as he himself. Now there is more danger than there was before because he will not live cautiously. He will think 'Now somebody is there to take respon-sibility --\nwhy be worried?'\nIt is because of this -- these blind people guiding other blind people -- that the whole humanity has almost become a madhouse: everybody has fallen into all kinds of ditches, everybody is suffering. Life has become almost intolerable. And it has all happened through good intentions.\nThe people who have tried to help have only hindered growth. Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Jainism; all teach service to humanity: service to humanity is the way to god.\nSo people start serving without knowing whether they are capable of serving or not.\nYou won't allow anybody to operate on you unless he is a qualified surgeon. Whatsoever his intentions, even if they are very good intentions -- he reads the Bible every day and goes to church and he talks beautifully about god and about prayer and he is a man of prayer -- still we will say 'Don't touch my body --\nyou are not a surgeon.' And he will say, 'But I want to help you, I want to serve you. Service to humanity is my religion, service above all.' You will say, 'That's very good, but find somebody else!'\nAbout the body you won't allow anybody to help you unless he is qualified, but about the soul all kinds of people are allowed to help you. Only the awakened ones can be helpers. Unless a man is enlightened, it is impossible for him to guide anybody. Of course the desire to guide is there in everybody, it is very ego- fulfilling. That's why everybody is ready to give you advice whether you ask for it or not. Unasked for advice is being given, and good advice, because everybody wants to be, at least in SOMEBODY'S eyes, a wise man. And it is very easy to advise others. They may not have practised the same thing in their own life...\nThere is a Sufi story. A woman came to a Sufi mystic with her small child who was eating too many sweets, ice cream and all kinds of things, and the mother\nwas worried. The mother believed that sugar was white poison; she believed in naturopathy. But the child was adamant and he wouldn't listen.\nShe told the mystic 'I have tried every possible way: I have punished him, I have rewarded him --\nnothing works! He goes on eating sweets, he simply eats sweets and nothing else. He is ready to be hungry but he won't eat anything else; the whole day he goes on stuffing himself. We are worried -- it is going to be dangerous for his health, for his teeth, and everything will be affected. You have to do something. You have always been of great help to me -- please advise this stupid child. He is very stubborn.'\nThe mystic looked at the child and said to the woman, 'Come back after three weeks. I cannot advise you right now.' Even the child was curious, because so many people were advising him. He looked at the mystic and said, 'What is the matter? -- because every person that I have come across advises me, and my mother takes me to every place. I have become accustomed to all this nonsense, and I have to listen. You are the first man who has wanted three weeks. Are you going to ponder over it?'\nAnd the old man said, 'No, my child, I am not going to ponder over it. I love sweets myself. I cannot advise you right now. I am not the right person to advise you; my advice will be futile. Three weeks I will practise. If I can manage at this age to drop sweets completely, then I can advise you. If I fail I will confess\n\"I cannot advise him -- take him to somebody else.\"' 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAfter three weeks they came back and the old man said, 'Three weeks more will be needed.' The child said, 'What is the matter?' The old man said, 'You know, I know, but this woman won't understand -- she is mad! I have been trying hard but I love sweets.'\nThe child said, 'You are right. I have also tried hard. Not that I don't want... I understand all these people are good people and they are all advising me for my good, but I cannot stop.'\nThe old man said, 'Wait three weeks more.' And after three weeks when they came back the old man said to the child, 'It can be done, my boy. I have done it! And look: I am a very old man, still I have been able to do it. Give it a try.' And the child said, 'Okay, master. I will try!'\nThe woman was puzzled. She said, 'This is the first time that the child has taken any interest in any adviser. In fact he insists every day, \"When are we going to the old man?\" He reminds me, \"Now three weeks are over and we should go.\" You are the first man with whom he has agreed willingly.'\nThe old man said, 'The reason is he can understand that I have tried on my own first, I have practised it.\nHe can see my sincerity; it is not mere advice. He knows it has cost me much. I love sweets, I have always loved sweets. Sugar may be white poison -- so what? One is going to die sooner or later. And I am an old man; whether I live two years or three years or seven years or ten, what does it matter? -- one day one has to die. For his sake I practised it, and I give my word that I will never eat sweets, I will never again use sugar in my life. If this can help the child, then it is okay, otherwise what else can I do?' This sincerity worked; the child dropped sweets that very day.\nMissionaries have been doing much work all over the world -- missionaries of all religions -- trying to help people with things they have not practised themselves...\nOne can be a helper only if one has first helped himself. It begins from your very innermost core. You have to be the basic experiment of transformation.\nThis is my approach. So I don't say to my sannyasins: go and help humanity. Enough of that kind of help has been done and enough harm has been done through that kind of help. No more of it! I insist: help yourself. And if you can attain to light, to bliss, to an experience of godliness, then you are bound to help others. There is no need to say anything about it; it will overflow, your joy will start overflowing. And remember: only a blissful person can be helpful; the miserable person can only harm.\nSo the first thing to remember, the most basic, is to become blissful. Be totally selfish, only then can you be altruistic. This is a strange message, because for centuries man has been told 'Don't be selfish, then you can be altruistic.' I say just the opposite: Be totally selfish because only out of your selfishness does altruism grow; it is not against it.\nA man who has loved himself will be able to love others. A man who has felt bliss will be able to spread it. One always gives whatsoever one has, one radiates it. It is not possible to hide it, it starts functioning of its own accord... It is such a miracle, it is such magic.\nOne cannot praise god unless one's life is a celebration -- obviously: if you are miserable you can only complain, you cannot praise -- praise for what? You cannot feel grateful -- grateful for what? In fact you will have a grudge against god. Deep down you will feel that you have been cheated.\nOne of the characters in Fyodor Dostoevsky's great novel BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, says 'If I meet god the first thing I am going to ask him is \"Who asked you to create me? And is it right to create me without my permission? This is an imposition, this is dictatorial. I never wanted your so-called life, because I only suffered. Who are you to create me without my permission? Do you enjoy people and their miseries?\nAre you a sadist of some kind? Are we created just to keep you engaged, and are all kinds of miseries created for us just for your enjoyment and entertainment? What is this existence for, for what purpose?\"'\nHe is angry, and I can see that his anger has a certain meaning. In fact everybody has felt that anger once in a while. Whenever you are in misery, in deep suffering, anguish, you have felt it. It is not just fiction, it is not something out of the imagination of the novelist; it is very true, it is human.\nIt will be impossible to forgive god if we remain miserable -- what to say of praising? That's why people who pray are bound to remain hypocrites for the simple reason: they have not tasted of bliss -- how can they show their thankfulness? Maybe they are praying out of fear, but how can prayer arise out of fear? Out of fear love never arises; out of fear arises hatred, anger.\nFriedrich Nietzsche seems to be far more authentic man than your so-called popes and ayatollahs and imams and pundits and shankaracharyas, because he\ndeclared that god is dead! That was just sheer anger, anger at being in such a miserable situation where there seems to be no way to get out. The more you try to get out, the more you become entangled. The more you try to solve the problems of life, the more you come 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nto see that they are insoluble.\nStill man has to live because there is a deep desire to live. God has given us a tremendous libido, a lust for life -- and life is full of misery. He has created a dilemma, a double-bind; he won't allow you to die easily and he won't allow you to live easily either.\nIt is very natural that the twentieth century has revolted against religions. All intelligent people all over the world are against religion for the simple reason that the whole thing seems to be insincere. You cannot pray, you cannot feel thankful because there is nothing to feel thankful for.\nMy effort here is to create a totally new concept of religion which will be applicable to the modern mind, which will be contemporary. All religions are rotten and old now. They have lost their relevance, their context, they have lost all their meaning. They may have been meaningful once, but now man has come of age.\nFive thousand years ago men were like small children. They needed a different kind of religion, a very childish religion: god the father, and angels flying with wings and all kinds of fairy tales. They were good for children to keep them engaged, colourful, but not for people who have become grown-up. And our religions are still hanging around those ancient fairy tales. They still talk a language which is okay as far as children are concerned but which is stupid, silly as far as silly as far as a grown-up person is concerned.\nIt is good to take small children to Disneyland, but when the Dalai Lama goes and visits it, then it looks silly, just stupid. But I can see the reason: the Dalai Lama also lives in a very childish religious attitude. He was deeply interested, he\nenjoyed it very much. There seems to be a certain affinity between the childish mind and the old religious mind.\nTo me religion should start not with a belief in god; a grown-up's religion cannot start by any belief -- it can only start in scientific experimen-tation. One has to become the scientific lab oneself. Of course the experimentation is inner and subjective, but it is as scientific as any objective experiment. In fact one has to be more alert because one will be dealing with more subtle phenomena. And one has to look for god, one has to look for bliss, because bliss is a natural desire; god almost seems to be something imposed upon us.\nReligions can be without god; there are religions -- Buddhism, Jainism. They are without god. God doesn't seem to be a necessary hypothesis at all. But without bliss there can be no religion because then there is no need for any religion. Religion means the science of bliss. How to transform our energies from a state of misery into a state of bliss -- that should be the whole of religion.\nAnd this is my experience, that when it happens a great gratitude arises. In that gratitude, for the first time you feel the presence of something divine. You can call it god, you can call it truth, you can call it tao\n-- it doesn't matter what you call it -- or you may not call it anything; you may remain completely silent about it because it is something inexpressible. But certainly it happens when you are blissful. Then you start feeling a deep thankfulness towards existence. That is praise of the lord.\nFind bliss and you will have found prayer as a consequence of it. But for centuries you have been told: pray and then you will find bliss. I am saying just the opposite: become blissful and prayer will come of its own accord. And then prayer has a beauty of its own: it is without fear, without greed. You are not asking for anything; it is not beggarly. You are simply feeling a thankfulness to the unknown source of all, to the ultimate source of all. And now you have something to feel grateful for -- you cannot complain.\nDostoevsky lived in misery. For his whole life he was a miserable man. He lived in all kinds of nightmares, he was really a tortured soul. He represented the modern consciousness in all its naked anguish, in its ugliest form. He suffered -- it is natural that he was angry. The same was true about Friedrich Nietzsche; he was also suffering very much. They were unable to find any way because\nChristianity had become almost hocus-pocus. After Jesus died Christianity became a dead phenomenon.\nNietzsche was right when he said that the first and the last Christian died two thousand years ago on the cross -- the first and the last, he said. After Jesus there has only been a long queue of stupid of people, of all kinds of superstitious people. But this has happened to almost every religion more or less; the difference is only of quantity.\nI don't want to give any belief, any dogma, any creed. I trust only in experience. So while being here with me and becoming a sannyasin, this has to be your goal: to become more blissful. We create our misery, hence it is not difficult to be blissful. It is just because we don't understand how we go on creating our misery; once we understand the mechanism of how we go on doing it, we can stop doing it. And the same energy starts moving into different directions. It starts becoming a totally new phenomenon: it becomes bliss, and then prayer follows.\nThat prayer is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan. That prayer is simply prayerfulness. That 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nprayer is not addressed to any particular god -- Christian, Jewish, Mohammedan\n-- it is not really addressed to anybody in particular. It is simply a heartfelt joy, a thankfulness for the whole existence: for the trees, for the clouds, for the stars, for all that has been, is, and will be.\n-- What is the meaning of your name, Kiffy? -- I don't know. -- And I also don't know, so...! You have such a beautiful name -- there is no need for a meaning. Ma Anand Kiffy -- we will call you blissful Kiffy. Whatsoever Kiffy means, be blissful! That is the real thing; that is the elephant. Kiffy is just the tail-end. If the elephant passes by, the tall will also go! How long will you be here? -- Till December, I think. -- That's good. Both the elephant and the tail will go!\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #4\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3049","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3049 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is ready to give you advice whether you ask for it or not. Unasked for
advice is being given, and good advice, because everybody wants to be,
at least in SOMEBODY'S eyes, a wise man. And it is very easy to advise
others. They may not have practised the same thing in their own
life...</p><p>There is a Sufi story. A woman came to a Sufi mystic with her small
child who was eating too many sweets, ice cream and all kinds of things,
and the mother</p><p>was worried. The mother believed that sugar was white poison; she
believed in naturopathy. But the child was adamant and he wouldn't
listen.</p><p>She told the mystic 'I have tried every possible way: I have punished
him, I have rewarded him --</p><p>nothing works! He goes on eating sweets, he simply eats sweets and
nothing else. He is ready to be hungry but he won't eat anything else;
the whole day he goes on stuffing himself. We are worried -- it is going
to be dangerous for his health, for his teeth, and everything will be
affected. You have to do something. You have always been of great help
to me -- please advise this stupid child. He is very stubborn.'</p><p>The mystic looked at the child and said to the woman, 'Come back
after three weeks. I cannot advise you right now.' Even the child was
curious, because so many people were advising him. He looked at the
mystic and said, 'What is the matter? -- because every person that I
have come across advises me, and my mother takes me to every place. I
have become accustomed to all this nonsense, and I <em>have</em> to
listen. You are the first man who has wanted three weeks. Are you going
to ponder over it?'</p><p>And the old man said, 'No, my child, I am not going to ponder over
it. I love sweets myself. I cannot advise you right now. I am not the
right person to advise you; my advice will be futile. Three weeks I will
practise. If I can manage at <em>this</em> age to drop sweets
completely, then I can advise you. If I fail I will confess</p><p>"I cannot advise him -- take him to somebody else."' 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

more will be needed.' The child said, 'What is the matter?' The old man
said, 'You know, I know, but this woman won't understand -- she is mad!
I have been trying hard but I love sweets.'</p><p>The child said, 'You are right. I have also tried hard. Not that I
don't want... I understand all these people are good people and they are
all advising me for my good, but I cannot stop.'</p><p>The old man said, 'Wait three weeks more.' And after three weeks when
they came back the old man said to the child, 'It can be done, my boy. I
have done it! And look: I am a very old man, still I have been able to
do it. Give it a try.' And the child said, 'Okay, master. I will
try!'</p><p>The woman was puzzled. She said, 'This is the first time that the
child has taken any interest in any adviser. In fact he insists every
day, "When are we going to the old man?" He reminds me, "Now three weeks
are over and we should go." You are the first man with whom he has
agreed willingly.'</p><p>The old man said, 'The reason is he can understand that I have tried
on my own first, I have practised it.</p><p>He can see my sincerity; it is not mere advice. He knows it has cost
me much. I love sweets, I have <em>always</em> loved sweets. Sugar may
be white poison -- so what? One is going to die sooner or later. And I
am an old man; whether I live two years or three years or seven years or
ten, what does it matter? -- one day one has to die. For <em>his</em>
sake I practised it, and I give my word that I will never eat sweets, I
will never again use sugar in my life. If this can help the child, then
it is okay, otherwise what else can I do?' This sincerity worked; the
child dropped sweets that very day.</p><p>Missionaries have been doing much work all over the world --
missionaries of all religions -- trying to help people with things they
have not practised themselves...</p><p>One can be a helper only if one has first helped himself. It begins
from your very innermost core. You have to be the basic experiment of
transformation.</p><p>This is my approach. So I don't say to my sannyasins: go and help
humanity. Enough of that kind of help has been done and enough harm has
been done through that kind of help. No more of it! I insist: help
yourself. And if you can attain to light, to bliss, to an experience of
godliness, then you are bound to help others. There is no need to say
anything about it; it will overflow, your joy will start overflowing.
And remember: only a blissful person can be helpful; the miserable
person can only harm.</p><p>So the first thing to remember, the most basic, is to become
blissful. Be totally selfish, only then can you be altruistic. This is a
strange message, because for centuries man has been told 'Don't be
selfish, then you can be altruistic.' I say just the opposite: Be
totally selfish because only out of your selfishness does altruism grow;
it is not against it.</p><p>A man who has loved himself will be able to love others. A man who
has felt bliss will be able to spread it. One always gives whatsoever
one has, one radiates it. It is not possible to hide it, it starts
functioning of its own accord... It is such a miracle, it is such
magic.</p><p>One cannot praise god unless one's life is a celebration --
obviously: if you are miserable you can only complain, you cannot praise
-- praise for what? You cannot feel grateful -- grateful for what? In
fact you will have a grudge against god. Deep down you will feel that
you have been cheated.</p><p>One of the characters in Fyodor Dostoevsky's great novel BROTHERS
KARAMAZOV, says 'If I meet god the first thing I am going to ask him is
"Who asked you to create me? And is it right to create me without my
permission? This is an imposition, this is dictatorial. I never wanted
your so-called life, because I only suffered. Who are you to create me
without my permission? Do you enjoy people and their miseries?</p><p>Are you a sadist of some kind? Are we created just to keep you
engaged, and are all kinds of miseries created for us just for your
enjoyment and entertainment? What is this existence for, for what
purpose?"'</p><p>He is angry, and I can see that his anger has a certain meaning. In
fact everybody has felt that anger once in a while. Whenever you are in
misery, in deep suffering, anguish, you have felt it. It is not just
fiction, it is not something out of the imagination of the novelist; it
is very true, it is human.</p><p>It will be impossible to forgive god if we remain miserable -- what
to say of praising? That's why people who pray are bound to remain
hypocrites for the simple reason: they have not tasted of bliss -- how
can they show their thankfulness? Maybe they are praying out of fear,
but how can prayer arise out of fear? Out of fear love never arises; out
of fear arises hatred, anger.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche seems to be far more authentic man than your
so-called popes and ayatollahs and imams and pundits and
shankaracharyas, because he</p><p>declared that god is dead! That was just sheer anger, anger at being
in such a miserable situation where there seems to be no way to get out.
The more you try to get out, the more you become entangled. The more you
try to solve the problems of life, the more you come 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>to see that they are insoluble.</p><p>Still man has to live because there is a deep desire to live. God has
given us a tremendous libido, a lust for life -- and life is full of
misery. He has created a dilemma, a double-bind; he won't allow you to
die easily and he won't allow you to live easily either.</p><p>It is very natural that the twentieth century has revolted against
religions. All intelligent people all over the world are against
religion for the simple reason that the whole thing seems to be
insincere. You cannot pray, you cannot feel thankful because there is
nothing to feel thankful for.</p><p>My effort here is to create a totally new concept of religion which
will be applicable to the modern mind, which will be contemporary. All
religions are rotten and old now. They have lost their relevance, their
context, they have lost all their meaning. They may have been meaningful
once, but now man has come of age.</p><p>Five thousand years ago men were like small children. They needed a
different kind of religion, a very childish religion: god the father,
and angels flying with wings and all kinds of fairy tales. They were
good for children to keep them engaged, colourful, but not for people
who have become grown-up. And our religions are still hanging around
those ancient fairy tales. They still talk a language which is okay as
far as children are concerned but which is stupid, silly as far as silly
as far as a grown-up person is concerned.</p><p>It is good to take small children to Disneyland, but when the Dalai
Lama goes and visits it, then it looks silly, just stupid. But I can see
the reason: the Dalai Lama also lives in a very childish religious
attitude. He was deeply interested, he</p><p>enjoyed it very much. There seems to be a certain affinity between
the childish mind and the old religious mind.</p><p>To me religion should start not with a belief in god; a grown-up's
religion cannot start by any belief -- it can only start in scientific
experimen-tation. One has to become the scientific lab oneself. Of
course the experimentation is inner and subjective, but it is as
scientific as any objective experiment. In fact one has to be
<em>more</em> alert because one will be dealing with more subtle
phenomena. And one has to look for god, one has to look for bliss,
because bliss is a natural desire; god almost seems to be something
imposed upon us.</p><p>Religions can be without god; there are religions -- Buddhism,
Jainism. They are without god. God doesn't seem to be a necessary
hypothesis at all. But without bliss there can be no religion because
then there is no need for any religion. Religion means the science of
bliss. How to transform our energies from a state of misery into a state
of bliss -- that should be the whole of religion.</p><p>And this is my experience, that when it happens a great gratitude
arises. In that gratitude, for the first time you feel the presence of
something divine. You can call it god, you can call it truth, you can
call it tao</p><p>-- it doesn't matter what you call it -- or you may not call it
anything; you may remain completely silent about it because it is
something inexpressible. But certainly it happens when you are blissful.
Then you start feeling a deep thankfulness towards existence. That is
praise of the lord.</p><p>Find bliss and you will have found prayer as a consequence of it. But
for centuries you have been told: pray and then you will find bliss. I
am saying just the opposite: become blissful and prayer will come of its
own accord. And then prayer has a beauty of its own: it is without fear,
without greed. You are not asking for anything; it is not beggarly. You
are simply feeling a thankfulness to the unknown source of all, to the
ultimate source of all. And now you have something to feel grateful for
-- you cannot complain.</p><p>Dostoevsky lived in misery. For his whole life he was a miserable
man. He lived in all kinds of nightmares, he was really a tortured soul.
He represented the modern consciousness in all its naked anguish, in its
ugliest form. He suffered -- it is natural that he was angry. The same
was true about Friedrich Nietzsche; he was also suffering very much.
They were unable to find any way because</p><p>Christianity had become almost hocus-pocus. After Jesus died
Christianity became a dead phenomenon.</p><p>Nietzsche was right when he said that the first and the last
Christian died two thousand years ago on the cross -- the first and the
last, he said. After Jesus there has only been a long queue of stupid of
people, of all kinds of superstitious people. But this has happened to
almost every religion more or less; the difference is only of
quantity.</p><p>I don't want to give any belief, any dogma, any creed. I trust only
in experience. So while being here with me and becoming a sannyasin,
this has to be your goal: to become more blissful. We create our misery,
hence it is not difficult to be blissful. It is just because we don't
understand how we go on creating our misery; once we understand the
mechanism of how we go on doing it, we can stop doing it. And the same
energy starts moving into different directions. It starts becoming a
totally new phenomenon: it becomes bliss, and then prayer follows.</p><p>That prayer is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan. That
prayer is simply prayerfulness. That 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan remains a beggar unless he knows what the truth is. And the truth is only one. It is neither mine nor yours; it does not belong to anybody, to any religion, to any ideology, to any church, to any country, to any time. It is eternal, it is the very centre of the whole existence. It is also our centre, everyone's centre. They are different on the circumference, we are all joined at the centre. As we start moving towards the centre we start moving towards oneness of being.\nFirst the personality is lost. The personality is a very circumferential thing, a peripheral thing, cultivated, conditioned, taught; it is something imposed from the outside. And when personality disappears, individuality appears. Individuality remains for the whole journey between the circumference and the centre. Then you enter the centre even individuality disappears; you become universal.\nTo reach that centre is to be crowned, is to become an emperor. That's what Jesus was talking about when he said 'I am a king' and 'Blessed are the meek' for theirs is the kingdom of god.' But he was totally misunderstood. The woman emperors thought that he was trying to take power from their hands, that he was trying to make a political rebellion and hiding his political philosophy behind religious words. That's why they conspired with the rabbis, with the Jews, otherwise they\nwere not at all interested in whether he was the messiah or not. The rabbis were angry because he was saying 'I am the messiah. I have come to deliver people from their misery.'\nAnd he was right: every man who has attained to truth is a messiah, and the man who has attained to truth lives only to liberate people. His whole life is nothing but a sharing of his joy, he has nothing else to live for. All his desires have disappeared; he has no motivation of his own. As long as he lives and breathes he breathes for all, he lives for all.\nHe was saying absolutely the right thing. But the rabbis were angry because he was trying to possess their religion, he was trying to convert Jews into his followers. And the Romans were afraid because he was talking about a kingdom and a crowning and saying that the people who listened to him and followed him would inherit the earth. They thought he was a political person camouflaging his political philosophy with a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nreligious ideology. Hence the Roman emperor and the rabbis conspired together to crucify Jesus.\nBut he was simply stating a fact: every man of truth is an emperor. He is certainly crowned, because he reaches the ultimate height of glory, splendour, freedom, blissfulness. That is the goal of sannyas too: to help you to become emperors, to help you to attain the kingdom of god, to help you to inherit the whole existence.\nMy sannyas is not for beggars, my sannyas is for emperors, those who really want to be crowned, those who really want to know the ultimate peak of bliss and benediction. It is possible, and it is possible for everyone, whosoever is ready to go on the inner pilgrimage, whosoever is ready first to risk his personality to attain individuality and then to risk even individuality to attain universality. He deserves to be crowned!\nMeditation is rest, absolute rest, a full stop to all activity -- physical, mental,\nemotional. When you are in such a deep rest that nothing stirs in you, when all action as such ceases, as if you are fast asleep yet awake, you come to know who you are. Suddenly the window opens. It cannot be opened by effort, because effort creates tension and tension is the cause of our whole misery. Hence this is something very fundamental to be understood,,that meditation is not effort.\nOne has to be very playful about meditation, one has to learn to enjoy it as fun. One has not to be serious about it -- be serious and you miss. One has to go into it very joyously. And one has to keep aware that it is falling into deeper and deeper rest. It is not concentration, just the contrary, it is relaxation, When you are utterly relaxed, for the first time you start feeling,,your reality, you come face to face with your being. When you are engaged in activity you are so occupied that you cannot see yourself. Activity creates much smoke round you, it raises much dust around you; hence all activity has to be dropped, at least for a few hours every day.\nThat is only so in the beginning. When you have learned the art of being at rest then you can be both active and restful together, because then you know that rest is something so inner that it cannot be disturbed by anything outer, the activity goes on on the circumference and at the centre you remain restful. So it is only for beginning that activity has to be dropped for a few hours. Then one has learned the art then there is no question: for twenty-four hours a day one can be meditative and one can continue all the activities of ordinary life.\nBut remember, the key word is rest, relaxation. Never go against rest and relaxation. Arrange your life in such a way, drop all futile activity, because ninety per cent is futile; it is just for killing time and remaining occupied. Do only the essential and devote your energies more and more to the inner journey.\nThen that miracle happens when you can remain at rest and in action together, simultaneously. That is the meeting of the sacred and the mundane, the meeting of this world and that, the meeting of materialism and spiritualism.\nIt is only in this way that the East and the West can meet and become one. It has not been possible up to now for the simple reason that the East has tried to remain at rest; hence it has fallen into a kind of inactivity. And the West has tried to remain active. The West has completely forgotten how to be at rest; it has become very feverishly active. Both have gone wrong: the East has become lazy and lousy and the West has become insane. And activity out of insanity is\ndangerous; the West is driving the whole world towards that danger, the third world war. And inactivity, lousiness, lethargy, laziness, is also dangerous -- it is suicidal, it is a slow kind of death. So the East is starving and dying, withering away.\nThe meeting of the East and the West is one of the most essential things if humanity is to be saved. And my sannyasins have to become this meeting of action and rest; then they can herald the new man on earth.\nA man who has not tasted of bliss is a man living in dark night. He has not known the morning yet, the day has not happened. He may have dreamt about the sun, he may have heard about the sun in his dreams, he may have seen paintings of the sun, but he has not yet experienced any sunrise in himself.\nSannyas is an endeavor to bring you out of your dark night of the soul. Hence the colour of sannyas is the colour of the rising sun, when the sky starts becoming orange, goes red, all the colours of red and suddenly the sun starts coming on the horizon. The same, exactly the same happens inside, you just have to prepare the way for it. The only blockage, the only hindrance is the ego. The whole art of sannyas consists of a simple thing how to drop the ego. And it is not difficult really because it is a false thing you have simply to understand that it doesn't exist at all.\nTo see that it doesn't exist is what I mean by dropping it. You cannot really drop it because it is not there at all even to be dropped; it is just a false notion, just an idea in the head, just hot air and nothing else. A 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlittle prick is needed, that will do; the balloon bursts and the hot air is released.\nAnd that's my whole function here: to burst peoples' balloons. And they really bring big balloons...\nLight is possible, but only through love. Without love only darkness is possible. In the inner world love and light are synonymous; they don't mean different\nthings. Hence one who wants to be full of light, one who wants to be enlightened, has to be unconditionally loving.\nLove without any demands. Demands make it ugly, demands destroy it. If you have some condition attached to your love, it remains no more love, it becomes lust. And it becomes a political game, a power trip.\nLet your love remain pure and let your love remain unconfined; don't make any boundaries to it. Let it remain unaddressed, so slowly slowly it is not a question of whom to love, what to love; the only question is how to be loving. The object of love is irrelevant.\nLove people, love animals, love the trees, love the stars, love yourself. Unless you love each and everything, it cannot become your very breath. And just as the body needs breath -- it is its life -- the soul needs love -- it is the nourishment for your soul. The more you love, the more soul you have. When your love is infinite your soul also has infinity. When your love knows no bounds, your being also knows no bounds. That's what is really meant by god-realization; it is love- realization and nothing else.\nJesus is right when he says \"God is love.\" He would have been even more right if he had said \"Love is god.\"\nThat's my whole effort; to put love first, even before god. Why say, \"God is love\"? -- love becomes secondary. I say, \"Love is god.\" Love is primary -- god is another name for it.\nMan has tremendous glory hidden in him. Man is a splendor, but an imprisoned splendor. That splendor has to be released. It is just as a seed keeps thousands of flowers hidden in it; they are imprisoned in it. A gardener is needed to help the seed; soil is needed. And the seed also needs a little courage to drop its defence, the hard shell that surrounds it and protects it. Then immediately life starts growing out of it, millions of leaves will come and millions of flowers and millions of seeds too! In fact a single seed has so much splendor hidden in it, it can make the whole earth green.\nAnd so is the case with a man: man is a seed with thousands of flowers waiting. Meditation is the method to release them. And the art is the same as that of the gardeners. You are the seed and you have to be the gardener too; you are the seed, you are the gardener, you have to be the soil too. And you have to drop that\nhard crust around you, the ego -- and immediately miracles become possible. One cannot believe it unless one comes to know what is hidden inside.\nJesus is right when he says, \"The kingdom of god is within you.\" People can't believe it because they don't know anything inside them. It is only through meditation that they will be able to experience it.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are taking a jump -- a jump into meditation. Put in all your energies, focus your whole being in meditation, and through meditation all is possible: even the impossible is possible.\nFrom the outside man appears to be a very small dewdrop. But that is only an appearance -- don't be deceived by the appearance. And it is from the outside that he appears like a dewdrop; if you look from within your being, from the inside, the whole vision changes. The moment you stand at your very inner centre and see yourself from there, you are in for a treat surprise: you appear to be oceanic, as vast as you can imagine. In fact, vaster than the whole space outside, bigger than the sky.\nBut because we know ourselves only from the outside we go on believing in our smallness. And because of this feeling of smallness an inferiority complex arises, and that creates millions of troubles -- not one or two, but millions.\nEverybody, almost everybody, suffers from an inferiority complex. And if you stop suffering from an inferiority complex, then you start suffering from a superiority complex -- which is the same! All that you are doing is standing on your head. It is the same problem in reverse order.\nFirst you were starting, from ABC, now you are starting from Z and going backwards. It is the same thing whether you start from A or from Z; it is the same line, the same logic. If you fail in your life you suffer from inferiority. If you succeed you become a president or a prime minister, you start suffering from a superiority complex. But the problem is the same. Why does it arise at all? It arises because we don't know who we are.\nWe are oceanic: neither small nor big, just infinite with no beginning, no end. That is our godliness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen we say, 'Man is a god', that's precisely what is meant -- that man is neither small nor big; man is infinite. You cannot conceive anything about him through these words 'small' and 'big'. You can conceive only if you drop all these words totally. But that is possible only through meditation, because you don't know how to stand at your centre, how to be the centre of the cyclone.\nMeditation is the secret, the only secret, and the greatest secret that man has discovered up to now. The theory of atomic energy is not the greatest secret, neither the theory of gravitation, nor the theory of Einsteinian relativity. These are nothing compared to the insight that man has discovered through meditation.\nBuddha, Christ, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu -- all these people have come to know only one thing: a simple art of going to your very centre and seeing the world from there... Because the perspective is totally different.\nYour whole world becomes different, it is no more the same world. In one sense everything remains the same and in another sense nothing is the same. It becomes such a beautiful experience, such an ecstasy that words are not adequate to express it, even poetry falls short, even music falls short, even dancing cannot become a real indication of it. There is no way to make a gesture about it.\nEach one has to know it. The only way to know it is to know it.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #16\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2600","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2600 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

mundane, the meeting of this world and that, the meeting of materialism
and spiritualism.</p><p>It is only in this way that the East and the West can meet and become
one. It has not been possible up to now for the simple reason that the
East has tried to remain at rest; hence it has fallen into a kind of
inactivity. And the West has tried to remain active. The West has
completely forgotten how to be at rest; it has become very feverishly
active. Both have gone wrong: the East has become lazy and lousy and the
West has become insane. And activity out of insanity is</p><p>dangerous; the West is driving the whole world towards that danger,
the third world war. And inactivity, lousiness, lethargy, laziness, is
also dangerous -- it is suicidal, it is a slow kind of death. So the
East is starving and dying, withering away.</p><p>The meeting of the East and the West is one of the most essential
things if humanity is to be saved. And my sannyasins have to become this
meeting of action and rest; then they can herald the new man on
earth.</p><p>A man who has not tasted of bliss is a man living in dark night. He
has not known the morning yet, the day has not happened. He may have
dreamt about the sun, he may have heard about the sun in his dreams, he
may have seen paintings of the sun, but he has not yet experienced any
sunrise in himself.</p><p>Sannyas is an endeavor to bring you out of your dark night of the
soul. Hence the colour of sannyas is the colour of the rising sun, when
the sky starts becoming orange, goes red, all the colours of red and
suddenly the sun starts coming on the horizon. The same, exactly the
same happens inside, you just have to prepare the way for it. The only
blockage, the only hindrance is the ego. The whole art of sannyas
consists of a simple thing how to drop the ego. And it is not difficult
really because it is a false thing you have simply to understand that it
doesn't exist at all.</p><p>To see that it doesn't exist is what I mean by dropping it. You
cannot really drop it because it is not there at all even to be dropped;
it is just a false notion, just an idea in the head, just hot air and
nothing else. A 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

air is released.</p><p>And that's my whole function here: to burst peoples' balloons. And
they really bring big balloons...</p><p>Light is possible, but only through love. Without love only darkness
is possible. In the inner world love and light are synonymous; they
don't mean different</p><p>things. Hence one who wants to be full of light, one who wants to be
enlightened, has to be unconditionally loving.</p><p>Love without any demands. Demands make it ugly, demands destroy it.
If you have some condition attached to your love, it remains no more
love, it becomes lust. And it becomes a political game, a power
trip.</p><p>Let your love remain pure and let your love remain unconfined; don't
make any boundaries to it. Let it remain unaddressed, so slowly slowly
it is not a question of whom to love, what to love; the only question is
how to be loving. The object of love is irrelevant.</p><p>Love people, love animals, love the trees, love the stars, love
yourself. Unless you love each and everything, it cannot become your
very breath. And just as the body needs breath -- it is its life -- the
soul needs love -- it is the nourishment for your soul. The more you
love, the more soul you have. When your love is infinite your soul also
has infinity. When your love knows no bounds, your being also knows no
bounds. That's what is really meant by god-realization; it is love-
realization and nothing else.</p><p>Jesus is right when he says "God is love." He would have been even
more right if he had said "Love is god."</p><p>That's my whole effort; to put love first, even before god. Why say,
"God is love"? -- love becomes secondary. I say, "Love is god." Love is
primary -- god is another name for it.</p><p>Man has tremendous glory hidden in him. Man is a splendor, but an
imprisoned splendor. That splendor has to be released. It is just as a
seed keeps thousands of flowers hidden in it; they are imprisoned in it.
A gardener is needed to help the seed; soil is needed. And the seed also
needs a little courage to drop its defence, the hard shell that
surrounds it and protects it. Then immediately life starts growing out
of it, millions of leaves will come and millions of flowers and millions
of seeds too! In fact a single seed has so much splendor hidden in it,
it can make the whole earth green.</p><p>And so is the case with a man: man is a seed with thousands of
flowers waiting. Meditation is the method to release them. And the art
is the same as that of the gardeners. You are the seed and you have to
be the gardener too; you are the seed, you are the gardener, you have to
be the soil too. And you have to drop that</p><p>hard crust around you, the ego -- and immediately miracles become
possible. One cannot believe it unless one comes to know what is hidden
inside.</p><p>Jesus is right when he says, "The kingdom of god is within you."
People can't believe it because they don't know anything inside them. It
is only through meditation that they will be able to experience it.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are taking a jump -- a jump into
meditation. Put in all your energies, focus your whole being in
meditation, and through meditation all is possible: even the impossible
is possible.</p><p>From the outside man appears to be a very small dewdrop. But that is
only an appearance -- don't be deceived by the appearance. And it is
from the outside that he appears like a dewdrop; if you look from within
your being, from the inside, the whole vision changes. The moment you
stand at your very inner centre and see yourself from there, you are in
for a treat surprise: you appear to be oceanic, as vast as you can
imagine. In fact, vaster than the whole space outside, bigger than the
sky.</p><p>But because we know ourselves only from the outside we go on
believing in our smallness. And because of this feeling of smallness an
inferiority complex arises, and that creates millions of troubles -- not
one or two, but millions.</p><p>Everybody, almost everybody, suffers from an inferiority complex. And
if you stop suffering from an inferiority complex, then you start
suffering from a superiority complex -- which is the same! All that you
are doing is standing on your head. It is the same problem in reverse
order.</p><p>First you were starting, from ABC, now you are starting from Z and
going backwards. It is the same thing whether you start from A or from
Z; it is the same line, the same logic. If you fail in your life you
suffer from inferiority. If you succeed you become a president or a
prime minister, you start suffering from a superiority complex. But the
problem is the same. Why does it arise at all? It arises because we
don't know who we are.</p><p>We are oceanic: neither small nor big, just infinite with no
beginning, no end. That is our godliness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

man is neither small nor big; man is infinite. You cannot conceive
anything about him through these words 'small' and 'big'. You can
conceive only if you drop all these words totally. But that is possible
only through meditation, because you don't know how to stand at your
centre, how to be the centre of the cyclone.</p><p>Meditation is the secret, the only secret, and the greatest secret
that man has discovered up to now. The theory of atomic energy is not
the greatest secret, neither the theory of gravitation, nor the theory
of Einsteinian relativity. These are nothing compared to the insight
that man has discovered through meditation.</p><p>Buddha, Christ, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu -- all these people have come to
know only one thing: a simple art of going to your very centre and
seeing the world from there... Because the perspective is totally
different.</p><p>Your whole world becomes different, it is no more the same world. In
one sense everything remains the same and in another sense nothing is
the same. It becomes such a beautiful experience, such an ecstasy that
words are not adequate to express it, even poetry falls short, even
music falls short, even dancing cannot become a real indication of it.
There is no way to make a gesture about it.</p><p>Each one has to know it. The only way to know it is to know it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #16</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

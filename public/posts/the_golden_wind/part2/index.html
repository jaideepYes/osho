This is a very significant symbol: it is very rare to find in any other mythology the combination of wisdom and song.\nOrdinarily nobody thinks of them together -- and in reality they are together. Wisdom is a song. It is not seriousness, it is playfulness; it is not sad, it is celebrating. And unless wisdom is a song it is not true. Then it is only knowledge mere knowledge. It is only pretending to be wisdom. But real wisdom that can also become a song, that ultimately becomes a song, is born only out of meditation. Where is no other way.\nMeditation simply means the art of inward journeying. We are perfectly aware how to go into the outside world, how to reach others. We have become capable of travelling long distances very easily; we have reached the moon, walked on the moon. But the people who walked on the moon had no idea who they were; they had not even penetrated the first layer of their inner being. They had gone so far away, and they had taken a great risk. It was risky, it was dangerous. It was a miracle that nothing went wrong. There was every possibility that they would not go back on the earth again. Anything could have gone wrong: it was a first attempt to land human beings on the moon. But they had never tried to go in, and\nthey may never try to go in; the idea may not occur to them.\nPeople take themselves for granted -- that is the difficulty, They think they know themselves already.\nand the reality of one's being is the most mysterious phenomenon, the most unknown and unknowable.\nMeditation is the art of landing you at your very centre. We live on the circumference -- how to jump from the circumference to the centre? It is a whole art. I call it art rather than science because science is more mathematical and art is more artistic, more poetic. In science there are no exceptions, it follows universal laws. In art there are exceptions. In fact every individual reaches his centre in a slightly different 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nway anybody else, because each individual has something unique in him. What is the divinity and the great grace of the universe, that it makes unique individuals only.\nMeditation is the bridge between the circumference and the centre, between the outer and the inner, between mind and no-mind, between matter and consciousness.\nLearn the art of meditation. My whole emphasis is on meditation. I don't want my sannyasins to become addicted to any other details of discipline, of food.…\nWhere are a thousand and one things people become anxious about, worried about -- what to eat, what not to eat, how much to sleep, when to get up, when to go to bed? They are all nonessential things. The only essential thing is to know oneself. And the person who wants to know himself will naturally arrange his life in such a way that it helps. Slowly slowly he will change his food without any effort, without any enforcement. He will start becoming alert about what food helps him to be more silent. Just by watching one knows what is healthy, what is unhealthy, what gives you cramps in the stomach and what gives you\nheaviness, what makes you sleepy, what makes you alert, aware, light, what makes you sad and what makes you joyous.\nThrough watching, the meditator slowly becomes aware of what is the right time for him to sleep, and what is the right time for him to get up... And it will be different for everybody. That's why I don't want to prescribe any rules, because there are people who are day people and there are people who are night people.\nThe day people are more alive in the day, in the night they slow down. The night people are not so alive in the days they start becoming alive as the sun goes down. Evening is their real time, and as the night progresses they become more lively, now the same rule cannot be prescribed for both. Everybody has to find by experimentation, by awareness, what is right and wrong for him; and it is not for anybody else.\nBut one thing is for everybody, for all sannyasins -- and that is meditation. In fact by watching your habits, your life-style, your food, your sleep, the way you talk, the way you walk, you are learning meditation, because watching is the key. If first you can start watching outer things then you come a little closer: you start watching your thoughts, then a little closer and you start watching your emotions\n-- you are already moving in, the meditation has started. When only the watcher is left and there is nothing to watch, you have arrived home. That's the centre. Suddenly great light explodes, all darkness disappears, and with it all misery, all death.\nMeditation makes you aware of great music -- music without and music within. It is there, but we are not alert, we are not awake, hence we go on missing it, otherwise the whole existence is nothing but music.\nThat music is called 'god' by the mystics. God is not a person but the ultimate harmony of existence; it is an orchestra. Everything is in tune with everything else. The trees are in tune with the earth, the earth is in tune with the wind, the wind is in tune with the sky, the sky is in tune with the stars, and so on, so forth. There is no hierarchy. Even the smallest blade of erass is as significant as the biggest star. They both contribute to the orchestra of existence. They both enhance it, enrich it.\nEverything is going on in such deep accord, but man remains unaware of it. That unawareness becomes his misery and he starts suffering from his own invented\nnightmares. Otherwise life is a celebration, it is a constant celebration, a continuum, a non-ending festival. We just have to become a little more silent to be able to hear it. And when we are absolutely silent, not only silent but when we are silence -- then we disappear, then we are part of this whole cosmic harmony. That is the meeting of man with god, of the part with the whole. We disappear in one sense, we dissolve in one sense -- as an ego, as a person -- but we become the whole, so in another sense we are for the first time. The dewdrop disappears but becomes the ocean. It is not a loser, it loses nothing. It loses only its small boundaries which were not worth keeping. In fact they were creating this whole trouble: the fear, the trembling, the constant fear that the sun will rise and it will disappear, it will die.\nMahavira has said that man's life lived as an ego is just like a dewdrop hanging on a blade of grass, constantly afraid.\nJust a small breeze and that's the end: the dewdrop falls into the earth and disappears. Or soon the morning will be there and the sun will rise and the dewdrop will evaporate. How can one live surrounded by so much death? All our boundaries are in fact drawn by our death; we are defined by our death. The moment we lose our boundaries we lose our death too. When we are eternal, then when we are infinite.\nRemember that meditation is succeeding if you become more and more alert of the great music that is always there -- it just needs a sympathetic ear. Meditation creates that ear, that heart.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation is a very paradoxical experience. In one sense it takes away your personality, and it takes it away in toto; it leaves not even a trace of your personality. And it is our personality that we think makes us unique; it is not our personality that makes us unique. But we are afraid of losing our personality, our identity, because then we will be nobody -- and this is our uniqueness, this is what makes us special, this is our definition.\nIn the first place personality is not a reality; it is a mask. The very word 'personality' comes from\n'persona', persona means a mask. In Greek theatre actors used to wear masks -- those masks were called persona -- and while they wore masks they had a personality.\nWe are all wearing masks. They are not our reality -- just faces imposed upon the original face.\nMeditation will take away all your false faces -- that's the fear, that's why many people want to meditate but never meditate, they only talk about meditation but never take the jump into it, for the simple reason they are scared to lose their persona, their mask. That's all they have. And they have become accustomed to it: they only know themselves through it.\nOn the other hand, if you are ready to risk the mask, for the first time you discover your real uniqueness, your individuality. Individuality is totally different from personality. The word 'individuality' comes from a root which means indivisible: that which cannot be divided, that which cannot be dismantled, disintegrated.\nMeditation takes away your personality and makes you aware of your individuality. That individuality is unique; it belongs only to you and to nobody else. There has never been any individual like you and there will never be again, because god never repeats. He always creates unique individuals.\nAnd this is not only true about human beings, this is so about everything. Go to the sea beach and try to find two pebbles exactly the same and you will not be able to. Or go into the garden and try to find two leaves exactly the same and you will not be able to. It is not only that your thumb impression is unique, in fact, everything in existence is unique. But we go on biding our reality behind many many curtains and we become lost in our own inventions, in our own lies.\nMeditation is the discovery of the truth. Of course one has to sacrifice many lies, but you don't lose anything, you gain. With every lie sacrificed a little bit of truth is discovered. And when you have discovered your whole truth you have found god.\nThere is no other paradise except when you achieve the state of no-mind. Mind\nis hell and no-mind is heaven. Hell and heaven are not geographical; hell is psychological and heaven is spiritual.\nPeople have been continuously looking for a geographical hell and heaven. They are only metaphors, and one should not stretch metaphors too far, otherwise they lose all meaning. That's what has happened, and it has happened all over the world, in almost all the religions: beautiful metaphors stretched too far have become ugly.\nNow there are maps of hell, of heaven, available, and it is really strange that we were not able to make maps of the earth. Those were made just a few centuries ago, but there are five-thousand-year-old maps of heaven and hell. It was easy because it is all imagination; you can make anything out of imagination; hence the Christians' heaven is different and the Hindus' heaven is different and the Mohammedan's heaven is different. They are bound to be different: different peoples'imagination works in a different way.\nThe Tibetan heaven cannot be cool; they are so tired of the cold -- it is warm. The Indian heaven cannot be warm; they are so tired of the heat -- it is cool. Now how can they agree about that? An Indian heaven is bound to be air- conditioned. The Indian hell is full of fire, naturally -- that's how India is suffering. We know that's how hell should be more fire, fire and fire, all flame, everywhere. From where do they go on getting all this gas and kerosene? -- nobody knows! For eternity they have been burning hell-fire. And it cannot be a small thing: millions of people are thrown into hell. And the whole work consists of one thing: just cooking them' And they are not owed to die either, because if they die they are freed from suffering, and they have to be there for eternity. And the whole work consists of this. That may be the cause of the scarcity of petrol and kerosene. Hell is somewhere deep down, so they have shut off all petrol going towards hell.\nAnd it must be easy there: you just put a pipe down and the petrol starts flowing. To pump it up is difficult!\nThis is just imagination. There is certainly something like hell, but it exists in you. And you are the creator of it, your mind is the cause of it. If you can go beyond the mind you go beyond hell, you go beyond suffering.\nMeditation is the way of transcendence. And life can be sheer joy. There is no\nreason why one should suffer. If we are suffering we are creating it.\nMy sannyasins have to accept total responsibility for their suffering, because it is in that acceptance that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwe become masters of our own hell. Then we of course can get out of it; there is nobody who is preventing us. No devil, no satan is the master of it -- we are! Throwing responsibility on somebody else -- on fate, on kismet -- is just a trick of the mind. So you go on creating your own hell but you go on throwing the responsibility on other peoples' shoulders, and the vicious circle continues.\nOnce we accept that we are the cause of our own misery, half the journey is already complete. Then the other half is not more difficult, it is less difficult; the first half is the most difficult part. The same energy can be used for creating paradise.\nKnowledge is learned from others. Wisdom has to be discovered within oneself. Knowledge comes through studying scriptures, accumulating information from all possible sources. But wisdom is not information, wisdom is transformation. It does not come from any scripture or from any source whatsoever; it is already within you -- you just have to dig deeply into your own being. You have to find the rock-bottom beyond which you cannot go.\nOnce you have touched the rock-bottom, a fountain of wisdom immediately starts flowing in your life.\nAnd then that wisdom has freshness because it is not borrowed; it is young, innocent, uncorrupted. It is not cunning; it is wise but not clever, it is intelligent but not intellectual. And it will change every thing in your life. Knowledge changes nothing, it simply goes on accumulating in you; you remain the same. Knowledge becomes like a burden; you can carry it on your head, you can go on piling it up in suitcases. That's what memory is, just the piling up of knowledge.\nThe more knowledge you have, the more you will be respected by people, but\nyou will know that you are the same person. You will not respect yourself, you will not have any self-respect. On the contrary you will have a deep self- condemnation. But with wisdom it is possible, people may not respect you, they may even condemn you, because your wisdom will be so fresh and so new that they may not be able to absorb, digest it. They may not even be able to hear it -- it may be so shocking to them. It will be against their traditions and conventions. Wisdom is never conventional, it is always revolutionary.\nKnowledge is always conventional. The pundit always follows the past; the scholar goes on digging in the graves and goes on finding skulls and bones -- that's what his whole work is. The more skulls he accumulates, the more bones he accumulates, the greater scholar he is thought to be.\nThe wise man has no accumulation really, but he has a tremendous freshness, the freshness of the early morning breeze, the freshness of the first ray of the sun, the freshness of the flowers just opening, the freshness of dewdrops. He has a coolness, a calmness, but whatsoever he says brings rebellion into his own life and it brings rebellion into other people's lives.\nThat rebellious wisdom is possible only through meditation, not through mentation. Mentation will bring you more and more knowledge, and meditation will bring you more and more wisdom. When meditation is absolutely full, complete, entire; when nothing is left, when you have come to a point beyond which there is no further to go, then wisdom is total.\nThen suddenly your life becomes integrated; it becomes one, centered, rooted, grounded.\nThen you live joyously and you die joyously. Then whatsoever you do there is dance in it.\nAnd when every breath is a celebration, then only should one think that one has found god, truth, the home.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2956","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2956 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

alive as the sun goes down. Evening is their real time, and as the night
progresses they become more lively, now the same rule cannot be
prescribed for both. Everybody has to find by experimentation, by
awareness, what is right and wrong for him; and it is not for anybody
else.</p><p>But one thing is for everybody, for all sannyasins -- and that is
meditation. In fact by watching your habits, your life-style, your food,
your sleep, the way you talk, the way you walk, you are learning
meditation, because watching is the key. If first you can start watching
outer things then you come a little closer: you start watching your
thoughts, then a little closer and you start watching your emotions</p><p>-- you are already moving in, the meditation has started. When only
the watcher is left and there is nothing to watch, you have arrived
home. That's the centre. Suddenly great light explodes, all darkness
disappears, and with it all misery, all death.</p><p>Meditation makes you aware of great music -- music without and music
within. It is there, but we are not alert, we are not awake, hence we go
on missing it, otherwise the whole existence is nothing but music.</p><p>That music is called 'god' by the mystics. God is not a person but
the ultimate harmony of existence; it is an orchestra. Everything is in
tune with everything else. The trees are in tune with the earth, the
earth is in tune with the wind, the wind is in tune with the sky, the
sky is in tune with the stars, and so on, so forth. There is no
hierarchy. Even the smallest blade of erass is as significant as the
biggest star. They both contribute to the orchestra of existence. They
both enhance it, enrich it.</p><p>Everything is going on in such deep accord, but man remains unaware
of it. That unawareness becomes his misery and he starts suffering from
his own invented</p><p>nightmares. Otherwise life <em>is</em> a celebration, it is a
constant celebration, a continuum, a non-ending festival. We just have
to become a little more silent to be able to hear it. And when we are
absolutely silent, not only silent but when we are silence -- then we
disappear, then we are part of this whole cosmic harmony. That is the
meeting of man with god, of the part with the whole. We disappear in one
sense, we dissolve in one sense -- as an ego, as a person -- but we
become the whole, so in another sense we <em>are</em> for the first
time. The dewdrop disappears but becomes the ocean. It is not a loser,
it loses nothing. It loses only its small boundaries which were not
worth keeping. In fact they were creating this whole trouble: the fear,
the trembling, the constant fear that the sun will rise and it will
disappear, it will die.</p><p>Mahavira has said that man's life lived as an ego is just like a
dewdrop hanging on a blade of grass, constantly afraid.</p><p>Just a small breeze and that's the end: the dewdrop falls into the
earth and disappears. Or soon the morning will be there and the sun will
rise and the dewdrop will evaporate. How can one live surrounded by so
much death? All our boundaries are in fact drawn by our death; we are
defined by our death. The moment we lose our boundaries we lose our
death too. When we are eternal, then when we are infinite.</p><p>Remember that meditation is succeeding if you become more and more
alert of the great music that is always there -- it just needs a
sympathetic ear. Meditation creates that ear, that heart.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

away your personality, and it takes it away in toto; it leaves not even
a trace of your personality. And it is our personality that we think
makes us unique; it is not our personality that makes us unique. But we
are afraid of losing our personality, our identity, because then we will
be nobody -- and this is our uniqueness, this is what makes us special,
this is our definition.</p><p>In the first place personality is not a reality; it is a mask. The
very word 'personality' comes from</p><p>'persona', persona means a mask. In Greek theatre actors used to wear
masks -- those masks were called persona -- and while they wore masks
they had a personality.</p><p>We are all wearing masks. They are not our reality -- just faces
imposed upon the original face.</p><p>Meditation will take away all your false faces -- that's the fear,
that's why many people want to meditate but never meditate, they only
talk about meditation but never take the jump into it, for the simple
reason they are scared to lose their persona, their mask. That's all
they have. And they have become accustomed to it: they only know
themselves through it.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are ready to risk the mask, for the first
time you discover your real uniqueness, your individuality.
Individuality is totally different from personality. The word
'individuality' comes from a root which means indivisible: that which
cannot be divided, that which cannot be dismantled, disintegrated.</p><p>Meditation takes away your personality and makes you aware of your
individuality. That individuality is unique; it belongs only to you and
to nobody else. There has never been any individual like you and there
will never be again, because god never repeats. He always creates unique
individuals.</p><p>And this is not only true about human beings, this is so about
everything. Go to the sea beach and try to find two pebbles exactly the
same and you will not be able to. Or go into the garden and try to find
two leaves exactly the same and you will not be able to. It is not only
that your thumb impression is unique, in fact, everything in existence
is unique. But we go on biding our reality behind many many curtains and
we become lost in our own inventions, in our own lies.</p><p>Meditation is the discovery of the truth. Of course one has to
sacrifice many lies, but you don't lose anything, you gain. With every
lie sacrificed a little bit of truth is discovered. And when you have
discovered your whole truth you have found god.</p><p>There is no other paradise except when you achieve the state of
no-mind. Mind</p><p>is hell and no-mind is heaven. Hell and heaven are not geographical;
hell is psychological and heaven is spiritual.</p><p>People have been continuously looking for a geographical hell and
heaven. They are only metaphors, and one should not stretch metaphors
too far, otherwise they lose all meaning. That's what has happened, and
it has happened all over the world, in almost all the religions:
beautiful metaphors stretched too far have become ugly.</p><p>Now there are maps of hell, of heaven, available, and it is really
strange that we were not able to make maps of the earth. Those were made
just a few centuries ago, but there are five-thousand-year-old maps of
heaven and hell. It was easy because it is all imagination; you can make
anything out of imagination; hence the Christians' heaven is different
and the Hindus' heaven is different and the Mohammedan's heaven is
different. They are bound to be different: different peoples'imagination
works in a different way.</p><p>The Tibetan heaven cannot be cool; they are so tired of the cold --
it is warm. The Indian heaven cannot be warm; they are so tired of the
heat -- it is cool. Now how can they agree about that? An Indian heaven
is bound to be air- conditioned. The Indian hell is full of fire,
naturally -- that's how India is suffering. We know that's how hell
should be more fire, fire and fire, all flame, everywhere. From where do
they go on getting all this gas and kerosene? -- nobody knows! For
eternity they have been burning hell-fire. And it cannot be a small
thing: millions of people are thrown into hell. And the whole work
consists of one thing: just cooking them' And they are not owed to die
either, because if they die they are freed from suffering, and they have
to be there for eternity. And the whole work consists of this. That may
be the cause of the scarcity of petrol and kerosene. Hell is somewhere
deep down, so they have shut off all petrol going towards hell.</p><p>And it must be easy there: you just put a pipe down and the petrol
starts flowing. To pump it up is difficult!</p><p>This is just imagination. There is certainly something like hell, but
it exists in you. And you are the creator of it, your mind is the cause
of it. If you can go beyond the mind you go beyond hell, you go beyond
suffering.</p><p>Meditation is the way of transcendence. And life can be sheer joy.
There is no</p><p>reason why one should suffer. If we are suffering we are creating
it.</p><p>My sannyasins have to accept total responsibility for their
suffering, because it is in that acceptance that 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>we become masters of our own hell. Then we of course can get out of
it; there is nobody who is preventing us. No devil, no satan is the
master of it -- we are! Throwing responsibility on somebody else -- on
fate, on kismet -- is just a trick of the mind. So you go on creating
your own hell but you go on throwing the responsibility on other
peoples' shoulders, and the vicious circle continues.</p><p>Once we accept that we are the cause of our own misery, half the
journey is already complete. Then the other half is not more difficult,
it is less difficult; the first half is the most difficult part. The
same energy can be used for creating paradise.</p><p>Knowledge is learned from others. Wisdom has to be discovered within
oneself. Knowledge comes through studying scriptures, accumulating
information from all possible sources. But wisdom is not information,
wisdom is transformation. It does not come from any scripture or from
any source whatsoever; it is already within you -- you just have to dig
deeply into your own being. You have to find the rock-bottom beyond
which you cannot go.</p><p>Once you have touched the rock-bottom, a fountain of wisdom
immediately starts flowing in your life.</p><p>And then that wisdom has freshness because it is not borrowed; it is
young, innocent, uncorrupted. It is not cunning; it is wise but not
clever, it is intelligent but not intellectual. And it will change every
thing in your life. Knowledge changes nothing, it simply goes on
accumulating in you; you remain the same. Knowledge becomes like a
burden; you can carry it on your head, you can go on piling it up in
suitcases. That's what memory is, just the piling up of knowledge.</p><p>The more knowledge you have, the more you will be respected by
people, but</p><p>you will know that you are the same person. You will not respect
yourself, you will not have any self-respect. On the contrary you will
have a deep self- condemnation. But with wisdom it is possible, people
may not respect you, they may even condemn you, because your wisdom will
be so fresh and so new that they may not be able to absorb, digest it.
They may not even be able to hear it -- it may be so shocking to them.
It will be against their traditions and conventions. Wisdom is never
conventional, it is always revolutionary.</p><p>Knowledge is always conventional. The pundit always follows the past;
the scholar goes on digging in the graves and goes on finding skulls and
bones -- that's what his whole work is. The more skulls he accumulates,
the more bones he accumulates, the greater scholar he is thought to
be.</p><p>The wise man has no accumulation really, but he has a tremendous
freshness, the freshness of the early morning breeze, the freshness of
the first ray of the sun, the freshness of the flowers just opening, the
freshness of dewdrops. He has a coolness, a calmness, but whatsoever he
says brings rebellion into his own life and it brings rebellion into
other people's lives.</p><p>That rebellious wisdom is possible only through meditation, not
through mentation. Mentation will bring you more and more knowledge, and
meditation will bring you more and more wisdom. When meditation is
absolutely full, complete, entire; when nothing is left, when you have
come to a point beyond which there is no further to go, then wisdom is
total.</p><p>Then suddenly your life becomes integrated; it becomes one, centered,
rooted, grounded.</p><p>Then you live joyously and you die joyously. Then whatsoever you do
there is dance in it.</p><p>And when every breath is a celebration, then only should one think
that one has found god, truth, the home.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

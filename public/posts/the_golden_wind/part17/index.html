In the same way trust is the climate in which the heart grows; they are polar opposites. If one wants to live in the mind then one has to go on increasing one's doubt. Then the whole effort should be how to sharpen doubt, how to make it absolute so that there is no way to come to any conclusion.\nScience depends on doubt because science is a project of the mind; hence science never comes to any conclusions. At the most it comes to hypothetical conclusions. And whenever a conclusion is hypothetical it is not conclusive. It simply means for the time being we will sharpen our doubt more and then we will have to change it. So science is always approximately true, never exactly true. It cannot claim truth -- that is not its territory.\nReligion is just the opposite of it: it functions through trust, faith. It is a totally different approach towards life. It is an approach through love. That's why religion comes to conclusions and it helps a person to become centred, to relax, to rest. With a hypothesis you can never rest, you can never be at ease. You know that it is only a hypothesis, tomorrow it is going to be changed -- how can you make your home on such shifting sands?\nScience can never be a shelter for man. It can give you more comfort, convenience, a better standard of living, but it cannot give you a better quality of life -- that is impossible. That can happen only through religion, because it helps you to feel at home, it gives you something certain to live for. It gives you a rock to build your temple upon -- and that rock is trust.\nAs your trust grows, your bliss grows; as your doubt grows, your tension grows, misery grows. Doubt ultimately ends in anguish and anxiety. That's why the scientific approach is bound to drive people crazy; it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis driving the whole world crazy. And remember: I am not against science at all, but I would like man first to be centred in the heart and then to use science as a means. It can never be the goal, it can never be the end. It can only be a good servant, never the master.\nLove has to be the master, doubt has to be its servant, then everything is in its right place. Otherwise doubt becomes the master and it starts encroaching upon the territory of love and trust and it goes on destroying everything. It is like cancer if it becomes a master. It has to be put in its place.\nI am not against it, it has to be used. Science has to be used for human comforts, convenience. It can give many benefits to humanity. But it never be enshrined as a god. That is not its business but that's what science has been pretending to do. That's why the whole of humanity feels is a desertlike situation where all meaning has been lost, he has become insignificant, worthless. At the most you can drag, but you cannot dance.\nThrough trust comes dance, celebration, bliss, benediction.\nSannyas means a change, a radical change from the heard to the heart, a jump from logic to love.\nJust as the farmer has to work with the seeds and the soil and the water and the sun, a sannyasin also has to work in the same way in the inner world. His\ninteriority, his subjectivity, is his field, his farm. He has to sow seeds of meditation, of awareness, of consciousness. And he has to work hard. He has to work hard, only then one day can those seeds start growing and one see the inner world flowering and becoming fruitful.\nOrdinarily man's inner world remains a desert. It can become a beautiful garden. All that is needed to make it a garden is provided at your birth; all that is necessary is given to you. It if you keep the seeds locked in a treasure box they don't become flowers. If you never take any care of the inner, if you never look at the inner, nothing is going to happen there. Attention is needed.\nIt has been found recently that attention is one of the most important ingredients for any kind of growth, outer or inner. A child needs the mother's milk, but even more than that he needs the mother's attention. If the mother only gives him nourishment for the body and takes no other care, if the child feels neglected, ignored, his growth is stopped. He loses trust in himself, he loses confidence, he loses the very purpose of life. He starts feeling he is useless, he is not needed. To be needed is the greatest need. Without it, without its cosy atmosphere nothing can grow.\nThey have found that even with plants... you can put two plants of the same size int he same soil you can give them the same nourishment -- manure, chemicals, everything -- with no difference except one: with one plant be loving and very caring, and with the other just be a nurse.\nWith one be a mother, with the other just be a nurse: give all that is needed but no attention, no caressing, never a 'hello'. And with the other plant chitchat a little, hug it a little, kiss it. And you will be surprised that the plant that has been given attention grows faster. In fact within weeks it will be double the size of the neglected one, it will bring bigger flowers and bigger fruits.\nAlthough it cannot speak, it cannot say to you thankyou, this is its way of thanking you. Those bigger flowers and bigger fruits are enough proof that the communication has happened, that the plant has felt deep down that there is somebody who cares.\nThe same happens in the inner world: if we remain deserts we are at fault. We have not taken any care of it, we have never even bothered about it.\nSannyas means the beginning of a new care in your life, becoming attentive to\nyour inner needs. And the most important thing is attention: pay more attention to your own centre. Whenever you have time close your eyes to the whole world and forget all about it. Shower your centre with all your attention, care, love, and soon you will see flowers coming up. It is a kind of gardening, a kind of farming, and it brings tremendous joy because when you come to see the flowers of consciousness you know that life has not been a wastage, that you have not missed the opportunity, that you have used it.\nMan ordinarily lives in a state of unconsciousness, he lives almost in a kind of sleep. Only in a very minimal way is he aware, and even that not the whole time; only in emergency situations. If somebody suddenly comes with a knife to kill you, then for a moment you are alert. Then you will see what I mean when I say man lives in sleep. Suddenly you will see a change: you are no longer as sleepy as you were just a moment before, a great alertness has come. You are shocked. All your thinking disappears, all your dreaming disappears, the fantasies that continuously go on and on stop. For a moment the whole mind stops, there is a blank, an interval. In that interval you are alert.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to say, and he seems to be very close to the truth, \"I have observed hundreds of people and my feeling is that if a person can attain a few seconds of awareness in his whole life, that seems to be more than enough.\" A few seconds -- even those few seconds are not available.\nWe live like robots, machines. We go on doing things, and efficiently too, but that does not prove that we are conscious. In fact all machines are efficient and robots can do almost every kind of thing that you are doing; computers can do things better, more efficiently and more quickly.\nNow they say that in the next century there is going to be trouble because there will be many robots.\nThey may be already around, but you don't recognise them. They will look just\nlike you. They will talk like you and they will be very efficient and very healthy, they will not fall ill.\nMachines are machines -- they will remain young longer, they will be more powerful. Only once in a while when something mechanical goes wrong will you recognise that it is a machine, not a real man. For example, the battery runs down... The robot was making love and suddenly he says 'Grrrgrrrrgrrr'. The woman will become afraid -- what is happening? He cannot speak; you may have to look into his pockets and find out what number robot he is, what computer has to be enquired about for him, and what has to be done and what workshop he has to be taken to. They will carry small identity cards and numbers for emergency situations. Or you will have to plug him into the electricity so that he comes back to normal.\nOtherwise it will be difficult to make any distinction. They may already be around -- they may be sitting here! If somebody goes 'Grrgrrr'... Be watchful!\nMan, as he has existed for centuries -- the common man, the ordinary man, the mob, the crowd -- is mechanical. It is only through consciousness that you can go beyond this mechanicalness. And that is the real birth, then you become twice born. Through your parents you are only given a biological birth, not a spiritual birth.\nThe spiritual birth is possible only through the master. Hence in the East we have ancient scriptures which say that it is easy to pay all your debts to your parents, but it is impossible to pay the debt to your master. And it is true because the parents have given to you only a biological birth, and in fact they have not given you anything consciously. They were not even thinking about you. You are just an accident to them, they were not waiting for you. They knew nothing about you -- how could they have waited for you? They might have been just attracted to each other by a biological pull, by something like gravitation, and out of that pull you were born. In fact you are just accidental in that way.\nBut with a master a totally different journey begins. You are given a birth, a new birth, a new dimension: the spiritual dimension. And it is given very consciously, very deliberately.\nThe whole work of the master upon the disciple is to bring him so some consciousness of his self, of his being. That's what sannyas is all about: an effort\nto make you conscious, to help you to rise above your biology.\nPeople live as biological units and die as biological units. Very few people have attained to their spiritual selves, and those that do are the only real men. Everybody has the potential but people never work on it, so it remains just a potential and it is lost.\nIt can become actual. So make it a point that from now onwards your whole life will become a concentrated effort to become more and more conscious. And as glimpses of consciousness start arising in you, you will be surprised: bliss follows each moment of consciousness. As consciousness deepens, bliss deepens. Bliss is the consequence, the by-product, of being conscious.\nPleasure is animal -- and many people live at that level. They look like human beings but because pleasure remains their only goal... It may be through sex, it may be through food; those two are the most basic sources of their pleasure, and they are interchangeable too: if they repress their sexuality, they start eating more; if they become too involved in sexuality their fatness disappears, they eat less.\nNinety-nine per cent of people live at that level, which is not better than any other animal. And animals can be forgiven, but not man, because animals can't do anything about it and man can do something about it.\nHe has the capacity to rise above it.\nHuman beings don't even become human, what to say about divine? Happiness is human. Very few people know the distinction between pleasure and happiness. They go on thinking that pleasure is happiness\n-- it is not. Happiness is something far superior, far more refined.\nSex is animal, but then it is pure lust, a gratification of a bodily need. It is physiological, biological, nothing more than that. Love is human. Love is far higher than sex. Sex may be one part of it, and that too, not necessarily. You can have a non-sexual relationship and a very joyous relationship -- you can have a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfriendship which may be even more satisfying than any sexual relationship, far more deep-going, far more ecstatic; and sex can be a part of it, but only a part. There is much more in love than sex. And whether it is a part or not, the moment your being becomes love-full, it transforms the very nature of sexuality too. Then it is not biological, then it is more of the nature of play. It has nothing to do with reproduction, it is just enjoying the company of the other. One of the dimensions can be sex, and that too, not necessarily.\nAnd then in happiness there are many more things which animals are absolutely incapable of enjoying: poetry, painting, music, sculpture. A thousand and one things are there -- the whole world of art and aesthetics. And you can see in music also, music that really belongs to the animal part of you. Particularly the modern music, jazz and pop music, belongs to the animal part of you. Classical music has a totally different dimension. Beethoven or Mozart or Wagner -- they take you into a totally different world.\nAnd eastern classical music takes you even higher because it is part of meditativeness. It almost touches the divine. It was born in the temples, it was born in the monasteries. It was born through sannyasins, not through ordinary people but through people who were tremendously meditative. It came out of their meditation. They had heard something fo the celestial music and they wanted to bring something to humanity. Their music represents something celestial -- something of it, a reflection. It is a far-away echo, but still; a reflection of the moon is a reflection of the moon: it is a reflection but somehow it represents the moon, gives you a glimpse of the moon.\nBliss is the highest dimension of joy. the first is pleasure -- that is animal, the second is happiness -- that is human, and bliss is divine.\nSex is animal, love is human, prayer is divine. In love there may be sex, there may not be. In prayer there is no possibility of sex, is simply disappears. Hence tantra cannot be understood by ordinary people; they are bound to misunderstand it. It is prayer. It has nothing to do with sex. Even making love has nothing to do with sex. When it becomes a meditation, a prayer -- just the melting and meeting and merging of energies in a prayerful mood. It is not even fun or play, it is\ndevotion.\nBliss is the goal because only in blissfulness do you touch the highest peak of your being, you come to your total realisation. Man is a three-storeyed building. The ground floor is animal. And it is good, nothing is wrong in it; I am not against it, but I would like everybody to know something of the higher. Let the lower be the base, but don't remain confined to it. The second floor is human and the third floor is divine.\nIn knowing bliss one comes to know one's godliness, one is a god. And unless this is realised, remember: life remains unfulfilled, it remains a deep frustration, a discontentment. When you have reached your ultimate peak, only then is there contentment, peace, silence, a deep satisfaction that one has arrived.\nGold has always been symbolic, both in the East and in the West. For centuries alchemists have talked about it, and they have been very much misunderstood because people thought that they were talking about real god. They were talking about gold only as a metaphor.\nMan can become gold, he has all the chemicals needed for that transmutation, but those chemicals have to be mixed in the right proportion, heated in the right way to the right degree. Only in a mystery school is that possible. It is the world of inner chemistry. And the moment everything inside you is put in the right place a great harmony arises.\nOrdinarily a man is like an orchestra in which there is no leader, no guide and everybody is playing solo.\nAlthough it is an orchestra everybody is playing solo according to his own ideas, not bothering about others, what they are doing, not making any effort to bring a harmony; hence the noise, hence the craziness inside, the insanity. Almost the whole of humanity is insane. Of course people differ in degrees: a few people are more insane and a few are less, but a difference of degree is not much of a difference.\nOnly very few people -- once in a while a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Basho, a Jesus -- only very few people have been able to become guides of all their elementary forces and have been able to play, not solo, but to become part in an orchestra. These few people who have been able to bring some accord into their beings have known the ultimate truth.\nThat's what is meant by gold. It is the most precious metal, hence it became symbolic.\nThe man who knows what to do with all his elementary forces becomes gold; his life becomes really precious. Each moment is so inestimably valuable, each moment is such a gift that one cannot be thankful enough for it. There is no way to show our gratitude to god. His gift is of such immense proportions that we don't really deserve it. He has given it out of his abundance.\nKnowing this accord, feeling this accord one becomes blissful. And out of that bliss arises a thankfulness towards existence. That thankfulness is prayer.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3243","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3243 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

on destroying everything. It is like cancer if it becomes a master. It
has to be put in its place.</p><p>I am not against it, it has to be used. Science has to be used for
human comforts, convenience. It can give many benefits to humanity. But
it never be enshrined as a god. That is not its business but that's what
science has been pretending to do. That's why the whole of humanity
feels is a desertlike situation where all meaning has been lost, he has
become insignificant, worthless. At the most you can drag, but you
cannot dance.</p><p>Through trust comes dance, celebration, bliss, benediction.</p><p>Sannyas means a change, a radical change from the heard to the heart,
a jump from logic to love.</p><p>Just as the farmer has to work with the seeds and the soil and the
water and the sun, a sannyasin also has to work in the same way in the
inner world. His</p><p>interiority, his subjectivity, is his field, his farm. He has to sow
seeds of meditation, of awareness, of consciousness. And he has to work
hard. He has to work hard, only then one day can those seeds start
growing and one see the inner world flowering and becoming fruitful.</p><p>Ordinarily man's inner world remains a desert. It can become a
beautiful garden. All that is needed to make it a garden is provided at
your birth; all that is necessary is given to you. It if you keep the
seeds locked in a treasure box they don't become flowers. If you never
take any care of the inner, if you never look at the inner, nothing is
going to happen there. Attention is needed.</p><p>It has been found recently that attention is one of the most
important ingredients for any kind of growth, outer or inner. A child
needs the mother's milk, but even more than that he needs the mother's
attention. If the mother only gives him nourishment for the body and
takes no other care, if the child feels neglected, ignored, his growth
is stopped. He loses trust in himself, he loses confidence, he loses the
very purpose of life. He starts feeling he is useless, he is not needed.
To be needed is the greatest need. Without it, without its cosy
atmosphere nothing can grow.</p><p>They have found that even with plants... you can put two plants of
the same size int he same soil you can give them the same nourishment --
manure, chemicals, everything -- with no difference except one: with one
plant be loving and very caring, and with the other just be a nurse.</p><p>With one be a mother, with the other just be a nurse: give all that
is needed but no attention, no caressing, never a 'hello'. And with the
other plant chitchat a little, hug it a little, kiss it. And you will be
surprised that the plant that has been given attention grows faster. In
fact within weeks it will be double the size of the neglected one, it
will bring bigger flowers and bigger fruits.</p><p>Although it cannot speak, it cannot say to you thankyou, this is its
way of thanking you. Those bigger flowers and bigger fruits are enough
proof that the communication has happened, that the plant has felt deep
down that there is somebody who cares.</p><p>The same happens in the inner world: if we remain deserts <em>we</em>
are at fault. We have not taken any care of it, we have never even
bothered about it.</p><p>Sannyas means the beginning of a new care in your life, becoming
attentive to</p><p>your inner needs. And the most important thing is attention: pay more
attention to your own centre. Whenever you have time close your eyes to
the whole world and forget all about it. Shower your centre with all
your attention, care, love, and soon you will see flowers coming up. It
is a kind of gardening, a kind of farming, and it brings tremendous joy
because when you come to see the flowers of consciousness you know that
life has not been a wastage, that you have not missed the opportunity,
that you have used it.</p><p>Man ordinarily lives in a state of unconsciousness, he lives almost
in a kind of sleep. Only in a very minimal way is he aware, and even
that not the whole time; only in emergency situations. If somebody
suddenly comes with a knife to kill you, then for a moment you are
alert. Then you will see what I mean when I say man lives in sleep.
Suddenly you will see a change: you are no longer as sleepy as you were
just a moment before, a great alertness has come. You are shocked. All
your thinking disappears, all your dreaming disappears, the fantasies
that continuously go on and on stop. For a moment the whole mind stops,
there is a blank, an interval. In that interval you are alert.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

truth, "I have observed hundreds of people and my feeling is that if a
person can attain a few seconds of awareness in his whole life, that
seems to be more than enough." A few seconds -- even those few seconds
are not available.</p><p>We live like robots, machines. We go on doing things, and efficiently
too, but that does not prove that we are conscious. In fact all machines
are efficient and robots can do almost every kind of thing that you are
doing; computers can do things better, more efficiently and more
quickly.</p><p>Now they say that in the next century there is going to be trouble
because there will be many robots.</p><p>They may be already around, but you don't recognise them. They will
look just</p><p>like you. They will talk like you and they will be very efficient and
very healthy, they will not fall ill.</p><p>Machines are machines -- they will remain young longer, they will be
more powerful. Only once in a while when something mechanical goes wrong
will you recognise that it is a machine, not a real man. For example,
the battery runs down... The robot was making love and suddenly he says
'Grrrgrrrrgrrr'. The woman will become afraid -- what is happening? He
cannot speak; you may have to look into his pockets and find out what
number robot he is, what computer has to be enquired about for him, and
what has to be done and what workshop he has to be taken to. They will
carry small identity cards and numbers for emergency situations. Or you
will have to plug him into the electricity so that he comes back to
normal.</p><p>Otherwise it will be difficult to make any distinction. They may
already be around -- they may be sitting here! If somebody goes
'Grrgrrr'... Be watchful!</p><p>Man, as he has existed for centuries -- the common man, the ordinary
man, the mob, the crowd -- is mechanical. It is only through
consciousness that you can go beyond this mechanicalness. And that is
the real birth, then you become twice born. Through your parents you are
only given a biological birth, not a spiritual birth.</p><p>The spiritual birth is possible only through the master. Hence in the
East we have ancient scriptures which say that it is easy to pay all
your debts to your parents, but it is impossible to pay the debt to your
master. And it is true because the parents have given to you only a
biological birth, and in fact they have not given you anything
consciously. They were not even thinking about you. You are just an
accident to them, they were not waiting for you. They knew nothing about
you -- how could they have waited for you? They might have been just
attracted to each other by a biological pull, by something like
gravitation, and out of that pull you were born. In fact you are just
accidental in that way.</p><p>But with a master a totally different journey begins. You are given a
birth, a new birth, a new dimension: the spiritual dimension. And it is
given very consciously, very deliberately.</p><p>The whole work of the master upon the disciple is to bring him so
some consciousness of his self, of his being. That's what sannyas is all
about: an effort</p><p>to make you conscious, to help you to rise above your biology.</p><p>People live as biological units and die as biological units. Very few
people have attained to their spiritual selves, and those that do are
the only real men. Everybody has the potential but people never work on
it, so it remains just a potential and it is lost.</p><p>It can become actual. So make it a point that from now onwards your
whole life will become a concentrated effort to become more and more
conscious. And as glimpses of consciousness start arising in you, you
will be surprised: bliss follows each moment of consciousness. As
consciousness deepens, bliss deepens. Bliss is the consequence, the
by-product, of being conscious.</p><p>Pleasure is animal -- and many people live at that level. They look
like human beings but because pleasure remains their only goal... It may
be through sex, it may be through food; those two are the most basic
sources of their pleasure, and they are interchangeable too: if they
repress their sexuality, they start eating more; if they become too
involved in sexuality their fatness disappears, they eat less.</p><p>Ninety-nine per cent of people live at that level, which is not
better than any other animal. And animals can be forgiven, but not man,
because animals can't do anything about it and man can do something
about it.</p><p>He has the capacity to rise above it.</p><p>Human beings don't even become human, what to say about divine?
Happiness is human. Very few people know the distinction between
pleasure and happiness. They go on thinking that pleasure is
happiness</p><p>-- it is not. Happiness is something far superior, far more
refined.</p><p>Sex is animal, but then it is pure lust, a gratification of a bodily
need. It is physiological, biological, nothing more than that. Love is
human. Love is far higher than sex. Sex may be one part of it, and that
too, not necessarily. You can have a non-sexual relationship and a very
joyous relationship -- you can have a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

relationship, far more deep-going, far more ecstatic; and sex can be a
part of it, but only a part. There is much more in love than sex. And
whether it is a part or not, the moment your being becomes love-full, it
transforms the very nature of sexuality too. Then it is not biological,
then it is more of the nature of play. It has nothing to do with
reproduction, it is just enjoying the company of the other. One of the
dimensions can be sex, and that too, not necessarily.</p><p>And then in happiness there are many more things which animals are
absolutely incapable of enjoying: poetry, painting, music, sculpture. A
thousand and one things are there -- the whole world of art and
aesthetics. And you can see in music also, music that really belongs to
the animal part of you. Particularly the modern music, jazz and pop
music, belongs to the animal part of you. Classical music has a totally
different dimension. Beethoven or Mozart or Wagner -- they take you into
a totally different world.</p><p>And eastern classical music takes you even higher because it is part
of meditativeness. It almost touches the divine. It was born in the
temples, it was born in the monasteries. It was born through sannyasins,
not through ordinary people but through people who were tremendously
meditative. It came out of their meditation. They had heard something fo
the celestial music and they wanted to bring something to humanity.
Their music represents something celestial -- something of it, a
reflection. It is a far-away echo, but still; a reflection of the moon
is a reflection of the moon: it is a reflection but somehow it
represents the moon, gives you a glimpse of the moon.</p><p>Bliss is the highest dimension of joy. the first is pleasure -- that
is animal, the second is happiness -- that is human, and bliss is
divine.</p><p>Sex is animal, love is human, prayer is divine. In love there may be
sex, there may not be. In prayer there is no possibility of sex, is
simply disappears. Hence tantra cannot be understood by ordinary people;
they are bound to misunderstand it. It is prayer. It has nothing to do
with sex. Even making love has nothing to do with sex. When it becomes a
meditation, a prayer -- just the melting and meeting and merging of
energies in a prayerful mood. It is not even fun or play, it is</p><p>devotion.</p><p>Bliss is the goal because only in blissfulness do you touch the
highest peak of your being, you come to your total realisation. Man is a
three-storeyed building. The ground floor is animal. And it is good,
nothing is wrong in it; I am not against it, but I would like everybody
to know something of the higher. Let the lower be the base, but don't
remain confined to it. The second floor is human and the third floor is
divine.</p><p>In knowing bliss one comes to know one's godliness, one is a god. And
unless this is realised, remember: life remains unfulfilled, it remains
a deep frustration, a discontentment. When you have reached your
ultimate peak, only then is there contentment, peace, silence, a deep
satisfaction that one has arrived.</p><p>Gold has always been symbolic, both in the East and in the West. For
centuries alchemists have talked about it, and they have been very much
misunderstood because people thought that they were talking about real
god. They were talking about gold only as a metaphor.</p><p>Man can become gold, he has all the chemicals needed for that
transmutation, but those chemicals have to be mixed in the right
proportion, heated in the right way to the right degree. Only in a
mystery school is that possible. It is the world of inner chemistry. And
the moment everything inside you is put in the right place a great
harmony arises.</p><p>Ordinarily a man is like an orchestra in which there is no leader, no
guide and everybody is playing solo.</p><p>Although it is an orchestra everybody is playing solo according to
his own ideas, not bothering about others, what they are doing, not
making any effort to bring a harmony; hence the noise, hence the
craziness inside, the insanity. Almost the whole of humanity is insane.
Of course people differ in degrees: a few people are more insane and a
few are less, but a difference of degree is not much of a
difference.</p><p>Only very few people -- once in a while a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Basho,
a Jesus -- only very few people have been able to become guides of all
their elementary forces and have been able to play, not solo, but to
become part in an orchestra. These few people who have been able to
bring some accord into their beings have known the ultimate truth.</p><p>That's what is meant by gold. It is the most precious metal, hence it
became symbolic.</p><p>The man who knows what to do with all his elementary forces becomes
gold; his life becomes really precious. Each moment is so inestimably
valuable, each moment is such a gift that one cannot be thankful enough
for it. There is no way to show our gratitude to god. His gift is of
such immense proportions that we don't really deserve it. He has given
it out of his abundance.</p><p>Knowing this accord, feeling this accord one becomes blissful. And
out of that bliss arises a thankfulness towards existence. That
thankfulness is prayer.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan can come to truth only through meditation. Truth is not something that mind can know. Mind can theorise about it, but 'about' means around -- and mind goes about and about, around and around. It moves in a circle, it never reaches the centre. Its very nature is not to reach to the centre, it exists for the circumference.\nMind is needed only to relate with others. It is a method of communication. Truth is your very being. It is not a question of relating to it. It happens only when you fall into deep silence, when you forget the whole world, when the other is completely forgotten as if the other does not exist at all. In those moments of solitude and aloneness truth is revealed. It is not a conclusion of the mind but a revelation of no-mind.\nMeditation simply means turning in. Mind is always turning out, mind is basically extroversion. It has its utility -- I am not against utilising it, but I am certainly against being utilised by it. Use it as a servant, use it as a beautiful mechanism, but don't let it become your master. It is a good slave, take every care of it, but don't allow it to enslave you.\nRemember that the real master is not on the circumference, the real master is at\nthe centre. And at the centre there is only consciousness: no thoughts, no desires, no imagination. All the faculties of the mind stop functioning. You are simply alert, aware, watchful, you simply are. In that state you are truth. That is the meaning of Verity -- it is one of the most beautiful names: the state of being true.\nAnd once it is experienced it starts changing your whole life style. If you know your truth you cannot be untrue in any way. It becomes impossible. Even to be untrue to others becomes impossible.\nThe joy of being truthful is such that who would like to fall into the darkness of being untrue? The simplicity of being truthful is such that who would like to create unnecessary complexities, complications, by being untruthful?\nOne lie brings in its wake a thousand and one other lies, because you have to defend it, you have to support it -- and it cannot be defended by truth, it can only be defended by other lies. And every other lie will need in its own turn more lies. A single lie, and your whole life starts becoming untruthful, inauthentic.\nTruth needs no defence. It is very simple, it is simply so. And the man who lives in truth need not bother what he has said, what he has done. We need not go on remembering all that he has said and all that he has done. The lying person has to be continuously calculating, watching. he may say something; which goes against something else which he said before, he may do something, that may undo something else. His life becomes more and more complicated, more and more entangled. It becomes a riddle, it becomes a problem; he becomes a problem to himself and to others. And a problematic life cannot know what bliss is.\nBliss is known only by the simple, the innocent. But the way to find it is to put the mind aside and to go in a state of no-mind. Slowly slowly a few glimpses will arise, and then those gaps start becoming bigger, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthen those beautiful intervals become vaster. And then sooner or later such a state arises that even if you are in the marketplace doing the ordinary things of\nlife which are needed, your silence continues like an undercurrent; it goes on flowing. You can hear its melody, you can feel its beauty, you can taste its sweetness.\nTruth brings many gifts, but one has to open the door of meditation. Nobody can give you the truth; truth is already given to you from god himself. It is not something that has to be found anywhere else; it is already the case, it is your suchness, verity! You just have to take a few steps inwards...\nSannyas simply means this: a decision to find one's truth, a commitment that 'From this moment my life will be devoted to finding mY truth.'\nAnd remember: the truth of Buddha, the truth of Jesus or the truth of Zarathustra cannot be your truth. If you repeat Jesus or Buddha you will be living in the mind. And when you put the mind aside, naturally you put your Christianity, your Hinduism, your Mohammedanism aside because they are all part of the mind.\nThe moment you put the mind aside you have put the whole of history aside, the whole world aside. Then you are moving into your own being with no history, no past, with no society, as if you are alone on the earth, as if you are the first being on the earth, in existence.\nOnce this decision becomes a commitment... That's why I insist on sannyas, otherwise people can simply listen to me and they can meditate and they can go on living ordinarily -- there is no need to become sannyasins. And many people think 'What is the need of becoming a sannyasin? We can meditate, we can listen, we can try to understand what is happening, we can go through therapy groups...'\nBut there is a very fundamental reason; the reason is: it is a deliberate commitment, a conscious decision, so from this moment it becomes your focus of life. You have to put all that is unessential aside, and you have to put more and more energy into the inward journey.\nThe truth is not very far. It needs only one step, hence it is better not to call it a step: it is a quantum leap, a jump from mind to no-mind.\nMeditation brings many fruits. It brings truth, it brings freedom too; it brings bliss, it brings awareness, it brings immortality too. In fact it simply opens the\ndoors of all the mysteries of life. It is the golden key, the master key: with a single key you can unlock everything.\nWithout meditation nobody can live in freedom. One can be politically free, but that is not true freedom.\nIf there are many desires inside you, then those desires function like chains -- invisible chains of course, but because they are invisible they are more dangerous. Iron chains are not so dangerous because you can see them, and because you can see them they can be broken. The chains created by desires are invisible, and because you cannot see them you go on thinking you are free. But a man living in desires is not a free man, he is living in constant bondage. He is always desiring more. His greed is his imprisonment: he will live like a prisoner and die like a prisoner.\nAnd desires bring other problems too: jealousy will be there, possessiveness will be there, clinging will be there, fear will be there, competition, comparison, and between all these boundaries you cannot be free.\nUnless you are free of all these you are not free.\nThe moment desires disappear one knows freedom for the first time. Then one is untethered, then one lives moment to moment, not asking for more; on the contrary, enjoying that which is available.\nThere are only two kinds of people in the world. There are the people who are always asking for more and never enjoying that which is available. When that which they are asking for becomes available they will still be asking for more; they are not going to enjoy it either. They will be postponing their enjoyment for their whole life. Their life is nothing but a long, long postponement; it is always tomorrow. Today they have to work, today they have to earn, tomorrow they will relax and enjoy. But the tomorrow never comes, it is always today. Hence they live without knowing what life is.\nThe second category of people is of those who enjoy that which they have, not bothering about more.\nAnd the miracle is that every day they have more and more to enjoy, for two reasons. Their capacity to enjoy increases. They are constantly practising it, each moment they are enjoying. They become more skilful, they become connoisseurs\nof joy, they become very very sensitive about small nuances of pleasure.\nAll their senses become very alive, they become tremendously intelligent, and out of this intelligence, awareness, sensitivity, the next moment will be born. Of course they will be able to enjoy the next moment more than they have enjoyed this moment. Their life will be a constant process of deepening; they will be moving into depth.\nThe first category of people live horizontally. They don't know anything about depth; they have never 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nknown anything of intensity, of passion, of totality. They are always running and rushing. They are in such a hurry, it is impossible for them to enjoy anything. They are always running and rushing. They go on missing that which is surrounding them.\nThe person who lives in the moment lives a vertical life. It is a totally different dimension; he grows in depth. And the deeper you go, the higher you rise. It is just like a tree: the roots go deep in the ground and the tree goes high in the sky; the deeper the roots, the higher the tree. It is always proportionate: with small roots a tree cannot rise high in the sky -- it will fall. If the tree wants to touch the stars then it will have to reach the very hell by its roots.\nHence a real man lives in such totality that he reaches the very depths, the rockbottom of his being. And he starts touching the very stars, the ultimate heights and peaks of bliss.\nThis is freedom -- freedom to be, and freedom to be total and whole. Sannyasins have to belong to the second category.\nMeditation brings all that is valuable in life: truth, freedom, celebration. It gives your heart a dance, it makes your being full of songs; one loses all seriousness.\nSeriousness is pathological. It is an ill state of affairs, it is not healthy. The\nmeditator takes life playfully. For him the whole existence is just a beautiful dream and life is acting: do it with totality, but without any seriousness. And if you are not serious then there is never any frustration. If you succeed, good; if you fail, good. Neither failure brings misery nor success brings euphoria; one takes both things with deep equanimity. One remains undisturbed by success or failure; one remains absolutely unmoved, centered, grounded.\nMeditation makes you the center of the cyclone. Life comes and goes -- the meditator remains unaffected, even death is just a drama. Just as he enjoys life, he enjoys death; he can laugh in life, he can laugh in death.\nMeditation is the greatest miracle there is. It is the greatest gift that has been given by the awakened ones to humanity. Science has given many things, but nothing compared to meditation; and one cannot conceive that science will ever be able to give anything comparable to meditation. Up to now meditation has been the greatest gift to humanity, and it is going to remain the greatest gift forever. That can be safely predicted for the simple reason that science goes on studying the objective world; meditation gives you mastery of your subjective existence, your inner world -- and the inner is always higher than the outer.\nScience cannot be greater than the scientist, obviously: the object cannot be higher, more valuable than the observer.\nAlbert Einstein has given many great things, but nothing is more valuable than Albert Einstein himself\n-- and he remained unaware of himself. He became aware of this fact, but very late. Just before he dies he confesses to a friend \"Next time, if I come back to life, I would rather be a plumber than a physicist. I would like to live a simple life.\" But he did not know that plumbers are not living simple lives either! Life without meditation -- whether you are a plumber or a physicist makes no difference. But one thing is certain, that he became aware of the fact that he had missed something.\nThis is the right time for you, this is the age that one should start getting involved in the inner. Then there is time and there is space and there is energy to do something. So feel blessed that at the right time you are becoming a sannyasin. You need not to die feeling that you have missed.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2220","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2220 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

enjoy. But the tomorrow never comes, it is always today. Hence they live
without knowing what life is.</p><p>The second category of people is of those who enjoy that which they
have, not bothering about more.</p><p>And the miracle is that every day they have more and more to enjoy,
for two reasons. Their capacity to enjoy increases. They are constantly
practising it, each moment they are enjoying. They become more skilful,
they become connoisseurs</p><p>of joy, they become very very sensitive about small nuances of
pleasure.</p><p>All their senses become very alive, they become tremendously
intelligent, and out of this intelligence, awareness, sensitivity, the
next moment will be born. Of course they will be able to enjoy the next
moment more than they have enjoyed this moment. Their life will be a
constant process of deepening; they will be moving into depth.</p><p>The first category of people live horizontally. They don't know
anything about depth; they have never 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

running and rushing. They are in such a hurry, it is impossible for them
to enjoy anything. They are always running and rushing. They go on
missing that which is surrounding them.</p><p>The person who lives in the moment lives a vertical life. It is a
totally different dimension; he grows in depth. And the deeper you go,
the higher you rise. It is just like a tree: the roots go deep in the
ground and the tree goes high in the sky; the deeper the roots, the
higher the tree. It is always proportionate: with small roots a tree
cannot rise high in the sky -- it will fall. If the tree wants to touch
the stars then it will have to reach the very hell by its roots.</p><p>Hence a real man lives in such totality that he reaches the very
depths, the rockbottom of his being. And he starts touching the very
stars, the ultimate heights and peaks of bliss.</p><p>This is freedom -- freedom to be, and freedom to be total and whole.
Sannyasins have to belong to the second category.</p><p>Meditation brings all that is valuable in life: truth, freedom,
celebration. It gives your heart a dance, it makes your being full of
songs; one loses all seriousness.</p><p>Seriousness is pathological. It is an ill state of affairs, it is not
healthy. The</p><p>meditator takes life playfully. For him the whole existence is just a
beautiful dream and life is acting: do it with totality, but without any
seriousness. And if you are not serious then there is never any
frustration. If you succeed, good; if you fail, good. Neither failure
brings misery nor success brings euphoria; one takes both things with
deep equanimity. One remains undisturbed by success or failure; one
remains absolutely unmoved, centered, grounded.</p><p>Meditation makes you the center of the cyclone. Life comes and goes
-- the meditator remains unaffected, even death is just a drama. Just as
he enjoys life, he enjoys death; he can laugh in life, he can laugh in
death.</p><p>Meditation is the greatest miracle there is. It is the greatest gift
that has been given by the awakened ones to humanity. Science has given
many things, but nothing compared to meditation; and one cannot conceive
that science will ever be able to give anything comparable to
meditation. Up to now meditation has been the greatest gift to humanity,
and it is going to remain the greatest gift forever. That can be safely
predicted for the simple reason that science goes on studying the
objective world; meditation gives you mastery of your subjective
existence, your inner world -- and the inner is always higher than the
outer.</p><p>Science cannot be greater than the scientist, obviously: the object
cannot be higher, more valuable than the observer.</p><p>Albert Einstein has given many great things, but nothing is more
valuable than Albert Einstein himself</p><p>-- and he remained unaware of himself. He became aware of this fact,
but very late. Just before he dies he confesses to a friend "Next time,
if I come back to life, I would rather be a plumber than a physicist. I
would like to live a simple life." But he did not know that plumbers are
not living simple lives either! Life without meditation -- whether you
are a plumber or a physicist makes no difference. But one thing is
certain, that he became aware of the fact that he had missed
something.</p><p>This is the right time for you, this is the age that one should start
getting involved in the inner. Then there is time and there is space and
there is energy to do something. So feel blessed that at the right time
you are becoming a sannyasin. You need not to die feeling that you have
missed.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #11</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

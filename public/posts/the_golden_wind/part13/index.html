It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan builds his life on the sands of dreams. That's why whatsoever one tries to do, everything fails, all houses collapse. They don't have their foundation in something eternal, they are founded on the momentary.\nAnd when one house of sand falls we start making another house -- of the same material, with the same material. We never seem to learn any lesson: if one dream fails we start dreaming, another dream; if one desire is frustrated we immediately jump into another desire, another project -- but we never see that desire as such is bound to fail.\nTo desire means to go against the whole. It is an impossible task, it cannot be done. Not to desire means 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nto relax with the whole, to go with the whole, to have no desire of one's own, it\nmeans 'Whatsoever the whole wills is my will. I am not trying to achieve any individual goal.'\nThe moment you start trying to achieve an individual goal you are bound for trouble, because we are not separate from the whole, hence we can't have separate goals. The English word, idiot, is very significant in this context. Its root meaning is one who is trying to achieve something individual. He is an idiot because his failure is absolutely certain. Nobody has ever succeeded in achieving any individual goal.\nWe have to learn to be part of life, existence. We are waves in the ocean: we cannot have individual goals. And there is no need to at all. And because of the individual goals, every day there is frustration, every day there is misery.\nSannyas means seeing, the whole absurdity of our dreams and desires then trying to find a rocklike phenomenon on which a house can be built. and that rock is found only in meditation because meditation moans a state of no-thought, no desire, no dream. Suddenly you are on solid ground. Now each moment is going to be a blissful experience and each moment is going to be a victory -- not yours of course, because you are no more.\nWe are victorious when we are not, and when we are, we are failures. Meditation means coming to know that we don't exist as separate entities, that we are not islands; we are part of the infinite continent --\ncall it god, call it truth, the ultimate, the absolute or whatsoever name you choose.\nLao Tzu says 'It has no name, hence I will call it tao.' It has no name, so you can choose your own, or you can choose some name used by Jesus, Lao Tzu, Buddha, Krishna... but the basic secret of being victorious is disappearing totally as an individual. And the moment there are no desires, no dreams, no thoughts, how can you be? Who are you except a bundle of desires, thoughts and dreams?\nTo be a beloved disciple is the greatest gift of god. There cannot be anything greater than that. The\n'word 'disciple' comes from the same root as discipline; it means the capacity to learn, the openness to learn, the availability to learn. Very few people are capable of learning. Their knowledge hinders; they already know too much. They have\nalready arrived at some conclusions, hence they are always listening through their conclusions. They are closed.\nComing to a conclusion means that your mind is closed; on a certain subject you have decided that this is the end, there is no more to it. That means conclusion. A real disciple, a learner, never concludes. He remains always open, he never comes to a full stop. He knows nothing of the full stop, nothing like a full stop exists in his consciousness. His consciousness is always an ongoing phenomenon. He is always learning. There is so much to learn that only stupid people can conclude.\nThe wiser a person becomes, the more aware he becomes of how little he knows; the more stupid a person is, the more certain he is about his knowledge. You can judge the stupidity by the certainty. The stupids are very fanatical people because they have arrived at ultimate conclusions. And not only have they arrived for themselves, they have arrived for everybody. They want to impose their conclusions on everybody, on the whole world. They think they are being very compassionate to people.\nYou must have come across Jehovah witnesses or Hari Krishna people. These are the representatives of the most stupid fanatical types. They have arrived at every conclusion, they know everything; there is nothing more for them to know. Now their whole work is to force their knowledge on others, whether you are willing to accept it or not.\nSocrates in his last days said 'I know only one thing, that I know nothing. And that was the day he became the greatest wise man the West has yet known. That day he became part of the great company of the Buddhas. That day he was no more a philosopher, that day he became awakened, enlightened.\nA disciple is one who functions through a state of not-knowing. Whatsoever he knows is only hypothetical and he is always ready to change it -- he is not a fanatic. He loves truth so much that he cannot decide anything about truth in a hasty way. His love is so great, he is not in a hurry. He knows truth is vast\n-- how can I be decisive about it? At the most I can say that this much I feel -- maybe, perhaps -- is right.'\nOne of the greatest men the East has produced was Mahavira. He used to start every sentence with a\n'perhaps '. It was becoming almost annoying to his disciples, irritating. He would always start every statement with a 'perhaps'. But I can see his point. This is the non -- fanatical person. If you ask him 'Is there a god?' he will not say yes or no ; he will say 'Perhaps -- perhaps yes, perhaps no.' He will not give you a conclusion. He will help you to enquire, he will push you into the enquiry.\nThat's the function of the master: to push you into the enquiry. He does not give you ready-made conclusions. He simply makes you aware of the tremendous questions of life, of the tremendous mysteries 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nof existence. The function of the master is to make you aware of the mysteries which are almost unknowable. And the function of the disciple is to be able to go along with the master, totally, fully -- and he can go totally and fully only if he is not carrying any conclusions already. If he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan he cannot be a disciple.\nDisciplehood does not happen through the head, it happens through the heart. The head is full of conclusions, the heart is always innocent and always ready to know. The heart is always a child and the head is always an old man. The head is never young, remember, and the heart is never old.\nTo be a beloved disciple means to live in the heart, to live through the heart, to remain fresh, young, open, available, to be capable of dropping all conclusions and knowledge and scriptures. The disciple has to be courageous enough to burn all the scriptures -- I mean symbolically, not literally -- and just to live out of love, not out of logic.. Then life becomes an infinite wonder, then each moment brings new surprises, then one is always in a state of awe.\nAnd to remain in that state continuously is ecstasy, is bliss, is benediction.\nMan cannot get out of misery unless he realises something in him which is deathless. Death is the root cause of all our fears -- and we are surrounded by death. Whenever you see somebody dying you are reminded of your death. Never ask for whom the bell tolls -- it always tolls for you.\nPeople don't like to talk about death. It is not thought to be polite, mannerly, cultured, to talk about death, because it reminds everybody of his own death which is always there, hanging like a naked sword from a very thin thread: it can fall any moment! Just a little breeze is enough and it can fall on you. How can you enjoy life? How can you live totally when death is always following you like a shadow? It contaminates all your joys.\nIt is a well-known fact, observed almost all over the world by all the researchers, that people are afraid of love for the simple reason that when they move into love-making a moment of deep orgasmic joy comes when they suddenly experience themselves as being close to death, melting, disappearing, and they become frightened, they become frozen.\nIt is one of the causes why millions of women never achieve orgasm; they hold back, they remain cold.\nOf course they have rationalised it in many ways -- that that is good, ladylike. And millions of men suffer from premature ejaculation for the simple reason; the same reason they are so afraid, and out of fear they cannot attain to a mature ejaculation. Before the orgasm happens their energy is released. It is a way of avoiding the orgasm, it is a very subtle strategy. Women become frigid, men either start having immature ejaculations or at a later stage of life they become impotent. And now this is a perfectly well-known fact that very rarely does a man become impotent, very rarely -- one man in a thousand, maybe -- but millions suffer from the idea of impotency. The idea is their own, imposed on themselves. And the reason is very deep, it is beyond psychology to help.\nOnly meditation can help, because only meditation can make you aware that you are deathless. In fact, even if you want to die you cannot, there is no way to die. You were never born and you will never die. You were before birth and you will remain after death. Birth is only entering into a certain body and death is leaving that certain body -- but you are eternal.\nTo experience this eternity, this deathlessness, becomes the foundation of a totally new life, a new life-style: fearless, without misery, without anxiety, a life which is orgasmic -- not only in the sexual sense...\nbecause that is only one of the dimensions of orgasm. There are many dimensions of being orgasmic.\nA really orgasmic person knows many dimensions of orgasm. Looking at a beautiful sunset he is in an orgasm -- an absolutely non-sexual orgasm. Watching the sky full of stars he goes into an orgasm; that orgasm has nothing to do with sex. Listening to music or dancing or just sitting silently doing nothing, resting in oneself, there is great joy; all the cells of the body are dancing, rejoicing.\nA person starts living bliss each moment if only one experience becomes possible: that of deathlessness.\nHence the East has never bothered much about psychology, for the simple reason that the eastern understanding has been this, that ninety-nine point nine per cent of psychological problems are not basically psychological, they are rooted in spiritual ignorance. Once that ignorance disappears, those problems disappear. Western psychology goes on analysing. That analysis is simply absurd, it goes on and on. No psychoanalysis is ever complete -- cannot be -- it is moving in a vicious circle. You analyse one thing, there is still another thing; you analyse that and then a third thing bubbles up, because the centre of the problem is never touched, the root is never cut. You go on pruning the leaves and new leaves go on coming. The foliage in fact becomes far thicker than it was before.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPsychologists suffer more from psychological problems than anybody else for the simple reason that they know how to prune the leaves and how to cut the branches, so their problems become more and more thick and bigger and stronger, and the roots are intact, the roots are underground, hidden...\nOrdinarily psychologists don't think that meditation can do anything because they are not aware of the roots -- and meditation's whole function is to cut the roots. Once the roots are cut the tree withers away by itself.\nLove makes man an ocean, an infinity. It gives a kind of unboundedness. It helps you to know that you are not defined by any limits, that you are not confined by the body or the mind, that you are not confined at all, that you are as vast as the\nsky; in fact, even the sky is not the limit. There is no limit to you.\nThis is the beauty of love, it makes you aware of vastness. That is the first experience of godliness. And if the first experience happens, then other things follow in their own time. The first experience triggers a process. Then everything follows, then you have not to do anything else. Just one thing you have to do, that is to start with love.\nLove as much as you can, as many people as possible -- not only people, but animals, birds, trees, stars, rocks. When I say love, I mean become loving. Be love, so whatsoever you do, it should have the flavor of love, whatsoever you touch you should touch with love, whatsoever you say you should say it with love. In the beginning it is hard because we are so unconscious.\nA man came to meet a great Zen master, Lin Chi. He pushed open the door, threw off his shoes and went in. The master was watching and a few disciples were sitting with him. The man touched the master's feet, the master said, \"Don't touch my feet, because I will have to take a bath!\" The man said, \"What are you saying? Why should you have to take a bath? I am not impure or dirty or anything.\" The master said, \"You are! In the way you opened the door there was anger, in the way you threw your shoes there was anger. You misbehaved with the shoes, you misbehaved with the door -- which have not done anything wrong to you.\nSo your bowing down to me is just formality, deep down you are full of anger. Close your eyes and see!\"\nThe man had to close his eyes and he could see it was so.\nThe master said, \"If you see that what I am saying is right, then go and first bow down to your shoes, ask forgiveness.\" The man said, \"What are you saying? Are you mad or something? -- bowing down to the shoes, my own shoes and asking their forgiveness? They are dead things!\"\nThe master said, \"If you could be angry with them and you never thought that you were being angry with dead things, why can you not ask their forgiveness? Unless you ask forgiveness from the shoes and the doors I am not going to even talk to you. Simply get out, be lost!\"\nThe man could see the point. He went and bowed down to the shoes, to the door.\nAnd later on he came back with tears in his eyes and he said to the master, \"Never in my life have I felt so happy. At first bowing down to my shoes I felt very embarrassed. But when I really bowed down, I was immensely happy.\nSomething inside me, the whole climate, immediately changed, as if suddenly spring had come and flowers had bloomed.\"\nWatch your life. Don't be in any way rude to anything, not even dead things, because in fact nothing is dead. If god permeates everything then nothing is dead. A rock is only a soul very fast asleep, so fast asleep that it is not even breathing, in a coma. But it is as alive as anybody else.\nBe love... and you will know what sannyas is. Sannyas is an experience of love, and love brings you to the oceanic, to the unbounded, to the vast. The door of the temple opens, and without your knowing suddenly you enter the shrine.\nNo churches, temples and mosques can help you. Only this door I am talking is the real door to the real temple where you will find the real god.\nLove simply moans surrendering the ego. Don't live any more as an ego, Drop the idea that you are separate, forget completely that you are a different entity. We are rooted in existence, we are one with it, part of it ; we live through it, it lives through us. We are intertwined, we are interdependent. You cannot exist without the whole, and the whole also cannot exist without you. If it could exist without you it would have existed without you. Just that you are is proof enough that existence needs you in some way, you are fulfilling a certain need.\nEven the smallest blade of grass is as needed as the greatest star. There is no hierarchy in existence.\nNobody is higher and nobody is lower, and nobody is more needed and nobody is less needed. All is needed because existence means the togetherness of all. We all contribute something to existence, and existence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ngoes on giving to us everything that we need.\nOnce this interdependence is understood life starts having a new kind of beauty and grace. Then there are no problems. Problems are created by the ego; because the ego is a false entity it creates problems. It lives in anxiety, fear, always afraid, always cautious: something may go wrong...\nThe moment the ego is dropped nothing can go wrong. Nothing ever goes wrong: all is perfectly right as it is. That's exactly the meaning of god -- that all is good as it is.\nSamarpan (her name) defines sannyas. Samarpan means surrender, let-go. Those two words 'let', 'go', are my whole message.\nThe Golden Wind Chapter #14\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3123","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_wind/>The Golden Wind</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3123 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Wind/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

capacity to learn, the openness to learn, the availability to learn.
Very few people are capable of learning. Their knowledge hinders; they
already know too much. They have</p><p>already arrived at some conclusions, hence they are always listening
through their conclusions. They are closed.</p><p>Coming to a conclusion means that your mind is closed; on a certain
subject you have decided that this is the end, there is no more to it.
That means conclusion. A real disciple, a learner, never concludes. He
remains always open, he never comes to a full stop. He knows nothing of
the full stop, nothing like a full stop exists in his consciousness. His
consciousness is always an ongoing phenomenon. He is always learning.
There is so much to learn that only stupid people can conclude.</p><p>The wiser a person becomes, the more aware he becomes of how little
he knows; the more stupid a person is, the more certain he is about his
knowledge. You can judge the stupidity by the certainty. The stupids are
very fanatical people because they have arrived at ultimate conclusions.
And not only have they arrived for themselves, they have arrived for
everybody. They want to impose their conclusions on everybody, on the
whole world. They think they are being very compassionate to people.</p><p>You must have come across Jehovah witnesses or Hari Krishna people.
These are the representatives of the most stupid fanatical types. They
have arrived at every conclusion, they know everything; there is nothing
more for them to know. Now their whole work is to force their knowledge
on others, whether you are willing to accept it or not.</p><p>Socrates in his last days said 'I know only one thing, that I know
nothing. And that was the day he became the greatest wise man the West
has yet known. That day he became part of the great company of the
Buddhas. That day he was no more a philosopher, that day he became
awakened, enlightened.</p><p>A disciple is one who functions through a state of not-knowing.
Whatsoever he knows is only hypothetical and he is always ready to
change it -- he is not a fanatic. He loves truth so much that he cannot
decide anything about truth in a hasty way. His love is so great, he is
not in a hurry. He knows truth is vast</p><p>-- how can I be decisive about it? At the most I can say that this
much I feel -- maybe, perhaps -- is right.'</p><p>One of the greatest men the East has produced was Mahavira. He used
to start every sentence with a</p><p>'perhaps '. It was becoming almost annoying to his disciples,
irritating. He would always start every statement with a 'perhaps'. But
I can see his point. This is the non -- fanatical person. If you ask him
'Is there a god?' he will not say yes or no ; he will say 'Perhaps --
perhaps yes, perhaps no.' He will not give you a conclusion. He will
help you to enquire, he will push you into the enquiry.</p><p>That's the function of the master: to push you into the enquiry. He
does not give you ready-made conclusions. He simply makes you aware of
the tremendous questions of life, of the tremendous mysteries

mysteries which are almost unknowable. And the function of the disciple
is to be able to go along with the master, totally, fully -- and he can
go totally and fully only if he is not carrying any conclusions already.
If he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan he cannot be a
disciple.</p><p>Disciplehood does not happen through the head, it happens through the
heart. The head is full of conclusions, the heart is always innocent and
always ready to know. The heart is always a child and the head is always
an old man. The head is never young, remember, and the heart is never
old.</p><p>To be a beloved disciple means to live in the heart, to live through
the heart, to remain fresh, young, open, available, to be capable of
dropping all conclusions and knowledge and scriptures. The disciple
<em>has</em> to be courageous enough to burn all the scriptures -- I
mean symbolically, not literally -- and just to live out of love, not
out of logic.. Then life becomes an infinite wonder, then each moment
brings new surprises, then one is always in a state of awe.</p><p>And to remain in that state continuously is ecstasy, is bliss, is
benediction.</p><p>Man cannot get out of misery unless he realises something in him
which is deathless. Death is the root cause of all our fears -- and we
are surrounded by death. Whenever you see somebody dying you are
reminded of your death. Never ask for whom the bell tolls -- it always
tolls for you.</p><p>People don't like to talk about death. It is not thought to be
polite, mannerly, cultured, to talk about death, because it reminds
everybody of his own death which is always there, hanging like a naked
sword from a very thin thread: it can fall any moment! Just a little
breeze is enough and it can fall on you. How can you enjoy life? How can
you live totally when death is always following you like a shadow? It
contaminates all your joys.</p><p>It is a well-known fact, observed almost all over the world by all
the researchers, that people are afraid of love for the simple reason
that when they move into love-making a moment of deep orgasmic joy comes
when they suddenly experience themselves as being close to death,
melting, disappearing, and they become frightened, they become
frozen.</p><p>It is one of the causes why millions of women never achieve orgasm;
they hold back, they remain cold.</p><p>Of course they have rationalised it in many ways -- that that is
good, ladylike. And millions of men suffer from premature ejaculation
for the simple reason; the same reason they are so afraid, and out of
fear they cannot attain to a mature ejaculation. Before the orgasm
happens their energy is released. It is a way of avoiding the orgasm, it
is a very subtle strategy. Women become frigid, men either start having
immature ejaculations or at a later stage of life they become impotent.
And now this is a perfectly well-known fact that very rarely does a man
become impotent, very rarely -- one man in a thousand, maybe -- but
millions suffer from the idea of impotency. The idea is their own,
imposed on themselves. And the reason is very deep, it is beyond
psychology to help.</p><p>Only meditation can help, because only meditation can make you aware
that you are deathless. In fact, even if you want to die you cannot,
there is no way to die. You were never born and you will never die. You
were before birth and you will remain after death. Birth is only
entering into a certain body and death is leaving that certain body --
but you are eternal.</p><p>To experience this eternity, this deathlessness, becomes the
foundation of a totally new life, a new life-style: fearless, without
misery, without anxiety, a life which is orgasmic -- not only in the
sexual sense...</p><p>because that is only one of the dimensions of orgasm. There are many
dimensions of being orgasmic.</p><p>A really orgasmic person knows many dimensions of orgasm. Looking at
a beautiful sunset he is in an orgasm -- an absolutely non-sexual
orgasm. Watching the sky full of stars he goes into an orgasm; that
orgasm has nothing to do with sex. Listening to music or dancing or just
sitting silently doing nothing, resting in oneself, there is great joy;
all the cells of the body are dancing, rejoicing.</p><p>A person starts living bliss each moment if only one experience
becomes possible: that of deathlessness.</p><p>Hence the East has never bothered much about psychology, for the
simple reason that the eastern understanding has been this, that
ninety-nine point nine per cent of psychological problems are not
basically psychological, they are rooted in spiritual ignorance. Once
that ignorance disappears, those problems disappear. Western psychology
goes on analysing. That analysis is simply absurd, it goes on and on. No
psychoanalysis is ever complete -- cannot be -- it is moving in a
vicious circle. You analyse one thing, there is still another thing; you
analyse that and then a third thing bubbles up, because the centre of
the problem is never touched, the root is never cut. You go on pruning
the leaves and new leaves go on coming. The foliage in fact becomes far
thicker than it was before.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

else for the simple reason that they know how to prune the leaves and
how to cut the branches, so their problems become more and more thick
and bigger and stronger, and the roots are intact, the roots are
underground, hidden...</p><p>Ordinarily psychologists don't think that meditation can do anything
because they are not aware of the roots -- and meditation's whole
function is to cut the roots. Once the roots are cut the tree withers
away by itself.</p><p>Love makes man an ocean, an infinity. It gives a kind of
unboundedness. It helps you to know that you are not defined by any
limits, that you are not confined by the body or the mind, that you are
not confined at all, that you are as vast as the</p><p>sky; in fact, even the sky is not the limit. There is no limit to
you.</p><p>This is the beauty of love, it makes you aware of vastness. That is
the first experience of godliness. And if the first experience happens,
then other things follow in their own time. The first experience
triggers a process. Then everything follows, then you have not to do
anything else. Just one thing you have to do, that is to start with
love.</p><p>Love as much as you can, as many people as possible -- not only
people, but animals, birds, trees, stars, rocks. When I say love, I mean
become loving. Be love, so whatsoever you do, it should have the flavor
of love, whatsoever you touch you should touch with love, whatsoever you
say you should say it with love. In the beginning it is hard because we
are so unconscious.</p><p>A man came to meet a great Zen master, Lin Chi. He pushed open the
door, threw off his shoes and went in. The master was watching and a few
disciples were sitting with him. The man touched the master's feet, the
master said, "Don't touch my feet, because I will have to take a bath!"
The man said, "What are you saying? Why should you have to take a bath?
I am not impure or dirty or anything." The master said, "You are! In the
way you opened the door there was anger, in the way you threw your shoes
there was anger. You misbehaved with the shoes, you misbehaved with the
door -- which have not done anything wrong to you.</p><p>So your bowing down to me is just formality, deep down you are full
of anger. Close your eyes and see!"</p><p>The man had to close his eyes and he could see it was so.</p><p>The master said, "If you see that what I am saying is right, then go
and first bow down to your shoes, ask forgiveness." The man said, "What
are you saying? Are you mad or something? -- bowing down to the shoes,
my own shoes and asking their forgiveness? They are dead things!"</p><p>The master said, "If you could be angry with them and you never
thought that you were being angry with dead things, why can you not ask
their forgiveness? Unless you ask forgiveness from the shoes and the
doors I am not going to even talk to you. Simply get out, be lost!"</p><p>The man could see the point. He went and bowed down to the shoes, to
the door.</p><p>And later on he came back with tears in his eyes and he said to the
master, "Never in my life have I felt so happy. At first bowing down to
my shoes I felt very embarrassed. But when I really bowed down, I was
immensely happy.</p><p>Something inside me, the whole climate, immediately changed, as if
suddenly spring had come and flowers had bloomed."</p><p>Watch your life. Don't be in any way rude to anything, not even dead
things, because in fact nothing is dead. If god permeates everything
then nothing is dead. A rock is only a soul very fast asleep, so fast
asleep that it is not even breathing, in a coma. But it is as alive as
anybody else.</p><p>Be love... and you will know what sannyas is. Sannyas is an
experience of love, and love brings you to the oceanic, to the
unbounded, to the vast. The door of the temple opens, and without your
knowing suddenly you enter the shrine.</p><p>No churches, temples and mosques can help you. Only this door I am
talking is the real door to the real temple where you will find the real
god.</p><p>Love simply moans surrendering the ego. Don't live any more as an
ego, Drop the idea that you are separate, forget completely that you are
a different entity. We are rooted in existence, we are one with it, part
of it ; we live through it, it lives through us. We are intertwined, we
are interdependent. You cannot exist without the whole, and the whole
also cannot exist without you. If it could exist without you it would
have existed without you. Just that you <em>are</em> is proof enough
that existence needs you in some way, you are fulfilling a certain
need.</p><p>Even the smallest blade of grass is as needed as the greatest star.
There is no hierarchy in existence.</p><p>Nobody is higher and nobody is lower, and nobody is more needed and
nobody is less needed. <em>All</em> is needed because existence means
the togetherness of all. We all contribute something to existence, and
existence 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

of beauty and grace. Then there are no problems. Problems are created by
the ego; because the ego is a false entity it creates problems. It lives
in anxiety, fear, always afraid, always cautious: something may go
wrong...</p><p>The moment the ego is dropped nothing can go wrong. Nothing ever goes
wrong: all is perfectly right as it is. That's exactly the meaning of
god -- that all is good as it is.</p><p>Samarpan (her name) defines sannyas. Samarpan means surrender,
let-go. Those two words 'let', 'go', are my whole message.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #14</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

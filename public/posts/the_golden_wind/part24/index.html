It is for reference purposes only.]\nMoses is one of the most beautiful names; it has three meanings and all are significant.\nThe first is the saved one, because Moses was saved from water. And the second meaning is delivered by god.\nUnless god saves you there is no way to ba saved. Man is helpless, and to understand it is of great significance. The deliverance is through grace, not by our effort. What can we do? Our efforts are bound to be very tiny and our efforts will come out of our ignorance, out of our confusion. They are bound to create more confusion, they cannot lead us beyond confusion. Hence it is through the grace of god that one is saved.\nAll that is needed on our part is to be in a let-go, to allow him to save us. That is the trouble: very few people allow god to save them. They resist, they struggle, they fight. You have been struggling with me for so long!\nI was dying to see your face here! And you were hiding and hiding. But now there is no way -- I am going to save you!\nAnd the third meaning is servant of god. Once you are saved you have to serve!\nThere are millions of Christians -- they are only so-called Christians. They go to church but that is only a Sunday affair. It is a kind of sociality. It is good, it is helpful in many ways, because it is the most ancient kind of rotary club -- the church -- where all good people meet and praise each other and say nice things to each other and everybody feels good. But they are not Christians.\nTo be a Christian, really a Christian, one needs to be a Christ -- less than that won't do. Hence Nietzsche was right when he said that the first and the last Christian died on the cross two thousand years ago. His emphasis was on the first and the last. Of course he himself was a madman, but sometimes mad people have great insights which the so-called sane people go on missing. He had tremendous intuitive energy. In fact he had too much of it and could not manage it, could not control it, could not be a master of it.\nHad he been a meditator he would have become a Christ. He had all the potential but he remained a thinker. And that is the calamity that has happened in the West\n-- and it has persisted for thousands of years now -- that all brilliant people become confined to the world of thought.\nFriedrich Nietzsche or Ludwig Wittgenstein or Bertrand Russell or Jean-Paul Sartre -- these people have the potential but don't know what to do with it; they don't know how to transcend the mind. And only through transcendence can that potential be used, otherwise it is going to drive you crazy. That's what happened to Nietzsche. It is as if you give a one-hundred-watt bulb a one-thousand-watt voltage; it is bound to go crazy.\nThe energy that could have become a breakthrough became a breakdown. Nietzsche needed a master, he needed a Buddha, he needed a Christ. And he felt the need. For his whole life he was continuously thinking of Christ. In fact he was haunted by the idea of Christ, so much so that he became antagonistic to Christ. It became almost a torture. To avoid it he became anti-Christ. When he\nbecame mad he even started signing his name \"Anti-Christ, Friedrich Nietzsche.\" First he would write \"anti-Christ\" and then \"Friedrich Nietzsche\". \"Friedrich Nietzsche\" became secondary; his antagonism to Christ became more essential to his being. That was just resistance. He felt a great pull towards the man but he had also a great ego.\nSo whenever there were some moments when he was not functioning like an ego, some moment of rest and relaxation. One cannot be an egoist for twenty- four hours a day; it is too hard a work -- sometimes one has to relax. Those are the moments when the windows open. And in those moments he had tremendous insights.\nThis is one of his great insights, that the first and last Christian died on the cross two thousand years before. He is saying all these Christians are bogus, false. They are simply paying lip-service, their heart is not with Christ.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo be a sannyasin means to become totally involved with the phenomenon of being a Christ or a Buddha\n-- which are the same thing. To put it exactly, it simply means becoming aware, alert; hence Jesus continuously says to his disciples, \"Beware!\" Beware means be aware.\nThose two words contain his whole teaching and those two words contain the teaching of all the buddhas. Be blissful and be aware. They come together: if you are blissful you will be aware; if you are aware you will be blissful -- they are two sides of the same coin.\nMan is mind, and mind can never be peaceful. In all the languages we have such expressions and phrases as peace of mind, mental peace, peaceful mind -- they are all wrong.\nJoshua Liebman has written a famous book, but the title is wrong, and from that very point he starts going wrong. PEACE OF MIND is the title of the book -- and he never thinks twice about it, about what he is saying. But that is what the western approach is. The West has always thought that you can achieve peace through the mind. That's where East differs totally.\nThrough the mind there is no possibility of peace. You have to transcend mind, you have to go beyond mind. If you live in the mind you will live in noise. It can be lessened but the difference will only be of degree . So there are more noisy minds and less noisy minds, but they are both noisy.\nMind cannot be without noise -- that is impossible. Mind means thoughts. You can arrange them in a beautiful way but they are still there, and they will make a noise -- howsoever skilfully arranged. Mind cannot have peace.\nPeace is divine, it is not human. Peace means absence of all mental processes: no thought, no desire, no imagination, no memory -- as if the whole mind has ceased completely. And then suddenly you know who you are and you know what this existence is all about.\nIt is not that the mind is not useful, it can be used, but it can be used only be a master. And the master is one who knows how to transcend it.\nOnce you know the ladder that goes beyond the mind you are a master. Then whenever you want to use it you can use it and whenever you don't want to use it you can simply put it aside. Right now you may go on saying \"Please stop\" It is not going to listen to you. In fact the more you try to stop it, the more the mind will go berserk. It will show its power to you, saying 'Who are you?' The servant has become the master --\nand whenever a servant becomes a master, he is a very bad master.\nMeditation simply means putting things in their right places. Mind is a mechanism; you are not the mind. You are consciousness, and you can become conscious of the mind. Mind becomes just an object of your consciousness. You are a mirror. You can mirror and reflect everything in the mind, outside the mind.\nThey are all objects in front of you; you are pure subjectivity. This is the whole definition of sannyas, that you are consciousness. And this is the whole effort here, to help you to go beyond mind. And it is not difficult.\nThe most difficult thing is to live in the mind and to make an effort to be peaceful. That will be just superficial peace; a very thin layer of peace can be spread, but deep down there will be a volcano and it can erupt any moment. A slight provocation is enough and all peace is lost.\nBut if you know how to go beyond it, then there is no problem at all: you can come into the mind, you can go out of the mind. Peace is never of the mind, peace is a state of no-mind, hence I call it divine, not human. A peaceful man is a messenger of god. He is no more himself, he exists only on behalf of god.\nMeditation is our true home. Without it we are homeless. A man without meditation is without shelter.\nHe exists just like driftwood, he is accidental. He goes on moving from one event to another event, because one has to keep oneself somehow occupied. otherwise life is boring, meaningless and one becomes scared.\nSo one goes on moving and goes on doing thing, which are not really essential at all, but one has to do them otherwise one can see the emptiness inside, and that is very scary. Without meditation you are bound to remain empty. You can go on stuffing yourself with all kinds of stupidities; they will never make you feel fulfilled.\nMeditation is the only way to become fulfilled, to know the innermost core of your being which is already perfect, which needs no perfection, which is already overflowing with joy and peace and love.\nMeditation simply makes you aware of that which is already inside you. It is a way of awakening to one's own self. And the moment you know it you have found the home; then you are no more homeless. Then you are rooted in existence; then you know that you are not just a driftwood, then you know that you are not accidental. Then you know that you are part of a divine existence, of an organic unity of the whole.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo experience it is to become holy, to know the whole is to become holy. And to know oneself as part of the whole, an intrinsic part of the whole, brings great joy because the most significant thing in man's life is to know that he is needed by existence, that he is not useless.\nJean-Paul Sartre says 'Man is a useless passion.' That simply shows he has not known meditation at all.\nWithout meditation man certainly is a useless passion but with meditation man is neither useless nor a passion. Man is tremendously significant an d is compassion, not passion at all. Passion rises to new heights and becomes compassion, it becomes love.\n[A young Italian man has opted to keep his original name, Ganesh, as part of his sannyas name. Osho prefixes it with 'anand', then goes on to explain that Ganesh is the name of a mythological Hindu god.]\nGanesh is not a historical person, but it is far more significant than any historical person can ever be. It is a metaphor, it is very poetic. It has to be decoded, it carries a great message.\nGanesh is half man and half animal. This is the first thing to be understood, that no man is born as a fully grown-up man; every man is born half animal and half man. Hence the constant duality, the conflict in man: a pull towards animality and also a pull towards god, divinity. And man is torn apart; he lives in anguish. That is his anguish, his anxiety: What to do, where to go?\nHis lower being is always gravitating towards the past -- that is the animal -- and his potential is always hankering for a chance to grow -- that is man's future, his hope. Ganesh represents both; he is half man, half elephant.\nThis situation has to be changed. And one cannot go back, one cannot become an animal again, because there is no possibility of going back. Whatsoever you have known you cannot forget and whatsoever you have experienced is part of you; you cannot undo whatsoever you have done. Hence there is no going back, you cannot move backwards in time, you can only go forwards. But the pull of the past is great because the past is great; the future is only a possibility and the past has happened.\nHence if you look at Ganesh the animal is very heavy. It is the head part -- Ganesh has the head of an elephant. It is the head, the mind that is full of the past and very heavy, naturally. Just think of a man with an elephant's head. It is a miracle how he manages to sit -- he will fall down, he cannot carry that much load. He should be standing on his head!\nThere is another beautiful metaphor. If you look at the statue of Ganesh he is riding on a rat' Now the head is of an elephant; the man is top-heavy, carrying a mountain, and riding on a rat. The rat represents logic because logic is nothing but continuous hair-splitting, chopping. That's what the rat goes on doing, continuously cutting things. Whatsoever comes in front of the rat it starts cutting it. And that's what logic is.\nIn Indian mythology the rat represents logic. The head rides on logic, the head lives on logic, it goes on becoming bigger and bigger. The more logical you are, the more powerful and heavy and destructive your head becomes. One has to drop the head, one has to drop logic; one has to learn ways which can make one headless.\nThe whole methodology of sannyas is to help you cut your head. With the head gone the whole past disappears. You become light, you become very weightless. You can fly, your heart has wings. Your head is just like a rock, it cannot fly -- and to reach god you need wings. And you don't need logic, you need love.\nLove is creative, logic is destructive. Logic means doubt, love means trust.\nSo try to understand this. I don't know who has given you the name... Some Hindu fool? -- Nimkoroli Baba. -- Some Hindu fool, certainly. But you wanted to keep it so I will try to dismantle you, because your head will have to be chopped off!\nCarrying an elephant's head is dangerous. And the poor rat -- he has to be relieved, released. I have kept your name just so that I can go on remembering what has to be done with you!\nMarion is a very beautiful but strange name. It is a paradoxical name.\nIt has two meanings. The first meaning is bitter grace and the second meaning is living fragrance. On the surface one cannot see how they are related. How can they be related? Bitter grace and living fragrance seem to be totally different\nwords. But they are related very deep down.\nGrace is bitter because you have to drop your identity. That's why it is bitter. You have to drop your ego, you have to drop your personality. You have to go through a kind of death, only then does your real life begin. Unless you die, god is not; when you die, god is. Hence it is a bitter medicine.\nBuddha used to say that the journey to truth begins in bitterness and ends in sweetness. That's why many 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npeople never start the journey -- because it is so bitter they become scared. And their logical mind says 'If it is so bitter even in the beginning, how much more bitter it will be when you have reached the goal? If the first step is so bitter just think of the last step. And then it will be very difficult even to come back; you may have gone too far. Better, don't take the first step.'\nSo the mind does not allow people to take the first step because it is bitter. But the ultimate flowering is a great sweetness, it is living fragrance. The journey begins in death and ends in abundant life.\nJesus said to Nicodemus 'Unless you are reborn, unless you die as you are and are born again, you cannot enter into my kingdom of god.' Nicodemus never returned to him. He was a professor in the university and he came in the night when nobody was there. He could not even gather the courage to come in the day. He was a rabbi too, a well-known scholar -- what would people think of him going to this madman, Jesus?\nSo in the night when nobody was there he came, hidden. The first statement of Jesus was enough to stop him; he was not ready to pay that much of a price. And Jesus made it clear from the very beginning, 'Unless you are ready to die, forget all about it; you cannot enter into my kingdom of god, you cannot be a fellow pilgrim of mine -- it is impossible. The ego will have to be dropped.'\nDrop the ego, howsoever bitter it is, howsoever painful it is, and you will be\ntremendously rewarded.\nMeditation sharpens your brilliance. Ordinarily your sword is rusty. You have never cared about it, you have not even taken it out of its sheath. And it needs constant sharpening, otherwise it is not even useful in cutting vegetables' And it has great work to do -- it has to kill you! That's what sannyas is all about: cutting your head-off with your own hands. It is real suicide. It is not of the body, it is the suicide of the ego -- and the ego is very subtle and very cunning. Unless you are sharp enough it will go deceiving you. You throw it out from one door and it will enter from another. And it is so cunning that it can even come in the name of humbleness.\nYou can watch the so-called humble people and you can see their egos. They are egoistic about their humbleness, they are egoistic about their simplicity, egoistic about their saintliness, even egoistic about their egolessness.\nA man without ego is neither egoistic nor egoless. Both are dropped. He is simply there. To create that state is very great intelligence is needed. Mind is not enough, only meditation can help.\nSo concentrate on meditation. Make it a point that this is the topmost priority in your life, everything else is secondary. I don't say anything else to my sannyasins, all that I want them to do is to become meditators, and everything else follows of its own accord. Freedom comes, bliss comes, peace comes, celebration comes, virtue comes, transformation comes, and ultimately the experience of god.\nBecome an image of meditation, become meditation. Walk in meditation, sit in meditation, eat in meditation, sleep in meditation. Let the flavour of meditation spread all over your life -- breathe in, breathe out, but meditation continues.\nMeditation simply means an awareness of all that is happening. That which is happening outside -- that is the outermost circle of your life. Then that which is being done by your body -- that is the second concentric circle, closer to you. Then the third concentric circle is that which is done by your mind. And then the fourth is that which is done by your feelings and emotions. And within these four concentric circles is your centre, the fifth.\nIf you become aware of all that is going on, sooner or later you will become centred at the centre and you will be able to see the whole panorama, the whole\ndrama of the outer world, of physical activity, of psychological activity, of emotional activity. And when you are able to see all this you become free of it because immediately you come to know that you are the seer, you are not the doer. That is the greatest revolution in life, when this shift happens, that you are no more a doer but just a seer, a witness. Than one becomes an image of meditation -- a Buddha, a Christ, a Zarathustra.\nMeditation releases great creativity. It is an explosion; all your seeds start sprouting. For the first time you see how much potential you were carrying within yourself: a great garden with so many flowers, such beautiful bushes and trees and so many birds singing... a whole paradise! But we are not ordinarily aware of it. We are completely closed, we have not opened up; we are living like a capsule which has no opening, no windows.\nLeibniz has the right word for it. He calls man a monad, a windowless house; no doors, no windows.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMeditation throws open all the doors and all the windows. Suddenly you become aware of the vast sky, the stars, the moon, the sun, the wind, the rain, the rainbows, the clouds -- the whole infinity of it, the whole spectrum of it. And the moment you become aware of it your heart starts singing and dancing.\nThat's what I mean by a poet. I don't literally mean a poet; not that one starts just composing poetry, but that one's whole life becomes poetic. To whatsoever one does there is the golden touch of creativity. You touch dust and by your touch it is transformed into gold. Wherever you move it becomes a sacred place; wherever you sit it becomes a temple, a shrine of infinite beauty and grandeur. Whatsoever you do releases the imprisoned splendour within you.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Moses is one of the most beautiful names; it has three meanings and
all are significant.</p><p>The first is the saved one, because Moses was saved from water. And
the second meaning is delivered by god.</p><p>Unless god saves you there is no way to ba saved. Man is helpless,
and to understand it is of great significance. The deliverance is
through grace, not by our effort. What can we do? Our efforts are bound
to be very tiny and our efforts will come out of our ignorance, out of
our confusion. They are bound to create more confusion, they cannot lead
us beyond confusion. Hence it is through the grace of god that one is
saved.</p><p>All that is needed on our part is to be in a let-go, to allow him to
save us. That is the trouble: very few people allow god to save them.
They resist, they struggle, they fight. You have been struggling with me
for so long!</p><p>I was dying to see your face here! And you were hiding and hiding.
But now there is no way -- I am going to save you!</p><p>And the third meaning is servant of god. Once you are saved you have
to serve!</p><p>There are millions of Christians -- they are only so-called
Christians. They go to church but that is only a Sunday affair. It is a
kind of sociality. It is good, it is helpful in many ways, because it is
the most ancient kind of rotary club -- the church -- where all good
people meet and praise each other and say nice things to each other and
everybody feels good. But they are not Christians.</p><p>To be a Christian, really a Christian, one needs to be a Christ --
less than that won't do. Hence Nietzsche was right when he said that the
first and the last Christian died on the cross two thousand years ago.
His emphasis was on the first and the last. Of course he himself was a
madman, but sometimes mad people have great insights which the so-called
sane people go on missing. He had tremendous intuitive energy. In fact
he had too much of it and could not manage it, could not control it,
could not be a master of it.</p><p>Had he been a meditator he would have become a Christ. He had all the
potential but he remained a thinker. And that is the calamity that has
happened in the West</p><p>-- and it has persisted for thousands of years now -- that all
brilliant people become confined to the world of thought.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche or Ludwig Wittgenstein or Bertrand Russell or
Jean-Paul Sartre -- these people have the potential but don't know what
to do with it; they don't know how to transcend the mind. And only
through transcendence can that potential be used, otherwise it is going
to drive you crazy. That's what happened to Nietzsche. It is as if you
give a one-hundred-watt bulb a one-thousand-watt voltage; it is bound to
go crazy.</p><p>The energy that could have become a breakthrough became a breakdown.
Nietzsche needed a master, he needed a Buddha, he needed a Christ. And
he felt the need. For his whole life he was continuously thinking of
Christ. In fact he was haunted by the idea of Christ, so much so that he
became antagonistic to Christ. It became almost a torture. To avoid it
he became anti-Christ. When he</p><p>became mad he even started signing his name "Anti-Christ, Friedrich
Nietzsche." First he would write "anti-Christ" and then "Friedrich
Nietzsche". "Friedrich Nietzsche" became secondary; his antagonism to
Christ became more essential to his being. That was just resistance. He
felt a great pull towards the man but he had also a great ego.</p><p>So whenever there were some moments when he was not functioning like
an ego, some moment of rest and relaxation. One cannot be an egoist for
twenty- four hours a day; it is too hard a work -- sometimes one has to
relax. Those are the moments when the windows open. And in those moments
he had tremendous insights.</p><p>This is one of his great insights, that the first and last Christian
died on the cross two thousand years before. He is saying all these
Christians are bogus, false. They are simply paying lip-service, their
heart is not with Christ.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>To be a sannyasin means to become totally involved with the
phenomenon of being a Christ or a Buddha</p><p>-- which are the same thing. To put it exactly, it simply means
becoming aware, alert; hence Jesus continuously says to his disciples,
"Beware!" Beware means be aware.</p><p>Those two words contain his whole teaching and those two words
contain the teaching of all the buddhas. Be blissful and be aware. They
come together: if you are blissful you will be aware; if you are aware
you will be blissful -- they are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>Man is mind, and mind can never be peaceful. In all the languages we
have such expressions and phrases as peace of mind, mental peace,
peaceful mind -- they are all wrong.</p><p>Joshua Liebman has written a famous book, but the title is wrong, and
from that very point he starts going wrong. PEACE OF MIND is the title
of the book -- and he never thinks twice about it, about what he is
saying. But that is what the western approach is. The West has always
thought that you can achieve peace through the mind. That's where East
differs totally.</p><p>Through the mind there is no possibility of peace. You have to
transcend mind, you have to go beyond mind. If you live in the mind you
will live in noise. It can be lessened but the difference will only be
of degree . So there are more noisy minds and less noisy minds, but they
are both noisy.</p><p>Mind cannot be without noise -- that is impossible. Mind means
thoughts. You can arrange them in a beautiful way but they are still
there, and they will make a noise -- howsoever skilfully arranged. Mind
cannot have peace.</p><p>Peace is divine, it is not human. Peace means absence of all mental
processes: no thought, no desire, no imagination, no memory -- as if the
whole mind has ceased completely. And then suddenly you know who you are
and you know what this existence is all about.</p><p>It is not that the mind is not useful, it can be used, but it can be
used only be a master. And the master is one who knows how to transcend
it.</p><p>Once you know the ladder that goes beyond the mind you are a master.
Then whenever you want to use it you can use it and whenever you don't
want to use it you can simply put it aside. Right now you may go on
saying "Please stop" It is not going to listen to you. In fact the more
you try to stop it, the more the mind will go berserk. It will show its
power to you, saying 'Who are you?' The servant has become the master
--</p><p>and whenever a servant becomes a master, he is a very bad master.</p><p>Meditation simply means putting things in their right places. Mind is
a mechanism; you are not the mind. You are consciousness, and you can
become conscious of the mind. Mind becomes just an object of your
consciousness. You are a mirror. You can mirror and reflect everything
in the mind, outside the mind.</p><p>They are all objects in front of you; you are pure subjectivity. This
is the whole definition of sannyas, that you are consciousness. And this
is the whole effort here, to help you to go beyond mind. And it is not
difficult.</p><p>The most difficult thing is to live in the mind and to make an effort
to be peaceful. That will be just superficial peace; a very thin layer
of peace can be spread, but deep down there will be a volcano and it can
erupt any moment. A slight provocation is enough and all peace is
lost.</p><p>But if you know how to go beyond it, then there is no problem at all:
you can come into the mind, you can go out of the mind. Peace is never
of the mind, peace is a state of no-mind, hence I call it divine, not
human. A peaceful man is a messenger of god. He is no more himself, he
exists only on behalf of god.</p><p>Meditation is our true home. Without it we are homeless. A man
without meditation is without shelter.</p><p>He exists just like driftwood, he is accidental. He goes on moving
from one event to another event, because one has to keep oneself somehow
occupied. otherwise life is boring, meaningless and one becomes
scared.</p><p>So one goes on moving and goes on doing thing, which are not really
essential at all, but one <em>has</em> to do them otherwise one can see
the emptiness inside, and that is very scary. Without meditation you are
bound to remain empty. You can go on stuffing yourself with all kinds of
stupidities; they will never make you feel fulfilled.</p><p>Meditation is the only way to become fulfilled, to know the innermost
core of your being which is already perfect, which needs no perfection,
which is already overflowing with joy and peace and love.</p><p>Meditation simply makes you aware of that which is already inside
you. It is a way of awakening to one's own self. And the moment you know
it you have found the home; then you are no more homeless. Then you are
rooted in existence; then you know that you are not just a driftwood,
then you know that you are not accidental. Then you know that you are
part of a divine existence, of an organic unity of the whole.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>To experience it is to become holy, to know the whole is to become
holy. And to know oneself as part of the whole, an intrinsic part of the
whole, brings great joy because the most significant thing in man's life
is to know that he is needed by existence, that he is not useless.</p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre says 'Man is a useless passion.' That simply shows
he has not known meditation at all.</p><p>Without meditation man certainly is a useless passion but with
meditation man is neither useless nor a passion. Man is tremendously
significant an d is compassion, not passion at all. Passion rises to new
heights and becomes compassion, it becomes love.</p><p>[A young Italian man has opted to keep his original name, Ganesh, as
part of his sannyas name. Osho prefixes it with 'anand', then goes on to
explain that Ganesh is the name of a mythological Hindu god.]</p><p>Ganesh is not a historical person, but it is far more significant
than any historical person can ever be. It is a metaphor, it is very
poetic. It has to be decoded, it carries a great message.</p><p>Ganesh is half man and half animal. This is the first thing to be
understood, that no man is born as a fully grown-up man; every man is
born half animal and half man. Hence the constant duality, the conflict
in man: a pull towards animality and also a pull towards god, divinity.
And man is torn apart; he lives in anguish. That is his anguish, his
anxiety: What to do, where to go?</p><p>His lower being is always gravitating towards the past -- that is the
animal -- and his potential is always hankering for a chance to grow --
that is man's future, his hope. Ganesh represents both; he is half man,
half elephant.</p><p>This situation has to be changed. And one cannot go back, one cannot
become an animal again, because there is no possibility of going back.
Whatsoever you have known you cannot forget and whatsoever you have
experienced is part of you; you cannot undo whatsoever you have done.
Hence there is no going back, you cannot move backwards in time, you can
only go forwards. But the pull of the past is great because the past
<em>is</em> great; the future is only a possibility and the past has
happened.</p><p>Hence if you look at Ganesh the animal is very heavy. It is the head
part -- Ganesh has the head of an elephant. It is the head, the mind
that is full of the past and very heavy, naturally. Just think of a man
with an elephant's head. It is a miracle how he manages to sit -- he
will fall down, he cannot carry that much load. He should be standing on
his head!</p><p>There is another beautiful metaphor. If you look at the statue of
Ganesh he is riding on a rat' Now the head is of an elephant; the man is
top-heavy, carrying a mountain, and riding on a rat. The rat represents
logic because logic is nothing but continuous hair-splitting, chopping.
That's what the rat goes on doing, continuously cutting things.
Whatsoever comes in front of the rat it starts cutting it. And that's
what logic is.</p><p>In Indian mythology the rat represents logic. The head rides on
logic, the head lives on logic, it goes on becoming bigger and bigger.
The more logical you are, the more powerful and heavy and destructive
your head becomes. One has to drop the head, one has to drop logic; one
has to learn ways which can make one headless.</p><p>The whole methodology of sannyas is to help you cut your head. With
the head gone the whole past disappears. You become light, you become
very weightless. You can fly, your heart has wings. Your head is just
like a rock, it cannot fly -- and to reach god you need wings. And you
don't need logic, you need love.</p><p>Love is creative, logic is destructive. Logic means doubt, love means
trust.</p><p>So try to understand this. I don't know who has given you the name...
Some Hindu fool? -- Nimkoroli Baba. -- Some Hindu fool, certainly. But
you wanted to keep it so I will try to dismantle you, because your head
will have to be chopped off!</p><p>Carrying an elephant's head is dangerous. And the poor rat -- he has
to be relieved, released. I have kept your name just so that I can go on
remembering what has to be done with you!</p><p>Marion is a very beautiful but strange name. It is a paradoxical
name.</p><p>It has two meanings. The first meaning is bitter grace and the second
meaning is living fragrance. On the surface one cannot see how they are
related. How can they be related? Bitter grace and living fragrance seem
to be totally different</p><p>words. But they are related very deep down.</p><p>Grace <em>is</em> bitter because you have to drop your identity.
That's why it is bitter. You have to drop your ego, you have to drop
your personality. You have to go through a kind of death, only then does
your real life begin. Unless you die, god is not; when you die, god is.
Hence it is a bitter medicine.</p><p>Buddha used to say that the journey to truth begins in bitterness and
ends in sweetness. That's why many 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>people never start the journey -- because it is so bitter they become
scared. And their logical mind says 'If it is so bitter even in the
beginning, how much more bitter it will be when you have reached the
goal? If the first step is so bitter just think of the last step. And
then it will be very difficult even to come back; you may have gone too
far. Better, don't take the first step.'</p><p>So the mind does not allow people to take the first step because it
is bitter. But the ultimate flowering is a great sweetness, it is living
fragrance. The journey begins in death and ends in abundant life.</p><p>Jesus said to Nicodemus 'Unless you are reborn, unless you die as you
are and are born again, you cannot enter into my kingdom of god.'
Nicodemus never returned to him. He was a professor in the university
and he came in the night when nobody was there. He could not even gather
the courage to come in the day. He was a rabbi too, a well-known scholar
-- what would people think of him going to this madman, Jesus?</p><p>So in the night when nobody was there he came, hidden. The first
statement of Jesus was enough to stop him; he was not ready to pay that
much of a price. And Jesus made it clear from the very beginning,
'Unless you are ready to die, forget all about it; you cannot enter into
<em>my</em> kingdom of god, you cannot be a fellow pilgrim of mine -- it
is impossible. The ego will have to be dropped.'</p><p>Drop the ego, howsoever bitter it is, howsoever painful it is, and
you will be</p><p>tremendously rewarded.</p><p>Meditation sharpens your brilliance. Ordinarily your sword is rusty.
You have never cared about it, you have not even taken it out of its
sheath. And it needs constant sharpening, otherwise it is not even
useful in cutting vegetables' And it has great work to do -- it has to
kill you! That's what sannyas is all about: cutting your head-off with
your own hands. It is <em>real</em> suicide. It is not of the body, it
is the suicide of the ego -- and the ego is very subtle and very
cunning. Unless you are sharp enough it will go deceiving you. You throw
it out from one door and it will enter from another. And it is so
cunning that it can even come in the name of humbleness.</p><p>You can watch the so-called humble people and you can see their egos.
They are egoistic about their humbleness, they are egoistic about their
simplicity, egoistic about their saintliness, even egoistic about their
egolessness.</p><p>A man without ego is neither egoistic nor egoless. Both are dropped.
He is simply there. To create that state is very great intelligence is
needed. Mind is not enough, only meditation can help.</p><p>So concentrate on meditation. Make it a point that this is the
topmost priority in your life, everything else is secondary. I don't say
anything else to my sannyasins, all that I want them to do is to become
meditators, and everything else follows of its own accord. Freedom
comes, bliss comes, peace comes, celebration comes, virtue comes,
transformation comes, and ultimately the experience of god.</p><p>Become an image of meditation, become meditation. Walk in meditation,
sit in meditation, eat in meditation, sleep in meditation. Let the
flavour of meditation spread all over your life -- breathe in, breathe
out, but meditation continues.</p><p>Meditation simply means an awareness of all that is happening. That
which is happening outside -- that is the outermost circle of your life.
Then that which is being done by your body -- that is the second
concentric circle, closer to you. Then the third concentric circle is
that which is done by your mind. And then the fourth is that which is
done by your feelings and emotions. And within these four concentric
circles is your centre, the fifth.</p><p>If you become aware of all that is going on, sooner or later you will
become centred at the centre and you will be able to see the whole
panorama, the whole</p><p>drama of the outer world, of physical activity, of psychological
activity, of emotional activity. And when you are able to see all this
you become free of it because immediately you come to know that you are
the seer, you are not the doer. That is the greatest revolution in life,
when this shift happens, that you are no more a doer but just a seer, a
witness. Than one becomes an image of meditation -- a Buddha, a Christ,
a Zarathustra.</p><p>Meditation releases great creativity. It is an explosion; all your
seeds start sprouting. For the first time you see how much potential you
were carrying within yourself: a great garden with so many flowers, such
beautiful bushes and trees and so many birds singing... a whole
paradise! But we are not ordinarily aware of it. We are completely
closed, we have not opened up; we are living like a capsule which has no
opening, no windows.</p><p>Leibniz has the right word for it. He calls man a monad, a windowless
house; no doors, no windows.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Meditation throws open all the doors and all the windows. Suddenly
you become aware of the vast sky, the stars, the moon, the sun, the
wind, the rain, the rainbows, the clouds -- the whole infinity of it,
the whole spectrum of it. And the moment you become aware of it your
heart starts singing and dancing.</p><p>That's what I mean by a poet. I don't literally mean a poet; not that
one starts just composing poetry, but that one's whole life becomes
poetic. To whatsoever one does there is the golden touch of creativity.
You touch dust and by your touch it is transformed into gold. Wherever
you move it becomes a sacred place; wherever you sit it becomes a
temple, a shrine of infinite beauty and grandeur. Whatsoever you do
releases the imprisoned splendour within you. And this goes on
happening; it is not something that happens once.</p><p>Meditation starts an explosion which is infinite, which goes on and
on, unending; there is no end to it.</p><p>There is a beginning in meditation but no end.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #25</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

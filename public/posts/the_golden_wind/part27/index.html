It is for reference purposes only.]\nThere have been two kinds of religion in the world: the religions of meditation and the religions of prayer. And they have existed like enemies; they have divided the whole of humanity.\nFor example, Buddhism is a religion of meditation, Christianity is a religion of prayer, and up to now there has been no bridge between them. It has not only divided humanity, it has divided each human being into two parts -- because man's wholeness needs to be fulfilled in its wholeness. And man has both aspects his being.\nOne aspect is fulfilled by meditation, another aspect is fulfilled by prayer. And if one sticks to one against the other, then he remains only half. Hence in the past the so-called holy men were not really holy, because they were not whole. It is because of this schizophrenic division that religion has not been able to bring the revolution it is capable of.\nMy effort here is to create a bridge. My sannyasin has to be both a man of meditation and a man of prayer, together.\nMeditation means a state of thoughtless awareness. It is in a way negative; it\nrejects thoughts and creates a silent state inside you. It is beautiful, that silence, but it is lacking something. It is lacking music, there is no poetry in it, there is no dance in it. It is a kind of dead silence, no song arises out of it.\nPrayer means the heart is full of love. It is a positive approach. Prayer can dance, prayer can sing, prayer can be a celebration, but without meditation all that celebration remains superficial, noisy. Yes, there is a great liveliness in it but that liveliness is childish, not mature.\nMaturity comes through meditation, joy comes through prayer. Centering comes through meditation, dancing comes through prayer. A man is really blessed who can remain centred and yet in a dance, who c an become the centre of the cyclone. And that is my vision of a sannyasin, a true religious person, the whole person.\nAnd it is possible, there is no difficulty in it, there is no intrinsic problem in it. Of course because it has to fulfil two apparently contradictory dimensions together, in the past people chose one. It was easier, less complicated but less rich, obviously.\nMan has to grow from simplicity to complexity, but the complexity should not lose track of simplicity, otherwise it becomes insane. It should remain rooted in simplicity and yet it should be complex. Then one has a tremendous beauty because when opposites meet as complementaries they give you dimensions; you are not one-dimensional.\nSo remember it: be meditative, be prayerful. Through meditation create emptiness and through prayer create love to fill it, so the emptiness becomes an overflowing of love.\nOne can be rich by possessing many things but that richness is pseudo, it is just befooling oneself. You come empty-handed into the world and you will have to go empty-handed; all your possessions will have to be left behind. So you can waste your life in accumulating them but you are not really gaining anything through life. On the contrary you are wasting a tremendous opportunity to be rich.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe real richness is something inner; it has nothing to do with things. And remember: I am not against things -- use, enjoy things, they have their utility. I am not anti-world, not anti-life, not anti -- enjoyment --\nenjoy life in all its beauty. But remember that's not all, that is only a very peripheral world. Your real treasure is within you. So don't get lost in the jungle of the world, otherwise you will remain poor and you will die poor.\nJesus says 'Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of god.' I would like to say 'Blessed are the rich for theirs is the kingdom of god,' although what he means by poor is exactly the same as what I mean by rich, but I am talking more directly.\nWhen he says 'Blessed are the poor in spirit,' he simply means those who are egoless, humble, simple.\ninnocent -- but that is what I call richness. Why call it poverty? -- it is not poverty. The person with an ego is poor; the person with pretentions is the poor person, Alexander the Great is a poor person, not Jesus; Jesus is the richest person the world has ever known. But I know by his idea of poverty he means exactly what I mean by richness. But I like a direct approach. Why go round about? -- first calling it poverty and then explaining it so that it becomes richness. Why not say it directly? But there is a reason why he used the word 'poverty'; that word has a tremendous appeal for the so-called religious people. They have always worshipped poverty, although their poverty is totally different from what Jesus calls poverty; hence there is bound to be misunderstanding.\nOnce a young man, a Jesus freak, came to me. He was living as poor a life as possible, without shoes, with rotten clothes. And he was travelling on foot all over India. From the Himalayas he was going to the south, and just living by begging.\nWhen he passed the town I was in somebody told him about me and he came to see me. And I said\n'What are you doing? What is this nonsense?' He said 'You call it nonsense?\nJesus says \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\"' I said he does not say that just by not wearing shoes you become poor in spirit or just by begging you become poor in spirit. As far as I can see you are tremendously egoistic. The moment I said this he became very angry, almost ready to fight.\nI said 'Sit down. That's what I am saying -- that you are not humble. Your humbleness is just a strategy of the ego and you are using Jesus' words in a totally wrong context; you have not understood them.'\nBut that's what Christians down the ages have been doing with the words of Christ. And that is going to be done to almost all enlightened people and their teachings. Hence my effort is to be as direct as possible, so there is less possibility of misunderstanding.\nI don't want to be metaphorical, I don't want to use parables because they can be interpreted in many ways. I don't want to use traditional words, or if I have to use them because there are no other words available then I want to make my meaning as clear as possible, as definite as possible. In that sense I am very logical and mathematical.\nI call meditation the greatest richness because it makes you aware of your own infinite treasure. It makes you a master of the kingdom of god. And the only key to that kingdom is through meditation, through silence, watchfulness, awareness.\nMan can have knowledge but not wisdom. Man can achieve as much knowledge as he wants. It is easy, you just need a little mind effort, a little exertion. You can go on feeding your memory system. It is a computer; you can accumulate whole libraries. But wisdom is not something that you can accumulate because it does not happen through the mind at all. It happens through the heart, it happens through love, not through logic.\nWhen the heart is open with love, with trust, when the heart is surrendered to the whole, then a new kind of insight arises in you, a clarity a tremendously deep understanding of what life is all about, of who you are, of why this whole existence exists in the first place. All the secrets are revealed, but through love not through logic, through the heart not through the head. God has a direct connection with the heart, no connection with the head at all. So if one wants to approach god the way goes through the heart.\nOnce you have known wisdom through the heart then you can use your mind\nalso as a good servant, then you can use even the knowledge accumulated by the mind in the service of wisdom -- but not before you have known through the heart. Hence, rather than wasting time in accumulating unnecessary information, and people go on accumulating such stupid information, which is utterly ridiculous. If you look in the history books ... children are forced to remember the names of stupid kings and queens and their birth date and their death date -- and what do they have to do with this poor child?\nOnce a teacher asked a child 'If Adam had never left the garden of Eden what would have happened?'\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nchild said 'One thing is certain: there would have been no history and no history class! It all began with Adam getting out of the garden of Eden.'\nIt is rumoured that the first words that Adam uttered when he was coming out of the gate... to Eve he said 'We are passing through a great crisis.'And since then we have always been passing through a great crisis. It is always a crisis. Not for a single moment have the crises stopped: one crisis after another crisis.\nAnd the poor children have to read history.\nWhen I was a student in the school that was a constant problem for my teachers, because I would insist\n'What is the purpose? Why should I know about this man? Did he know anything about me? Then why should I bother?' My history teacher would simply close his eyes and sit silently -- what to do? Many times he sent me to the principal saying 'Please explain to this boy. He asks such questions that cannot be answered. And in a way he is right...' because what do I have to do with some Henry, some Edward? What do I have to do with these people/ And still I am wondering because I have not come across any situation in which they were needed. And I don't think they will ever be needed. And all kinds of\ngeographies...\nDon't waste your time with information. All the universities are wasting peoples' lives. Almost ninety-nine per cent that they teach is rubbish.\nThe one per cent, it seems enters the rubbish without their knowledge, otherwise they would stop that too. Somehow it gets mixed into the rubbish and enters the curriculums and the texts; otherwise it is all absurd.\nD.H. Lawrence had the suggestion that if for one hundred years we could close all the schools and universities humanity would be immensely benefitted. And I agree with him: it would be the greatest blessing to humanity if for one hundred years there were no school, no college, no university -- all were finished. For one hundred years, a holiday. Man would become fresh, young again and he would forget all about Alexander the Great and Napoleon and Ivan the Terrible and Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. It would be such an unburdening and man could start from ABC.\nBut each person can do it. It may not be possible to persuade the whole of humanity to stop all the colleges and universities, but individuals can be persuaded. And that's what I go on doing with my sannyasins: I persuade them to drop all nonsense and give the uttermost priority to their heart.\nMove your energy to the heart, be more loving and you are in for a great surprise. As your love grows, as your love petals open and your heart becomes a lotus, something tremendously beautiful starts descending on you -- that is wisdom. And wisdom brings freedom.\nKnowledge brings information, wisdom brings transformation.\nEven a drop of bliss is an ocean. One can be drowned in a single drop of bliss. In fact a single drop of bliss is immeasurable. It is enough, more than enough, because bliss has no boundaries, it is infinite, and even a drop of infinity is infinite. It is as vast as the sky.\nThe only reason why we cannot attain it is that we are clinging to the ego which keeps us confined, which makes us very small. If we want to be blissful we have to drop our boundaries. We have to forget that we are Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, that we are communists, socialists, fascists. We have to forget all boundaries that ideologies draw around us -- religions and cultures, traditions,\nconventions, moralities.\nOnce all these boundaries are dropped, suddenly you are moving into a totally new world, a world which is unbounded. You are getting out of the prison.\nTo be a Christian is to be in a prison. Jesus was never a Christian, remember. And he rebelled against the Jews, that's why they crucified him. He rebelled against all boundaries, against all that was past, He was a rebel. So was Buddha, so was Lao Tzu, and so is the case with everyone who has ever experienced bliss.\nDrop the boundaries, definitions, identities and the doors are open -- there is nobody barring the path --\nand one immediately plunges into the world of bliss.\nKnowledge never makes you blissful; on the contrary it makes you more and more miserable. And it can be easily observed, it is a factual phenomenon. As man has grown more and more in knowledge, he has become more and more miserable. Whenever a society is well-educated, people start feeling life is meaningless, people start feeling a kind of deep boredom.\nMove to the primitive societies, go to the aboriginals who are still living five thousand years back and you will be surprised by one thing: they don't have anything to be blissful about but they are blissful. They don't have big aeroplanes and palaces and television sets, they have no technology, they are living in a primitive way, but one thing is very clear, very obvious, they are blissful -- poor, but blissful. Why is it so?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMove to a very knowledgeable society where education has become available to almost one hundred per cent of the people and you will be surprised: people look very miserable. They have lost something rather than gaining. In accumulating\nknowledge they have forgotten to move into the world of wisdom. They have made knowledge a substitute, and remember substitutes never fulfil.\nYou love a woman -- that is a tremendously beautiful experience -- but you can get a substitute through a prostitute. Now in America they have substitute wives. And psychologists are suggesting to people to go to a substitute just for a change because they are so bored with their wife, bored with their family. But a substitute wife is after all a substitute; it is a plastic flower. She does not love you, you don't love her. At the most it can be a superficial meeting. At the most it can be sexual, but it can't have intimacy; it can never be spiritual. You use the woman and the woman uses you. It is a monetary relationship; you are ready to pay, she is ready to sell.\nNow there are male prostitutes also! Of course not in poor countries like India, but in England, in America you can find male prostitutes. These are the great things that are happening through women's liberation. If men can have women prostitutes, why cannot woman enjoy male prostitutes? -- equality after all is equality. So people can go to foolish extremes, absurd extremes.\nBut slowly slowly everything is becoming a substitute, The true thing goes on disappearing. Instead of the true thing some substitute takes its place because a substitute can be manufactured, it is easily available, sellable, marketable. The real thing is not sellable or marketable; you have to deserve it.\nKnowledge is a substitute. You can go to any university, to any library, to any museum, and you can accumulate much knowledge, but for wisdom you cannot go anywhere. In fact you have to stop going, you have to be very still and silent. You have to dig deep within yourself, to the very rock-bottom of your being.\nIt is arduous, but when you are absolutely silent, when all thoughts have disappeared, when your eyes are as clear as a mirror without any dust, you become capable of seeing that which is. That is wisdom.\nAnd simultaneously, as wisdom happens your heart starts dancing. In fact for the first time you hear the REAL heart beat. For the first time you hear the song of the heart. For the first time your whole being --\nbody, mind, heart, soul -- are all dancing together and there is tremendous grace. My sannyasins have to achieve it. That's the only thing worth achieving, a blissful wisdom.\nBlessed are the blissful, because they have already entered into the kingdom of god. Not knowing that they are entering into god's heart they have entered. In fact god can never be found directly. You cannot approach god directly, he has no address; he has no name either, no form. If you search and seek god you will never find him.\nIt is because of this fact that humanity has slowly slowly turned atheistic, because people have looked for god and they have not found him. They searched, they wasted their lives and finally they discovered it had been an exercise in utter futility.\nBut the whole responsibility falls on the shoulders of the priests, the popes, the shankaracharyas, the imams, the ayatollah, the so-called religious people, the religious preachers, because they go on telling people to search for god, to seek god -- and that is patent nonsense'\nI say seek bliss and you will find god. Seek god and you will not find god and you will become more miserable than you were ever before because not finding something on which you have staked your whole life is bound to make you very frustrated. Forget all about god; just search for bliss, find the causes of your misery and drop those causes, remove those causes from the very roots.\nAnd you will be surprised: as all the causes of misery are dropped bliss starts growing in you. And in blissful moments you will become aware of a new presence surrounding you -- and not only you but the whole existence. That presence is god.\nGod is not a person but a presence. God is not god but godliness.\nBliss comes like a breeze, it comes like fresh air. You cannot see it but you can feel it. It is not tangible, it is not material. You cannot show it to anybody; it is not objective. But you can breathe it and you can be tremendously enriched and nourished by it. In fact if somebody is open to you he will also feel your bliss. It cannot be proved -- that is true. It cannot be proved in a scientific way because it is not an object, it is a subjective experience, something inner, very inner. But when one feels it there is absolute certainty, there is no doubt at all. Doubt is impossible in those moments. It is impossible even to ask a question about it. It is so self-evident and so totally convincing that it is not possible for there to be any question mark. It is only in such moments that trust is born.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGod cannot be believed in, and those who believe in god are simply deceiving themselves, they are dishonest people. My observation is that the so-called religious people are the most insincere and dishonest people in the world. Atheists are more sincere, honest, authentic; theists are hocus-pocus, bogus, pretenders, hypocrites, living a double kind of life: saying one thing and doing exactly the opposite. They have two doors to their life; the front-door, where they are Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans and are reading the Bhagavad Gita and the Koran and the Bible and having all the paraphernalia of their religious ritual.\nAnd they have a backdoor also where you will find their reality. And you will be surprised: you were thinking this man was one and this man is not one, this man is not even two, this man is many. He has many masks and he goes on changing his masks.\nIn fact people have become so skilful that they don't need to change their mask, it is almost an autonomous process. The mask changes itself; as the situation changes the mask changes. You can observe it in others, you can observe it in yourself. You know when you are smiling truly and when you are simply smiling just to deceive, because a smile is expected; you are fulfilling a certain expectation. But it is only on the lips, an exercise of the lips maybe but it has nothing else behind it, it is a facade.\nA real trust is not a belief, it is an experience. God has to be experienced. And never believe before you come to experience -- never never -- because once a belief enters your being it poisons you. Drop all beliefs because god is -- why believe? Why not experience?\nI am not a teacher. I don't give you a dogma or a philosophy; I am simply a witness. I say 'I have experienced, so YOU can experience.' And there is no need at all to believe.\nI was absolutely atheistic and I am tremendously fortunate that I never believed in god because if I had I would have never known. I never believed in anything at all. I was such a sceptical person that I would even ask things which nobody seems to ask. I would even ask about the existence of the other person, whether the other person really existed or was I just dreaming. Because sometimes you dream and there are persons in your dream.\nI have always loved Chuang Tzu's famous statement: 'One night I dreamt that I became a butterfly, and since then I have always been in trouble because I have not been able to figure it out: if Chuang Tzu can dream that he is a butterfly, who knows? -- in the morning the butterfly may fall asleep and start dreaming that she is a Chuang Tzu. Who knows?'\nI had it written just behind my desk when I was the university. One of my professors came to see me one day. He saw that and he said 'Why have you written this Chuang Tzu statement?' I said 'This is my statement too. I don't believe that you are.'\nHe said 'What are you saying?' I said 'Because sometimes you come in the dreams also. And now the thing has become more complicated.' He said 'What do you mean?' I said 'In the dream also you asked about this board, \"Why do you have this board?\" -- and now you are asking again. Now which one to believe?'\nHe simply went out.

Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8007275 ShortTitle: GWIND28 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>There have been two kinds of religion in the world: the religions of
meditation and the religions of prayer. And they have existed like
enemies; they have divided the whole of humanity.</p><p>For example, Buddhism is a religion of meditation, Christianity is a
religion of prayer, and up to now there has been no bridge between them.
It has not only divided humanity, it has divided each human being into
two parts -- because man's wholeness needs to be fulfilled in its
wholeness. And man has both aspects his being.</p><p>One aspect is fulfilled by meditation, another aspect is fulfilled by
prayer. And if one sticks to one against the other, then he remains only
half. Hence in the past the so-called holy men were not really holy,
because they were not whole. It is because of this schizophrenic
division that religion has not been able to bring the revolution it is
capable of.</p><p>My effort here is to create a bridge. My sannyasin has to be both a
man of meditation and a man of prayer, together.</p><p>Meditation means a state of thoughtless awareness. It is in a way
negative; it</p><p>rejects thoughts and creates a silent state inside you. It is
beautiful, that silence, but it is lacking something. It is lacking
music, there is no poetry in it, there is no dance in it. It is a kind
of dead silence, no song arises out of it.</p><p>Prayer means the heart is full of love. It is a positive approach.
Prayer can dance, prayer can sing, prayer can be a celebration, but
without meditation all that celebration remains superficial, noisy. Yes,
there is a great liveliness in it but that liveliness is childish, not
mature.</p><p>Maturity comes through meditation, joy comes through prayer.
Centering comes through meditation, dancing comes through prayer. A man
is really blessed who can remain centred and yet in a dance, who c an
become the centre of the cyclone. And that is my vision of a sannyasin,
a true religious person, the whole person.</p><p>And it is possible, there is no difficulty in it, there is no
intrinsic problem in it. Of course because it has to fulfil two
apparently contradictory dimensions together, in the past people chose
one. It was easier, less complicated but less rich, obviously.</p><p>Man has to grow from simplicity to complexity, but the complexity
should not lose track of simplicity, otherwise it becomes insane. It
should remain rooted in simplicity and yet it should be complex. Then
one has a tremendous beauty because when opposites meet as
complementaries they give you dimensions; you are not
one-dimensional.</p><p>So remember it: be meditative, be prayerful. Through meditation
create emptiness and through prayer create love to fill it, so the
emptiness becomes an overflowing of love.</p><p>One can be rich by possessing many things but that richness is
pseudo, it is just befooling oneself. You come empty-handed into the
world and you will have to go empty-handed; all your possessions will
have to be left behind. So you can waste your life in accumulating them
but you are not really gaining anything through life. On the contrary
you are wasting a tremendous opportunity to be rich.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The real richness is something inner; it has nothing to do with
things. And remember: I am not against things -- use, enjoy things, they
have their utility. I am not anti-world, not anti-life, not anti --
enjoyment --</p><p>enjoy life in all its beauty. But remember that's not all, that is
only a very peripheral world. Your real treasure is within you. So don't
get lost in the jungle of the world, otherwise you will remain poor and
you will die poor.</p><p>Jesus says 'Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of god.' I
would like to say 'Blessed are the rich for theirs is the kingdom of
god,' although what he means by poor is exactly the same as what I mean
by rich, but I am talking more directly.</p><p>When he says 'Blessed are the poor in spirit,' he simply means those
who are egoless, humble, simple.</p><p>innocent -- but that is what I call richness. Why call it poverty? --
it is not poverty. The person with an ego is poor; the person with
pretentions is the poor person, Alexander the Great is a poor person,
not Jesus; Jesus is the richest person the world has ever known. But I
know by his idea of poverty he means exactly what I mean by richness.
But I like a direct approach. Why go round about? -- first calling it
poverty and then explaining it so that it becomes richness. Why not say
it directly? But there is a reason why he used the word 'poverty'; that
word has a tremendous appeal for the so-called religious people. They
have always worshipped poverty, although their poverty is totally
different from what Jesus calls poverty; hence there is bound to be
misunderstanding.</p><p>Once a young man, a Jesus freak, came to me. He was living as poor a
life as possible, without shoes, with rotten clothes. And he was
travelling on foot all over India. From the Himalayas he was going to
the south, and just living by begging.</p><p>When he passed the town I was in somebody told him about me and he
came to see me. And I said</p><p>'What are you doing? What is this nonsense?' He said 'You call it
nonsense?</p><p>Jesus says "Blessed are the poor in spirit."' I said he does not say
that just by not wearing shoes you become poor in spirit or just by
begging you become poor in spirit. As far as I can see you are
tremendously egoistic. The moment I said this he became very angry,
almost ready to fight.</p><p>I said 'Sit down. That's what I am saying -- that you are not humble.
Your humbleness is just a strategy of the ego and you are using Jesus'
words in a totally wrong context; you have not understood them.'</p><p>But that's what Christians down the ages have been doing with the
words of Christ. And that is going to be done to almost all enlightened
people and their teachings. Hence my effort is to be as direct as
possible, so there is less possibility of misunderstanding.</p><p>I don't want to be metaphorical, I don't want to use parables because
they can be interpreted in many ways. I don't want to use traditional
words, or if I have to use them because there are no other words
available then I want to make my meaning as clear as possible, as
definite as possible. In that sense I am very logical and
mathematical.</p><p>I call meditation the greatest richness because it makes you aware of
your own infinite treasure. It makes you a master of the kingdom of god.
And the only key to that kingdom is through meditation, through silence,
watchfulness, awareness.</p><p>Man can have knowledge but not wisdom. Man can achieve as much
knowledge as he wants. It is easy, you just need a little mind effort, a
little exertion. You can go on feeding your memory system. It is a
computer; you can accumulate whole libraries. But wisdom is not
something that you can accumulate because it does not happen through the
mind at all. It happens through the heart, it happens through love, not
through logic.</p><p>When the heart is open with love, with trust, when the heart is
surrendered to the whole, then a new kind of insight arises in you, a
clarity a tremendously deep understanding of what life is all about, of
who you are, of why this whole existence exists in the first place. All
the secrets are revealed, but through love not through logic, through
the heart not through the head. God has a direct connection with the
heart, no connection with the head at all. So if one wants to approach
god the way goes through the heart.</p><p>Once you have known wisdom through the heart then you can use your
mind</p><p>also as a good servant, then you can use even the knowledge
accumulated by the mind in the service of wisdom -- but not before you
have known through the heart. Hence, rather than wasting time in
accumulating unnecessary information, and people go on accumulating such
stupid information, which is utterly ridiculous. If you look in the
history books ... children are forced to remember the names of stupid
kings and queens and their birth date and their death date -- and what
do they have to do with this poor child?</p><p>Once a teacher asked a child 'If Adam had never left the garden of
Eden what would have happened?'</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>child said 'One thing is certain: there would have been no history
and no history class! It all began with Adam getting out of the garden
of Eden.'</p><p>It is rumoured that the first words that Adam uttered when he was
coming out of the gate... to Eve he said 'We are passing through a great
crisis.'And since then we have always been passing through a great
crisis. It is always a crisis. Not for a single moment have the crises
stopped: one crisis after another crisis.</p><p>And the poor children have to read history.</p><p>When I was a student in the school that was a constant problem for my
teachers, because I would insist</p><p>'What is the purpose? Why should I know about this man? Did he know
anything about me? Then why should I bother?' My history teacher would
simply close his eyes and sit silently -- what to do? Many times he sent
me to the principal saying 'Please explain to this boy. He asks such
questions that cannot be answered. And in a way he is right...' because
what do I have to do with some Henry, some Edward? What do I have to do
with these people/ And still I am wondering because I have not come
across any situation in which they were needed. And I don't think they
will ever be needed. And all kinds of</p><p>geographies...</p><p>Don't waste your time with information. All the universities are
wasting peoples' lives. Almost ninety-nine per cent that they teach is
rubbish.</p><p>The one per cent, it seems enters the rubbish without their
knowledge, otherwise they would stop that too. Somehow it gets mixed
into the rubbish and enters the curriculums and the texts; otherwise it
is all absurd.</p><p>D.H. Lawrence had the suggestion that if for one hundred years we
could close all the schools and universities humanity would be immensely
benefitted. And I agree with him: it would be the greatest blessing to
humanity if for one hundred years there were no school, no college, no
university -- all were finished. For one hundred years, a holiday. Man
would become fresh, young again and he would forget all about Alexander
the Great and Napoleon and Ivan the Terrible and Genghis Khan and
Tamerlane. It would be such an unburdening and man could start from
ABC.</p><p>But each person can do it. It may not be possible to persuade the
whole of humanity to stop all the colleges and universities, but
individuals can be persuaded. And that's what I go on doing with my
sannyasins: I persuade them to drop all nonsense and give the uttermost
priority to their heart.</p><p>Move your energy to the heart, be more loving and you are in for a
great surprise. As your love grows, as your love petals open and your
heart becomes a lotus, something tremendously beautiful starts
descending on you -- that is wisdom. And wisdom brings freedom.</p><p>Knowledge brings information, wisdom brings transformation.</p><p>Even a drop of bliss is an ocean. One can be drowned in a single drop
of bliss. In fact a single drop of bliss is immeasurable. It is enough,
more than enough, because bliss has no boundaries, it is infinite, and
even a drop of infinity is infinite. It is as vast as the sky.</p><p>The only reason why we cannot attain it is that we are clinging to
the ego which keeps us confined, which makes us very small. If we want
to be blissful we have to drop our boundaries. We have to forget that we
are Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans, that we are communists, socialists,
fascists. We have to forget all boundaries that ideologies draw around
us -- religions and cultures, traditions,</p><p>conventions, moralities.</p><p>Once all these boundaries are dropped, suddenly you are moving into a
totally new world, a world which is unbounded. You are getting out of
the prison.</p><p>To be a Christian is to be in a prison. Jesus was never a Christian,
remember. And he rebelled against the Jews, that's why they crucified
him. He rebelled against all boundaries, against all that was past, He
was a rebel. So was Buddha, so was Lao Tzu, and so is the case with
everyone who has ever experienced bliss.</p><p>Drop the boundaries, definitions, identities and the doors are open
-- there is nobody barring the path --</p><p>and one immediately plunges into the world of bliss.</p><p>Knowledge never makes you blissful; on the contrary it makes you more
and more miserable. And it can be easily observed, it is a factual
phenomenon. As man has grown more and more in knowledge, he has become
more and more miserable. Whenever a society is well-educated, people
start feeling life is meaningless, people start feeling a kind of deep
boredom.</p><p>Move to the primitive societies, go to the aboriginals who are still
living five thousand years back and you will be surprised by one thing:
they don't have anything to be blissful about but they are blissful.
They don't have big aeroplanes and palaces and television sets, they
have no technology, they are living in a primitive way, but one thing is
very clear, very obvious, they are blissful -- poor, but blissful. Why
is it so?</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Move to a very knowledgeable society where education has become
available to almost one hundred per cent of the people and you will be
surprised: people look very miserable. They have lost something rather
than gaining. In accumulating</p><p>knowledge they have forgotten to move into the world of wisdom. They
have made knowledge a substitute, and remember substitutes never
fulfil.</p><p>You love a woman -- that is a tremendously beautiful experience --
but you can get a substitute through a prostitute. Now in America they
have substitute wives. And psychologists are suggesting to people to go
to a substitute just for a change because they are so bored with their
wife, bored with their family. But a substitute wife is after all a
substitute; it is a plastic flower. She does not love you, you don't
love her. At the most it can be a superficial meeting. At the most it
can be sexual, but it can't have intimacy; it can never be spiritual.
You use the woman and the woman uses you. It is a monetary relationship;
you are ready to pay, she is ready to sell.</p><p>Now there are male prostitutes also! Of course not in poor countries
like India, but in England, in America you can find male prostitutes.
These are the great things that are happening through women's
liberation. If men can have women prostitutes, why cannot woman enjoy
male prostitutes? -- equality after all is equality. So people can go to
foolish extremes, absurd extremes.</p><p>But slowly slowly everything is becoming a substitute, The true thing
goes on disappearing. Instead of the true thing some substitute takes
its place because a substitute can be manufactured, it is easily
available, sellable, marketable. The real thing is not sellable or
marketable; you have to deserve it.</p><p>Knowledge is a substitute. You can go to any university, to any
library, to any museum, and you can accumulate much knowledge, but for
wisdom you cannot go anywhere. In fact you have to stop going, you have
to be very still and silent. You have to dig deep within yourself, to
the very rock-bottom of your being.</p><p>It is arduous, but when you are absolutely silent, when all thoughts
have disappeared, when your eyes are as clear as a mirror without any
dust, you become capable of seeing that which is. That is wisdom.</p><p>And simultaneously, as wisdom happens your heart starts dancing. In
fact for the first time you hear the REAL heart beat. For the first time
you hear the song of the heart. For the first time your whole being
--</p><p>body, mind, heart, soul -- are all dancing together and there is
tremendous grace. My sannyasins have to achieve it. That's the only
thing worth achieving, a blissful wisdom.</p><p>Blessed are the blissful, because they have already entered into the
kingdom of god. Not knowing that they are entering into god's heart they
have entered. In fact god can never be found directly. You cannot
approach god directly, he has no address; he has no name either, no
form. If you search and seek god you will never find him.</p><p>It is because of this fact that humanity has slowly slowly turned
atheistic, because people have looked for god and they have not found
him. They searched, they wasted their lives and finally they discovered
it had been an exercise in utter futility.</p><p>But the whole responsibility falls on the shoulders of the priests,
the popes, the shankaracharyas, the imams, the ayatollah, the so-called
religious people, the religious preachers, because they go on telling
people to search for god, to seek god -- and that is patent
nonsense'</p><p>I say seek bliss and you will find god. Seek god and you will not
find god and you will become more miserable than you were ever before
because not finding something on which you have staked your whole life
is bound to make you very frustrated. Forget all about god; just search
for bliss, find the causes of your misery and drop those causes, remove
those causes from the very roots.</p><p>And you will be surprised: as all the causes of misery are dropped
bliss starts growing in you. And in blissful moments you will become
aware of a new presence surrounding you -- and not only you but the
whole existence. That presence is god.</p><p>God is not a person but a presence. God is not god but godliness.</p><p>Bliss comes like a breeze, it comes like fresh air. You cannot see it
but you can feel it. It is not tangible, it is not material. You cannot
show it to anybody; it is not objective. But you can breathe it and you
can be tremendously enriched and nourished by it. In fact if somebody is
open to you he will also feel your bliss. It cannot be proved -- that is
true. It cannot be proved in a scientific way because it is not an
object, it is a subjective experience, something inner, very inner. But
when one feels it there is absolute certainty, there is no doubt at all.
Doubt is impossible in those moments. It is impossible even to ask a
question about it. It is so self-evident and so totally convincing that
it is not possible for there to be any question mark. It is only in such
moments that trust is born.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>God cannot be believed in, and those who believe in god are simply
deceiving themselves, they are dishonest people. My observation is that
the so-called religious people are the most insincere and dishonest
people in the world. Atheists are more sincere, honest, authentic;
theists are hocus-pocus, bogus, pretenders, hypocrites, living a double
kind of life: saying one thing and doing exactly the opposite. They have
two doors to their life; the front-door, where they are Christians and
Hindus and Mohammedans and are reading the Bhagavad Gita and the Koran
and the Bible and having all the paraphernalia of their religious
ritual.</p><p>And they have a backdoor also where you will find their reality. And
you will be surprised: you were thinking this man was one and this man
is not one, this man is not even two, this man is many. He has many
masks and he goes on changing his masks.</p><p>In fact people have become so skilful that they don't need to change
their mask, it is almost an autonomous process. The mask changes itself;
as the situation changes the mask changes. You can observe it in others,
you can observe it in yourself. You know when you are smiling truly and
when you are simply smiling just to deceive, because a smile is
expected; you are fulfilling a certain expectation. But it is only on
the lips, an exercise of the lips maybe but it has nothing else behind
it, it is a facade.</p><p>A real trust is not a belief, it is an experience. God has to be
experienced. And never believe before you come to experience -- never
never -- because once a belief enters your being it poisons you. Drop
all beliefs because god is -- why believe? Why not experience?</p><p>I am not a teacher. I don't give you a dogma or a philosophy; I am
simply a witness. I say 'I have experienced, so YOU can experience.' And
there is no need at all to believe.</p><p>I was absolutely atheistic and I am tremendously fortunate that I
never believed in god because if I had I would have never known. I never
believed in anything at all. I was such a sceptical person that I would
even ask things which nobody seems to ask. I would even ask about the
existence of the other person, whether the other person really existed
or was I just dreaming. Because sometimes you dream and there are
persons in your dream.</p><p>I have always loved Chuang Tzu's famous statement: 'One night I
dreamt that I became a butterfly, and since then I have always been in
trouble because I have not been able to figure it out: if Chuang Tzu can
dream that he is a butterfly, who knows? -- in the morning the butterfly
may fall asleep and start dreaming that she is a Chuang Tzu. Who
knows?'</p><p>I had it written just behind my desk when I was the university. One
of my professors came to see me one day. He saw that and he said 'Why
have you written this Chuang Tzu statement?' I said 'This is my
statement too. I don't believe that you are.'</p><p>He said 'What are you saying?' I said 'Because sometimes you come in
the dreams also. And now the thing has become more complicated.' He said
'What do you mean?' I said 'In the dream also you asked about this
board, "Why do you have this board?" -- and now you are asking again.
Now which one to believe?'</p><p>He simply went out. He said 'You will drive me crazy! Are you mad or
something?'</p><p>But I am happy that I was that mad. Because I could not believe in
anything I was free, totally free, and in that freedom something
transpired; in that utter emptiness something came from the beyond like
a breeze.</p><p>I could not see it but I felt it; I felt the freshness of it, I felt
the fragrance of it and it transformed me. I am still not a believer
because now god is a certainty to me.</p><p>Now I don't say God exists, 'I say 'ONLY god exists and nothing
else.'</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-golden-wind>The Golden Wind</h3><p>Chapter #29</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

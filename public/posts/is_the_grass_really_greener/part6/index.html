It is for reference purposes only.]\nVeet Dirk. Dirk is a dangerous name. It means the ruler of the people. The very idea of ruling others is ugly; it is political, it is inhuman. Hence I am giving you the name Veet Dirk: Veet means go beyond Dirk, go beyond the idea, the desire of domination, of ruling others. Veet means transcending. It is an ordinary desire in everybody, to somehow prove superior to others.\nThe really superior man has no desire to prove that he is superior -- he simply is! He never becomes a politician, there is no need. The politician suffers from an inferiority complex, hence to compensate he projects just the opposite of it into the world; he tries to prove that he is great, that Alexander the Great, but inside he knows his emptiness.\nSannyas means dropping the desire to rule others and putting your whole energy into conquering yourself, into becoming a matter of one's own being. And one cannot manage both together. To rule others 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\none has to go outside, one has to be violent, competitive, destructive. To become a master of oneself one has to go in, one has to become more loving, more peaceful, more silent, more non-competitive, more non-ambitious, more and more diving into one's being. A moment comes when you reach the very centre.\nThat moment is the moment of real victory. That is the moment when one becomes a master.\nAnd that is worth achieving; all else is just stupid. Prem means love. Gabriele means God is my strength.\nMan can live either as love or as an ego. These are the two, the only two alternatives available, the two alternative lifestyles.\nThe ego is very attractive because it promises great things, although it delivers nothing; those goods are never delivered. But it is very persuasive, seductive. It goes on promising, it goes on alluring, it goes on telling you that just a few steps more and you will achieve the goal -- although the goal is never achieved because the goal is like the horizon. You can go on and on but the distance between you and the horizon remains the same, for the simple reason that that horizon is illusory. It exists not, it only appears to; it has no reality.\nThe ego creates dreams and fantasies of achieving this, of being this, of getting that, of reaching there.\nAnd through all these fantasies it takes you farther and farther away from yourself. And to be away from one's own self is to be away from god.\nLove is not at all persuasive. You have to choose it, it does not propagate itself. It will not prove itself.\nSo when the ego style fails -- and it fails only for the intelligent people, remember; for the stupid it never fails. It fails again and again, but again and again they are in the same trap; they can be befooled for their whole life. But the intelligent person sooner or later -- and it is sooner rather than later -- recognizes that the ego is just a deceptive phenomenon, a mirage.\nIn that failure of the ego lifestyle one moves to egolessness. And that's what love is: love is egolessness.\nNow there is nowhere to go, nothing to achieve; your whole energy starts settling, resting within yourself.\nAnd when it rests at the center one comes to know that one is not, only God is. \"That's the meaning of Gabriele: 'God is my strength, God is my existence, God is my very being. I am just a small manifestation of divine energy.'\"\nTo know it brings great rejoicing. All worries disappear, all anxieties disappear; now you know that there is somebody far bigger than you who takes care, who is concerned. You are his project so it is his business to fulfill it, to help you to be blissful. And he is constantly trying to reach you to be blissful. And he is constantly trying to reach you but you are always running, chasing after shadows, hence he cannot reach you. When you are inside yourself, immediately you hear the still, small voice within you -- and that becomes the guiding star.\nThen you don't need any scriptures, any morality, any codes of behavior; you have your own insight --\nnow you can know what is right and what is wrong, on your own. And that has tremendous beauty: to live according to one's own being is to live authentically. That's the way a sannyasin should live.\nDhyan Susanne. Dhyan means meditation. Susanne means full of grace.\nEverybody is born with great grace, beauty and intelligence, but it has to be discovered. It is only a potential; it has to be actualised. It is only a seed; you have to sow it, only then will it burst forth into flowers one day.\nOrdinarily it is invisible. You cannot see the flowers in the seed. Even if you cut the seed you will not find any colour, any fragrance, nothing, no foliage, and you know this seed has all that. Millions of flowers are possible through it, for years and years millions of leaves, greenery, will come out of it; it has infinite potential, but that potential has to become a tree, a reality.\nMan is a seed full of grace, full of beauty, full of wisdom, full of god -- but he is only a seed. Meditation is the way to make that seed sprout. Meditation is nothing but preparing the ground, withdrawing all the stones, weeds, roots, all\nthat is non-essential, so that the essential can have space enough to grow. Meditation only creates space within you by taking out all the weeds.\nThoughts are weeds, desires are weeds, memories are weeds -- and they all have to be taken out, root and all. Once the space is there you will be surprised: suddenly roses start growing within you.\nGovindo is a name of god. One may know it one may not know, but one is a god.\nThe function of the master is to remind you, to create a situation in which you can remember, to create 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndevices which can function as mirrors in which you can see your original face.\nBut one is not less than god; less than that is all false. Less than that is our invention, more than that is not possible. So don't settle for less. Discover the reality of your being. And it is not very far away either.\nJust a little bit of shaking, jumping, jogging, and you will wake up. That's what we are doing here, One never knows through what situation one is going to wake up. Buddha became awakened while he was just sitting under a tree, like any lazy man -- just sitting, doing nothing. And we Indians are really efficient at it! (laughter) Perhaps that's why so many people became Buddhas in India: laziness may be the real cause of it.\nWe know how not to do things. We are really efficient. So he was just sitting like any other Indian under a tree and he became awakened.\nIf you sit too long under a tree sooner or later you will wake up. You will get tired of sitting and you will think 'What am I doing?' You will have to get it. For how long can one sit?\nSomebody can become enlightened while he is dancing. One never knows. So in\nmy commune all kinds of devices are Made available. Try every possible door. One thing is certain, that there is one door for you too, but you will have to knock on many doors before you come to the real door that will be yours.\nIt is a trial-and-error method. There is no other possibility. So do all that is happening here, participate in everything. Don't be choosey, because whatsoever you choose you will choose from the mind -- and the mind is very cunning: it will avoid the door that is really going to be your door.\nMy own observation is that whatsoever the mind chooses is almost always wrong. So the best way is: whatsoever is available, try; try everything -- all the meditations, all the groups. One never knows in what situation the lightning will happen. But it happens -- that much is certain.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- One month.\n-- That is not like a Japanese! (Osho shakes his head slowly, looking smilingly at Govindo, and does it for so long that everyone begins to laugh.)\nNext time come for a longer period! Good. Anurage means pure love.\nLove can be impure, then it creates bondage. When it is pure it brings freedom. The whole process of sannyas is of purifying your love-energy. It is mixed with many things, because our society makes every child a mess. There is lust, which is not love but millions of people think that is love; it is just a biological instinct. It is just nature trying to continue the race. It has nothing to do with you; it is almost impersonal.\nLove is not possessiveness; many people think that's what love is: you possess somebody totally. To possess somebody is to destroy all possibility of love. Possessiveness can be hate but cannot be love, it can be fear but it cannot be love.\nOne has to drop possessiveness, one has to drop the very idea of dominating, one has to give freedom if one wants freedom. Whatsoever you want for yourself give to others. And if you cannot give even to those you love, to whom else can\nyou give it? And the only gift worth giving is freedom. And the miracle is that the moment love gives freedom it becomes pure, absolutely pure. And in that purity it rises to its ultimate height. That height is prayer. At that height you start meeting, merging with the eternal, with the infinite.\nNothing else is needed if one can go on watching all those elements which made one's love impure and drop them so ultimately only love is left. Then love is just fragrance -- so sweet and of such grandeur that one cannot imagine it, there is no way to imagine it, one can only experience it. It is of the beyond, penetrating the thick layers of the earthen existence. It is like a ray coming from the ultimate source. Jesus says god is love -- and he is right.\nGopalo is a name of god.\nEvery man should be reminded again and again that he is a god. In fact we do just the opposite: we remind every man that he is nothing but an animal. This has been particularly so since Charles Darwin. That man is nothing but an evolution of a certain animal species has become a popular myth, although it is absolutely ungrounded and no proof exists for it. The Darwinians have not been able to provide a single proof that monkeys have become men. If it were true then we would see at least a few monkeys becoming men today also. There is no record of that. At least ten thousand-year-old scriptures exist: not at a single point has anybody seen a monkey becoming a man (laughter). Sometimes it happens that a man becomes a monkey (laughter) and goes crazy, nuts, but vice versa has never happened.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nBut Darwinians go on believing it and they have polluted the whole mind of man for all these years and now everybody has accepted the idea. That idea has been one of the greatest hindrances in human evolution.\nThe old idea, that man comes from god, was far more significant because it gives you an impetus, a challenge. If you come from god than you are god; then there\nis a possibility for you to regain, to reclaim, your inheritance. But if you come from monkeys, what challenge is there? One just feels a little awkward, that's all; one wants to hide somewhere. And one feels as if one has come to the ultimate peak of evolution\n-- what more can you do?\nMonkeys have done great work. Buddha is a monkey, Jesus is a monkey, Lao Tzu is a monkey -- what else can you think of? Monkeys have done miracles! But this is just an absurd idea, utterly unscientific.\nScience is burdened with many superstitions; this is one of the superstitions of science.\nI insist that man comes from god. In fact I insist that even monkeys come from god; all that exists comes from god. God is our only source, and unless we again reach that source we will remain discontented.\nSannyas is a deliberate effort to regain our real source, to again become part of the reality from which we have become uprooted.\nRishiraj. Rishi is a very specific word. There is no equivalent in English for it, in fact in no other language is there an equivalent for it. All the languages have just one word for the poet; only Sanskrit has two words for the poet. One is \"kavi\" which is exactly synonymous with poetry; the other is \"rishi\" which is something plus -- but that plus is mysterious, very mysterious.\nThe rishi is a poet but in a very special sense. The poet composes poetry but there are only a few moments when he functions as a poet, otherwise he is an ordinary man. No poet is a poet for twenty-four hours a day. Yes, there are moments when windows open and he can see into the beyond and he can bring great treasures from that experience. But those windows open and close, and he is not the master of those windows; whenever they open they open.…\nColeridge, a great English poet, died with thousands of incomplete poems. His friends insisted again and again \"Why don't you complete these poems?\" Sometimes only a single line was needed and the poem would be complete. It would be such a beautiful poem that it would be unfortunate if it remained incomplete. But Coleridge was insistent, he said, \"No, I cannot complete it because I have not composed it.\nOnly once in a while am I a poet and at that moment something starts flowing through me. I cannot claim that I am the author of it but just the vehicle, so whatsoever comes, comes. If the process, if the energy, stops in the middle, I stop, I have to stop. I have tried many times to complete it but my line seems to be very far away from the other lines that have come on their own. It does not fit\n-- there is a qualitative difference.\" And he was right.\nA rishi is a poet who is a poet twenty-four hours a day, who knows the art of opening the window whenever he wants to open it. The poet is in a way unconscious. The rishi is a conscious poet; he is an awakened poet, an enlightened poet.\nIt is not a question of him feeling poetry flowing through him once in a while; it is flowing all the time, twenty-four hours a day. That's the meaning of rishi.\nAnd Raj means a king. A poet who is a poet twenty-four hours a day is certainly a king; he has found the real kingdom -- the kingdom of god.\nNarayani. Narayani is a very significant name. 'Nar' means man, and Narayana means god in man.\nNarayani is the feminine form of Narayana.\nMan is not only man. From the outside he is man, from the inside he is god. Jesus says many times 'I am the son of man,' and many times 'I am the son of god.' For two thousand years Christian theologists have been pondering, discussing, analysing, arguing about why he uses these two expressions. Either he is a son of man or he is a son of god. How can he be both? But everybody is both, it is not only Jesus. Jesus is simply representing a truth about everybody: from the outside we are sons of man, from the inside we are sons of god. Our body comes from our parents and our consciousness comes from god himself. So we are the meeting place of these two, the physical and the supraphysical.\nNarayani means the meeting of the physical and the non-physical. Unfortunate are those people who think themselves only physical. Those people are in a far better way, far more fortunate are those who think themselves spiritual. But the ultimate joy and the blessing and the benediction belongs to the third category that knows that we are both.\nAnd that's exactly my approach, that man should live both sides, the exterior and\nthe interior, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsimultaneously, in deep harmony. There is no need to drop life and escape to a monastery, and there is no need to become just a worldly man, a Rotarian, etcetera. You have to be both because only when you are both does a synthesis happen in you, a synthesis which takes you beyond both, which leads you to the transcendental.\nSo my sannyasins have to live in the world without being part of the world. They have to be in the cyclone, but still rooted in their centres. Let the cyclone surround you -- it has its own beauty -- but you remain unaffected, calm and cool and centred, and then the beauty is a thousand times more.\nAnuradha is the name of Krishna's beloved. The name is Anuradha but in love it can be pronounced Anuradhe. It becomes more beautiful, more rounded. Anuradha looks square, Anuradhe becomes circular.\nWords also have shapes. Just a little change and a word becomes a totally different thing -- if its shape changes.\nThe woman, Anuradha, is very mysterious in a way, because no scripture mentions her. Because of that many historians think that it is a latter addition -- that's not true. In the ancient scriptures Anuradha is mentioned but not by her name, for the simple reason that she effaced herself totally. And that's what love can do: it can efface you totally, it can help you to become absolutely egoless. That's what happened to Anuradha.\nThe ancient scriptures only say that there was one woman who followed Krishna just like a shadow --\nthat's the only mention. No name is mentioned, nothing else is said about the woman except that she was just like a shadow. Love can do that miracle.\nIn love one becomes so one with the beloved that there is no need for a separate\nname. And 'just like a shadow' is also very significant. Lovers quarrelling, fighting, nagging each other, arguing, is something which is not love-like at all. But that's what the contemporary idea has become: lovers encountering.\nMost of the time they encounter each other. Love is only just a break, a love break, and again the encounter starts. And here I have many sannyasins who are great encounter-addicts! (laughter) When they become tired of encountering then there is a little bit of love. That is just to keep things going on so that they remain glued together. Love is just like a glue. But the whole purpose is encounter!\nThat was not the ancient ideal of love; it was totally different, a completely different perspective. Lovers have to be so deeply in tune with each other that they lose all separate identity, they become shadows to each other. That's what I love in Anuradha -- that she is only mentioned as a shadow. Nobody knew who she was, what her name was, but she always followed Krishna wherever he went, just like a shadow serving him, loving him, showering him with her love, asking nothing in return. And she must have been absolutely non-possessive because Krishna had many women who loved him. There is not a single mention of any argument between Anuradha and Krishna, no encounter...\nIt will look unbelievable to modern psychologists who think lovers are nothing but intimate enemies.\nAnd they are right as far as modern lovers are con-cerned: they are intimate enemies. In fact, they are only enemies; just to be polite we call them intimate enemies. The 'intimate' has to be put in brackets. It happens only once in a while, that intimacy. But the ancient ideal of love was certainly just intimacy, pure intimacy, a surrender. That is the message of your name,\nTo be with a master is an intimate love affair. It is not a logical relationship, not a rational phenomenon; it is utter irrational, absurd. You cannot prove it, you cannot convince anybody. You can simply say something has happened which is incomprehensible to others.\nJust today I was reading about two young women, two twin sisters in England, who have become a problem to the psychologists. Never such a case has happened before. It is really something very unique: they have two bodies and one mind. Twins are alike physically, but these twins are psychologically alike.\nIf one gets angry the other gets angry, immediately, for no reason at all. Not only that, their facial expression in anger is the same. Not only that, if they become angry -- that means if one becomes angry and starts saying something -- they start shouting both together and the same words come from both, as if one mind is functioning in two bodies. They are the same words, exactly same words. In any mood -- in love, in anger, whenever they are just warmed up -- they say the same words, they make the same gestures; even if they are in two separate rooms it happens the same way. If one falls ill, the other falls ill -- it is the same illness.\nThey may be far away, there is no question of infection, but they fall ill and they get healthy at the same time.\nThey both fell in love with one person. The man of course escaped, because he would have gone crazy with these two women! (laughter) Just one is enough, and two exactly alike... He escaped, he got married as 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nquickly as possible, because when you hare a woman you are protected, otherwise those two were chasing him. But he was a cabdriver, so whenever these two women found him driving the cab anywhere they would both fall in front of the cab and would start saying the same things. A crowd would gather, and it was a scene to watch: exactly the same words glowing!\nNow psychologists are studying... They can only think that it is something like telepathy perhaps; they can find nothing else. But this has happened many times between a master and disciple.

people. The very idea of ruling others is ugly; it is political, it is
inhuman. Hence I am giving you the name Veet Dirk: Veet means go beyond
Dirk, go beyond the idea, the desire of domination, of ruling others.
Veet means transcending. It is an ordinary desire in everybody, to
somehow prove superior to others.</p><p>The really superior man has no desire to prove that he is superior --
he simply is! He never becomes a politician, there is no need. The
politician suffers from an inferiority complex, hence to compensate he
projects just the opposite of it into the world; he tries to prove that
he is great, that Alexander the Great, but inside he knows his
emptiness.</p><p>Sannyas means dropping the desire to rule others and putting your
whole energy into conquering yourself, into becoming a matter of one's
own being. And one cannot manage both together. To rule others

destructive. To become a master of oneself one has to go in, one has to
become more loving, more peaceful, more silent, more non-competitive,
more non-ambitious, more and more diving into one's being. A moment
comes when you reach the very centre.</p><p>That moment is the moment of real victory. That is the moment when
one becomes a master.</p><p>And that is worth achieving; all else is just stupid. Prem means
love. Gabriele means God is my strength.</p><p>Man can live either as love or as an ego. These are the two, the only
two alternatives available, the two alternative lifestyles.</p><p>The ego is very attractive because it promises great things, although
it delivers nothing; those goods are never delivered. But it is very
persuasive, seductive. It goes on promising, it goes on alluring, it
goes on telling you that just a few steps more and you will achieve the
goal -- although the goal is never achieved because the goal is like the
horizon. You can go on and on but the distance between you and the
horizon remains the same, for the simple reason that that horizon is
illusory. It exists not, it only appears to; it has no reality.</p><p>The ego creates dreams and fantasies of achieving this, of being
this, of getting that, of reaching there.</p><p>And through all these fantasies it takes you farther and farther away
from yourself. And to be away from one's own self is to be away from
god.</p><p>Love is not at all persuasive. You have to choose it, it does not
propagate itself. It will not prove itself.</p><p>So when the ego style fails -- and it fails only for the intelligent
people, remember; for the stupid it never fails. It fails again and
again, but again and again they are in the same trap; they can be
befooled for their whole life. But the intelligent person sooner or
later -- and it is sooner rather than later -- recognizes that the ego
is just a deceptive phenomenon, a mirage.</p><p>In that failure of the ego lifestyle one moves to egolessness. And
that's what love is: love is egolessness.</p><p>Now there is nowhere to go, nothing to achieve; your whole energy
starts settling, resting within yourself.</p><p>And when it rests at the center one comes to know that one is not,
only God is. "That's the meaning of Gabriele: 'God is my strength, God
is my existence, God is my very being. I am just a small manifestation
of divine energy.'"</p><p>To know it brings great rejoicing. All worries disappear, all
anxieties disappear; now you know that there is somebody far bigger than
you who takes care, who is concerned. You are his project so it is his
business to fulfill it, to help you to be blissful. And he is constantly
trying to reach you to be blissful. And he is constantly trying to reach
you but you are always running, chasing after shadows, hence he cannot
reach you. When you are inside yourself, immediately you hear the still,
small voice within you -- and that becomes the guiding star.</p><p>Then you don't need any scriptures, any morality, any codes of
behavior; you have your own insight --</p><p>now you can know what is right and what is wrong, on your own. And
that has tremendous beauty: to live according to one's own being is to
live authentically. That's the way a sannyasin should live.</p><p>Dhyan Susanne. Dhyan means meditation. Susanne means full of
grace.</p><p>Everybody is born with great grace, beauty and intelligence, but it
has to be discovered. It is only a potential; it has to be actualised.
It is only a seed; you have to sow it, only then will it burst forth
into flowers one day.</p><p>Ordinarily it is invisible. You cannot see the flowers in the seed.
Even if you cut the seed you will not find any colour, any fragrance,
nothing, no foliage, and you know this seed <em>has</em> all that.
Millions of flowers are possible through it, for years and years
millions of leaves, greenery, will come out of it; it has infinite
potential, but that potential has to become a tree, a reality.</p><p>Man is a seed full of grace, full of beauty, full of wisdom, full of
god -- but he is only a seed. Meditation is the way to make that seed
sprout. Meditation is nothing but preparing the ground, withdrawing all
the stones, weeds, roots, all</p><p>that is non-essential, so that the essential can have space enough to
grow. Meditation only creates space within you by taking out all the
weeds.</p><p>Thoughts are weeds, desires are weeds, memories are weeds -- and they
all have to be taken out, root and all. Once the space is there you will
be surprised: suddenly roses start growing within you.</p><p>Govindo is a name of god. One may know it one may not know, but one
is a god.</p><p>The function of the master is to remind you, to create a situation in
which you can remember, to create 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

original face.</p><p>But one is not less than god; less than that is all false. Less than
that is our invention, more than that is not possible. So don't settle
for less. Discover the reality of your being. And it is not very far
away either.</p><p>Just a little bit of shaking, jumping, jogging, and you will wake up.
That's what we are doing here, One never knows through what situation
one is going to wake up. Buddha became awakened while he was just
sitting under a tree, like any lazy man -- just sitting, doing nothing.
And we Indians are really efficient at it! (laughter) Perhaps that's why
so many people became Buddhas in India: laziness may be the real cause
of it.</p><p>We know how <em>not</em> to do things. We are really efficient. So he
was just sitting like any other Indian under a tree and he became
awakened.</p><p>If you sit too long under a tree sooner or later you will wake up.
You will get tired of sitting and you will think 'What am I doing?' You
will have to get it. For how long can one sit?</p><p>Somebody can become enlightened while he is dancing. One never knows.
So in</p><p>my commune all kinds of devices are Made available. Try every
possible door. One thing is certain, that there is one door for you too,
but you will have to knock on many doors before you come to the real
door that will be yours.</p><p>It is a trial-and-error method. There is no other possibility. So do
all that is happening here, participate in everything. Don't be choosey,
because whatsoever you choose you will choose from the mind -- and the
mind is very cunning: it will avoid the door that is really going to be
your door.</p><p>My own observation is that whatsoever the mind chooses is almost
always wrong. So the best way is: whatsoever is available, try; try
everything -- all the meditations, all the groups. One never knows in
what situation the lightning will happen. But it happens -- that much is
certain.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- One month.</p><p>-- That is not like a Japanese! (Osho shakes his head slowly, looking
smilingly at Govindo, and does it for so long that everyone begins to
laugh.)</p><p>Next time come for a longer period! Good. Anurage means pure
love.</p><p>Love can be impure, then it creates bondage. When it is pure it
brings freedom. The whole process of sannyas is of purifying your
love-energy. It is mixed with many things, because our society makes
every child a mess. There is lust, which is not love but millions of
people think that is love; it is just a biological instinct. It is just
nature trying to continue the race. It has nothing to do with you; it is
almost impersonal.</p><p>Love is not possessiveness; many people think that's what love is:
you possess somebody totally. To possess somebody is to destroy all
possibility of love. Possessiveness can be hate but cannot be love, it
can be fear but it cannot be love.</p><p>One has to drop possessiveness, one has to drop the very idea of
dominating, one has to give freedom if one wants freedom. Whatsoever you
want for yourself give to others. And if you cannot give even to those
you love, to whom else can</p><p>you give it? And the only gift worth giving is freedom. And the
miracle is that the moment love gives freedom it becomes pure,
absolutely pure. And in that purity it rises to its ultimate height.
That height is prayer. At that height you start meeting, merging with
the eternal, with the infinite.</p><p>Nothing else is needed if one can go on watching all those elements
which made one's love impure and drop them so ultimately only love is
left. Then love is just fragrance -- so sweet and of such grandeur that
one cannot imagine it, there is no way to imagine it, one can only
experience it. It is of the beyond, penetrating the thick layers of the
earthen existence. It is like a ray coming from the ultimate source.
Jesus says god is love -- and he is right.</p><p>Gopalo is a name of god.</p><p>Every man should be reminded again and again that he is a god. In
fact we do just the opposite: we remind every man that he is nothing but
an animal. This has been particularly so since Charles Darwin. That man
is nothing but an evolution of a certain animal species has become a
popular myth, although it is absolutely ungrounded and no proof exists
for it. The Darwinians have not been able to provide a single proof that
monkeys have become men. If it were true then we would see at least a
few monkeys becoming men today also. There is no record of that. At
least ten thousand-year-old scriptures exist: not at a single point has
anybody seen a monkey becoming a man (laughter). Sometimes it happens
that a man becomes a monkey (laughter) and goes crazy, nuts, but vice
versa has never happened.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>But Darwinians go on believing it and they have polluted the whole
mind of man for all these years and now everybody has accepted the idea.
That idea has been one of the greatest hindrances in human
evolution.</p><p>The old idea, that man comes from god, was far more significant
because it gives you an impetus, a challenge. If you come from god than
you <em>are</em> god; then there</p><p>is a possibility for you to regain, to reclaim, your inheritance. But
if you come from monkeys, what challenge is there? One just feels a
little awkward, that's all; one wants to hide somewhere. And one feels
as if one has come to the ultimate peak of evolution</p><p>-- what more can you do?</p><p>Monkeys have done great work. Buddha is a monkey, Jesus is a monkey,
Lao Tzu is a monkey -- what else can you think of? Monkeys have done
miracles! But this is just an absurd idea, utterly unscientific.</p><p>Science is burdened with many superstitions; this is one of the
superstitions of science.</p><p>I insist that man comes from god. In fact I insist that even monkeys
come from god; <em>all</em> that exists comes from god. God is our only
source, and unless we again reach that source we will remain
discontented.</p><p>Sannyas is a deliberate effort to regain our real source, to again
become part of the reality from which we have become uprooted.</p><p>Rishiraj. Rishi is a very specific word. There is no equivalent in
English for it, in fact in no other language is there an equivalent for
it. All the languages have just one word for the poet; only Sanskrit has
two words for the poet. One is "kavi" which is exactly synonymous with
poetry; the other is "rishi" which is something plus -- but that plus is
mysterious, very mysterious.</p><p>The rishi <em>is</em> a poet but in a very special sense. The poet
composes poetry but there are only a few moments when he functions as a
poet, otherwise he is an ordinary man. No poet is a poet for twenty-four
hours a day. Yes, there are moments when windows open and he can see
into the beyond and he can bring great treasures from that experience.
But those windows open and close, and he is not the master of those
windows; whenever they open they open.…</p><p>Coleridge, a great English poet, died with thousands of incomplete
poems. His friends insisted again and again "Why don't you complete
these poems?" Sometimes only a single line was needed and the poem would
be complete. It would be such a beautiful poem that it would be
unfortunate if it remained incomplete. But Coleridge was insistent, he
said, "No, I cannot complete it because I have not composed it.</p><p>Only once in a while am I a poet and at that moment something starts
flowing through me. I cannot claim that I am the author of it but just
the vehicle, so whatsoever comes, comes. If the process, if the energy,
stops in the middle, I stop, I have to stop. I have tried many times to
complete it but my line seems to be very far away from the other lines
that have come on their own. It does not fit</p><p>-- there is a qualitative difference." And he was right.</p><p>A rishi is a poet who is a poet twenty-four hours a day, who knows
the art of opening the window whenever he wants to open it. The poet is
in a way unconscious. The rishi is a conscious poet; he is an awakened
poet, an enlightened poet.</p><p>It is not a question of him feeling poetry flowing through him once
in a while; it is flowing <em>all</em> the time, twenty-four hours a
day. That's the meaning of rishi.</p><p>And Raj means a king. A poet who is a poet twenty-four hours a day is
certainly a king; he has found the real kingdom -- the kingdom of
god.</p><p>Narayani. Narayani is a very significant name. 'Nar' means man, and
Narayana means god in man.</p><p>Narayani is the feminine form of Narayana.</p><p>Man is not only man. From the outside he is man, from the inside he
is god. Jesus says many times 'I am the son of man,' and many times 'I
am the son of god.' For two thousand years Christian theologists have
been pondering, discussing, analysing, arguing about why he uses these
two expressions. Either he is a son of man or he is a son of god. How
can he be both? But everybody is both, it is not only Jesus. Jesus is
simply representing a truth about everybody: from the outside we are
sons of man, from the inside we are sons of god. Our body comes from our
parents and our consciousness comes from god himself. So we are the
meeting place of these two, the physical and the supraphysical.</p><p>Narayani means the meeting of the physical and the non-physical.
Unfortunate are those people who think themselves only physical. Those
people are in a far better way, far more fortunate are those who think
themselves spiritual. But the ultimate joy and the blessing and the
benediction belongs to the third category that knows that we are
both.</p><p>And that's exactly my approach, that man should live both sides, the
exterior and</p><p>the interior, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

escape to a monastery, and there is no need to become just a worldly
man, a Rotarian, etcetera. You have to be both because only when you are
both does a synthesis happen in you, a synthesis which takes you beyond
both, which leads you to the transcendental.</p><p>So my sannyasins have to live in the world without being part of the
world. They have to be in the cyclone, but still rooted in their
centres. Let the cyclone surround you -- it has its own beauty -- but
you remain unaffected, calm and cool and centred, and then the beauty is
a thousand times more.</p><p>Anuradha is the name of Krishna's beloved. The name is Anuradha but
in love it can be pronounced Anuradhe. It becomes more beautiful, more
rounded. Anuradha looks square, Anuradhe becomes circular.</p><p>Words also have shapes. Just a little change and a word becomes a
totally different thing -- if its shape changes.</p><p>The woman, Anuradha, is very mysterious in a way, because no
scripture mentions her. Because of that many historians think that it is
a latter addition -- that's not true. In the ancient scriptures Anuradha
is mentioned but not by her name, for the simple reason that she effaced
herself totally. And that's what love can do: it can efface you totally,
it can help you to become absolutely egoless. That's what happened to
Anuradha.</p><p>The ancient scriptures only say that there was one woman who followed
Krishna just like a shadow --</p><p>that's the only mention. No name is mentioned, nothing else is said
about the woman except that she was just like a shadow. Love can do that
miracle.</p><p>In love one becomes so one with the beloved that there is no need for
a separate</p><p>name. And 'just like a shadow' is also very significant. Lovers
quarrelling, fighting, nagging each other, arguing, is something which
is not love-like at all. But that's what the contemporary idea has
become: lovers encountering.</p><p>Most of the time they encounter each other. Love is only just a
break, a love break, and again the encounter starts. And here I have
many sannyasins who are great encounter-addicts! (laughter) When they
become tired of encountering then there is a little bit of love. That is
just to keep things going on so that they remain glued together. Love is
just like a glue. But the whole purpose is encounter!</p><p>That was not the ancient ideal of love; it was totally different, a
completely different perspective. Lovers have to be so deeply in tune
with each other that they lose all separate identity, they become
shadows to each other. That's what I love in Anuradha -- that she is
only mentioned as a shadow. Nobody knew who she was, what her name was,
but she always followed Krishna wherever he went, just like a shadow
serving him, loving him, showering him with her love, asking nothing in
return. And she must have been absolutely non-possessive because Krishna
had many women who loved him. There is not a single mention of any
argument between Anuradha and Krishna, no encounter...</p><p>It will look unbelievable to modern psychologists who think lovers
are nothing but intimate enemies.</p><p>And they are right as far as modern lovers are con-cerned: they
<em>are</em> intimate enemies. In fact, they are only enemies; just to
be polite we call them intimate enemies. The 'intimate' has to be put in
brackets. It happens only once in a while, that intimacy. But the
ancient ideal of love was certainly just intimacy, pure intimacy, a
surrender. That is the message of your name,</p><p>To be with a master is an intimate love affair. It is not a logical
relationship, not a rational phenomenon; it is utter irrational, absurd.
You cannot prove it, you cannot convince anybody. You can simply say
something has happened which is incomprehensible to others.</p><p>Just today I was reading about two young women, two twin sisters in
England, who have become a problem to the psychologists. Never such a
case has happened before. It is really something very unique: they have
two bodies and one mind. Twins are alike physically, but these twins are
psychologically alike.</p><p>If one gets angry the other gets angry, immediately, for no reason at
all. Not only that, their facial expression in anger is the same. Not
only that, if they become angry -- that means if one becomes angry and
starts saying something -- they start shouting both together and the
same words come from both, as if one mind is functioning in two bodies.
They are the same words, exactly same words. In any mood -- in love, in
anger, whenever they are just warmed up -- they say the same words, they
make the same gestures; even if they are in two separate rooms it
happens the same way. If one falls ill, the other falls ill -- it is the
same illness.</p><p>They may be far away, there is no question of infection, but they
fall ill and they get healthy at the same time.</p><p>They both fell in love with one person. The man of course escaped,
because he would have gone crazy with these two women! (laughter) Just
one is enough, and two exactly alike... He escaped, he got married as

otherwise those two were chasing him. But he was a cabdriver, so
whenever these two women found him driving the cab anywhere they would
both fall in front of the cab and would start saying the same things. A
crowd would gather, and it was a scene to watch: exactly the same words
glowing!</p><p>Now psychologists are studying... They can only think that it is
something like telepathy perhaps; they can find nothing else. But this
has happened many times between a master and disciple. This has happened
many times between lovers. With Anuradha it must have happened.</p><p>And when it happens between a master and disciple then one
consciousness starts functioning between two bodies. That is communion,
that is Satsanga -- and that's the whole purpose of this commune of
sannyasins.</p><p>So be ready for some crazy things to happen! Right?

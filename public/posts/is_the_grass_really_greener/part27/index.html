It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand Pushpo. Anand means bliss. Pushpo means flowering.\nThe experience of bliss has many aspects to it. The first and the most significant aspect is that it is just like a flower opening.\nWe are born as buds, our petals are closed, and millions of people die as they are born, on the same spot, in the same space, without opening up to life. And unless the flower opens to the sun, to the wind, to the rain, it does not really exist. It comes into real being only when its fragrance is released. And bliss is a fragrance.\nUnless a person becomes blissful he has lived in vain, meaninglessly,\naccidentally, just like driftwood, at the mercy of the winds and the waves. He knows nothing about who he is, where he is going, why he is going, from where he comes. He is absolutely unaware of the origin, of the goal, of the journey. Just like a somnambulist, a sleepwalker, he goes on and on from the cradle to the grave, but in between nothing happens. Life remains empty.\nA closed life is an empty life. The open life -- all the doors, all the windows open\n-- is an authentic life. Then one is really born.\nThe first birth is only physical, the second birth that happens through opening up is spiritual. Sannyas is the alchemy for the second birth. And it is never too late; it is only a question of making it a commitment, a decision. Once the decision to open to existence is total, then it can happen to the child, it can happen to the young person, it can happen to the old person, it can even happen at the last moment of life. If just for the last moment one opens up, life is fulfilled. Then one knows there is no death, then one knows that life goes on and on, in different forms. It is an eternal process, an eternal river.\nAnand Chhanda. Anand means bliss. Chhanda means a song that springs within your being -- the second aspect of bliss.\nBliss cannot remain unexpressed; that is impossible, that is against the law of existence. You can keep misery unexpressed, but you cannot keep bliss unexpressed; it starts overflowing from you! It is like fire, how can you hide it? It is like the sunrise, it is bound to radiate. It is inevitable that bliss becomes a song, a dance; music, celebration -- all that is contained in the word 'chhanda'. And unless your heart overflows with joy, you are not even aware of having a heart.\nPeople think there is no heart and through medical examination no heart is found. The heart the mystics have been talking about, the heart the poets have been singing about, is not found by medical analysis in any post-mortem; what they find is just a breathing system, lungs. And the reason why they cannot find it is that it is not part of the body; it is the opening up of your soul, it is a dance of the spirit. Certainly it does illuminate the body.\nWhen you light a lamp the flame is separate from the glass but the glass radiates it; it filters through the glass but the glass is not the source of the light. If you\ndissect the glass you will not find the light. That's exactly the situation with bliss, bliss happens in the soul -- the soul is invisible, no dissection is possible --\nbut the blissful person mediates it even through his body. Each of his gestures carries the grace of his inner song. His love will be full of joy. Even his aloneness will not be desertlike; it will be the silence of a garden\n-- very pregnant, not dead. Even if the blissful person is silent something within his being goes on speaking.\nOne only needs eyes to see and ears to hear the subtle, to hear the very subtle. Very few people have those eyes and those ears, that's why very few people gather around a Buddha or a Christ or a Zarathustra.\nThe people who gather around these people are capable of seeing something which others are incapable of seeing.\nRemember, your heart starts existing only when you bring joy to your being. So I teach the religion of cheerfulness. One is not to be serious or sad at all, there is no need to be serious or sad. Life has to be taken in playfulness, with great love, laughter and with a sense of humor.\nAnand Suniti. Anand means bliss. Suniti means virtue -- the third aspect of bliss.\nThere are two kinds of virtues possible: one, that is imposed according to the dictates of others -- the society, the state, the race, the religion, the church. It is not true virtue, deep down you are against it. It really creates one of the greatest problems: it creates a split in your being, it makes you doubt.\nOn the surface you are one person, in the depths you are just the opposite of it. The logical conclusion of 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthis process is schizophrenia; and the whole humanity is living in a mild form of schizophrenia. Once in a while the schizophrenia reaches to such a height and\nthe insanity becomes so much that the humanity has to commit a mad act, a suicidal act -- that's what war is. After every ten or twelve years we need a world war; it is a kind of necessity. We are living in such a wrong way, we are living with such insanity hidden in us that sooner or later so much is accumulated that it explodes and then man goes on destroying himself.\nThe real virtue is never according to other's dictates; it comes out of your blissfulness. A blissful person cannot harm anybody, it is impossible. You can give to others only that which you have got. If you are blissful you can only give bliss; if you are not blissful you may intend to give bliss but you will give only misery because that's what you have really got. Intentions don't count. People can create hell for each other with very good intentions. That's what they are doing: parents are doing it for children, children are doing it for parents, students are doing it for teachers, teachers are doing it for students, leaders are doing it for the led, and the led are doing it for the leaders. Everybody is full of good intentions but so full of misery that all those good intentions become vehicles of misery. They prove to be horses and the misery rides on them.\nOnly a blissful person can help others to be blissful.\nAnd that's what virtue is all about: helping others to know themselves, helping others to be themselves, helping others to be blissful, to be creative. But this is possible only if first you become blissful.\nOut of bliss virtue arises naturally. It is a by-product. The cultivated virtue is a false virtue. The natural virtue that comes out of blissfulness is real, authentic, sincere, sane, and it is an immense benediction to others.\nAnand Prema. Anand means bliss. Prema means love -- the fourth aspect of bliss.\nA blissful person cannot help but be loving and a miserable person cannot help but be angry, full of hatred, jealousy, aggression. One can understand why it is so. The miserable person has nothing to be grateful for -- how can he love? He cannot even love himself, how can he love others? He is so miserable that he hates himself. He is constantly condemning himself. He wants to avoid himself, he does not want to look at his face. He finds a thousand and one excuses to remain as far away from his own being as possible\n-- that's what all our occupations and businesses are trying to evade the most\nbasic thing, an encounter with oneself.\nBut it is understandable why people are trying to evade themselves; they are afraid to see that much misery. And then they know that if they are so miserable and they become aware of it, then it will be impossible to live at all, that misery will drown them. Then suicide will be the only outlet. So it is better not to look at it, to ignore it, to repress it, to throw it into the basement of the unconscious.\nBut whatsoever you do with it, if you are miserable, you are miserable. You can keep it behind you but it is there and working from behind. And it is going to influence, contaminate and pollute your whole life.\nAnd because the miserable person cannot love himself he cannot love others -- although he tries very much to love somebody. That too is a strategy to evade his own being; he wants to become interested in somebody, focussed on somebody -\n- that's what he calls love. But whomsoever he loves he cripples, paralyses, destroys, because his misery is there; he is carrying poison within himself.\nIn ancient India the kings used to have a few poison girls -- they were called poison girls. From the very first day if a beautiful girl was born to somebody then the girl was slowly fed poison in very small doses, and the doses would go on increasing as she grew. By the time she was a young girl her whole bloodstream would be full of poison. All the kings used to have a few poison girls to use as detectives or to use as murderers. It was a very subtle strategy, they were so beautiful that anybody was bound to fall in love with them. They would be sent to the enemy and the enemy was bound to fall in love. Just by kissing the girl the person would become unconscious; making love to the poison girl was enough to kill anybody!\nThis is really our situation people are full of poison -- poison girls and poison boys, playgirls and playboys -- all are full of poison, but because both are poisonous they don't kill each other, they somehow survive. But survival is not life. They make each other's life miserable.\nIt is only through bliss that real love moment you are blissful you love without any motivation. It is not an escape from yourself; it is sharing, it is your joy to share it. You don't put any conditions on it, you don't ask anything in return. You don't even create the feeling in the other person that he or she is obliged to you.\nYou simply give with no motive, with no desire. You give because you have so\nmuch, you give out of your abundance -- that is love. And whomsoever such love touches, his life is transformed, his life also starts having a new fragrance, a new flavour.\nIt is a magical touch -- but this magic is possible only if one is overflowing with bliss. And that is our 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbirthright: we can be blissful, we have all the potential, it is just that we have never tried it. We have not looked at it, we have never worked it out. We have been running from misery rather than taking hold of it and trying to understand its roots and its causes.\nOnce you understand its roots and causes, in that very understanding is the ending of misery. And the ending of misery is the beginning of bliss. The cessation of misery is the birth of bliss, and bliss brings love.\nJust as your shadow follows you, love follows bliss. And this is all a person needs: blissfulness inside and the sharing of love outside.\nAnand Anubhava. Anand means bliss. Anubhava means experience -- the fifth quality of bliss. It is not a thought, it is an experience.\nOne can think about water, and the thirsty person does naturally think about water, but thinking is not going to quench his thirst. He may go on reading all that is written about water, he may understand the formula H2O, he may go into every aspect, he may create a whole philosophy about water; he may even try to build a whole system of life and water may be used as the most basic element -- Heraclitus says that water is the most fundamental element -- but his thirst will remain unquenched. You have to drink water, not talk about it, not philosophise about it. And by drinking, the thirst disappears. Whether you know the chemistry of the water or not does not matter; what matters is that you have experienced it. The same is true about bliss.\nThere are many people who go on thinking about it, about what it is.\nPhilosophers do great work, and their whole work is an exercise in utter futility. They write great treatises about every conceivable subject, but their own life remains absolutely empty.\nMy effort here is not to help you to become capable of philosophising but to be fulfilled, to be contented\n-- and that is possible only through experience. Experience is not of the mind and experience is not of the heart; experience belongs to your totality. Experience is very inclusive it includes your body, your mind, your heart, your being. Its roots are in your being, its trunk is in your heart, its branches in your mind, its flowers in your body, but your whole being is involved, your whole existence is involved.\nEach experience has a totality, an organic unity, it is not fragmentary. Thinking is only of the mind, feeling is only of the heart, action is only of the body, and meditation is only of the being -- but these are all fragments. When all these four are together in a deep harmony, functioning, humming, in organic oneness, then there is experience. And bliss is an experience.\nSo nothing has to be rejected, all has to be absorbed. That's why I am against renunciation, repression, rejection. One has to say yes to life with one's totality and then one becomes worthy of receiving the gift of bliss. It certainly comes. You just have to say yes so totally that there is nowhere, in any nook and corner of your being, where any no is hiding. when your whole being is just yes and nothing else, immediately bliss showers on you and then it goes on showering forever!\nAnand Alok. Anand means bliss. Alok means light -- this is the sixth aspect of bliss.\nMisery is dark, it is darkness. In the miserable person you can see a certain darkness, a certain dark aura around him. You can feel that he is dragging a load, a weight; you can see that he is living but reluctantly.\nSomehow he is managing, but it is not a dance, it is just a management. He is keeping himself together, otherwise any moment he can fall apart.\nIf you look within the miserable person you will find nothing but a dark night of the soul -- no stars, no moon, just pure darkness. Just the opposite is the case\nwith bliss, it is a full-moon, the sun is at its height, at its climax, your whole being is sunlit.\nDarkness is cold, hence the miserable person be-comes cold, cold like steel. For example, Joseph Stalin must have been very miserable. He was. Stalin is not his real name. In Russian Stalin means a man of steel; it was given to him because he was so cold and so hard and so cruel. Of course the people who called him Stalin were praising him because he was a man of steel, unbendable, strong. But that strength is ugly; it is the strength of violence.\nThe miserable person is always violent. He has a certain strength, there is no doubt about it he can destroy, he enjoys destroying, he knows no other joy except destruction. He can tortureS he can torture others, he can torture himself, but he is bound to torture. He has nothing else in life -- no creativity, no poetry, no rejoicing. His life is a black hole in which everything dies.\nThe blissful person is creative, loving, full of light and also light weight-wise, he is weightless. He can fly! There is no height which is not possible for him.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe change from darkness to light is very simple, because all the ingredients which are needed to create light in you are there. The lamp is there, the wick is there, the oil is there, the matchbox is there. Just a little intelligence to put things in a certain order is needed.\nAnd that's what I call sannyas: a little intelligence to put things together. You need not go outside to look for anything; all that you need has been given to you from the very beginning. But things are upside-down. It is like a jigsaw puzzle; there is a solution to it -- just a little intelligence... It is like a room where the furniture is put upside-down and the chandelier is on the floor and the chair is hanging in place of the chandelier and all the paintings are upside-down. It looks crazy but a little intelligence and you can put things where they belong.\nAnd once this discrimination about where a thing is needed has come to you, you can sort out the mess inside. And the same things which were making the mess make a beautiful cosy house to live in. And when there is light there is warmth -- and warmth is another name of love, another name of creativity, another name of prayer. And the person who is full of light can help many others to become lighted.\nIt is not accidental that we call this state enlightenment -- one is just pure light -- but whenever a man of pure light comes into contact with somebody who is not yet lighted, a process is triggered. He becomes a catalytic agent. And that's the relationship between the master and the disciple. The master is already aflame. The disciple comes close to the master and at a certain closeness the flame from the master jumps into the disciple and suddenly, lo and behold (he says this as if it is in inverted commas; we laugh) the darkness is over and the light has arrived, and with light comes life.\nAnand Divyo. Anand means bliss. Divyo means divine -- that's the seventh aspect of bliss. It is the most divine experience in life, or maybe it is the only divine experience in life. All other experiences which look divine are bound to have something of bliss in them. Love looks divine but it is only divine because it shares a certain space with bliss. There is some overlapping with bliss. Truth looks divine -- again there is the same overlapping. Creativity is divine but again there is the same overlapping. Wherever you find any proof for more than matter, for something higher than matter, then one thing is certain: bliss must be present there.\nThere is no god as is being taught in the churches and the temples and the schools. It is just a cock-and-bull story, manufactured for childish people. But there are very few people who are not childish, there are very few people who are really mature, hence a mature religion is non-existential. All religions are childish. Worshipping a statue is childish, praying to some god as if he is a person somewhere above in the sky is childish. There is nobody to listen and nobody to answer; you are simply in a monologue but you can think it is a dialogue. All prayers are monologues, but one can believe. Belief as such is childish.\nThe mature person wants to know, not to believe; his whole effort is for knowledge, he wants to experience on his own. He is not ready to believe because some guy two thousand years ago experienced god. Who knows\nwhether he really experienced god or was just hallucinating? Who knows whether he was really an experienced person or was just trying to exploit people and their gullibility? And who knows whether he really existed or not? -- there is no guarantee.\nUnless you yourself experience it, god does not exist. And when you experience it you always experience godliness, not god. And that godliness comes as an experience of bliss, tremendous bliss, great ecstasy.\nSo remember not to be bothered with prayer, not to be bothered with statues, not to be bothered with rituals, not to be bothered with scriptures, not to be bothered with the priests. Only one thing is needed be silent, be utterly silent. I call it meditation. And out of that silence bliss starts arising in you and goes on arising, goes on reaching higher and higher planes. And as bliss reaches higher you reach higher. A moment comes when bliss becomes just like an Everest, sunlit peaks of virgin snow. Those are the moments for which we have all been longing for lives together. And they can happen any moment -- just the right perspective is needed and the right direction. One can go on searching in the wrong place, in the wrong direction, and one will never find.\nAnd one thing mores bliss is something feminine. Perhaps that's why all the seven sannyasins (tonight, awaiting initiation) were women. There was one man but he had to leave. He was looking really out of tune\n-- and he also felt that and started coughing! (laughter) So that is the last aspect of bliss -- it is feminine.\nEven if a man is to attain it he has to become a little bit feminine, he has to become like a womb so that he can be pregnant with the divine, so he can carry the divine in his being.\nThe male mind is aggressive, the feminine mind is receptive, and bliss comes to those who are receptive.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOpen the door -- and it is already standing at your door. Just open the door, say hello and it comes in!\n(laughter) It won't knock on the door and it certainly won't ring the bell (laughter); it will wait. Unless you invite it, it won't make any noise.\nOne has to invite and welcome it; one has to become a host, then bliss comes as a guest. And the moment bliss enters your being, for the first time you know the grandeur, the splendour, of life. For the first time you become aware of what a gift has been given to you.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Anand Pushpo. Anand means bliss. Pushpo means flowering.</p><p>The experience of bliss has many aspects to it. The first and the
most significant aspect is that it is just like a flower opening.</p><p>We are born as buds, our petals are closed, and millions of people
die as they are born, on the same spot, in the same space, without
opening up to life. And unless the flower opens to the sun, to the wind,
to the rain, it does not really exist. It comes into real being only
when its fragrance is released. And bliss is a fragrance.</p><p>Unless a person becomes blissful he has lived in vain,
meaninglessly,</p><p>accidentally, just like driftwood, at the mercy of the winds and the
waves. He knows nothing about who he is, where he is going, why he is
going, from where he comes. He is absolutely unaware of the origin, of
the goal, of the journey. Just like a somnambulist, a sleepwalker, he
goes on and on from the cradle to the grave, but in between nothing
happens. Life remains empty.</p><p>A closed life is an empty life. The open life -- all the doors, all
the windows open</p><p>-- is an authentic life. Then one is really born.</p><p>The first birth is only physical, the second birth that happens
through opening up is spiritual. Sannyas is the alchemy for the second
birth. And it is never too late; it is only a question of making it a
commitment, a decision. Once the decision to open to existence is total,
then it can happen to the child, it can happen to the young person, it
can happen to the old person, it can even happen at the last moment of
life. If just for the last moment one opens up, life is fulfilled. Then
one knows there is no death, then one knows that life goes on and on, in
different forms. It is an eternal process, an eternal river.</p><p>Anand Chhanda. Anand means bliss. Chhanda means a song that springs
within your being -- the second aspect of bliss.</p><p>Bliss cannot remain unexpressed; that is impossible, that is against
the law of existence. You can keep misery unexpressed, but you cannot
keep bliss unexpressed; it starts overflowing from you! It is like fire,
how can you hide it? It is like the sunrise, it is bound to radiate. It
is inevitable that bliss becomes a song, a dance; music, celebration --
all that is contained in the word 'chhanda'. And unless your heart
overflows with joy, you are not even aware of having a heart.</p><p>People think there is no heart and through medical examination no
heart is found. The heart the mystics have been talking about, the heart
the poets have been singing about, is not found by medical analysis in
any post-mortem; what they find is just a breathing system, lungs. And
the reason why they cannot find it is that it is not part of the body;
it is the opening up of your soul, it is a dance of the spirit.
Certainly it does illuminate the body.</p><p>When you light a lamp the flame is separate from the glass but the
glass radiates it; it filters through the glass but the glass is not the
source of the light. If you</p><p>dissect the glass you will not find the light. That's exactly the
situation with bliss, bliss happens in the soul -- the soul is
invisible, no dissection is possible --</p><p>but the blissful person mediates it even through his body. Each of
his gestures carries the grace of his inner song. His love will be full
of joy. Even his aloneness will not be desertlike; it will be the
silence of a garden</p><p>-- very pregnant, not dead. Even if the blissful person is silent
something within his being goes on speaking.</p><p>One only needs eyes to see and ears to hear the subtle, to hear the
very subtle. Very few people have those eyes and those ears, that's why
very few people gather around a Buddha or a Christ or a Zarathustra.</p><p>The people who gather around these people are capable of seeing
something which others are incapable of seeing.</p><p>Remember, your heart starts existing only when you bring joy to your
being. So I teach the religion of cheerfulness. One is not to be serious
or sad at all, there is no need to be serious or sad. Life has to be
taken in playfulness, with great love, laughter and with a sense of
humor.</p><p>Anand Suniti. Anand means bliss. Suniti means virtue -- the third
aspect of bliss.</p><p>There are two kinds of virtues possible: one, that is imposed
according to the dictates of others -- the society, the state, the race,
the religion, the church. It is not true virtue, deep down you are
against it. It really creates one of the greatest problems: it creates a
split in your being, it makes you doubt.</p><p>On the surface you are one person, in the depths you are just the
opposite of it. The logical conclusion of 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>this process is schizophrenia; and the whole humanity is living in a
mild form of schizophrenia. Once in a while the schizophrenia reaches to
such a height and</p><p>the insanity becomes so much that the humanity has to commit a mad
act, a suicidal act -- that's what war is. After every ten or twelve
years we need a world war; it is a kind of necessity. We are living in
such a wrong way, we are living with such insanity hidden in us that
sooner or later so much is accumulated that it explodes and then man
goes on destroying himself.</p><p>The real virtue is never according to other's dictates; it comes out
of your blissfulness. A blissful person cannot harm anybody, it is
impossible. You can give to others only that which you have got. If you
are blissful you can only give bliss; if you are not blissful you may
intend to give bliss but you will give only misery because that's what
you have really got. Intentions don't count. People can create hell for
each other with very good intentions. That's what they are doing:
parents are doing it for children, children are doing it for parents,
students are doing it for teachers, teachers are doing it for students,
leaders are doing it for the led, and the led are doing it for the
leaders. Everybody is full of good intentions but so full of misery that
all those good intentions become vehicles of misery. They prove to be
horses and the misery rides on them.</p><p>Only a blissful person can help others to be blissful.</p><p>And that's what virtue is all about: helping others to know
themselves, helping others to be themselves, helping others to be
blissful, to be creative. But this is possible only if first
<em>you</em> become blissful.</p><p>Out of bliss virtue arises naturally. It is a by-product. The
cultivated virtue is a false virtue. The natural virtue that comes out
of blissfulness is real, authentic, sincere, sane, and it is an immense
benediction to others.</p><p>Anand Prema. Anand means bliss. Prema means love -- the fourth aspect
of bliss.</p><p>A blissful person cannot help but be loving and a miserable person
cannot help but be angry, full of hatred, jealousy, aggression. One can
understand why it is so. The miserable person has nothing to be grateful
for -- how can he love? He cannot even love himself, how can he love
others? He is so miserable that he <em>hates</em> himself. He is
constantly condemning himself. He wants to avoid himself, he does not
want to look at his face. He finds a thousand and one excuses to remain
as far away from his own being as possible</p><p>-- that's what all our occupations and businesses are trying to evade
the most</p><p>basic thing, an encounter with oneself.</p><p>But it is understandable why people are trying to evade themselves;
they are afraid to see that much misery. And then they know that if they
are so miserable and they become aware of it, then it will be impossible
to live at all, that misery will drown them. Then suicide will be the
only outlet. So it is better not to look at it, to ignore it, to repress
it, to throw it into the basement of the unconscious.</p><p>But whatsoever you do with it, if you are miserable, you are
miserable. You can keep it behind you but it is there and working from
behind. And it is going to influence, contaminate and pollute your whole
life.</p><p>And because the miserable person cannot love himself he cannot love
others -- although he tries very much to love somebody. That too is a
strategy to evade his own being; he wants to become interested in
somebody, focussed on somebody -</p><p>- that's what he calls love. But whomsoever he loves he cripples,
paralyses, destroys, because his misery is there; he is carrying poison
within himself.</p><p>In ancient India the kings used to have a few poison girls -- they
were called poison girls. From the very first day if a beautiful girl
was born to somebody then the girl was slowly fed poison in very small
doses, and the doses would go on increasing as she grew. By the time she
was a young girl her whole bloodstream would be full of poison. All the
kings used to have a few poison girls to use as detectives or to use as
murderers. It was a very subtle strategy, they were so beautiful that
anybody was bound to fall in love with them. They would be sent to the
enemy and the enemy was bound to fall in love. Just by kissing the girl
the person would become unconscious; making love to the poison girl was
enough to kill anybody!</p><p>This is really our situation people are full of poison -- poison
girls and poison boys, playgirls and playboys -- all are full of poison,
but because both are poisonous they don't kill each other, they somehow
survive. But survival is not life. They make each other's life
miserable.</p><p>It is only through bliss that real love moment you are blissful you
love without any motivation. It is not an escape from yourself; it is
sharing, it is your joy to share it. You don't put any conditions on it,
you don't ask anything in return. You don't even create the feeling in
the other person that he or she is obliged to you.</p><p>You simply give with no motive, with no desire. You give because you
have so</p><p>much, you give out of your abundance -- that is love. And whomsoever
such love touches, his life is transformed, his life also starts having
a new fragrance, a new flavour.</p><p>It is a magical touch -- but this magic is possible only if one is
overflowing with bliss. And that is our 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>birthright: we can be blissful, we have all the potential, it is just
that we have never tried it. We have not looked at it, we have never
worked it out. We have been running from misery rather than taking hold
of it and trying to understand its roots and its causes.</p><p>Once you understand its roots and causes, in that very understanding
is the ending of misery. And the ending of misery is the beginning of
bliss. The cessation of misery is the birth of bliss, and bliss brings
love.</p><p>Just as your shadow follows you, love follows bliss. And this is all
a person needs: blissfulness inside and the sharing of love outside.</p><p>Anand Anubhava. Anand means bliss. Anubhava means experience -- the
fifth quality of bliss. It is not a thought, it is an experience.</p><p>One can think about water, and the thirsty person does naturally
think about water, but thinking is not going to quench his thirst. He
may go on reading all that is written about water, he may understand the
formula H2O, he may go into every aspect, he may create a whole
philosophy about water; he may even try to build a whole system of life
and water may be used as the most basic element -- Heraclitus says that
water is the most fundamental element -- but his thirst will remain
unquenched. You have to drink water, not talk about it, not philosophise
about it. And by drinking, the thirst disappears. Whether you know the
chemistry of the water or not does not matter; what matters is that you
have experienced it. The same is true about bliss.</p><p>There are many people who go on thinking about it, about what it
is.</p><p>Philosophers do great work, and their whole work is an exercise in
utter futility. They write great treatises about every conceivable
subject, but their own life remains absolutely empty.</p><p>My effort here is not to help you to become capable of philosophising
but to be fulfilled, to be contented</p><p>-- and that is possible only through experience. Experience is not of
the mind and experience is not of the heart; experience belongs to your
totality. Experience is very inclusive it includes your body, your mind,
your heart, your being. Its roots are in your being, its trunk is in
your heart, its branches in your mind, its flowers in your body, but
your whole being is involved, your whole existence is involved.</p><p>Each experience has a totality, an organic unity, it is not
fragmentary. Thinking is only of the mind, feeling is only of the heart,
action is only of the body, and meditation is only of the being -- but
these are all fragments. When all these four are together in a deep
harmony, functioning, humming, in organic oneness, then there is
experience. And bliss is an experience.</p><p>So nothing has to be rejected, all has to be absorbed. That's why I
am against renunciation, repression, rejection. One has to say yes to
life with one's totality and then one becomes worthy of receiving the
gift of bliss. It certainly comes. You just have to say yes so totally
that there is nowhere, in any nook and corner of your being, where any
no is hiding. when your whole being is just yes and nothing else,
immediately bliss showers on you and then it goes on showering
forever!</p><p>Anand Alok. Anand means bliss. Alok means light -- this is the sixth
aspect of bliss.</p><p>Misery is dark, it is darkness. In the miserable person you can see a
certain darkness, a certain dark aura around him. You can feel that he
is dragging a load, a weight; you can see that he is living but
reluctantly.</p><p>Somehow he is managing, but it is not a dance, it is just a
management. He is keeping himself together, otherwise any moment he can
fall apart.</p><p>If you look within the miserable person you will find nothing but a
dark night of the soul -- no stars, no moon, just pure darkness. Just
the opposite is the case</p><p>with bliss, it is a full-moon, the sun is at its height, at its
climax, your whole being is sunlit.</p><p>Darkness is cold, hence the miserable person be-comes cold, cold like
steel. For example, Joseph Stalin must have been very miserable. He
<em>was</em>. Stalin is not his real name. In Russian Stalin means a man
of steel; it was given to him because he was so cold and so hard and so
cruel. Of course the people who called him Stalin were praising him
because he was a man of steel, unbendable, strong. But that strength is
ugly; it is the strength of violence.</p><p>The miserable person is always violent. He has a certain strength,
there is no doubt about it he can destroy, he enjoys destroying, he
knows no other joy except destruction. He can tortureS he can torture
others, he can torture himself, but he is bound to torture. He has
nothing else in life -- no creativity, no poetry, no rejoicing. His life
is a black hole in which everything dies.</p><p>The blissful person is creative, loving, full of light and also light
weight-wise, he is weightless. He can fly! There is no height which is
not possible for him.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The change from darkness to light is very simple, because all the
ingredients which are needed to create light in you are there. The lamp
is there, the wick is there, the oil is there, the matchbox is there.
Just a little intelligence to put things in a certain order is
needed.</p><p>And that's what I call sannyas: a little intelligence to put things
together. You need not go outside to look for anything; all that you
need has been given to you from the very beginning. But things are
upside-down. It is like a jigsaw puzzle; there is a solution to it --
just a little intelligence... It is like a room where the furniture is
put upside-down and the chandelier is on the floor and the chair is
hanging in place of the chandelier and all the paintings are
upside-down. It looks crazy but a little intelligence and you can put
things where they belong.</p><p>And once this discrimination about where a thing is needed has come
to you, you can sort out the mess inside. And the same things which were
making the mess make a beautiful cosy house to live in. And when there
is light there is warmth -- and warmth is another name of love, another
name of creativity, another name of prayer. And the person who is full
of light can help many others to become lighted.</p><p>It is not accidental that we call this state enlightenment -- one is
just pure light -- but whenever a man of pure light comes into contact
with somebody who is not yet lighted, a process is triggered. He becomes
a catalytic agent. And that's the relationship between the master and
the disciple. The master is already aflame. The disciple comes close to
the master and at a certain closeness the flame from the master jumps
into the disciple and suddenly, lo and behold (he says this as if it is
in inverted commas; we laugh) the darkness is over and the light has
arrived, and with light comes life.</p><p>Anand Divyo. Anand means bliss. Divyo means divine -- that's the
seventh aspect of bliss. It is the most divine experience in life, or
maybe it is the only divine experience in life. All other experiences
which look divine are bound to have something of bliss in them. Love
looks divine but it is only divine because it shares a certain space
with bliss. There is some overlapping with bliss. Truth looks divine --
again there is the same overlapping. Creativity is divine but again
there is the same overlapping. Wherever you find any proof for more than
matter, for something higher than matter, then one thing is certain:
bliss must be present there.</p><p>There is no god as is being taught in the churches and the temples
and the schools. It is just a cock-and-bull story, manufactured for
childish people. But there are very few people who are not childish,
there are very few people who are really mature, hence a mature religion
is non-existential. All religions are childish. Worshipping a statue
<em>is</em> childish, praying to some god as if he is a person somewhere
above in the sky <em>is</em> childish. There is nobody to listen and
nobody to answer; you are simply in a monologue but you can think it is
a dialogue. All prayers are monologues, but one can believe. Belief as
such is childish.</p><p>The mature person wants to know, not to believe; his whole effort is
for knowledge, he wants to experience on his own. He is not ready to
believe because some guy two thousand years ago experienced god. Who
knows</p><p>whether he really experienced god or was just hallucinating? Who
knows whether he was really an experienced person or was just trying to
exploit people and their gullibility? And who knows whether he really
existed or not? -- there is no guarantee.</p><p>Unless you yourself experience it, god does not exist. And when you
experience it you always experience godliness, not god. And that
godliness comes as an experience of bliss, tremendous bliss, great
ecstasy.</p><p>So remember not to be bothered with prayer, not to be bothered with
statues, not to be bothered with rituals, not to be bothered with
scriptures, not to be bothered with the priests. Only one thing is
needed be silent, be utterly silent. I call it meditation. And out of
that silence bliss starts arising in you and goes on arising, goes on
reaching higher and higher planes. And as bliss reaches higher
<em>you</em> reach higher. A moment comes when bliss becomes just like
an Everest, sunlit peaks of virgin snow. Those are the moments for which
we have all been longing for lives together. And they can happen any
moment -- just the right perspective is needed and the right direction.
One can go on searching in the wrong place, in the wrong direction, and
one will never find.</p><p>And one thing mores bliss is something feminine. Perhaps that's why
all the seven sannyasins (tonight, awaiting initiation) were women.
There was one man but he had to leave. He was looking really out of
tune</p><p>-- and he also felt that and started coughing! (laughter) So that is
the last aspect of bliss -- it is feminine.</p><p>Even if a man is to attain it he has to become a little bit feminine,
he has to become like a womb so that he can be pregnant with the divine,
so he can carry the divine in his being.</p><p>The male mind is aggressive, the feminine mind is receptive, and
bliss comes to those who are receptive.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

the door, say hello and it comes in!</p><p>(laughter) It won't knock on the door and it certainly won't ring the
bell (laughter); it will wait. Unless you invite it, it won't make any
noise.</p><p>One has to invite and welcome it; one has to become a host, then
bliss comes as a guest. And the moment bliss enters your being, for the
first time you know the grandeur, the splendour, of life. For the first
time you become aware of what a gift has been given to you. And out of
that experience arises gratitude, gratitude towards the whole. To me
that is prayer.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I'm not clear about that. Maybe until the end of January or
longer.</p><p>-- Let it be longer. Be clear about it: longer and longer and longer!

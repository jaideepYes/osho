It is for reference purposes only.]\nDhyan Shemesh. Dhyan means meditation. Shemesh means the center of being. It means the sun and also illumination, enlightenment. It is a beautiful word; it carries the whole dimension of meditation, all its aspects.\nMeditation means reaching the center of your being. It is a journey inwards. The farther away you are from your center, the darker your life is; it is in the same proportion. The closer you are to the center, the less dark it gets, less and less dark. Then a moment comes when you are just in between darkness and light\n-- twilight. In Zen they call it satori -- when the darkness is no more and the light is yet to be, just dawn, the boundary line between the night and the day.\nOne can fall from satori, one can be pulled back again by the darkness. Its forces are great because it is your whole past of thousands of lives. Its weight is great, mountainous. Hence one can fall from satori, one can turn back, one can get afraid.\nToo much light ahead can create fear.\nThat is the moment when the master is needed.\nThere are only two moments when the master is absolutely needed. The first moment is when you start the journey, but even more important than that is the second moment when you reach the twilight zone. That is the most significant moment in the relationship of the master and the disciple because only the master can push you into the unknown world of light.\nOnce you have entered it you are pulled by the center as if through gravitation; it has its own magnetism. Once you are in the field of it you are pulled; then you cannot turn back, then there is no way to go back. Once you have reached the center... in India we have called it samadhi.\nOne cannot fall from samadhi. That is the difference between samadhi and satori. One can have one hundred satoris, but one can have only one samadhi. That is the moment when illumination happens. For the first time you are fully aware of who you are and what this life is all about. One can call it the state of Christ-consciousness or Buddhahood. It is literally enlightenment -- you have become the light. That's the goal of sannyas.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nDhyan Dominique. Dhyan means meditation. Dominique means belonging to god, a child of god.\nIt is only through meditation that one comes to realise that one belongs to god, that one is not without roots in existence. that one is not an orphan. Without meditation one remains an orphan. That is the misery of the man who has never known the taste of meditation. He feels afraid; he is continuously surrounded by all kinds of anxieties and fears. Anguish is there because he cannot see anybody protecting him, there is no security, nobody to look after him. And one seems so small compared to the universe. The universe is so vast, almost like an ocean, and one is just a dewdrop.\nThe moment you understand that the ocean is not your enemy but your home, that you belong to it, that you are inseparably one with it, great rejoicing arises,\nyou feel blessed. One is bathed in a new kind of light which goes on pouring from the beyond.\nMeditation is nothing but the art of opening up to the beyond, of coming to terms with existence, of feeling at home, at rest. Then one lives blissfully, then life has the flavour of a continuous, unending celebration.\nGod cannot be believed in and should not be believed in; god has to be discovered, realised -- and that realisation happens only by becoming silent. Silence is meditation.\nAnand Gerard. Anand means bliss. Gerard has two meanings. One is courageous, the other is a loyal heart. Both are significant as far as sannyas is concerned.\nAnd bliss happens only to a courageous person who has deep trust in life, in existence. who has a loyal heart. In fact that's why courage is needed. Any coward can doubt -- that needs no guts In fact cowards continuously doubt; they live in doubts, they are surrounded by doubts. They doubt everything, they doubt themselves. There are doubts and doubts, it is an almost infinite regress. They even doubt their doubts! They cannot find any place where they can stand in deep trust and loyalty. And how can such a person be blissful? Doubts create misery.\nTrust creates bliss. It is only in trust that life blossoms, that life becomes a prayer. And for trust courage is needed, because to trust means to be capable of opening up to danger, of leaving your doors open for the sun, for the rain, for the wind. But thieves can also enter from the same doors. To close the door because of the thief is to close the door to the sun and to the rain and to the wind. Your doubt, your fear, will create a grave around you; you will live a dead life. You will not be able to love, because who knows? -- the woman may deceive you. In the middle of the night she may cut your throat -- women are dangerous (laughter).\nWho knows what she is going to do -- crazy people! To live with a woman in the same room and be fast asleep and snoring (laughter)... anything is possible!\nAdolf Hitler never got married for the simple reason that he was very much afraid of getting too involved with anybody. He had many love affairs but he was very suspicious. He got married only at the last moment, when he decided to\ncommit suicide -- just before that. Now there was no fear -- what could this woman do? He got married in the middle of the night and the next thing that they did was to commit suicide.\nThe person who has doubts cannot love, the person who has doubts cannot be friendly, the person who has doubts cannot enjoy life. He is always on guard, watching, 'Who is going to deceive me?' Everybody looks like an enemy. He lives in paranoia.\nSannyas means to live fearlessly, open, available, vulnerable, to existence.\nAnd then bliss is a natural consequence. You need not seek bliss, it comes of its own accord. And when it comes of its own accord it never goes; then it is eternal, yours forever.\nPrem Michael. Prem means love. Michael means godly.\nLogic is the farthest from god and love the closest. Those who live in logic live without god; they cannot afford god. They can go on playing with words, theories, philosophies, ideologies, but their life will not have the fragrance of a divine experience. They will never know what Buddha tasted, they will never know what Lao Tzu became drunk with. They are the most unfortunate people on earth.\nOne has to shift one's energies from logic to love. They are polar opposites. Logic is reason, love is absolutely irrational. Logic is of the head and love of the heart; logic is thinking and love is feeling. And nobody, anywhere, is teaching you the art of feeling. From the kindergarten to the university you are taught how to think; you are trained, disciplined, to argue, to think, to philosophize. The whole discipline is of logic, and one gets so involved in it that one tends to forget one's heart. And that is the only door to god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy effort here is to help you to open that door -- and it opens only in one way, there is no other way: when all your energy is pulled out of its investment in logic it is a tremendous force. It rushes against the doors of the heart like a flood and the doors open. Suddenly you are face-to-face with god and for the first time you know what it means to realize god, what it means to feel god. It transforms you totally. Time disappears, mind disappears, death disappears. You are suddenly taken into a totally different dimension of timelessness and deathlessness; you become part of eternity.\nOnly then is there bliss, only then is one for the first time at rest. The journey is complete -- one has arrived.\nAnandesh means god is bliss.\nIn the East the mystics have defined god as satchidanand. It consists of three words, 'sat', 'chid', 'anand'.\n'Sat' means truth, that which is forever; 'chid' means consciousness, awareness, Buddhahood; and 'anand'\nmeans bliss. Anand is the ultimate peak. When you enter into the dimension of the divine, first you encounter truth, then you encounter awareness and then you encounter bliss. This is the eastern trinity. It is certainly far more superior than the Christian idea of god and the holy ghost and the son -- that is very childish, juvenile. But these three qualities are really fundamental qualities and the most important is bliss.\nMy emphasis is that if one can choose to be blissful... And remember, it is a question of choice. Each moment presents you both alternatives, to be miserable or to be blissful. It is up to you.\nA Hassid master was dying and his disciples asked 'Now tell us the secret. We have watched you for almost fifty years and we have never found you sad, not even for a single moment. And we have heard from our fathers and forefathers that in your youth you were a very sad and serious person -- then what happened? How did you become so cheerful?'\nHe said 'They are right, up to my thirtieth year I was a very sad and very serious person. Then one morning I thought \"What am I doing? Why am I so sad and serious? Why should I waste my energies? Let me try today, just for a change, to\nbe cheerful.\" I tried and it worked! Since then every morning when I wake up I ask myself, \"Zusya\" -- Zusya was his name -- \"What do you want today? Do you want to be sad, serious and sad, miserable, or blissful?\" And I always choose to be blissful. Since then I have been blissful.'\nAnd I totally agree with this man Zusya, he is certainly right, it is only a question of choice.\nSo from tomorrow morning try it. You have been serious enough. Or you can start even now. There is no need to wait even for tomorrow, because who knows? -- tomorrow may come, may not come. Give it a try. And believe me, you will like it! (much laughter)\n(Osho slips a mala over the head of the next initiate and touches his third eye. Just before handing him the names sheet, Osho comments: Another serious guy!\nWhere Anandesh did look like a 'serious guy', this new sannyasin dissolves into laughter along with the group.)\nDhyanesh means god of meditation. I am giving you a very serious name! (laughter) But whenever I am serious I am joking (much laughter)... and whenever I am joking I am serious (Osho chuckles). This you have to be absolutely aware of from the very beginning.\nMeditation is a simple art, very simple. It need not be taken seriously. It is so simple that even a child can learn it, in fact a child can learn it more easily. The older one becomes, the more serious one becomes.\nIn fact it is thought that if you are mature you have to be serious. Seriousness and maturity somehow have been associated -- it is a wrong association.\nA really mature person cannot be serious, there is nothing to be serious about. The whole of life is fun, it is a play, a play of consciousness. And that's what meditation reveals to you -- that the whole of life is a beautiful play of energy. The same energy is in the trees, in the stars, in the rivers, in the mountains, in you, in animals. It is the same energy dancing in different forms. We in the East have called it 'leela'; leela means god's play. But the Judaic attitude which is carried by Christianity and Islam is very serious.\nThe Talmud says god is not your uncle, and I say to you he is your uncle!\n(laughter) Forget all about him being your father -- that is a serious thing. He is your uncle and he is a very nice fellow! The Talmud insists that he is not nice, he is not your uncle, be afraid of him. And I say to you, don't be afraid of him, don't be afraid of existence. It is beautiful, there is no need to be afraid. It is not antagonistic to you, it is nourishing to you.\nMeditation reveals many things but the first revelation is the playfulness of existence -- and then one 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecomes like a child.\nJesus says 'Unless you are like small children you will not enter my kingdom of god.' He is right; you have to be like small children, so small that you don't have any weight of experience. Experience makes people serious and a meditator has tn drop all experience, the whole past. He has to bury his past, he has to die every moment to the past so that every moment he is renewed, so that every moment he is a new person.\nAnd then miracles become possible. If you are cheerful the whole existence starts laughing with you!\nThe old proverb is right. Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.\nGyanda means wisdom.\nThe most essential thing to remember about wisdom is that it is not knowledge. Knowledge is ignorance covered with information, a wound covered with flowers; but the wound goes on growing inside and the pus goes on gathering. It is not advisable to hide a wound; it is better to leave it open because if it is open then the wind and the sun and existence, can heal it. But people are very much afraid to show their ignorance, and the only way to hide it is to collect information. That's what knowledge is. Information is utterly useless because it is borrowed.\nWisdom is that which arises in you. It is a growth, not an accumulation; it does not come from the outside. The first step towards wisdom is to accept one's ignorance without any guilt, without any humiliation. It is so, such is the nature of things -- we are born ignorant.\nAnd once you accept it without any judgement, like Socrates did... He said 'I know only one thing, that I know nothing.' That was the moment that the Oracle of the temple of Delphi declared him to be the wisest man in the whole world, because he had taken the first step. And the first step is the last step too, because it is a quantum leap. Once you accept your ignorance you become simple, you are no more a pretender, you are no more a hypocrite, you are not trying to deceive anybody. You have accepted the truth as you are and in that very acceptance something explodes within you. In that very acceptance wisdom starts arising.\nAnd wisdom never becomes knowledge; it always remains insight, clarity. You are able to see things clearly and to find your way out of the jungle of life. It is always just unclouded consciousness, nothing else. It is not that by becoming wise you will be able to know all the secrets of life and you will be able to know everything that is there to know -- that is not so.\nA wise person is one who has a clear insight, so whatsoever comes in his life, whatsoever challenge, whatsoever situation arises, he is capable of dealing with it with full awareness, with totality. He never feels repentant, because he did whatsoever he could. He never holds back, he is always total, his response is total.\nAnd whenever one is total in one's acts life has a grace, a beauty of its own. I call that grace sannyas, that beauty sannyas.\nRupda means the beautiful.\nGod can be approached in many ways; one of the doors is the door of beauty. It is from the door of beauty that the poets and the painters and the dancers and the musicians -- the people of sensitivity, the people of aesthetic consciousness -- enter. And to me that is the most beautiful door. On that path you will find beautiful flowers and birds singing and waterFalls and rivers and mountains.\nThere are other doors and other paths too, but no path is so enchanting, so\nmagical. So unless I find that somebody is absolutely incapable of sensitivity I never suggest any other path. I suggest creativity, sensitivity, love, feeling, poetry, music, dance, sculpture -- all the possibilities of experiencing beauty and creating beauty. That is the most significant religiousness, the religion of the creator. And my sannyasins have to follow that path.\nYes, there will be a few people who will have to follow the door of truth, which is a desert path, but for a few people the desert is beautiful; it also has its own beauty. It depends on the person and his inner structure. Bet out of one hundred sannyasins ninety will find the door of beauty the closest to their heart.\nSatsang is a very specific word. It is almost impossible to translate it, but the flavour can be transmitted.\nSatsang means the miracle that transpires between the disciple and the master. Something does transpire; what it is exactly is indefinable. The disciple sits in silence with the master and the master is already absolutely silent; the master has nothing to say because the truth cannot be uttered, and the disciple has nothing to ask because whatsoever can be asked cannot be significant. The really significant question remains unasked. So the disciple sits in silence, waiting for the answer for which he has not asked the question and the master is already silent.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSlowly slowly these two silences start meeting and merging into each other, because two silences cannot be two for long. It is like two zeroes: if they come closer and closer, they become one zero. It is just the reverse process of what happens in the life of amoebas. The amoeba becomes fatter and fatter -- like Vidya!\n(Vidya, one of the office administrators, is sitting in the front row. Osho indicates her with a gesture of his left hand, not even glancing in her direction... which makes even more intimate the reference to her. There is much laughter.)\nAny day that miracle can happen here: Vidya can split in two and we will not be at a loss\n-- we will have two Vidyas! (much laughter)\nThe amoeba goes on becoming fatter and fatter and then a point comes where it cannot hold itself together, it splits in two. So the amoeba never dies. And the amoeba is the only celibate animal in the world; there is no sexuality involved at all, it goes on giving birth without any sex. Then two amoebas start getting fatter and they split and they become four and this goes on and on, for eternity.\nJust the opposite happens with the master; two zeroes start coming closer and closer and suddenly there is only one zero. That is the moment of satsang, when the master is not there and the disciple is not there but only a pervading silence, so vast that it comprehends both in oneness.\nNothing is said, nothing is heard, all is said, all is heard. Hence I call what transpires between the master and the disciple, a miracle.\nSannyas is only a preparation for satsang.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- Six months.\n-- Then it is possible.

first moment is when you start the journey, but even more important than
that is the second moment when you reach the twilight zone. That is the
most significant moment in the relationship of the master and the
disciple because only the master can push you into the unknown world of
light.</p><p>Once you have entered it you are pulled by the center as if through
gravitation; it has its own magnetism. Once you are in the field of it
you are pulled; then you cannot turn back, then there is no way to go
back. Once you have reached the center... in India we have called it
<em>samadhi</em>.</p><p>One cannot fall from samadhi. That is the difference between samadhi
and satori. One can have one hundred satoris, but one can have only one
samadhi. That is the moment when illumination happens. For the first
time you are fully aware of who you are and what this life is all about.
One can call it the state of Christ-consciousness or Buddhahood. It is
literally enlightenment -- you have become the light. That's the goal of
sannyas.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

god, a child of god.</p><p>It is only through meditation that one comes to realise that one
belongs to god, that one is not without roots in existence. that one is
not an orphan. Without meditation one remains an orphan. That is the
misery of the man who has never known the taste of meditation. He feels
afraid; he is continuously surrounded by all kinds of anxieties and
fears. Anguish is there because he cannot see anybody protecting him,
there is no security, nobody to look after him. And one seems so small
compared to the universe. The universe is so vast, almost like an ocean,
and one is just a dewdrop.</p><p>The moment you understand that the ocean is not your enemy but your
home, that you belong to it, that you are inseparably one with it, great
rejoicing arises,</p><p>you feel blessed. One is bathed in a new kind of light which goes on
pouring from the beyond.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but the art of opening up to the beyond, of
coming to terms with existence, of feeling at home, at rest. Then one
lives blissfully, then life has the flavour of a continuous, unending
celebration.</p><p>God cannot be believed in and should not be believed in; god has to
be discovered, realised -- and that realisation happens only by becoming
silent. Silence is meditation.</p><p>Anand Gerard. Anand means bliss. Gerard has two meanings. One is
courageous, the other is a loyal heart. Both are significant as far as
sannyas is concerned.</p><p>And bliss happens only to a courageous person who has deep trust in
life, in existence. who has a loyal heart. In fact that's why courage is
needed. Any coward can doubt -- that needs no guts In fact cowards
continuously doubt; they live in doubts, they are surrounded by doubts.
They doubt everything, they doubt themselves. There are doubts and
doubts, it is an almost infinite regress. They even doubt their doubts!
They cannot find any place where they can stand in deep trust and
loyalty. And how can such a person be blissful? Doubts create
misery.</p><p>Trust creates bliss. It is only in trust that life blossoms, that
life becomes a prayer. And for trust courage is needed, because to trust
means to be capable of opening up to danger, of leaving your doors open
for the sun, for the rain, for the wind. But thieves can also enter from
the same doors. To close the door because of the thief is to close the
door to the sun and to the rain and to the wind. Your doubt, your fear,
will create a grave around you; you will live a dead life. You will not
be able to love, because who knows? -- the woman may deceive you. In the
middle of the night she may cut your throat -- women are dangerous
(laughter).</p><p>Who knows what she is going to do -- crazy people! To live with a
woman in the same room and be fast asleep and snoring (laughter)...
anything is possible!</p><p>Adolf Hitler never got married for the simple reason that he was very
much afraid of getting too involved with anybody. He had many love
affairs but he was very suspicious. He got married only at the last
moment, when he decided to</p><p>commit suicide -- just before that. Now there was no fear -- what
could this woman do? He got married in the middle of the night and the
next thing that they did was to commit suicide.</p><p>The person who has doubts cannot love, the person who has doubts
cannot be friendly, the person who has doubts cannot enjoy life. He is
always on guard, watching, 'Who is going to deceive me?' Everybody looks
like an enemy. He lives in paranoia.</p><p>Sannyas means to live fearlessly, open, available, vulnerable, to
existence.</p><p>And then bliss is a natural consequence. You need not seek bliss, it
comes of its own accord. And when it comes of its own accord it never
goes; then it is eternal, yours forever.</p><p>Prem Michael. Prem means love. Michael means godly.</p><p>Logic is the farthest from god and love the closest. Those who live
in logic live without god; they cannot afford god. They can go on
playing with words, theories, philosophies, ideologies, but their life
will not have the fragrance of a divine experience. They will never know
what Buddha tasted, they will never know what Lao Tzu became drunk with.
They are the most unfortunate people on earth.</p><p>One has to shift one's energies from logic to love. They are polar
opposites. Logic is reason, love is absolutely irrational. Logic is of
the head and love of the heart; logic is thinking and love is feeling.
And nobody, anywhere, is teaching you the art of feeling. From the
kindergarten to the university you are taught how to think; you are
trained, disciplined, to argue, to think, to philosophize. The whole
discipline is of logic, and one gets so involved in it that one tends to
forget one's heart. And that is the only door to god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>My effort here is to help you to open that door -- and it opens only
in one way, there is no other way: when all your energy is pulled out of
its investment in logic it is a tremendous force. It rushes against the
doors of the heart like a flood and the doors open. Suddenly you are
face-to-face with god and for the first time you know what it means to
realize god, what it means to feel god. It transforms you totally. Time
disappears, mind disappears, death disappears. You are suddenly taken
into a totally different dimension of timelessness and deathlessness;
you become part of eternity.</p><p>Only then is there bliss, only then is one for the first time at
rest. The journey is complete -- one has arrived.</p><p>Anandesh means god is bliss.</p><p>In the East the mystics have defined god as satchidanand. It consists
of three words, 'sat', 'chid', 'anand'.</p><p>'Sat' means truth, that which is forever; 'chid' means consciousness,
awareness, Buddhahood; and 'anand'</p><p>means bliss. Anand is the ultimate peak. When you enter into the
dimension of the divine, first you encounter truth, then you encounter
awareness and then you encounter bliss. This is the eastern trinity. It
is certainly far more superior than the Christian idea of god and the
holy ghost and the son -- that is very childish, juvenile. But these
three qualities are really fundamental qualities and the most important
is bliss.</p><p>My emphasis is that if one can choose to be blissful... And remember,
it is a question of choice. Each moment presents you both alternatives,
to be miserable or to be blissful. It is up to you.</p><p>A Hassid master was dying and his disciples asked 'Now tell us the
secret. We have watched you for almost fifty years and we have never
found you sad, not even for a single moment. And we have heard from our
fathers and forefathers that in your youth you were a very sad and
serious person -- then what happened? How did you become so
cheerful?'</p><p>He said 'They are right, up to my thirtieth year I was a very sad and
very serious person. Then one morning I thought "What am I doing? Why am
I so sad and serious? Why should I waste my energies? Let me try today,
just for a change, to</p><p>be cheerful." I tried and it worked! Since then every morning when I
wake up I ask myself, "Zusya" -- Zusya was his name -- "What do you want
today? Do you want to be sad, serious and sad, miserable, or blissful?"
And I always choose to be blissful. Since then I have been
blissful.'</p><p>And I totally agree with this man Zusya, he is certainly right, it is
only a question of choice.</p><p>So from tomorrow morning try it. You have been serious enough. Or you
can start even now. There is no need to wait even for tomorrow, because
who knows? -- tomorrow may come, may not come. Give it a try. And
believe me, you will like it! (much laughter)</p><p>(Osho slips a mala over the head of the next initiate and touches his
third eye. Just before handing him the names sheet, Osho comments:
Another serious guy!</p><p>Where Anandesh <em>did</em> look like a 'serious guy', this new
sannyasin dissolves into laughter along with the group.)</p><p>Dhyanesh means god of meditation. I am giving you a very serious
name! (laughter) But whenever I am serious I am joking (much
laughter)... and whenever I am joking I am serious (Osho chuckles). This
you have to be absolutely aware of from the very beginning.</p><p>Meditation is a simple art, very simple. It need not be taken
seriously. It is so simple that even a child can learn it, in fact a
child can learn it more easily. The older one becomes, the more serious
one becomes.</p><p>In fact it is thought that if you are mature you have to be serious.
Seriousness and maturity somehow have been associated -- it is a wrong
association.</p><p>A really mature person cannot be serious, there is nothing to be
serious about. The whole of life is fun, it is a play, a play of
consciousness. And that's what meditation reveals to you -- that the
whole of life is a beautiful play of energy. The same energy is in the
trees, in the stars, in the rivers, in the mountains, in you, in
animals. It is the same energy dancing in different forms. We in the
East have called it 'leela'; leela means god's play. But the Judaic
attitude which is carried by Christianity and Islam is very serious.</p><p>The Talmud says god is not your uncle, and I say to you he
<em>is</em> your uncle!</p><p>(laughter) Forget all about him being your father -- that is a
serious thing. He <em>is</em> your uncle and he is a very nice fellow!
The Talmud insists that he is not nice, he is not your uncle, be afraid
of him. And I say to you, don't be afraid of him, don't be afraid of
existence. It is beautiful, there is no need to be afraid. It is not
antagonistic to you, it is nourishing to you.</p><p>Meditation reveals many things but the first revelation is the
playfulness of existence -- and then one 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

kingdom of god.' He is right; you have to be like small children, so
small that you don't have any weight of experience. Experience makes
people serious and a meditator has tn drop all experience, the whole
past. He has to bury his past, he has to die every moment to the past so
that every moment he is renewed, so that every moment he is a new
person.</p><p>And then miracles become possible. If you are cheerful the whole
existence starts laughing with you!</p><p>The old proverb is right. Laugh and the whole world laughs with you,
weep and you weep alone.</p><p>Gyanda means wisdom.</p><p>The most essential thing to remember about wisdom is that it is not
knowledge. Knowledge is ignorance covered with information, a wound
covered with flowers; but the wound goes on growing inside and the pus
goes on gathering. It is not advisable to hide a wound; it is better to
leave it open because if it is open then the wind and the sun and
existence, can heal it. But people are very much afraid to show their
ignorance, and the only way to hide it is to collect information. That's
what knowledge is. Information is utterly useless because it is
borrowed.</p><p>Wisdom is that which arises in you. It is a growth, not an
accumulation; it does not come from the outside. The first step towards
wisdom is to accept one's ignorance without any guilt, without any
humiliation. It is so, such is the nature of things -- we are born
ignorant.</p><p>And once you accept it without any judgement, like Socrates did... He
said 'I know only one thing, that I know nothing.' That was the moment
that the Oracle of the temple of Delphi declared him to be the wisest
man in the whole world, because he had taken the first step. And the
first step is the last step too, because it is a quantum leap. Once you
accept your ignorance you become simple, you are no more a pretender,
you are no more a hypocrite, you are not trying to deceive anybody. You
have accepted the truth as you are and in that very acceptance something
explodes within you. In that very acceptance wisdom starts arising.</p><p>And wisdom never becomes knowledge; it always remains insight,
clarity. You are able to see things clearly and to find your way out of
the jungle of life. It is always just unclouded consciousness, nothing
else. It is not that by becoming wise you will be able to know all the
secrets of life and you will be able to know everything that is there to
know -- that is not so.</p><p>A wise person is one who has a clear insight, so whatsoever comes in
his life, whatsoever challenge, whatsoever situation arises, he is
capable of dealing with it with full awareness, with totality. He never
feels repentant, because he did whatsoever he could. He never holds
back, he is always total, his response is total.</p><p>And whenever one is total in one's acts life has a grace, a beauty of
its own. I call that grace sannyas, that beauty sannyas.</p><p>Rupda means the beautiful.</p><p>God can be approached in many ways; one of the doors is the door of
beauty. It is from the door of beauty that the poets and the painters
and the dancers and the musicians -- the people of sensitivity, the
people of aesthetic consciousness -- enter. And to me that is the most
beautiful door. On that path you will find beautiful flowers and birds
singing and waterFalls and rivers and mountains.</p><p>There are other doors and other paths too, but no path is so
enchanting, so</p><p>magical. So unless I find that somebody is absolutely incapable of
sensitivity I never suggest any other path. I suggest creativity,
sensitivity, love, feeling, poetry, music, dance, sculpture -- all the
possibilities of experiencing beauty and creating beauty. That is the
most significant religiousness, the religion of the creator. And my
sannyasins have to follow that path.</p><p>Yes, there will be a few people who will have to follow the door of
truth, which is a desert path, but for a few people the desert is
beautiful; it also has its own beauty. It depends on the person and his
inner structure. Bet out of one hundred sannyasins ninety will find the
door of beauty the closest to their heart.</p><p>Satsang is a very specific word. It is almost impossible to translate
it, but the flavour can be transmitted.</p><p>Satsang means the miracle that transpires between the disciple and
the master. Something does transpire; what it is exactly is indefinable.
The disciple sits in silence with the master and the master is already
absolutely silent; the master has nothing to say because the truth
cannot be uttered, and the disciple has nothing to ask because
whatsoever can be asked cannot be significant. The really significant
question remains unasked. So the disciple sits in silence, waiting for
the answer for which he has not asked the question and the master is
already silent.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

other, because two silences cannot be two for long. It is like two
zeroes: if they come closer and closer, they become one zero. It is just
the reverse process of what happens in the life of amoebas. The amoeba
becomes fatter and fatter -- like Vidya!</p><p>(Vidya, one of the office administrators, is sitting in the front
row. Osho indicates her with a gesture of his left hand, not even
glancing in her direction... which makes even more intimate the
reference to her. There is much laughter.)</p><p>Any day that miracle can happen here: Vidya can split in two and we
will not be at a loss</p><p>-- we will have two Vidyas! (much laughter)</p><p>The amoeba goes on becoming fatter and fatter and then a point comes
where it cannot hold itself together, it splits in two. So the amoeba
never dies. And the amoeba is the only celibate animal in the world;
there is no sexuality involved at all, it goes on giving birth without
any sex. Then two amoebas start getting fatter and they split and they
become four and this goes on and on, for eternity.</p><p>Just the opposite happens with the master; two zeroes start coming
closer and closer and suddenly there is only one zero. That is the
moment of satsang, when the master is not there and the disciple is not
there but only a pervading silence, so vast that it comprehends both in
oneness.</p><p>Nothing is said, nothing is heard, all is said, all is heard. Hence I
call what transpires between the master and the disciple, a miracle.</p><p>Sannyas is only a preparation for satsang.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Six months.</p><p>-- Then it is possible.

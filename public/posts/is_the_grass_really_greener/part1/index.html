It is for reference purposes only.]\nDhyan Manuela. Dhyan means meditation.\nMeditation is just the opposite pole of mind. Mind means conflict, struggle, ego, competition. Mind is always planning to reach somewhere. It never reaches anywhere because the only place that one has to reach is within oneself and the effort of the mind is to reach somewhere else -- to the moon, to Mars, to become the president, the prime minister, to have this, to have that. The mind goes on thinking in terms of the outside world. The mind is extrovert. Its whole philosophy is: the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.\nMeditation is just the reversal of this whole approach. Meditation means asking the question 'Is the grass really greener on the other side of the fence?' With that question a radical change starts happening. It is not a question of reaching somewhere, the question is of being yourself. Only that can bring contentment; and 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncontentment opens you towards god -- that's the meaning of Manuela.\nManuela means god is with us. The mind cannot know that because the mind keeps its back towards god. God resides within you. Unless you are absolutely non-competitive, non-ambitious, you cannot turn in.\nThe competition is on the outside; in the inner world you are alone -- with whom to compete, whom to defeat, whom to conquer?\nIn that aloneness, in that silence, in that noiseless harmony, one discovers the temple of god. Everybody carries the temple within.\nAnd the name Manuela is also significant because originally this name was used only for Christ himself, because he had discovered god within himself. That's the meaning of Christ.\nJesus becomes a Christ by discovering god within himself. You also can become a Christ by discovering the god within you. To discover oneself is to discover god -- and unless that happens there is no possibility of bliss, no possibility of rejoicing, no possibility of ecstasy.\nMeditation is the way to ecstasy, to god, to the ultimate peak of consciousness.\nSahajo is the name of one of the most important woman mystics of India. There have been very few women mystics in the whole history of man for the simple reason that man never allowed them to discover themselves.\nHumanity up to now has lived in a very ugly way. Half of humanity, the feminine half, has been reduced to a thing. Women have not been allowed to discover their being; in fact, many cultures have believed that the woman has got no soul to discover. What is there to discover? -- she is just a body to be used by man.\nAnd that is the ugly part of the biblical story -- that God made woman for man's use because he was alone, feeling lonely. The story is anti-feminine, it is male chauvinistic.\nGod makes Adam for his own self, but because Adam feels lonely, God makes a\nwoman -- but in a different way. He just takes a rib out of Adam's body and creates a woman. So the woman is just to be a part of man's life. She cannot be herself; she is only a rib, a bone, to be used as a means.\nAll the religions have supported this ugly nonsense, this idiotic idea. That's why I say the real religion, a religion which makes everybody capable of discovering God, has yet to be born. Hence, only a few women\n-- their names can be counted on one's fingers -- have attained to the ultimate peak. Sahajo is one of them.\nIn India we have known only five women who can be compared to Buddha, Christ, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu and Nanak. One is Meera, whose name is well known all over the world. The second is Lalla -- she was born in Kashmir, and Kashmir has tremendous respect for the woman. In Kashmir there is a saying that they know only two names: Allah and Lalla. Allah means God, and Lalla means the woman Lalla. The third name is Sahajo; the fourth name is Daya -- another contemporary of Sahajo and a friend of Sahajo. And the fifth name is Mallibai, one of the tirthankaras of the Jainas, one of the most important masters.\nLiterally, the meaning of Sahajo is spontaneity -- and that was her teaching; hence the name was given to her by her master.\nLive spontaneously, moment to moment. This moment is all. The past has to be dropped, forgotten, because it is no more, and the future has not to be worried about because it is not yet. Then all that is left is this beautiful moment. Rejoice in this moment, live in this moment totally and this moment becomes the door to God.\nJesus says to his disciples, \"Look at the lilies in the field -- they are far more beautiful than even the emperor Solomon attired in all his precious clothes and ornaments, in all his grandeur. These poor flowers, lilies, are far more beautiful than Solomon, for the simple reason that they don't think of the morrow. They live in the moment, herenow. That is their beauty.\"\nAnd my own observation of the female is that she is less worried about the future than man and less burdened with the past than man. She is more realistic, pragmatic, more rooted and grounded in the earth; hence it is easier for her to be spontaneous. And spontaneity and a life of spontaneity can become the whole path.\nGod knows only one time and that is now, and only one space and that is here. God is always now-here.\nSo once you withdraw yourself from the past and the future, only God is left. There is no need to pray, there is no need to go into scriptures, there is no need to dig into all kinds of stupid esoteric teachings. One can be very simple and one can find the truth without any fuss. The whole of theology is an unnecessary fuss, much ado about nothing.\nAnd this is my approach too -- to live totally in the present. Nothing else is needed.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSupriti means love.\nLove can exist in three possible ways. The lowest is lust, the highest is prayer, and exactly between the two is love.\nLust means the instinctive, the biological, of the body It can reproduce children, it helps the race to survive; it is reproductive but it is not creative. Higher than lust is love. Love is creative; it creates music, painting and poetry. When you love a person you create the person. The moment somebody loves you, the very love changes you immediately. The loved person is no more the same person, the lover is no more the same person either. Love is so magical that it transforms, it makes people beautiful, graceful. Wherever love lands it creates something new.\nLove is of the mind. It is higher than the body but lower than the spirit. The highest form is prayer. The first is reproductive -- it only goes on creating replicas. Your children will just be replicas of your repetitions -- and they will produce and their children will produce and so on, so forth. It is a chain. Love is creative. Creativity is something greater than reproductivity. There have been only very few creators in the world, very few lovers.\nPrayer is neither reproductive nor creative; prayer is higher than both. It is discovery: discovering the truth, the ultimate reality: god. Lust is on the surface, Love is going slowly deeper; it is in the middle, between the centre and the circumference. Prayer is at the very centre of your being.\nMy concern is with the highest form of love. To help you move from the lowest I use the second form of love also, the creative part. But that is only a milestone on the way; the goal is prayer.\nTruth cannot be created. Reproduction is biological and natural, and creativity is imagination.\nDiscovering is simply uncovering that which is already there, that which is already the case. And to know the truth is to know all that is worth knowing. Truth liberates it liberates one from darkness, from misery, from hell, and opens the doors of paradise.\nAnadi means beginningless.\nLife is eternal; there is no beginning, no end. We begin at the time of birth and we end at the time of death. That means we have not yet known our real life. We have known only the container, not the content.\nThe container changes; it becomes old and it needs a change. The body is only a container, so you can use it for seventy, eighty, ninety or one hundred years, then you have to change the house. It become so dilapidated, it becomes so impossible to renovate that it is better to move into a new house than to renovate the old. It is less costly.\nSo life goes on changing from one house to another house, unless you discover it. The moment you discover it there is no need to change houses; then life can become part of the universal life. There is no need to be confined to a small body. That's what is meant by the word 'god'; god means the life of the cosmos. And man can feel blissful only when his small river disappears into the ocean of god.\nI don't teach any philosophy here. I only give you small strategies to discover the ocean, small devices to reach the ocean. It is not very far, we just need to know the right method, the right technique.\nMohani means the beautiful, the graceful.\nTruth has many aspects to it and one of the most important aspects is beauty. There are three types of people in the world and there are three main aspects of truth. Satyam is one aspect; satyam means truth.\nShivam is another aspect; shivam means the good. And Sundaram is the third aspect; sundaram means the beautiful. And these are also the three categories of people. A few people seek the truth, a few people seek the good and a few people seek the beautiful.\nThe people who seek the beautiful become painters, poets, musicians, dancers. That is the most lovely path to follow, and the easiest and the smoothest -- particularly for a female seeker. It is very close to her heart. The woman has more of an aesthetic sense than man. She is not much concerned about truth, that seems to be a far-away thing. I have never come across a woman who is really philosophical. Even if she has studied philosophy it remains superficial, because the ultimate is not the feminine concern but the immediate.\nRather than studying Plato and Aristotle and Kant and Hegel, she likes to stand before a mirror... for hours! That can be transformed into a meditation! But because nobody has bothered about woman, so nobody has taken note that this is such a meditative process.\nI have made a certain meditation out of it, just look at your eyes in the mirror and enjoy it! Look at your face, at your eyes, and enjoy it. Just looking at the mirror, doing nothing, spring comes and the grass grows 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- by itself!\nMove through the door of beauty. And there is so much beauty all around -- it is very immediate. Truth may be somewhere above the clouds, but the clouds are so beautiful, why bother about something that is above them? And the stars are so beautiful and the people and the trees and rocks. To reach god through beauty\nis the simplest method; it is very easy because it is so close.\nMohani... is also the name of the great Indian mystic, Krishna; one of his names is Mohan. Mohan means the beautiful -- and he was really a beautiful man. In fact if you look at pictures of him... he can defeat any woman. He has long hair and a beautiful crown of peacock feathers and he uses all kinds of ornaments. And the way he stands in a dancing pose with a flute... a perfect hippie! Nobody has seen him naked, otherwise you would find him tattooed! That's the secret thing I am telling you -- don't tell anybody because Hindus will be very angry!\nAkhil means the total.\nMy approach towards life is that of totality; whatsoever you do, don't do it half- heartedly. Either do it or don't do it, but never be in anything in a half-hearted way. Never be partial, fragmentary, because unless you are total in your acts you will never have any taste of god. And the moment you have learned the knack of being total in things then every action becomes prayer, then every gesture becomes meditation. Then if you are cleaning the floor with your total heart in it, not withholding anything, it is no more ordinary; you have brought some extraordinary quality into it. You have changed something mundane into the sacred. That's the whole secret of sannyas: change every mundane activity into the sacred -- and the way is to be total.\nWhile eating simply eat, while sleeping simply sleep, while walking just walk. And slowly slowly your whole life goes through a rebirthing process. A moment comes in life when each and every thing has your whole heart in it. That is the greatest moment. In that moment of total absorption one becomes enlightened.\nWhat one was doing does not matter -- how one was doing it matters.\nAstiko is ordinarily translated into English as the theist. But that is not its deeper meaning, it is its superficial meaning -- one who believes in god. And it is not only superficial but in a way inadequate too.\nMy definition of a man of god is one who knows, not one who believes. The believer is ignorant. He believes because he is not capable of doubting, he is afraid of doubt. Through his belief he represses his doubt, but the doubt is there; and the more you repress it, the deeper it goes into you. You may completely forget about it but it will remain part of your unconscious. And any moment it can again surface, any situation can bring it up.\nTo me, knowing, not believing, is the only way to be religious. In the past it has been said that believing is knowing; I say to you knowing is believing. Without knowing there is no point in believing.\nSo Astiko means one who knows god. And in fact we all know, it is just that we have forgotten that we know it. We are born knowing; each child is born knowing but he is not aware that he knows. So we have not to know god really, just we have to become aware of our knowing. But we are so occupied with the outside world that the whole energy is spent in the non-essential and nothing is left for the essential.\nThe religious person is one who starts discriminating between the essential and the non-essential and goes on dropping the non-essential so more and more energy is available for the essential. The moment enough energy is available for the essential you suddenly go through an explosion and that explosion makes you aware of who you are. Suddenly it is there, the experience that we are part of god. And also in that moment one knows that we always know it in a very subtle way, in an underground way -- something like an undercurrent -- but we were so occupied, preoccupied with other things that it receded. We had been ignoring it, that's all.\nThe English word 'ignorance' is beautiful. It means ignoring; it does not mean not-knowing. We have been ignoring god, that's all; our ignorance consists of ignoring. If we drop ignoring, if we pay attention, if we just become a little bit concerned about our own being, immediately the discovery.…\nNeti-neti. They contain the whole of religion -- those two words, neti-neti. They mean neither this nor that.\nThis is a method of inner discovery. One has to become aware that one is not the body -- that is the first neti -- and then one has to become aware that one is not the mind -- that is the second neti. Neither this nor that ... and then suddenly only that which you are is left behind.\nOne is neither the body nor the mind. With these two discarded what is left? -- a pure consciousness, a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndeep awareness. That awareness is our very being, that's what we are and that's what god is. We are little bits of awareness, just dewdrops of awareness. God may be the ocean, a vast ocean, but our innermost nature is the same.\nBut you have to go beyond two things, the body and the mind; hence the repetition: neti-neti. One won't do! If you can fulfil these two simple words -- and I think you can do it.… (Osho is grinning broadly. He holds her gaze for what seems like some minutes. And the longer he does, the louder becomes the laughter of the group watching.) I know you can do it (more laughter) It is a very simple thing. I have done it and I found it easy!\nNow start meditating! That's all you need, at least one hour every day. Use twenty-three hours for the world and one hour for yourself. And ultimately you will find that those twenty-three hours are wasted; only one hour, the one in which you were meditating, is saved.\nTime becomes precious while you are meditating. Time is a wastage in every other way; without meditation time has no significance at all. Then people are right when they say that they are killing time --\nthey are: playing cards and looking at a TV or going to a movie and becoming a member of a Rotary club.\nAnd there are few fools who even become members of a Lions' club! (laughter) As if to be just a man is not enough for them -- they have to become some animal! But these people think they are killing time and time goes on laughing because time knows it is killing all these people.\nSo don't kill time and time will not be able to kill you. The only way to escape from time is meditation because in meditation you move beyond time. Slowly slowly you start transcending time -- and that is our reality, that's our truth: the transcendental.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

India. There have been very few women mystics in the whole history of
man for the simple reason that man never allowed them to discover
themselves.</p><p>Humanity up to now has lived in a very ugly way. Half of humanity,
the feminine half, has been reduced to a thing. Women have not been
allowed to discover their being; in fact, many cultures have believed
that the woman has got no soul to discover. What is there to discover?
-- she is just a body to be used by man.</p><p>And that is the ugly part of the biblical story -- that God made
woman for man's use because he was alone, feeling lonely. The story is
anti-feminine, it is male chauvinistic.</p><p>God makes Adam for his own self, but because Adam feels lonely, God
makes a</p><p>woman -- but in a different way. He just takes a rib out of Adam's
body and creates a woman. So the woman is just to be a part of man's
life. She cannot be herself; she is only a rib, a bone, to be used as a
means.</p><p>All the religions have supported this ugly nonsense, this idiotic
idea. That's why I say the real religion, a religion which makes
everybody capable of discovering God, has yet to be born. Hence, only a
few women</p><p>-- their names can be counted on one's fingers -- have attained to
the ultimate peak. Sahajo is one of them.</p><p>In India we have known only five women who can be compared to Buddha,
Christ, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu and Nanak. One is Meera, whose name is well
known all over the world. The second is Lalla -- she was born in
Kashmir, and Kashmir has tremendous respect for the woman. In Kashmir
there is a saying that they know only two names: Allah and Lalla. Allah
means God, and Lalla means the woman Lalla. The third name is Sahajo;
the fourth name is Daya -- another contemporary of Sahajo and a friend
of Sahajo. And the fifth name is Mallibai, one of the tirthankaras of
the Jainas, one of the most important masters.</p><p>Literally, the meaning of Sahajo is spontaneity -- and that was her
teaching; hence the name was given to her by her master.</p><p>Live spontaneously, moment to moment. This moment is all. The past
has to be dropped, forgotten, because it is no more, and the future has
not to be worried about because it is not yet. Then all that is left is
this beautiful moment. Rejoice in this moment, live in this moment
totally and this moment becomes the door to God.</p><p>Jesus says to his disciples, "Look at the lilies in the field -- they
are far more beautiful than even the emperor Solomon attired in all his
precious clothes and ornaments, in all his grandeur. These poor flowers,
lilies, are far more beautiful than Solomon, for the simple reason that
they don't think of the morrow. They live in the moment, herenow. That
is their beauty."</p><p>And my own observation of the female is that she is less worried
about the future than man and less burdened with the past than man. She
is more realistic, pragmatic, more rooted and grounded in the earth;
hence it is easier for her to be spontaneous. And spontaneity and a life
of spontaneity can become the whole path.</p><p>God knows only one time and that is now, and only one space and that
is here. God is always now-here.</p><p>So once you withdraw yourself from the past and the future, only God
is left. There is no need to pray, there is no need to go into
scriptures, there is no need to dig into all kinds of stupid esoteric
teachings. One can be very simple and one can find the truth without any
fuss. The whole of theology is an unnecessary fuss, much ado about
nothing.</p><p>And this is my approach too -- to live totally in the present.
Nothing else is needed.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

highest is prayer, and exactly between the two is love.</p><p>Lust means the instinctive, the biological, of the body It can
reproduce children, it helps the race to survive; it is reproductive but
it is not creative. Higher than lust is love. Love is creative; it
creates music, painting and poetry. When you love a person you create
the person. The moment somebody loves you, the very love changes you
immediately. The loved person is no more the same person, the lover is
no more the same person either. Love is so magical that it transforms,
it makes people beautiful, graceful. Wherever love lands it creates
something new.</p><p>Love is of the mind. It is higher than the body but lower than the
spirit. The highest form is prayer. The first is reproductive -- it only
goes on creating replicas. Your children will just be replicas of your
repetitions -- and they will produce and their children will produce and
so on, so forth. It is a chain. Love is creative. Creativity is
something greater than reproductivity. There have been only very few
creators in the world, very few lovers.</p><p>Prayer is neither reproductive nor creative; prayer is higher than
both. It is discovery: discovering the truth, the ultimate reality: god.
Lust is on the surface, Love is going slowly deeper; it is in the
middle, between the centre and the circumference. Prayer is at the very
centre of your being.</p><p>My concern is with the highest form of love. To help you move from
the lowest I use the second form of love also, the creative part. But
that is only a milestone on the way; the goal is prayer.</p><p>Truth cannot be created. Reproduction is biological and natural, and
creativity is imagination.</p><p>Discovering is simply uncovering that which is already there, that
which is already the case. And to know the truth is to know all that is
worth knowing. Truth liberates it liberates one from darkness, from
misery, from hell, and opens the doors of paradise.</p><p>Anadi means beginningless.</p><p>Life is eternal; there is no beginning, no end. We begin at the time
of birth and we end at the time of death. That means we have not yet
known our real life. We have known only the container, not the
content.</p><p>The container changes; it becomes old and it needs a change. The body
is only a container, so you can use it for seventy, eighty, ninety or
one hundred years, then you have to change the house. It become so
dilapidated, it becomes so impossible to renovate that it is better to
move into a new house than to renovate the old. It is less costly.</p><p>So life goes on changing from one house to another house, unless you
discover it. The moment you discover it there is no need to change
houses; then life can become part of the universal life. There is no
need to be confined to a small body. That's what is meant by the word
'god'; god means the life of the cosmos. And man can feel blissful only
when his small river disappears into the ocean of god.</p><p>I don't teach any philosophy here. I only give you small strategies
to discover the ocean, small devices to reach the ocean. It is not very
far, we just need to know the right method, the right technique.</p><p>Mohani means the beautiful, the graceful.</p><p>Truth has many aspects to it and one of the most important aspects is
beauty. There are three types of people in the world and there are three
main aspects of truth. Satyam is one aspect; satyam means truth.</p><p>Shivam is another aspect; shivam means the good. And Sundaram is the
third aspect; sundaram means the beautiful. And these are also the three
categories of people. A few people seek the truth, a few people seek the
good and a few people seek the beautiful.</p><p>The people who seek the beautiful become painters, poets, musicians,
dancers. That is the most lovely path to follow, and the easiest and the
smoothest -- particularly for a female seeker. It is very close to her
heart. The woman has more of an aesthetic sense than man. She is not
much concerned about truth, that seems to be a far-away thing. I have
never come across a woman who is really philosophical. Even if she has
studied philosophy it remains superficial, because the ultimate is not
the feminine concern but the immediate.</p><p>Rather than studying Plato and Aristotle and Kant and Hegel, she
likes to stand before a mirror... for hours! That can be transformed
into a meditation! But because nobody has bothered about woman, so
nobody has taken note that this is such a meditative process.</p><p>I have made a certain meditation out of it, just look at your eyes in
the mirror and enjoy it! Look at your face, at your eyes, and enjoy it.

around -- it is very immediate. Truth may be somewhere above the clouds,
but the clouds are so beautiful, why bother about something that is
above them? And the stars are so beautiful and the people and the trees
and rocks. To reach god through beauty</p><p>is the simplest method; it is very easy because it is so close.</p><p>Mohani... is also the name of the great Indian mystic, Krishna; one
of his names is Mohan. Mohan means the beautiful -- and he was really a
beautiful man. In fact if you look at pictures of him... he can defeat
any woman. He has long hair and a beautiful crown of peacock feathers
and he uses all kinds of ornaments. And the way he stands in a dancing
pose with a flute... a perfect hippie! Nobody has seen him naked,
otherwise you would find him tattooed! That's the secret thing I am
telling you -- don't tell anybody because Hindus will be very angry!</p><p>Akhil means the total.</p><p>My approach towards life is that of totality; whatsoever you do,
don't do it half- heartedly. Either do it or don't do it, but never be
in anything in a half-hearted way. Never be partial, fragmentary,
because unless you are total in your acts you will never have any taste
of god. And the moment you have learned the knack of being total in
things then every action becomes prayer, then every gesture becomes
meditation. Then if you are cleaning the floor with your total heart in
it, not withholding anything, it is no more ordinary; you have brought
some extraordinary quality into it. You have changed something mundane
into the sacred. That's the whole secret of sannyas: change every
mundane activity into the sacred -- and the way is to be total.</p><p>While eating simply eat, while sleeping simply sleep, while walking
just walk. And slowly slowly your whole life goes through a rebirthing
process. A moment comes in life when each and every thing has your whole
heart in it. That is the greatest moment. In that moment of total
absorption one becomes enlightened.</p><p>What one was doing does not matter -- how one was doing it
matters.</p><p>Astiko is ordinarily translated into English as the theist. But that
is not its deeper meaning, it is its superficial meaning -- one who
believes in god. And it is not only superficial but in a way inadequate
too.</p><p>My <span class=p>definition of a man of god is one who knows, not
one who believes. The believer is ignorant. He believes because he is
not capable of doubting, he is afraid of doubt. Through his belief he
represses his doubt, but the doubt is there; and the more you repress
it, the deeper it goes into you. You may completely forget about it but
it will remain part of your unconscious. And any moment it can again
surface, any situation can bring it up.</span></p><p>To me, knowing, not believing, is the only way to be religious. In
the past it has been said that believing is knowing; I say to you
knowing is believing. Without knowing there is no point in
believing.</p><p>So Astiko means one who knows god. And in fact we <em>all</em> know,
it is just that we have forgotten that we know it. We are born knowing;
each child is born knowing but he is not aware that he knows. So we have
not to know god really, just we have to become aware of our knowing. But
we are so occupied with the outside world that the whole energy is spent
in the non-essential and nothing is left for the essential.</p><p>The religious person is one who starts discriminating between the
essential and the non-essential and goes on dropping the non-essential
so more and more energy is available for the essential. The moment
enough energy is available for the essential you suddenly go through an
explosion and that explosion makes you aware of who you are. Suddenly it
is there, the experience that we are part of god. And also in that
moment one knows that we always know it in a very subtle way, in an
underground way -- something like an undercurrent -- but we were so
occupied, preoccupied with other things that it receded. We had been
ignoring it, that's all.</p><p>The English word 'ignorance' is beautiful. It means ignoring; it does
not mean not-knowing. We have been ignoring god, that's all; our
ignorance consists of ignoring. If we drop ignoring, if we pay
attention, if we just become a little bit concerned about our own being,
immediately the discovery.…</p><p>Neti-neti. They contain the whole of religion -- those two words,
neti-neti. They mean neither this nor that.</p><p>This is a method of inner discovery. One has to become aware that one
is not the body -- that is the first neti -- and then one has to become
aware that one is not the mind -- that is the second neti. Neither this
nor that ... and then suddenly only that which you are is left
behind.</p><p>One is neither the body nor the mind. With these two discarded what
is left? -- a pure consciousness, a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

and that's what god is. We are little bits of awareness, just dewdrops
of awareness. God may be the ocean, a vast ocean, but our innermost
nature is the same.</p><p>But you have to go beyond two things, the body and the mind; hence
the repetition: neti-neti. One won't do! If you can fulfil these two
simple words -- and I think you can do it.… (Osho is grinning broadly.
He holds her gaze for what seems like some minutes. And the longer he
does, the louder becomes the laughter of the group watching.) I
<em>know</em> you can do it (more laughter) It is a very simple thing. I
have done it and I found it easy!</p><p>Now start meditating! That's all you need, at least one hour every
day. Use twenty-three hours for the world and one hour for yourself. And
ultimately you will find that those twenty-three hours are wasted; only
one hour, the one in which you were meditating, is saved.</p><p>Time becomes precious while you are meditating. Time is a wastage in
every other way; without meditation time has no significance at all.
Then people are right when they say that they are killing time --</p><p>they <em>are</em>: playing cards and looking at a TV or going to a
movie and becoming a member of a Rotary club.</p><p>And there are few fools who even become members of a Lions' club!
(laughter) As if to be just a man is not enough for them -- they have to
become some animal! But these people think they are killing time and
time goes on laughing because time knows it is killing all these
people.</p><p>So don't kill time and time will not be able to kill you. The only
way to escape from time is meditation because in meditation you move
beyond time. Slowly slowly you start transcending time -- and that is
our reality, that's our truth: the transcendental.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #2</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

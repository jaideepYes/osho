It is for reference purposes only.]\nDhyan Rod. Dhyan means meditation. Rod means the esteemed one.\nSociety gives the feeling to every person that he is worthless. It is a political strategy. Once a person gets the idea that he is worthless, he cannot be rebellious, he cannot be independent, he cannot go outside the fold. He cannot choose a path of his own, he will follow the crowd.\nOnce the idea sinks deep into your unconscious that you are worthless you cannot trust yourself; you will have to trust the priest, the politician, the teacher, the parents -- all kinds of authorities. And you will seek them, you will cling to them because the ground underneath your feet has been taken away. You are afraid to be left alone on your own because then you know you cannot decide, all that you decide is wrong; you cannot act, whatsoever you do is wrong. Then it is better to follow the mob; let them decide, you just be an imitator.\nTo create imitators and slaves each child's trust in himself is being destroyed all over the world, in all kinds of societies and cultures, in all countries.\nMy effort here is to give you again the feeling of worth, a self-trust -- and that is possible only through meditation, because meditation can help you get rid of all\nconditionings. And it is only a matter of conditioning. Others have told you things again and again, they have hypnotised you. That hypnosis has to be destroyed, you have to be dehypnotised. That's what meditation is: a process of dehypnotisation. Once you are dehypnotised you wake up for the first time, then suddenly you know that you are immensely valuable, as everybody else is. Then one feels tremendous respect for oneself also. And it is not ego, because you feel the same respect for others. You are not higher, you are not holier than others; suddenly you have known that everyone is esteemed by nature itself, by the universe itself.\nPrem Martina. Prem means love. Martina means a loyal heart, a loyal spirit, one who is capable of trust.\nLove can arise only in the climate of trust. When you are full of doubts love is impossible. Doubt belongs to the mind and trust belongs to the heart. Being full of doubts mean s you are full of mind, and there is no space for the heart to grow. Being full of trust means you have emptied yourself of the mind, its doubts, and questions; then there is enough space for the heart to grow.\nAnd remember one fundamental law of life, that the gross is stronger than the subtle, that the lower is stronger than the higher -- stronger in the sense that it has more destructive power. The higher is stronger in a totally different sense; it has more creative force but it is not destructive.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMind is a gross phenomenon. Heart is subtle, delicate, soft, feminine. Mind is male, aggressive, ambitious, destructive; mind has not created anything.\nAll that has been created -- great poetry, great music, great paintings -- all belongs to the heart. And love is the highest creation of the heart, but for that rose to grow you have to pull out all the weeds. Weeds are very strong people. They grow on their own -- that is the first thing -- you need not sow Roses don't grow on their own; you have to plant them and protect them -- they are delicate\npeople. And if you leave it to nature then the roses will be crushed, destroyed. and the weeds will overpower everything.\nThe same is true about the inner world.\nA priest was passing by and he saw a gardener working in his garden. Such beautiful roses had blossomed that the priest stopped to have a look and talk to the gardener. He said 'God and man together can create so much.' The gardener laughed and said 'You should have come before when god alone was growing this garden -- then there was not a single rose, there were all weeds.' The gardener said 'It is not co-operation with god; in fact I have been fighting against god! He was growing weeds and I am growing roses, and he still insists on growing weeds. It is a continuous struggle.' And he was right!\nThe higher has to fight against the lower, but the fight has to be very intelligent otherwise the lower will crush it.\nLove has to be not only love but meditative love; then love has a tremendous intelligence, then it is not insane, it is the highest form of sanity. And then it knows how to protect itself, how to prevent doubts growing around it, how to prevent the mind from encroaching on the territory of the inner being.\nIt is only through meditation that love becomes capable of winning the battle -- between the mind and the heart, between doubt and trust, between logic and love. But if one is courageous enough one can drop the doubts. One can uproot all the weeds. That's the work a sannyasin has to do: uprooting the weeds of doubt and merging and molting into trust, surrender, into a deep and total yes. In that climate love blossoms.\nThat climate functions like the spring and suddenly one's whole life is full of roses.\nBodhi Herma. Bodhi means intelligence. Herma means diligence.\nIntelligence alone is impotent; it can think but it cannot act. Diligence alone can act but it is blind, hence whatsoever it does will create more trouble and chaos. And this is one of the calamities in the world, that the diligent people are not intelligent and the intelligent people are not diligent. For example, Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, Alexander, are very diligent but not intelligent. Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir, are very intelligent but not diligent.\nMy sannyasin has to create a synthesis. It is beautiful that a few Buddhas have happened in the world, but if they had been creative also, if they had not been just silent, just blissful, but also active in the world, they would have immensely benefitted humanity. And these diligent people, they are really great workers; for their whole life they go on doing things. Whore even angels are afraid to tread, the fools rush in. They are very intelligent people, fools are very intelligent people. They are active, very active. Their activity is the danger, their diligence is the danger. If the fools are less diligent and the wise are more diligent it would be good. If the wise are a little less intelligent it will do but the fools should be a little more intelligent -- it will bring balance into the world.\nThat's why I am not telling my sannyasins to renounce the world and to escape to the monasteries. That would be easier: you can be silent, you can be blissful, you c an forget all about the world -- but it is not good to forget all about the world. It is our world; we have to make it beautiful, we have to make a paradise out of it.\nSo I am telling my sannyasins to remain in the marketplace yet to be there very intelligently so you are not contaminated by the marketplace; on the contrary, you transform the marketplace itself.\nHow long will you be here?\n-- I'd like to stay for good, Osho.\n-- That's good. Be here forever!\nParibodh means transcendental intelligence.\nThe intellect is part of the ordinary mind. It is needed in the world, it is really a biocomputer. It collects information, memory, and keeps all the records which you may need any time, but it is not intelligence; it is only intellect. Intelligence is something transcendental, beyond the intellect.\nYou have to go through the bridge of meditation, only then will you reach the other shore. This shore is intellect, the other shore is intelLigence. And these two shores have to be bridged. I am not against intellect, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbut to remain confined to intellect is to remain confined to the outside world. To be just intellectual means to be a materialist, because intellect cannot give you any idea about that which is beyond it. It has a limitation; it can see matter because matter is measurable, weighable; it can be comprehended by the intellect. But it cannot give you any idea of consciousness. Consciousness is something beyond -- the other shore, the further shore.\nThat is the meaning of Paribodh: the other shore, the further shore, the shore of intelligence. It can be bridged -- meditation is the bridge.\nOnce you have bridged it, once you have known how to be silent, utterly silent, how to put your intellect, your mind, to rest, to bring it to a full stop, how to put it off, once you have learned the knack of it, suddenly your intelligence starts functioning and for the first time you become aware of the mysteries of life\n-- of consciousness, of love, of truth, of god. And than you can use the intellect whenever it is needed.\nWhen you want to remember somebody's phone number you can put it on, but when you don't want the phone number there is no need for the intellect to go on reminding you about phone numbers. And it goes on reminding you. Even if you go on shouting at it 'Shut up!', that does not matter, it laughs at you, it goes on saying the same phone number again and again. If you try to shut it up it will become very very aggressive. You can try it.…\nI give you the phone number -- 22333 -- and try to put it off... 22333.., (laughter) And the more you try... tonight try it! (more laughter) For the whole night you will have to remain awake, you cannot turn it off. Those figures will become bigger and bigger and bigger and they will cover your whole being and they will enter from this side and that side. You can go on shouting 'Shut up!', and they won't listen at all.\nIt is not a question of shouting at the mind; one needs a subtle technique to put it off. That technique is meditation. Reduced to its most essential core meditation means watching. When the mind says 22333, you simply watch, don't say anything; just look directly, go on looking. And you will be surprised: as you\nlook those figures start evaporating, they recede. You go on looking without any fight, without shouting, without getting angry and they disappear.\nThis is how the whole mind is slowly slowly overcome. And one day when you have been able to put the mind to rest... It is good for the mind too to have a little rest; it starts working at the cradle and goes on working up to the grave, and maybe -- who knows? -- maybe even after you are in the grave it may be continuously working.\nIt is good that Hindus burn the bodies. One thing is certain, that it is finished, they have burned the computer. But inside the grave a Christian or a Mohammedan may be still doing things 22333 (laughter).\nAnd then you cannot stop it at all; you cannot even get up. You cannot start reading the newspaper or turn the radio on! You cannot argue with your wife. There is nowhere to go; they don't even allow tossing and turning in the grave... just lying down and the same mind goes on playing the same games! Certain processes continue in the grave: hair goes on growing, nails go on growing -- so who knows? -- the mind may go on functioning just out of old habit.\nBut one thing is certain, that if mind continues to work you will never be able to know your innermost core -- and that is the liberating experience, the most ecstatic experience. Once you have tasted of it you are freed from all kinds of nonsense. You are freed from politics, you are freed from the so-called religions, you are freed from all kinds of ideologies. You start living in the moment, immediately related with reality, in tune, a dance arises in you -- a dance of spontaneity.\nOf course, whenever you need the mind you can put it on and put it off. Sambodh means right intelligence.\nIntellect is the wrong intelligence. It pretends to be intelligence -- it is not. But we have accepted its pretension, so from the school to the university all that we do is to cultivate intellect. We think we are helping intelligence to grow; in fact we are hindering intelligence, we are putting more and more rocks on top of it. Hence it is not coincidental that the scholars and the professors and the so-called learned people are very efficient as far as their own field of work is concerned. Outside of their own field of work, outside of their own expertise, they prove utter fools, far more stupid than the ordinary human being. Even farmers and\ngardeners and labourers seem to be more intelligent.\nJust take the scholar out of his field... In his field he is perfectly at ease because he is carrying a big load of information, all kinds of ready-made answers. Pull him out of his field, just as a simple question and he will be at a loss; if it does not concern his specialisation, he will be simply at a loss as to what to do with it.\nBy asking him a question any child can get him into trouble. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis is bound to happen because intellect is not intelligence. And because of this continuous cultivation of intellect in the educational world we have deprived humanity of intelligence. Humanity needs a new kind of education. This education I call miseducation. Humanity needs a totally different perspective so that intelligence can grow. Of course intellect is needed, but they should be balanced.\nBut intellect should not become the boss, it should only be the servant. When intellect is the servant of intelligence then you are in the right situation; when the intellect is the master then intelligence disappears; then you are hung up in the head. Then you know much and still you are as ignorant as any ignorant person is. Your knowing does not transform your being. It does not give you bliss, it does not give you a better life.\nIt may give you a better standard of living -- intellect can do that, it has done it. It can give you a more comfortable life, a better standard of living, better devices, gadgets, more technology, but it cannot give you a better quality of life; it can only increase the quantity. The quality comes from intelligence.\nThe Buddha or Lao Tzu or Jesus are not very intellectual people, but they are utterly intelligent. And their very life shows it, their spontaneity, their totality, their joy. Their life is a festival of lights.\nAnd that's how it should be for every sannyasin. Life has to be changed into a celebration. That can happen only through intelligence.\nIntellect is the cultivation of the mind, intelligence is the discovery of meditation\n-- and meditation is a state of no-mind. So one has to shift from mind to no- mind. And one has to be flexible so that one can come back to the mind whenever needed and can go back to no-mind whenever mind is not needed, but one's home should be no-mind and mind should be only the porch, not more than that. Once in a while you have to pass the porch so you use it, but you don't live there. And ordinarily people are living in their porches and have completely forgotten about the palaces that are within themselves.\nMy function here is to remind you of your palace, of your kingdom. Samvado means communion.\nThese two words: communication and communion, have to be understood. Communication is from head-to-head, communion is from heart-to-heart.\nThe relationship between the master and the disciple is of communion, it is not of communication. The relationship between a student and a teacher is of communication.\nBecoming a sannyasin means now you will be listening more and more with the heart and less and less with the head. And listening from the heart is a totally different experience. There is no argument, there is no judgement; one listens just as one listens to the song of the birds or to music or to the wind passing through the pine trees. One is not questioning it, there is no why; one is simply enjoying it The master has to be enjoyed!\nRemember it: the master has to be, in Jesus' words, eaten. The disciple has to be a cannibal. Don't be worried (laughter) to be a cannibal is perfect with me! To be with a master simply means to digest his being to let him come into you, to allow him to the innermost shrine of your being where you have never allowed anybody, where you yourself have never entered, to open all your doors and windows. That is Samvado that is communion. And then one understands not only the words, one starts understanding the silences too.\nAnd when the disciple can understand the silence of the master then something miraculous transpires; then something from the master simply enters into the\nbeing of the disciple and the unlit candle of the disciple is suddenly lit and becomes aflame. Where there was darkness now there is only light and nothing else.\nThis is a commune. Becoming a sannyasin means becoming part of this commune. And commune means a space where people are living in communion, where people are no more interested in theories and words and reasons and logic and arguments; where people are only interested in living totally, in loving totally, in being totally.\nAnurodh means invitation.\nTruth has to be invited. One cannot conquer it, one cannot be aggressive about it If one is aggressive one will never get to know truth. In that very aggressiveness one becomes farther away from truth than ever.\nTruth is a love affair; it is not a fight, not a struggle. One has to persuade it. Anurodh also means persuasion.\nOne has to slowly bring the truth into one's being.\nSo two things are needed: a deep receptivity, a welcoming and spaciousness within. And when you invite a guest you have to prepare your house, you have to make it ready. Truth is the ultimate guest, and when you are inviting truth you are becoming the ultimate host.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThat's what sannyas is all about: becoming the ultimate host, learning the art of being a host, so that truth can come, and not only come but can be persuaded to abide in you. It can be persuaded, that's the only way it has ever happened.\nOpen up to truth like a lotus opens to the sun.\nThe sun is showering but if the lotus is closed then the rays don't reach its inner core. If the lotus is open then the sun starts dancing on the petals and the lotus becomes really alive when the sun starts showering. In that very shower its fragrance is released.\nAsking truth to enter you, inviting truth to be a guest in your heart, is asking light to penetrate you -- and without your becoming afraid, allowing it to reach the very core, the very centre. It goes like an arrow and penetrates your very being. The moment the arrow of truth penetrates your being two things happen: death and resurrection. You die as you have always been before and something new is born, something totally new, which has never been there before. It is a rebirth, a resurrection.\nSannyas is only the beginning of learning the art; it is just ABC. But if you can take the first step then other steps are bound to follow.\nSo become an invitation to god, to truth, to love, to bliss, to all that is, and thousands of gifts are ready to shower on you. But we are closed -- we have to be open, vulnerable.\nRisk everything and be open. It is better to die as a flower than to live as a seed.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

destroyed all over the world, in all kinds of societies and cultures, in
all countries.</p><p>My effort here is to give you again the feeling of worth, a
self-trust -- and that is possible only through meditation, because
meditation can help you get rid of all</p><p>conditionings. And it is only a matter of conditioning. Others have
told you things again and again, they have hypnotised you. That hypnosis
has to be destroyed, you have to be dehypnotised. That's what meditation
is: a process of dehypnotisation. Once you are dehypnotised you wake up
for the first time, then suddenly you know that you are immensely
valuable, as everybody else is. Then one feels tremendous respect for
oneself also. And it is not ego, because you feel the same respect for
others. You are not higher, you are not holier than others; suddenly you
have known that everyone is esteemed by nature itself, by the universe
itself.</p><p>Prem Martina. Prem means love. Martina means a loyal heart, a loyal
spirit, one who is capable of trust.</p><p>Love can arise only in the climate of trust. When you are full of
doubts love is impossible. Doubt belongs to the mind and trust belongs
to the heart. Being full of doubts mean s you are full of mind, and
there is no space for the heart to grow. Being full of trust means you
have emptied yourself of the mind, its doubts, and questions; then there
is enough space for the heart to grow.</p><p>And remember one fundamental law of life, that the gross is stronger
than the subtle, that the lower is stronger than the higher -- stronger
in the sense that it has more destructive power. The higher is stronger
in a totally different sense; it has more creative force but it is not
destructive.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Mind is a gross phenomenon. Heart is subtle, delicate, soft,
feminine. Mind is male, aggressive, ambitious, destructive; mind has not
created anything.</p><p>All that has been created -- great poetry, great music, great
paintings -- all belongs to the heart. And love is the highest creation
of the heart, but for that rose to grow you have to pull out all the
weeds. Weeds are very strong people. They grow on their own -- that is
the first thing -- you need not sow Roses don't grow on their own; you
have to plant them and protect them -- they are delicate</p><p>people. And if you leave it to nature then the roses will be crushed,
destroyed. and the weeds will overpower everything.</p><p>The same is true about the inner world.</p><p>A priest was passing by and he saw a gardener working in his garden.
Such beautiful roses had blossomed that the priest stopped to have a
look and talk to the gardener. He said 'God and man together can create
so much.' The gardener laughed and said 'You should have come before
when god alone was growing this garden -- then there was not a single
rose, there were all weeds.' The gardener said 'It is not co-operation
with god; in fact I have been fighting against god! He was growing weeds
and I am growing roses, and he still insists on growing weeds. It is a
continuous struggle.' And he was right!</p><p>The higher has to fight against the lower, but the fight has to be
very intelligent otherwise the lower will crush it.</p><p>Love has to be not only love but meditative love; then love has a
tremendous intelligence, then it is not insane, it is the highest form
of sanity. And then it knows how to protect itself, how to prevent
doubts growing around it, how to prevent the mind from encroaching on
the territory of the inner being.</p><p>It is only through meditation that love becomes capable of winning
the battle -- between the mind and the heart, between doubt and trust,
between logic and love. But if one is courageous enough one can drop the
doubts. One can uproot all the weeds. That's the work a sannyasin has to
do: uprooting the weeds of doubt and merging and molting into trust,
surrender, into a deep and total yes. In that climate love blossoms.</p><p>That climate functions like the spring and suddenly one's whole life
is full of roses.</p><p>Bodhi Herma. Bodhi means intelligence. Herma means diligence.</p><p>Intelligence alone is impotent; it can think but it cannot act.
Diligence alone can act but it is blind, hence whatsoever it does will
create more trouble and chaos. And this is one of the calamities in the
world, that the diligent people are not intelligent and the intelligent
people are not diligent. For example, Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, Alexander,
are very diligent but not intelligent. Buddha, Lao Tzu, Kabir, are
<em>very</em> intelligent but not diligent.</p><p>My sannyasin has to create a synthesis. It is beautiful that a few
Buddhas have happened in the world, but if they had been creative also,
if they had not been just silent, just blissful, but also active in the
world, they would have immensely benefitted humanity. And these diligent
people, they are really great workers; for their whole life they go on
doing things. Whore even angels are afraid to tread, the fools rush in.
They are very intelligent people, fools are very intelligent people.
They are active, very active. Their activity is the danger, their
diligence is the danger. If the fools are less diligent and the wise are
more diligent it would be good. If the wise are a little less
intelligent it will do but the fools should be a little more intelligent
-- it will bring balance into the world.</p><p>That's why I am not telling my sannyasins to renounce the world and
to escape to the monasteries. That would be easier: you can be silent,
you can be blissful, you c an forget all about the world -- but it is
not good to forget all about the world. It is our world; we have to make
it beautiful, we have to make a paradise out of it.</p><p>So I am telling my sannyasins to remain in the marketplace yet to be
there very intelligently so you are not contaminated by the marketplace;
on the contrary, you transform the marketplace itself.</p><p>How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I'd like to stay for good, Osho.</p><p>-- That's good. Be here forever!</p><p>Paribodh means transcendental intelligence.</p><p>The intellect is part of the ordinary mind. It is needed in the
world, it is really a biocomputer. It collects information, memory, and
keeps all the records which you may need any time, but it is not
intelligence; it is only intellect. Intelligence is something
transcendental, beyond the intellect.</p><p>You have to go through the bridge of meditation, only then will you
reach the other shore. This shore is intellect, the other shore is
intelLigence. And these two shores have to be bridged. I am not against
intellect, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>but to remain confined to intellect is to remain confined to the
outside world. To be just intellectual means to be a materialist,
because intellect cannot give you any idea about that which is beyond
it. It has a limitation; it can see matter because matter is measurable,
weighable; it can be comprehended by the intellect. But it cannot give
you any idea of consciousness. Consciousness is something beyond -- the
other shore, the further shore.</p><p>That is the meaning of Paribodh: the other shore, the further shore,
the shore of intelligence. It can be bridged -- meditation is the
bridge.</p><p>Once you have bridged it, once you have known how to be silent,
utterly silent, how to put your intellect, your mind, to rest, to bring
it to a full stop, how to put it off, once you have learned the knack of
it, suddenly your intelligence starts functioning and for the first time
you become aware of the mysteries of life</p><p>-- of consciousness, of love, of truth, of god. And than you can use
the intellect whenever it is needed.</p><p>When you want to remember somebody's phone number you can put it on,
but when you don't want the phone number there is no need for the
intellect to go on reminding you about phone numbers. And it goes on
reminding you. Even if you go on shouting at it 'Shut up!', that does
not matter, it laughs at you, it goes on saying the same phone number
again and again. If you try to shut it up it will become very very
aggressive. You can try it.…</p><p>I give you the phone number -- 22333 -- and try to put it off...
22333.., (laughter) And the more you try... tonight try it! (more
laughter) For the whole night you will have to remain awake, you cannot
turn it off. Those figures will become bigger and bigger and bigger and
they will cover your whole being and they will enter from this side and
that side. You can go on shouting 'Shut up!', and they won't listen at
all.</p><p>It is not a question of shouting at the mind; one needs a subtle
technique to put it off. That technique is meditation. Reduced to its
most essential core meditation means watching. When the mind says 22333,
you simply watch, don't say anything; just look directly, go on looking.
And you will be surprised: as you</p><p>look those figures start evaporating, they recede. You go on looking
without any fight, without shouting, without getting angry and they
disappear.</p><p>This is how the whole mind is slowly slowly overcome. And one day
when you have been able to put the mind to rest... It is good for the
mind too to have a little rest; it starts working at the cradle and goes
on working up to the grave, and maybe -- who knows? -- maybe even after
you are in the grave it may be continuously working.</p><p>It is good that Hindus burn the bodies. One thing is certain, that it
is finished, they have burned the computer. But inside the grave a
Christian or a Mohammedan may be still doing things 22333
(laughter).</p><p>And then you cannot stop it at all; you cannot even get up. You
cannot start reading the newspaper or turn the radio on! You cannot
argue with your wife. There is nowhere to go; they don't even allow
tossing and turning in the grave... just lying down and the same mind
goes on playing the same games! Certain processes continue in the grave:
hair goes on growing, nails go on growing -- so who knows? -- the mind
may go on functioning just out of old habit.</p><p>But one thing is certain, that if mind continues to work you will
never be able to know your innermost core -- and that is the liberating
experience, the most ecstatic experience. Once you have tasted of it you
are freed from all kinds of nonsense. You are freed from politics, you
are freed from the so-called religions, you are freed from all kinds of
ideologies. You start living in the moment, immediately related with
reality, in tune, a dance arises in you -- a dance of spontaneity.</p><p>Of course, whenever you need the mind you can put it on and put it
off. Sambodh means right intelligence.</p><p>Intellect is the wrong intelligence. It pretends to be intelligence
-- it is not. But we have accepted its pretension, so from the school to
the university all that we do is to cultivate intellect. We think we are
helping intelligence to grow; in fact we are hindering intelligence, we
are putting more and more rocks on top of it. Hence it is not
coincidental that the scholars and the professors and the so-called
learned people are very efficient as far as their own field of work is
concerned. Outside of their own field of work, outside of their own
expertise, they prove utter fools, far more stupid than the ordinary
human being. Even farmers and</p><p>gardeners and labourers seem to be more intelligent.</p><p>Just take the scholar out of his field... In his field he is
perfectly at ease because he is carrying a big load of information, all
kinds of ready-made answers. Pull him out of his field, just as a simple
question and he will be at a loss; if it does not concern his
specialisation, he will be simply at a loss as to what to do with
it.</p><p>By asking him a question any child can get him into trouble.

because of this continuous cultivation of intellect in the educational
world we have deprived humanity of intelligence. Humanity needs a new
kind of education. This education I call miseducation. Humanity needs a
totally different perspective so that intelligence can grow. Of course
intellect is needed, but they should be balanced.</p><p>But intellect should not become the boss, it should only be the
servant. When intellect is the servant of intelligence then you are in
the right situation; when the intellect is the master then intelligence
disappears; then you are hung up in the head. Then you know much and
still you are as ignorant as any ignorant person is. Your knowing does
not transform your being. It does not give you bliss, it does not give
you a better life.</p><p>It may give you a better standard of living -- intellect can do that,
it has done it. It can give you a more comfortable life, a better
standard of living, better devices, gadgets, more technology, but it
cannot give you a better quality of life; it can only increase the
quantity. The quality comes from intelligence.</p><p>The Buddha or Lao Tzu or Jesus are not very intellectual people, but
they are utterly intelligent. And their very life shows it, their
spontaneity, their totality, their joy. Their life is a festival of
lights.</p><p>And that's how it should be for every sannyasin. Life has to be
changed into a celebration. That can happen only through
intelligence.</p><p>Intellect is the cultivation of the mind, intelligence is the
discovery of meditation</p><p>-- and meditation is a state of no-mind. So one has to shift from
mind to no- mind. And one has to be flexible so that one can come back
to the mind whenever needed and can go back to no-mind whenever mind is
not needed, but one's home should be no-mind and mind should be only the
porch, not more than that. Once in a while you have to pass the porch so
you use it, but you don't live there. And ordinarily people are living
in their porches and have completely forgotten about the palaces that
are within themselves.</p><p>My function here is to remind you of your palace, of your kingdom.
Samvado means communion.</p><p>These two words: communication and communion, have to be understood.
Communication is from head-to-head, communion is from
heart-to-heart.</p><p>The relationship between the master and the disciple is of communion,
it is not of communication. The relationship between a student and a
teacher is of communication.</p><p>Becoming a sannyasin means now you will be listening more and more
with the heart and less and less with the head. And listening from the
heart is a totally different experience. There is no argument, there is
no judgement; one listens just as one listens to the song of the birds
or to music or to the wind passing through the pine trees. One is not
questioning it, there is no why; one is simply enjoying it The master
has to be enjoyed!</p><p>Remember it: the master has to be, in Jesus' words, eaten. The
disciple has to be a cannibal. Don't be worried (laughter) to be a
cannibal is perfect with me! To be with a master simply means to digest
his being to let him come into you, to allow him to the innermost shrine
of your being where you have never allowed anybody, where you yourself
have never entered, to open all your doors and windows. That is Samvado
that is communion. And then one understands not only the words, one
starts understanding the silences too.</p><p>And when the disciple can understand the silence of the master then
something miraculous transpires; then something from the master simply
enters into the</p><p>being of the disciple and the unlit candle of the disciple is
suddenly lit and becomes aflame. Where there was darkness now there is
only light and nothing else.</p><p>This is a commune. Becoming a sannyasin means becoming part of this
commune. And commune means a space where people are living in communion,
where people are no more interested in theories and words and reasons
and logic and arguments; where people are only interested in living
totally, in loving totally, in being totally.</p><p>Anurodh means invitation.</p><p>Truth has to be invited. One cannot conquer it, one cannot be
aggressive about it If one is aggressive one will never get to know
truth. In that very aggressiveness one becomes farther away from truth
than ever.</p><p>Truth is a love affair; it is not a fight, not a struggle. One has to
persuade it. Anurodh also means persuasion.</p><p>One has to slowly bring the truth into one's being.</p><p>So two things are needed: a deep receptivity, a welcoming and
spaciousness within. And when you invite a guest you have to prepare
your house, you have to make it ready. Truth is the ultimate guest, and
when you are inviting truth you are becoming the ultimate host.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about: becoming the ultimate host,
learning the art of being a host, so that truth can come, and not only
come but can be persuaded to abide in you. It <em>can</em> be persuaded,
that's the only way it has ever happened.</p><p>Open up to truth like a lotus opens to the sun.</p><p>The sun is showering but if the lotus is closed then the rays don't
reach its inner core. If the lotus is open then the sun starts dancing
on the petals and the lotus becomes really alive when the sun starts
showering. In that very shower its fragrance is released.</p><p>Asking truth to enter you, inviting truth to be a guest in your
heart, is asking light to penetrate you -- and without your becoming
afraid, allowing it to reach the very core, the very centre. It goes
like an arrow and penetrates your very being. The moment the arrow of
truth penetrates your being two things happen: death and resurrection.
You die as you have always been before and something new is born,
something totally new, which has never been there before. It is a
rebirth, a resurrection.</p><p>Sannyas is only the beginning of learning the art; it is just ABC.
But if you can take the first step then other steps are bound to
follow.</p><p>So become an invitation to god, to truth, to love, to bliss, to all
that is, and thousands of gifts are ready to shower on you. But we are
closed -- we have to be open, vulnerable.</p><p>Risk everything and be open. It is better to die as a flower than to
live as a seed.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #22</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

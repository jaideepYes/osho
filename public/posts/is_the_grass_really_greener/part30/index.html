It is for reference purposes only.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSagaresh means the god of the ocean.\nMan can live either as a dewdrop, as an ego or as a vast ocean. Both the possibilities are open and available -- it is our choice. The only condition to be fulfilled to become oceanic is to let the dewdrop disappear, evaporate. Unless the dew drop disappears into the ocean it remains very small, limited; and all limitation creates misery.\nBliss means unlimitedness, vastness; bliss is oceanic. And one can be as vast as the whole universe; just a small thing has to be dropped the idea of the I. And it can be very easily done because it is a false idea, it is our own invention. It does not exist in reality.\nVeet Tanha. Veet means transcendence. 'Tanha' is a word used by Gautam the Buddha for desire.\nTranscending the desire of to be something, to reach somewhere, to possess something, to become something, is what sannyas is all about: it is to transcend the desiring mind. The desiring mind is a beggar, and whatsoever you give to the beggar it makes no difference -- it goes on begging, it is its nature to beg. So even if one possesses the whole world the mind will not feel contented. Discontent is its very quality. So one has to slip out of the mind to be contented, to feel fulfilled.\nThe moment you stop desiring -- and desire comes in many forms, in all sizes, in all shapes... There are people who have renounced the world but now they are desiring the pleasures of heaven -- it is the same desire. They are not in the marketplace, they have moved to the monastery, to the mountains, to the deserts, but the desire has not left. It has only taken on a new colour, a new dimension; it has come in again from the backdoor.\nSo desire in all its forms, even the desire to attain the truth, is a barrier. The desire to know god is a barrier. Any desire, desire as such, takes you away from your reality. The moment you drop all desiring, suddenly you explode into light, into love, into infinity, into eternity; suddenly all that you have been desiring and not finding is found. No-desire is the way to find, desire is the way to go astray.\nAradhana means prayer, but not the prayer that goes on in the churches and the temples and the synagogues.\nMy definition of prayer is silence, because words are useless when you are communicating with the divine. When you are communicating with the whole no language is needed. Language is human. Below humanity there is no language, above humanity also there is no language. So if you are communing with the trees no language is needed. You can hug a tree, you can kiss a tree, but no language is needed. If you start talking with the tree you are simply crazy! (laughter)\nThe same is true about that which is above humanity, again language loses all meaning; you have to be silent. And with the beyond... you cannot even kiss it, you cannot even hug it. It is invisible, so you can be in utter silence, just being, and that is prayer. And in that moment of silent being the communion happens.\nSo forget all the prayers that have been taught to you -- they are all false. Learn only one prayers wordless gratitude, gratitude for the whole, for all the beauty of existence, for all the joy of existence, for our life, for all the gifts that the whole has given to us -- the capacity to love, the capacity to dance, to celebrate, the capacity to be aware, to be silent, to be prayerful. All these are immeasurable, inestimable gifts, and we cannot return them in any way. We have nothing to give back, but we can be thankful.\nSo a silent thankfulness is my definition of prayer. Shunya means absolute zero.\nThe western mind associates zero with nothingness. The eastern understanding of the zero is not of nothingness but of no-thingness -- and there is a vast difference between the two.\nNothingness gives you a negative idea; no-thingness gives you the idea of space. There is no thing in it but there is spaciousness. It is full, full of space -- and that's the only thing that a sannyasin is required to create in himself, the space.\nWe are so full of rubbish, junk, garbage -- all kinds of furniture. All our thoughts, desires, memories, imagination, fantasies, are nothing but rotten furniture. We have to throw it out so that space can be created.\nOnce you are full of space and nothing else, the miracle happens: the whole universe rushes into you, Then the stars are within you and the flowers are within you and the birds are singing within you. Then suddenly you are in a deep harmony with the whole. you are the whole. And to me that's the only possibility of being holy: to become one with the whole.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHence zero means a new kind of fullness. It is not empty. It is empty of all rubbish, but the moment rubbish is removed, something immensely valuable\nrushes in. It was always waiting at the gate but there was no space for it to come in. The guest has been waiting and waiting and waiting, but the host is so occupied inside that even if the guest knocks on the door, the host is not going to listen -- it is so noisy inside. And even if he listens there is no space to call the guest in.\nMeditation means creating a zero within you and the moment you have created the zero you have invited god; that's the only invitation possible. He immediately, instantly enters in and your whole life is transformed. Then there is no birth, no death, no misery, no anguish. You have become one with the whole, relaxed, restful -- you have found your home!\nDayananda means compassion plus bliss.\nThey are two sides of the same coin, they happen simultaneously. Bliss happens within, compassion happens without. Bliss is the inner side of compassion, compassion is the outer side of bliss; or, compassion is the body and bliss is the soul.\nIt is better to begin with the inner, with the centre, because once the centre is transformed the circumference follows automatically, but not vice versa. You can try to be compassionate but it will remain just an effort, something cultivated, painted. It will not change your centre, in fact it will create a division in you; your circumference and your centre will become enemies.\nAt the centre there will be misery, at the circumference you will be trying to be compassionate. You will start falling apart, you will become schizophrenic. That's what the whole humanity has become, schizophrenic.\nSo never start from the circumference -- that is one of the most significant things to remember: every beginning has to be from the centre towards the circumference.\nIf you really want to change the tree, change the roots; don't go on painting the flowers and the leaves --\nyour painting won't help. If the leaves are looking pale you can paint them green, but they will die sooner because of your paint. You can deceive people but you cannot deceive the tree, you cannot deceive existence. If you really want the leaves to be green, then you have to think of the roots: nourish them, water them,\nand the leaves will automatically be green and the roses will become bigger and bigger, more and more fragrant.\nStart with the centre, start with bliss, and compassion follows like a shadow.\nKrishnananda. Krishna is one of the names of god. Ananda means bliss. Krishnananda means divine bliss, godly bliss.\nMan's real search is not for god, it is for bliss. Of course when you have found bliss you have found god too, but those who are trying to find god have started the journey from a wrong angle. The word 'god' does not ring any bells in the heart. If you were not told about god from your childhood you may not have ever thought about it.\nIn Communist Russia children are not told about god so they don't bother about it at all. Buddhists don't believe in god so their children don't bother about god at all. Jainas in India don't believe in god so their religion is a godless religion, there is no question about god at all. Not a single Jaina has ever asked me whether god exists or not. But as far as bliss is concerned, whether you are told about it or not, you will seek it. You will seek it in Communist Russia, you will seek it in a Buddhist home, you will seek it in a Christian family; you will seek it wherever you are. Atheist, theist, communist, fascist, it doesn't matter.\nSo bliss is our true search. Of course when bliss is found much more is found with it. And because of that much more we had to give it a new name, because it is not only bliss -- it is bliss plus many things, many indefinable things, many mysterious things -- so we had to coin the word 'god'. But that word is meaningful only when you have found bliss; before that, the word is utterly meaningless, there is no need to talk about it.\nIf one goes on searching for bliss one finds god too. And whenever you think about god you always think of him as being somewhere outside and whenever you think of bliss you cannot think of it as being outside; it has to be something inner -- an inner glow, an inner rejoicing. God can be worshipped, bliss cannot be worshipped. So around the idea of god religions can be created, anti-religions can be created, but around the idea of bliss no religion is created, no religion can be created. hence what I am doing here is not creating a religion, but only a kind of religiousness.\nMy sannyasins are not searching for god, they are searching for bliss within\nthemselves. But once you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhave found bliss simultaneously you have found many more things: truth, god, freedom, love, compassion --\nthe list is almost endless! How long will you be here?\n-- Not so long... or forever.\n-- Be here. Forever is better -- a little more! Good. Shunyananda. Shunya means zero. Anand means bliss.\nTo be absolutely silent, thoughtless, is the meaning of zero. And out of that no- thingness, out of that zero, bliss arises. Bliss is our intrinsic nature, but it is covered with layers and layers of rubbish. It has to be excavated, you have to dig it out. It is just like making a well: you go on digging layers of earth and then rocks, and one day, you find the springs of water. They were already there but between you and the springs of water there was this earth for twenty feet, thirty feet, forty feet. It differs with different people.\nSometimes there are big rocks and they have to be dynamited -- for that we have invented dynamic meditation. When you really do 'hoo, hoo, hoo,' all rocks are dynamited. Just sitting silently, doing nothing it won't happen! (laughter) 'Hoo' really hits hard and it hits at exactly the right place, where one needs to be hit.\nSo one has to go on digging. All the methods of meditation are nothing but methods of digging.\nBliss is within you, you just have to become empty of all that is covering it. Once the zero is found, suddenly, immediately, instantly, bliss starts overflowing you. And it comes like a flood; you cannot contain it. It becomes a dance, it\nbecomes a song, it becomes a sharing! How long will you be here?\n-- Two weeks.\n-- Then come back again, because in two weeks you will be able to find only the rock (much laughter). So dynamite it a little more, time will be needed, so come back again. Good!\nKarunesha means goddess of compassion.\nCompassion makes one a god or a goddess, but to achieve compassion is a long pilgrimage. From passion to compassion the distance is great. Passion is very gross, compassion very subtle; but compassion is rooted in passion so passion has not to be denied, it has not to be rejected. Roots are always ugly and passion contains the roots but those same roots can create beautiful flowers. Seeing the roots one cannot conceive that they may be hiding such beautiful flowers. It is impossible to conceive -- roots are so ugly!\nThe same is true about passion and compassion: passion is like roots hidden underground in the unconscious; and compassion is like a flowering branch -- so many flowers that the branch cannot carry the burden of it, it bends and touches the earth. Passion can be transformed into compassion through the process of meditation. Meditation is the bridge from this shore to that further shore.\nSo I am not against passion, I am not against anything at all; I am for transformation. Take hold of whatsoever energies are given to you by the whole and even if they look ugly in the beginning, don't reject them, try to refine them. Try to find out, there must be some hidden treasure in them. If nature has given them to you they must carry some message, they must carry something of immense value. But those messages have to be decoded; they are not given directly but in a code language. And meditation is the art of decoding man's animality.\nOnce it is decoded the same animality becomes man's godliness. Man is only a process from the animal to god. Man is not a place to stay; it is a bridge to be crossed.\nOne of the most significant sayings of Jesus is Life is a bridge -- don't make your\nhouse on it, pass over it. This saying is not contained in the Bible, but Sufis have carried it down the ages.\nOne of the great emperors of India, Akbar, made a new capital, a really beautiful capital which was never populated because he died. When the capital was ready he died. That's how it happens: by the time you think to enjoy and you have prepared everything, death comes and knocks you down. Death always comes at the right moment -- and the right moment means when you are ready to retire and relax.\nHe had made a beautiful capital, Fatehpur Sikri, and he wanted to retire there with his wise men and poets and singers and musicians; he was tired af the kingdom and the whole politics and he wanted to retire.\nHe had planned a beautiful town with beautiful palaces and gardens, and the entry was by a bridge across the river on the other side. On the bridge he wanted some message and he told his wise men to find a beautiful message which could be written just at the gate. And this was the sentence chosen. Life is a bridge\n-- pass through it but don't make your house on it. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMan is only a bridge, a bridge between the unconscious and the conscious, between matter and spirit, between passion and compassion, between animal and god. The bridge is the same -- the name of the bridge is meditation.\nSo put your total energy into meditation.\nTuriyananda. Turiya is a special word used by the eastern mystics; it does not mean anything, it is only a number -- it means the fourth.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to call his path the fourth way.\nMan can be divided into four stages. The first is the waking stage, the second is dreaming, the third is dreamless sleep and the fourth is the state of Buddhahood -\n- that is called turiya. Turiyananda means the bliss that happens by achieving the fourth state of consciousness.\nSo one has to become more and more aware, alert, watchful, so aware that even in sleep one can watch one's dreams, and one can remain aware that the dreams are passing by. The day it happens is of immense importance. The day you can watch your dreams just passing and you can be a witness to them, you have come half the journey already because you have passed two stages: the first of waking and the second of dreaming. And then the third is not very difficult: if you can watch dreams, you can also watch a dreamless sleep. The sleep is there, the body is resting and you are fully aware of the restfulness.\nAnd then the fourth, which is awareness of awareness itself, happens. Then the journey is complete, the circle is complete. When you become aware of awareness itself then nothing is left. You have come to the source, the source of your being, and one source of your being is also the source of all. It is not only your source, it is the source of the whole existence. At the source we are all one. That one can be called god --\nthat oneness, rather.\nSo this is the word for you to remember, the key word -- awareness. It will bring all the blessings that are possible and impossible. The possible happens through it and even the impossible happens through it.\nVedananda. Veda means wisdom and ananda means bliss.\nKnowledge is a barrier to wisdom, the only barrier. The moment one is ready to renounce knowledge one attains wisdom. Wisdom is innocence -- one has become a child again but with a difference, and a difference that really makes a difference. A child is innocent because of ignorance and the wise man is innocent, not because of ignorance but because he has renounced knowledge.\nThe child has to go into knowledge and the wise man has gone beyond it; he has left knowledge behind.\nSo in a way they are ones both are without knowledge. But in another way they are very different from each other; the child is yet ignorant, he will have to\nbecome knowledgeable; and the wise man is tired of knowledge, he has known its utter futility and he has dropped it.\nThis is the second birth. Jesus calls it being born anew. He told one of the rabbis, a professor and a scholar, Nicodemus, 'Unless you are born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.'\nNo knowledgeable person, no rabbi, no scholar, no pundit, no pope, has ever entered into the kingdom of god. They cannot; they are so full of knowledge. And it is really very strange that these same people --\nthe popes, the bishops, the priests -- go on telling their congregations that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden because they ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was the cause. If that was the cause then what are these fools doing? -- they are spreading knowledge. They go on telling people 'Read the Bible, repeat it every day...'\nThese are the people who will hinder people in getting into the kingdom of god again.\nMy work here is to help you become innocent, to be reborn. That fruit of the Tree of Knowledge has to be thrown out. Once it is thrown out the doors of the kingdom of god suddenly open for you.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"3375","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/is_the_grass_really_greener/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/is_the_grass_really_greener/>Is The Grass Really Greener</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3375 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Is_The_Grass_Really_Greener/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=chapter-title-none><span id=bookmark58>‌</span>Chapter title:

So one has to slip out of the mind to be contented, to feel
fulfilled.</p><p>The moment you stop desiring -- and desire comes in many forms, in
all sizes, in all shapes... There are people who have renounced the
world but now they are desiring the pleasures of heaven -- it is the
same desire. They are not in the marketplace, they have moved to the
monastery, to the mountains, to the deserts, but the desire has not
left. It has only taken on a new colour, a new dimension; it has come in
again from the backdoor.</p><p>So desire in all its forms, even the desire to attain the truth, is a
barrier. The desire to know god is a barrier. Any desire, desire as
such, takes you away from your reality. The moment you drop all
desiring, suddenly you explode into light, into love, into infinity,
into eternity; suddenly all that you have been desiring and not finding
is found. No-desire is the way to find, desire is the way to go
astray.</p><p>Aradhana means prayer, but not the prayer that goes on in the
churches and the temples and the synagogues.</p><p>My definition of prayer is silence, because words are useless when
you are communicating with the divine. When you are communicating with
the whole no language is needed. Language is human. Below humanity there
is no language, above humanity also there is no language. So if you are
communing with the trees no language is needed. You can hug a tree, you
can kiss a tree, but no language is needed. If you start talking with
the tree you are simply crazy! (laughter)</p><p>The same is true about that which is above humanity, again language
loses all meaning; you have to be silent. And with the beyond... you
cannot even kiss it, you cannot even hug it. It is invisible, so you can
be in utter silence, just being, and that is prayer. And in that moment
of silent being the communion happens.</p><p>So forget all the prayers that have been taught to you -- they are
all false. Learn only one prayers wordless gratitude, gratitude for the
whole, for all the beauty of existence, for all the joy of existence,
for our life, for all the gifts that the whole has given to us -- the
capacity to love, the capacity to dance, to celebrate, the capacity to
be aware, to be silent, to be prayerful. All these are immeasurable,
inestimable gifts, and we cannot return them in any way. We have nothing
to give back, but we can be thankful.</p><p>So a silent thankfulness is my definition of prayer. Shunya means
absolute zero.</p><p>The western mind associates zero with nothingness. The eastern
understanding of the zero is not of nothingness but of no-thingness --
and there is a vast difference between the two.</p><p>Nothingness gives you a negative idea; no-thingness gives you the
idea of space. There is no thing in it but there is spaciousness. It is
full, full of space -- and that's the only thing that a sannyasin is
required to create in himself, the space.</p><p>We are so full of rubbish, junk, garbage -- all kinds of furniture.
All our thoughts, desires, memories, imagination, fantasies, are nothing
but rotten furniture. We have to throw it out so that space can be
created.</p><p>Once you are full of space and nothing else, the miracle happens: the
whole universe rushes into you, Then the stars are within you and the
flowers are within you and the birds are singing within you. Then
suddenly you are in a deep harmony with the whole. <em>you</em> are the
whole. And to me that's the only possibility of being holy: to become
one with the whole.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

of all rubbish, but the moment rubbish is removed, something immensely
valuable</p><p>rushes in. It was always waiting at the gate but there was no space
for it to come in. The guest has been waiting and waiting and waiting,
but the host is so occupied inside that even if the guest knocks on the
door, the host is not going to listen -- it is so noisy inside. And even
if he listens there is no space to call the guest in.</p><p>Meditation means creating a zero within you and the moment you have
created the zero you have invited god; that's the only invitation
possible. He immediately, instantly enters in and your whole life is
transformed. Then there is no birth, no death, no misery, no anguish.
You have become one with the whole, relaxed, restful -- you have found
your home!</p><p>Dayananda means compassion plus bliss.</p><p>They are two sides of the same coin, they happen simultaneously.
Bliss happens within, compassion happens without. Bliss is the inner
side of compassion, compassion is the outer side of bliss; or,
compassion is the body and bliss is the soul.</p><p>It is better to begin with the inner, with the centre, because once
the centre is transformed the circumference follows automatically, but
not vice versa. You can try to be compassionate but it will remain just
an effort, something cultivated, painted. It will not change your
centre, in fact it will create a division in you; your circumference and
your centre will become enemies.</p><p>At the centre there will be misery, at the circumference you will be
trying to be compassionate. You will start falling apart, you will
become schizophrenic. That's what the whole humanity has become,
schizophrenic.</p><p>So never start from the circumference -- that is one of the most
significant things to remember: every beginning has to be from the
centre towards the circumference.</p><p>If you really want to change the tree, change the roots; don't go on
painting the flowers and the leaves --</p><p>your painting won't help. If the leaves are looking pale you can
paint them green, but they will die sooner because of your paint. You
can deceive people but you cannot deceive the tree, you cannot deceive
existence. If you really want the leaves to be green, then you have to
think of the roots: nourish them, water them,</p><p>and the leaves will automatically be green and the roses will become
bigger and bigger, more and more fragrant.</p><p>Start with the centre, start with bliss, and compassion follows like
a shadow.</p><p>Krishnananda. Krishna is one of the names of god. Ananda means bliss.
Krishnananda means divine bliss, godly bliss.</p><p>Man's real search is not for god, it is for bliss. Of course when you
have found bliss you have found god too, but those who are trying to
find god have started the journey from a wrong angle. The word 'god'
does not ring any bells in the heart. If you were not told about god
from your childhood you may not have ever thought about it.</p><p>In Communist Russia children are not told about god so they don't
bother about it at all. Buddhists don't believe in god so their children
don't bother about god at all. Jainas in India don't believe in god so
their religion is a godless religion, there is no question about god at
all. Not a single Jaina has ever asked me whether god exists or not. But
as far as bliss is concerned, whether you are told about it or not, you
will seek it. You will seek it in Communist Russia, you will seek it in
a Buddhist home, you will seek it in a Christian family; you will seek
it wherever you are. Atheist, theist, communist, fascist, it doesn't
matter.</p><p>So bliss is our true search. Of course when bliss is found much more
is found with it. And because of that much more we had to give it a new
name, because it is not only bliss -- it is bliss plus many things, many
indefinable things, many mysterious things -- so we had to coin the word
'god'. But that word is meaningful only when you have found bliss;
before that, the word is utterly meaningless, there is no need to talk
about it.</p><p>If one goes on searching for bliss one finds god too. And whenever
you think about god you always think of him as being somewhere outside
and whenever you think of bliss you cannot think of it as being outside;
it has to be something inner -- an inner glow, an inner rejoicing. God
can be worshipped, bliss cannot be worshipped. So around the idea of god
religions can be created, anti-religions can be created, but around the
idea of bliss no religion is created, no religion can be created. hence
what I am doing here is not creating a religion, but only a kind of
religiousness.</p><p>My sannyasins are not searching for god, they are searching for bliss
within</p><p>themselves. But once you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

truth, god, freedom, love, compassion --</p><p>the list is almost endless! How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Not so long... or forever.</p><p>-- Be here. Forever is better -- a little more! Good. Shunyananda.
Shunya means zero. Anand means bliss.</p><p>To be absolutely silent, thoughtless, is the meaning of zero. And out
of that no- thingness, out of that zero, bliss arises. Bliss is our
intrinsic nature, but it is covered with layers and layers of rubbish.
It has to be excavated, you have to dig it out. It is just like making a
well: you go on digging layers of earth and then rocks, and one day, you
find the springs of water. They were already there but between you and
the springs of water there was this earth for twenty feet, thirty feet,
forty feet. It differs with different people.</p><p>Sometimes there are big rocks and they have to be dynamited -- for
that we have invented dynamic meditation. When you really do 'hoo, hoo,
hoo,' all rocks are dynamited. Just sitting silently, doing nothing it
won't happen! (laughter) 'Hoo' really hits hard and it hits at exactly
the right place, where one needs to be hit.</p><p>So one has to go on digging. All the methods of meditation are
nothing but methods of digging.</p><p>Bliss is within you, you just have to become empty of all that is
covering it. Once the zero is found, suddenly, immediately, instantly,
bliss starts overflowing you. And it comes like a flood; you cannot
contain it. It becomes a dance, it</p><p>becomes a song, it becomes a sharing! How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Two weeks.</p><p>-- Then come back again, because in two weeks you will be able to
find only the rock (much laughter). So dynamite it a little more, time
will be needed, so come back again. Good!</p><p>Karunesha means goddess of compassion.</p><p>Compassion makes one a god or a goddess, but to achieve compassion is
a long pilgrimage. From passion to compassion the distance is great.
Passion is very gross, compassion very subtle; but compassion is rooted
in passion so passion has not to be denied, it has not to be rejected.
Roots are always ugly and passion contains the roots but those same
roots can create beautiful flowers. Seeing the roots one cannot conceive
that they may be hiding such beautiful flowers. It is impossible to
conceive -- roots are so ugly!</p><p>The same is true about passion and compassion: passion is like roots
hidden underground in the unconscious; and compassion is like a
flowering branch -- so many flowers that the branch cannot carry the
burden of it, it bends and touches the earth. Passion can be transformed
into compassion through the process of meditation. Meditation is the
bridge from this shore to that further shore.</p><p>So I am not against passion, I am not against anything at all; I am
for transformation. Take hold of whatsoever energies are given to you by
the whole and even if they look ugly in the beginning, don't reject
them, try to refine them. Try to find out, there must be some hidden
treasure in them. If nature has given them to you they must carry some
message, they must carry something of immense value. But those messages
have to be decoded; they are not given directly but in a code language.
And meditation is the art of decoding man's animality.</p><p>Once it is decoded the same animality becomes man's godliness. Man is
only a process from the animal to god. Man is not a place to stay; it is
a bridge to be crossed.</p><p>One of the most significant sayings of Jesus is Life is a bridge --
don't make your</p><p>house on it, pass over it. This saying is not contained in the Bible,
but Sufis have carried it down the ages.</p><p>One of the great emperors of India, Akbar, made a new capital, a
really beautiful capital which was never populated because he died. When
the capital was ready he died. That's how it happens: by the time you
think to enjoy and you have prepared everything, death comes and knocks
you down. Death always comes at the right moment -- and the right moment
means when you are ready to retire and relax.</p><p>He had made a beautiful capital, Fatehpur Sikri, and he wanted to
retire there with his wise men and poets and singers and musicians; he
was tired af the kingdom and the whole politics and he wanted to
retire.</p><p>He had planned a beautiful town with beautiful palaces and gardens,
and the entry was by a bridge across the river on the other side. On the
bridge he wanted some message and he told his wise men to find a
beautiful message which could be written just at the gate. And this was
the sentence chosen. Life is a bridge</p><p>-- pass through it but don't make your house on it. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Man is only a bridge, a bridge between the unconscious and the
conscious, between matter and spirit, between passion and compassion,
between animal and god. The bridge is the same -- the name of the bridge
is meditation.</p><p>So put your total energy into meditation.</p><p>Turiyananda. Turiya is a special word used by the eastern mystics; it
does not mean anything, it is only a number -- it means the fourth.</p><p>George Gurdjieff used to call his path the fourth way.</p><p>Man can be divided into four stages. The first is the waking stage,
the second is dreaming, the third is dreamless sleep and the fourth is
the state of Buddhahood -</p><p>- that is called turiya. Turiyananda means the bliss that happens by
achieving the fourth state of consciousness.</p><p>So one has to become more and more aware, alert, watchful, so aware
that even in sleep one can watch one's dreams, and one can remain aware
that the dreams are passing by. The day it happens is of immense
importance. The day you can watch your dreams just passing and you can
be a witness to them, you have come half the journey already because you
have passed two stages: the first of waking and the second of dreaming.
And then the third is not very difficult: if you can watch dreams, you
can also watch a dreamless sleep. The sleep is there, the body is
resting and you are fully aware of the restfulness.</p><p>And then the fourth, which is awareness of awareness itself, happens.
Then the journey is complete, the circle is complete. When you become
aware of awareness itself then nothing is left. You have come to the
source, the source of your being, and one source of your being is also
the source of all. It is not only your source, it is the source of the
whole existence. At the source we are all one. That one can be called
god --</p><p>that oneness, rather.</p><p>So this is the word for you to remember, the key word -- awareness.
It will bring all the blessings that are possible and impossible. The
possible happens through it and even the impossible happens through
it.</p><p>Vedananda. Veda means wisdom and ananda means bliss.</p><p>Knowledge is a barrier to wisdom, the <em>only</em> barrier. The
moment one is ready to renounce knowledge one attains wisdom. Wisdom is
innocence -- one has become a child again but with a difference, and a
difference that <em>really</em> makes a difference. A child is innocent
because of ignorance and the wise man is innocent, not because of
ignorance but because he has renounced knowledge.</p><p>The child has to go into knowledge and the wise man has gone beyond
it; he has left knowledge behind.</p><p>So in a way they are ones both are without knowledge. But in another
way they are very different from each other; the child is yet ignorant,
he will have to</p><p>become knowledgeable; and the wise man is tired of knowledge, he has
known its utter futility and he has dropped it.</p><p>This is the second birth. Jesus calls it being born anew. He told one
of the rabbis, a professor and a scholar, Nicodemus, 'Unless you are
born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.'</p><p>No knowledgeable person, no rabbi, no scholar, no pundit, no pope,
has ever entered into the kingdom of god. They cannot; they are so full
of knowledge. And it is really very strange that these same people
--</p><p>the popes, the bishops, the priests -- go on telling their
congregations that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden
because they ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; the fruit of the
Tree of Knowledge was the cause. If that was the cause then what are
these fools doing? -- they are spreading knowledge. They go on telling
people 'Read the Bible, repeat it every day...'</p><p>These are the people who will hinder people in getting into the
kingdom of god again.</p><p>My work here is to help you become innocent, to be reborn. That fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge has to be thrown out. Once it is thrown out the
doors of the kingdom of god suddenly open for you.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/is_the_grass_really_greener/part3/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: None</span>

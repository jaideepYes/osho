It is for reference purposes only.]\nSatyam literally means the truth, but the approach of the western mind and the eastern is so different, so diametrically opposite, that sometimes literal translations of words are not adequate at all.\nIn the West truth is a philosophical quest; in the East it is a mystical enquiry -- and there is tremendous difference. Philosophy means something of the head and mysticism is something of the heart. Philosophy is based on logical reasoning, and mysticism is rooted in something that transcends all logic, it is supralogic.\nAnd when I use the word 'truth' I use it with the eastern emphasis -- and that makes a lot of difference.\nIn the East we have thought about truth as an experience, not as a logical conclusion; more like love and less like logic, more in the mode of feeling than in the mode of thinking. In fact in the West if you are an enquirer, a seeker of truth, you have to sharpen your reasoning you have to become very skilful in thinking.\nThat's what the whole western philosophy is, the art of thinking.\nIn the East just the opposite has to be done: logic, reasoning, mind itself has to be put aside; you have to come into direct contact with reality, into immediate contact with reality.\nThe mind is an interference because it interprets reality, and the moment you interpret, it is something else, it is no more the something.\nThe mind cannot experience, only the heart can experience, but the mind can interpret, the heart cannot interpret. The mind interprets without experiencing. It is like a blind man talking about light to a dumb man who cannot talk but who knows what light is.\nThe heart is dumb, silent; it cannot express itself, there is no way for it to express itself, but it can feel.\nTile mind is very talkative -- it can interpret, comment, argue, philosophise, prove, disprove, but it cannot experience. And the real thing is experience -- whether you can talk about it or not is immaterial.\nHence all the great eastern mystics have said nothing can be said about truth. All that we say is how to reach it but nothing can be said about the experience itself; one has to experience it to know it The Buddhas only show the way, they give you some hints about how to reach to the ultimate peak of experience, but that's all; you will know only when you have reached. The truth has to be an individual experience. It cannot be borrowed, it cannot be transferred; it cannot even be expressed. And that is its beauty; its profoundness is such that no word can be comprehensive enough, no language is so unlimited that it can contain it.\nSo remember, when I say the truth, I mean the truth of the mystics, not the truth of the philosophers.\nEven in the West there have been mystics but they are not the main current of the\nwestern mind. Jesus is a mystic, not a philosopher; Eckhart is a mystic, not a philosopher; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Plotinus -- these are mystics, not philosophers. But they are far and few in between, very rare. And because the western philosophy knows no place to put them, to what category they belong, they are ordinarily but into the same category as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Bradley, Russell, Wittgenstein, Sartre. They are put in the same category because that is the only category known in the West.\nIn the East we have an absolute distinction. The philosophers are not counted with the Buddhas; they are only thinkers, mere thinkers. The Buddhas are the knowers. And my sannyasins have to make a journey of knowing, not of thinking.\nAnubodh means awareness -- and that is the secret key, the most essential part of religious experiment, of religious investigation, enquiry, exploration.\nOne has to become more aware than one ordinarily is. The ordinary life does not need more awareness than you have; just a superficial awareness is enough to go to the office, to do the routine work, to come home, to reproduce children, to get things done. And once you have learned them, you go on repeating the same pattern every day -- it is a mechanical phenomenon. The mechanical life is the mundane life.\nTo be a sannyasin means to enter into the phenomenon of the sacred. For that more awareness is needed, much more, because it is not something mechanical, something routine. It is now every day. It is moving; from the unknown towards the unknowable; it is dropping the known every day, dying to the known and entering into the unknown. It is an eternal pilgrimage, because every moment is so full of mystery that one has to be very alert, otherwise one will miss. One has to be constantly watchful.\nVery few people know the beauty of the stars. Even if they do, they have read it in a poem; it is not their own experience. Very few people know the beauty of the mountains. Even if they do it is because they have looked at albums, pictures, films. Even if they go to the Himalayas, they are much more concerned with taking photographs rather than looking at the reality.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe tourist is a very strange personality: carrying the camera everywhere. His idea is that back home, sitting before the fireplace at ease, he will look at the pictures, at how beautiful the Himalayas were; and when he was in the Himalayas he was concerned with the camera -- loading, unloading and clicking. The camera was not working (laughter)... and something got stuck and Who\nbothers about the Himalayas!\nThat is later on when the album is ready and one sits in the easy chair and relaxes, with the coffee pot by the (much laughter) side and... (The rest of the sentence is drowned in a deluge of laughter.) That's how people are.\nThis is not the way to experience reality -- it is a way to avoid it. Your pictures cannot contain the beauty or maybe only a very far far-away echo. They cannot\ncontain the coolness of the breeze, the warmth of the sun. They are bound to be one-dimensional, flat.\nOnce a friend said to Picasso 'I don't like your paintings. They don't represent reality, they are not realistic.' He said 'Rather, I like photographs -- which are realistic, representative. For an example, he took out of his pocket, a photograph of his would-be wife and he showed it to Picasso saying 'Look at this picture, this is my would-be wife: see how beautiful she is and how clear the photograph is. This is a realistic thing.' Picasso touched the photograph, felt it and said 'But your would-be wife looks very flat -- no curves, absolutely flat. What are you going to do with this woman?'\nOf course a picture is a flat thing, it cannot represent the multi-dimensional reality. It is only a reflection in the mirror and that too is dead -- because if you are in the Himalayas it is changing every moment. The clouds are dispersing, moving; sometimes the sun is there and the peaks with the virgin snow are all golden; and sometimes it is clouded and all that gold suddenly disappears and the shade and the shadows of the clouds move on the snow. You can see it reflected in the snow, the peaks functioning like mirrors. Your pictures, howsoever beautiful they are, cannot contain its reality.\nYou have to be more in contact with that which surrounds you; for that only one thing is needed, and that is more alertness. Very few people are alert. They go on\nlike sleepwalkers, somnambulists. Somehow they manage, but for that management just a small bit of consciousness needed, a very peripheral thing. And awareness, Anubodh, means a central awareness, not peripheral. Your very centre is full of consciousness, you are all consciousness. Only then does one become aware of the presence of the sacred, of the divine.\nThen this very earth is paradise.\nGetting initiation into sannyas really means getting initiation into awareness. That's the whole work a sannyasin has to do. All the methods of meditation are nothing but devices to help you to become more aware.\nNaresha means an empress, a queen.\nMan is not born as a beggar but ho lives like a beggar -- and the whole responsibility is his, he chooses to live like a beggar. Life gives so much but he is not ready to receive it, he is very reluctant; he is closed.\nWhen love knocks on his door he shrinks, withdraws; he is even afraid of love. He is afraid of truth; he feels more comfortable with conventional beliefs, which are nothing but beautiful lies, comfortable lies. At the most they can give one consolation.\nTruth needs enquiry, it needs work. A belief needs nothing; you can simply believe. Just by being born accidentally into a Christian home or a Hindu home or a Mohammedan home, one gets beliefs. People start conditioning you -- the parents, the teachers, the priests. They are all ready to jump upon every child and they start giving him a shape and a form. They call it education, culturisation, civilisation. And all they do is to give the child cheap beliefs, plastic flowers, which are of no help. In fact they are harmful, because then a person becomes afraid of truth; he has invested so much in beliefs that he is not ready to look at the truth; he avoids it. To look at the truth will mean all his beliefs will be shattered and with those beliefs all his dreams will be shattered and all his investment will be gone down the drain. So he shuts himself off.\nPeople are taught in such a way that they become incapable of love, incapable of truth, incapable of authenticity and sincerity. And the strange thing is that everybody's taught to find god but all the qualities that help to find god are destroyed, systematically destroyed.\nThat's why there are so many churches and so many temples, synagogues and mosques and all people belong to some religion or other -- still, the world is absolutely irreligious. God is only a formality.\nPeople don't bother really about god or anything significant. In fact it is impolite to talk about such things; people don't want to get involved in such things -- it is better to talk about the weather.\nEnglish people are very much interested in the weather. And it is a very strange thing because what is there to talk about? And both know what the weather is.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Osho's thumb arches back over itself to indicate Vivek sitting by his side.) Yes, she is also English!\n(laughter) When you meet her you can talk about the weather. (There is a roar of laughter.) Yes, she is...\nThere are many English people hiding here!\nIt is good manners to talk about the weather because you don't get into any controversial thing: that it is very cloudy -- of course you can...(He doesn't even bother to finish the sentence this time. Naresha smiles; and the group behind her doubles up.) But to talk about god or to talk about truth or to talk about anything really significant is dangerous; the other person may not agree. There may be argument, there may be a conflict; there is every possibility that that may create a disagreement -- and it is not good. When people meet they have to create a certain kind of lubricant between themselves so things go smoothly.\nMan is born with infinite potential. He can be as great as a Buddha, as a Jesus, as a Zarathustra; but he lives at the minimum, he never reaches the maximum. And the only reason is that he remains confined to his conditionings given by others.\nMy sannyasins have to drop those conditionings. They have to come out of the cave that others have created for them to live in. It is a dark cave, very small, but cosy and comfortable. They have to come out into the open, under the sky, under the stars, and they have to be adventurers, adventurers about life, about consciousness, about love, about truth. Nothing has to be accepted as belief, everything has to be explored.\nUnless you experience it as true there is no need to believe in anything.\nI don't give any belief, any dogma, any creed. I only provide you methods to enquire with. And once a person becomes an explorer he is on the way to becoming an emperor. He may not possess anything of the world but he will possess his inner being -- and that is the most precious thing. Jesus calls it the kingdom of god. It certainly is!\nParishuddha means perfectly pure.\nThoughts, desires, memories -- these are the impurities of consciousness. Consciousness is pure when there are no thoughts, no desires, no memories. It is just as when there are no clouds the sky is pure. Purity means to be just your essential consciousness with no content, no clouds, just and openness, a vastness\n--\nunhindered, unbounded. And that's the whole purpose of meditation, to give you a perfect purity, a clarity, an open sky.\nSo all that a sannyasin has to do is to get out of the rut of thoughts. It is not as difficult as it appears in the beginning. One only has to learn to be a witness. Just watch your thoughts whenever you have time.\nRelax and watch -- don't do anything. There is no need to fight with them, there is no need to throw them out, because if you fight with them they will defeat you. They will defeat you because you will be unnecessarily fighting with yourself.\nThoughts are non-existential, like darkness: you cannot fight with darkness because it does not exist at all. If you start wrestling with darkness you will be defeated -- not because darkness is powerful but because you will simply get tired and exhausted. There is nothing to fight -- darkness does not exist at all. All that is needed is to bring light in and there is no darkness. That light comes in by\nwitnessing, not by fighting.\nJust watch, go on looking, unattached, unconcerned, without any judgement that this thought is good or this thought is bad. Don't bring your moral notions in. Otherwise you will get involved in thinking, because you will cling to the good and you will want to throw out the bad -- and they are inseparable. They have a certain intrinsic unity, a certain organic unity. If you throw out the bad you will have to throw out the good too. If you want to keep the good you will have to keep the bad too. They are two sides of the same coin.\nThat's why every saint is unconsciously a sinner: That is the other side. He is just a repressed sinner.\nAnd every sinner is a repressed saint. So there is not much difference. The only difference is that one is standing on his feet and the other is standing on his head, upside-down, that's all. The saint is doing a headstand. Saints, particularly in India, love to stand on their heads very much. But that's what they are actually doing for their whole life; that headstand, the sirshasana, represents their whole life. But even if you are standing on your head you are the same person, nothing has changed; it is just that your legs are up and your head is down. Just a little digging in the saint and you will find the sinner. So every saint is a sinner in his dreams and every sinner is a saint in his dreams. That's why the psychoanalysis pays so much attention to dreams -- because they show what part you have repressed and the repressed part is very significant because it goes into your unconscious; and the unconscious is bigger. The conscious is only one-tenth and the unconscious is nine times bigger than the conscious. So the saint is only one- tenth and nine times more he is a sinner. In fact the sinner is in a far better situation psychologically: he is only one-tenth a sinner and nine times a saint.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI have more love for the sinner than for the saints. For the saints I have only pity, I feel sorry for them.\nRemember that to fight with anything is going to create a dichotomy in you, a division, a split personality. So don't choose, don't fight, don't judge. Remain choicelessly aware and slowly slowly you will find those clouds are disappearing. And the moment the sky is completely without clouds there is purity. It has nothing to do with morality -- it is innocence.\nYour vision will be clear, unhindered. You can see, you can hear for the first time; you can feel, you can touch, you can smell for the first time; you can taste for the first time. Then all your senses are doors to the divine. Then each sense brings a new feel of the divine. Then you are surrounded by the divine -- you see the divine, you hear the divine, you taste the divine, you touch the divine, you smell the divine. All your five senses are continuously pouring the divine into you.\nIt was happening before also but you were not able to see it. There were so many thoughts, desires, memories, imagination, dreams, fantasies, between you and the reality -- a thick China wall. But it disappears very easily, one just has to be a witness. Witnessing is the whole art of meditation.\nGyanesha means goddess of wisdom; remember, not of knowledge but of wisdom. And the difference is as much as it can be. They are unbridgeable, in fact they are opposites, enemies.\nThe knowledgeable person cannot become wise. It is impossible, absolutely impossible for him to become wise, because his knowledgeability does not allow him innocence, does not allow him wonder. He cannot feel any surprise, he cannot taste anything mysterious, magical. His life is flat. And the reason is that he thinks he already knows, he has answers, ready-made answers for every question. He has never really asked the question, he has only learned the answer. And how can you learn an answer?\nFirst he learns the answer and then he manages the question, but the question comes later on, it is not his own. The answer is somebody else's and just to make the answer fit with him he creates a question. The question is not part of his own growth. So he knows the question and he knows the answer, but he has never been in any quest, he has never risked anything for the question, he has never gone into it the whole way, he has never gambled. He has only learned the answer from the scriptures, from the scholars, from the philosophers. And so many answers are available. For each question thousands of answers are\navailable --\nyou can have your choice.\nA knowledgeable person is a stupid person, very stupid, unintelligent. He may be intellectual but he is not intelligent at all.\nWisdom is intelligence and the first act required for wisdom to happen is one has to discard all knowledge in toto; one has to become a child again -- innocent, full of wonder, awe. Everything seems to be mysterious because there is no answer.\nGertrude Stein on her deathbed suddenly opened her eyes and said \"What is the answer?\" The friends who had gathered were a little bit puzzled; \"What is the answer?\" What kind of a question is this? -- because the question had not been asked.\nOne person gathered courage and said \"But we don't know the question, so first tell us about the question, only then can something be done about the answer.\" She laughed and said \"Okay. Then what is the question?\"... and she died! Neither the question is known nor the answer is known -- and this was at her last moment. But this is the tragedy of humanity. At least at the last moment she had the guts to ask \"What is the answer?\" Of course there was no time left, that's why she was saying \"What is the answer? Don't waste time with the question -- just give me the answer.\" And because they insisted, she said \"Okay, then what is the question?\"\nThis is really the situation: we don't know the question, we don't know the answer, but we are full of knowledge. The wise man is not at all full of knowledge. He knows the question and he knows the answer; and there is only one question and there is only one answer. The question is \"Who am I?\" and the answer cannot be given, one has to find it.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Satyam literally means the truth, but the approach of the western
mind and the eastern is so different, so diametrically opposite, that
sometimes literal translations of words are not adequate at all.</p><p>In the West truth is a philosophical quest; in the East it is a
mystical enquiry -- and there is tremendous difference. Philosophy means
something of the head and mysticism is something of the heart.
Philosophy is based on logical reasoning, and mysticism is rooted in
something that transcends all logic, it is supralogic.</p><p>And when I use the word 'truth' I use it with the eastern emphasis --
and that makes a lot of difference.</p><p>In the East we have thought about truth as an experience, not as a
logical conclusion; more like love and less like logic, more in the mode
of feeling than in the mode of thinking. In fact in the West if you are
an enquirer, a seeker of truth, you have to sharpen your reasoning you
have to become very skilful in thinking.</p><p>That's what the whole western philosophy is, the art of thinking.</p><p>In the East just the opposite has to be done: logic, reasoning, mind
itself has to be put aside; you have to come into direct contact with
reality, into immediate contact with reality.</p><p>The mind is an interference because it interprets reality, and the
moment you interpret, it is something else, it is no more the
something.</p><p>The mind cannot experience, only the heart can experience, but the
mind can interpret, the heart cannot interpret. The mind interprets
without experiencing. It is like a blind man talking about light to a
dumb man who cannot talk but who knows what light is.</p><p>The heart is dumb, silent; it cannot express itself, there is no way
for it to express itself, but it can feel.</p><p>Tile mind is very talkative -- it can interpret, comment, argue,
philosophise, prove, disprove, but it cannot experience. And the real
thing is experience -- whether you can talk about it or not is
immaterial.</p><p>Hence all the great eastern mystics have said nothing can be said
about truth. All that we say is how to reach it but nothing can be said
about the experience itself; one has to experience it to know it The
Buddhas only show the way, they give you some hints about how to reach
to the ultimate peak of experience, but that's all; you will know only
when you have reached. The truth has to be an individual experience. It
cannot be borrowed, it cannot be transferred; it cannot even be
expressed. And that is its beauty; its profoundness is such that no word
can be comprehensive enough, no language is so unlimited that it can
contain it.</p><p>So remember, when I say the truth, I mean the truth of the mystics,
not the truth of the philosophers.</p><p>Even in the West there have been mystics but they are not the main
current of the</p><p>western mind. Jesus is a mystic, not a philosopher; Eckhart is a
mystic, not a philosopher; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Plotinus -- these are
mystics, not philosophers. But they are far and few in between, very
rare. And because the western philosophy knows no place to put them, to
what category they belong, they are ordinarily but into the same
category as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Bradley, Russell,
Wittgenstein, Sartre. They are put in the same category because that is
the only category known in the West.</p><p>In the East we have an absolute distinction. The philosophers are not
counted with the Buddhas; they are only thinkers, mere thinkers. The
Buddhas are the knowers. And my sannyasins have to make a journey of
knowing, not of thinking.</p><p>Anubodh means awareness -- and that is the secret key, the most
essential part of religious experiment, of religious investigation,
enquiry, exploration.</p><p>One has to become more aware than one ordinarily is. The ordinary
life does not need more awareness than you have; just a superficial
awareness is enough to go to the office, to do the routine work, to come
home, to reproduce children, to get things done. And once you have
learned them, you go on repeating the same pattern every day -- it is a
mechanical phenomenon. The mechanical life is the mundane life.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means to enter into the phenomenon of the sacred.
For that more awareness is needed, much more, because it is not
something mechanical, something routine. It is now every day. It is
moving; from the unknown towards the unknowable; it is dropping the
known every day, dying to the known and entering into the unknown. It is
an eternal pilgrimage, because every moment is so full of mystery that
one has to be very alert, otherwise one will miss. One has to be
constantly watchful.</p><p>Very few people know the beauty of the stars. Even if they do, they
have read it in a poem; it is not their own experience. Very few people
know the beauty of the mountains. Even if they do it is because they
have looked at albums, pictures, films. Even if they go to the
Himalayas, they are much more concerned with taking photographs rather
than looking at the reality.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The tourist is a very strange personality: carrying the camera
everywhere. His idea is that back home, sitting before the fireplace at
ease, he will look at the pictures, at how beautiful the Himalayas were;
and when he was in the Himalayas he was concerned with the camera --
loading, unloading and clicking. The camera was not working
(laughter)... and something got stuck and Who</p><p>bothers about the Himalayas!</p><p>That is later on when the album is ready and one sits in the easy
chair and relaxes, with the coffee pot by the (much laughter) side
and... (The rest of the sentence is drowned in a deluge of laughter.)
That's how people are.</p><p>This is not the way to experience reality -- it is a way to avoid it.
Your pictures cannot contain the beauty or maybe only a very far
far-away echo. They cannot</p><p>contain the coolness of the breeze, the warmth of the sun. They are
bound to be one-dimensional, flat.</p><p>Once a friend said to Picasso 'I don't like your paintings. They
don't represent reality, they are not realistic.' He said 'Rather, I
like photographs -- which are realistic, representative. For an example,
he took out of his pocket, a photograph of his would-be wife and he
showed it to Picasso saying 'Look at this picture, this is my would-be
wife: see how beautiful she is and how clear the photograph <em>is</em>.
This is a realistic thing.' Picasso touched the photograph, felt it and
said 'But your would-be wife looks very flat -- no curves, absolutely
flat. What are you going to do with this woman?'</p><p>Of course a picture is a flat thing, it cannot represent the
multi-dimensional reality. It is only a reflection in the mirror and
that too is dead -- because if you are in the Himalayas it is changing
every moment. The clouds are dispersing, moving; sometimes the sun is
there and the peaks with the virgin snow are all golden; and sometimes
it is clouded and all that gold suddenly disappears and the shade and
the shadows of the clouds move on the snow. You can see it reflected in
the snow, the peaks functioning like mirrors. Your pictures, howsoever
beautiful they are, cannot contain its reality.</p><p>You have to be more in contact with that which surrounds you; for
that only one thing is needed, and that is more alertness. Very few
people are alert. They go on</p><p>like sleepwalkers, somnambulists. Somehow they manage, but for that
management just a small bit of consciousness needed, a very peripheral
thing. And awareness, Anubodh, means a central awareness, not
peripheral. Your very centre is full of consciousness, you are all
consciousness. Only then does one become aware of the presence of the
sacred, of the divine.</p><p>Then this very earth is paradise.</p><p>Getting initiation into sannyas really means getting initiation into
awareness. That's the whole work a sannyasin has to do. All the methods
of meditation are nothing but devices to help you to become more
aware.</p><p>Naresha means an empress, a queen.</p><p>Man is not born as a beggar but ho lives like a beggar -- and the
whole responsibility is his, he chooses to live like a beggar. Life
gives so much but he is not ready to receive it, he is very reluctant;
he is closed.</p><p>When love knocks on his door he shrinks, withdraws; he is even afraid
of love. He is afraid of truth; he feels more comfortable with
conventional beliefs, which are nothing but beautiful lies, comfortable
lies. At the most they can give one consolation.</p><p>Truth needs enquiry, it needs work. A belief needs nothing; you can
simply believe. Just by being born accidentally into a Christian home or
a Hindu home or a Mohammedan home, one gets beliefs. People start
conditioning you -- the parents, the teachers, the priests. They are all
ready to jump upon every child and they start giving him a shape and a
form. They call it education, culturisation, civilisation. And all they
do is to give the child cheap beliefs, plastic flowers, which are of no
help. In fact they are harmful, because then a person becomes afraid of
truth; he has invested so much in beliefs that he is not ready to look
at the truth; he avoids it. To look at the truth will mean all his
beliefs will be shattered and with those beliefs all his dreams will be
shattered and all his investment will be gone down the drain. So he
shuts himself off.</p><p>People are taught in such a way that they become incapable of love,
incapable of truth, incapable of authenticity and sincerity. And the
strange thing is that everybody's taught to find god but all the
qualities that help to find god are destroyed, systematically
destroyed.</p><p>That's why there are so many churches and so many temples, synagogues
and mosques and all people belong to some religion or other -- still,
the world is absolutely irreligious. God is only a formality.</p><p>People don't bother really about god or anything significant. In fact
it is impolite to talk about such things; people don't want to get
involved in such things -- it is better to talk about the weather.</p><p>English people are very much interested in the weather. And it is a
very strange thing because what is there to talk about? And both know
what the weather is.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Osho's thumb arches back over itself to indicate Vivek sitting by
his side.) Yes, she is also English!</p><p>(laughter) When you meet her you can talk about the weather. (There
is a roar of laughter.) Yes, she is...</p><p>There are many English people hiding here!</p><p>It is good manners to talk about the weather because you don't get
into any controversial thing: that it is very cloudy -- of course you
can...(He doesn't even bother to finish the sentence this time. Naresha
smiles; and the group behind her doubles up.) But to talk about god or
to talk about truth or to talk about anything <em>really</em>
significant is dangerous; the other person may not agree. There may be
argument, there may be a conflict; there is every possibility that that
may create a disagreement -- and it is not good. When people meet they
have to create a certain kind of lubricant between themselves so things
go smoothly.</p><p>Man is born with infinite potential. He can be as great as a Buddha,
as a Jesus, as a Zarathustra; but he lives at the minimum, he never
reaches the maximum. And the only reason is that he remains confined to
his conditionings given by others.</p><p>My sannyasins have to drop those conditionings. They have to come out
of the cave that others have created for them to live in. It is a dark
cave, very small, but cosy and comfortable. They have to come out into
the open, under the sky, under the stars, and they have to be
adventurers, adventurers about life, about consciousness, about love,
about truth. Nothing has to be accepted as belief, everything has to be
explored.</p><p>Unless <em>you</em> experience it as true there is no need to believe
in anything.</p><p>I don't give any belief, any dogma, any creed. I only provide you
methods to enquire with. And once a person becomes an explorer he is on
the way to becoming an emperor. He may not possess anything of the world
but he will possess his inner being -- and that is the most precious
thing. Jesus calls it the kingdom of god. It certainly is!</p><p>Parishuddha means perfectly pure.</p><p>Thoughts, desires, memories -- these are the impurities of
consciousness. Consciousness is pure when there are no thoughts, no
desires, no memories. It is just as when there are no clouds the sky is
pure. Purity means to be just your essential consciousness with no
content, no clouds, just and openness, a vastness</p><p>--</p><p>unhindered, unbounded. And that's the whole purpose of meditation, to
give you a perfect purity, a clarity, an open sky.</p><p>So all that a sannyasin has to do is to get out of the rut of
thoughts. It is not as difficult as it appears in the beginning. One
only has to learn to be a witness. Just watch your thoughts whenever you
have time.</p><p>Relax and watch -- don't do anything. There is no need to fight with
them, there is no need to throw them out, because if you fight with them
they will defeat you. They will defeat you because you will be
unnecessarily fighting with yourself.</p><p>Thoughts are non-existential, like darkness: you cannot fight with
darkness because it does not exist at all. If you start wrestling with
darkness you will be defeated -- not because darkness is powerful but
because you will simply get tired and exhausted. There is nothing to
fight -- darkness does not exist at all. All that is needed is to bring
light in and there is no darkness. That light comes in by</p><p>witnessing, not by fighting.</p><p>Just watch, go on looking, unattached, unconcerned, without any
judgement that this thought is good or this thought is bad. Don't bring
your moral notions in. Otherwise you will get involved in thinking,
because you will cling to the good and you will want to throw out the
bad -- and they are inseparable. They have a certain intrinsic unity, a
certain organic unity. If you throw out the bad you will have to throw
out the good too. If you want to keep the good you will have to keep the
bad too. They are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>That's why every saint is unconsciously a sinner: That is the other
side. He is just a repressed sinner.</p><p>And every sinner is a repressed saint. So there is not much
difference. The only difference is that one is standing on his feet and
the other is standing on his head, upside-down, that's all. The saint is
doing a headstand. Saints, particularly in India, love to stand on their
heads very much. But that's what they are actually doing for their whole
life; that headstand, the sirshasana, represents their whole life. But
even if you are standing on your head you are the same person, nothing
has changed; it is just that your legs are up and your head is down.
Just a little digging in the saint and you will find the sinner. So
every saint is a sinner in his dreams and every sinner is a saint in his
dreams. That's why the psychoanalysis pays so much attention to dreams
-- because they show what part you have repressed and the repressed part
is very significant because it goes into your unconscious; and the
unconscious is bigger. The conscious is only one-tenth and the
unconscious is nine times bigger than the conscious. So the saint is
only one- tenth and nine times more he is a sinner. In fact the sinner
is in a far better situation psychologically: he is only one-tenth a
sinner and nine times a saint.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>I have more love for the sinner than for the saints. For the saints I
have only pity, I feel sorry for them.</p><p>Remember that to fight with anything is going to create a dichotomy
in you, a division, a split personality. So don't choose, don't fight,
don't judge. Remain choicelessly aware and slowly slowly you will find
those clouds are disappearing. And the moment the sky is completely
without clouds there is purity. It has nothing to do with morality -- it
is innocence.</p><p>Your vision will be clear, unhindered. You can see, you can hear for
the first time; you can feel, you can touch, you can smell for the first
time; you can taste for the first time. Then all your senses are doors
to the divine. Then each sense brings a new feel of the divine. Then you
are surrounded by the divine -- you see the divine, you hear the divine,
you taste the divine, you touch the divine, you smell the divine. All
your five senses are continuously pouring the divine into you.</p><p>It was happening before also but you were not able to see it. There
were so many thoughts, desires, memories, imagination, dreams,
fantasies, between you and the reality -- a thick China wall. But it
disappears very easily, one just has to be a witness. Witnessing is the
whole art of meditation.</p><p>Gyanesha means goddess of wisdom; remember, not of knowledge but of
wisdom. And the difference is as much as it can be. They are
unbridgeable, in fact they are opposites, enemies.</p><p>The knowledgeable person cannot become wise. It is impossible,
absolutely impossible for him to become wise, because his
knowledgeability does not allow him innocence, does not allow him
wonder. He cannot feel any surprise, he cannot taste anything
mysterious, magical. His life is flat. And the reason is that he thinks
he already knows, he has answers, ready-made answers for every question.
He has never really asked the question, he has only learned the answer.
And how can you learn an answer?</p><p>First he learns the answer and then he manages the question, but the
question comes later on, it is not his own. The answer is somebody
else's and just to make the answer fit with him he creates a question.
The question is not part of his own growth. So he knows the question and
he knows the answer, but he has never been in any quest, he has never
risked anything for the question, he has never gone into it the whole
way, he has never gambled. He has only learned the answer from the
scriptures, from the scholars, from the philosophers. And so many
answers are available. For each question thousands of answers are</p><p>available --</p><p>you can have your choice.</p><p>A knowledgeable person is a stupid person, very stupid,
unintelligent. He may be intellectual but he is not intelligent at
all.</p><p>Wisdom is intelligence and the first act required for wisdom to
happen is one has to discard all knowledge in toto; one has to become a
child again -- innocent, full of wonder, awe. Everything seems to be
mysterious because there is no answer.</p><p>Gertrude Stein on her deathbed suddenly opened her eyes and said
"What is the answer?" The friends who had gathered were a little bit
puzzled; "What is the answer?" What kind of a question is this? --
because the question had not been asked.</p><p>One person gathered courage and said "But we don't know the question,
so first tell us about the question, only then can something be done
about the answer." She laughed and said "Okay. Then what is the
question?"... and she died! Neither the question is known nor the answer
is known -- and this was at her last moment. But this is the tragedy of
humanity. At least at the last moment she had the guts to ask "What is
the answer?" Of course there was no time left, that's why she was saying
"What is the answer? Don't waste time with the question -- just give me
the answer." And because they insisted, she said "Okay, then what is the
question?"</p><p>This is really the situation: we don't know the question, we don't
know the answer, but we are full of knowledge. The wise man is not at
all full of knowledge. He knows the question and he knows the answer;
and there is only one question and there is only one answer. The
question is "Who am I?" and the answer cannot be given, one has to find
it. If it is given, it becomes knowledge; if you find it, it becomes
wisdom.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

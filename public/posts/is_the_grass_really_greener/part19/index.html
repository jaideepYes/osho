It is for reference purposes only.]\nAnand Fiore. Anand means bliss. Fiore means a flower.\nThe nature of misery is to make you closed -- closed to existence, to people, to all that is. It is intrinsic to misery that it makes you shrink inside yourself; it makes you hide, it disconnects you.\nThe nature of bliss is just the opposite: it opens you up like a flower. It makes you available to existence\n-- to the sun, to the wind, to the rain -- and when you are available to existence, existence is available to you. Whatsoever you do to existence always bounces back upon you. If you are closed, existence is closed; if you are open existence is\nopen. Existence simply reflects you. And when you are closed and existence is closed life becomes hell.\nOne of the famous plays of Jean Paul Sartre is NO EXIT. Three persons find themselves in a room which has no exit. Everything is available, whatsoever they need is there, but they cannot get out. Naturally they become bored, bored with each other, bored to death, but there is no way out; they have to be there.\nAnd one can conceive how torturous it could become. That's Sartre's idea of hell.\nNo need to throw people into a fire -- that is a very primitive idea, just put them in a place from where they cannot escape. And there is no need to torture them, give them all the luxury and comfort and convenience, but just destroy their freedom -- that's enough. It is more than throwing them into hellfire. At least there would be some excitement in hell-fire, but in a closed room, with no opening, nowhere to go...\nThis is the situation of every miserable persons no exit -- no windows, no doors. Windowless, he is living in a cocoon.\nMeditation opens windows. Windows are there, it is just that you have forgotten about them. Even if they are locked there are keys which can open them. And it is up to you to open them or not to open them --\nit is your freedom, it is your choice.\nThe moment you start opening up... That's what I call meditation, opening up like a flower. And then suddenly life is paradise; instantly, immediately, you are transported into an other dimension.\nThe whole art of bliss is the art of opening your petals. Take the risk -- of course there is a risk in opening up, there is danger, but the only way to live is to live dangerously, there is no other way. Nothing can be done about it.\nIf one does not want to live then there is no danger. Then the best place is the grave, one simply goes inside the grave, all is closed, a beautiful marble stone is put over you and then rest forever in peace.\nNothing will ever happen, no accident, no trouble, no anxiety, no problem, but then you are dead.\nLife means challenges, problems. One has to learn how to enjoy those challenges, how to ride over those challenges how to conquer all the dangers that life gives to you. It is a gift. And as you start learning the ways of conquering more and more you become more and more blissful and ecstatic. Then each moment is a joy.\nThis is your name: Swami Dhyan Peter. Dhyan means meditation. Peter means a rock.\nMind is like shifting sands. Mind is always in a flux, changing. Not even for two consecutive moments is it the same, so you cannot make your house there. And everybody is trying to do that.\nTo make your house in the mind is to make your house on shifting sands. It is like writing on water: you have not even written and it is gone. Or it is like making a house of playing cards: a little breeze, maybe just your own breath, and the house collapses. One card slips and the whole house is gone.\nMeditation is just the opposite of mind. It is rocklike. Mind is time, meditation is eternity -- that is what is represented by the rock. The rock is a symbol, a symbol of eternity. One has to get out of the mind and enter into a state of no-mind, no- thought, no-desire, no-memory; just pure silence, pure being. Then whatsoever you make remains, then whatsoever you create is forever.\nIt is only there that one can find shelter, that one can find a home. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe moment Gautam the Buddha became enlightened the first thing that he said was, \"I have found my home. This is the place I have been searching for for thousands of lives.\" And he said to his own mind,\n\"Now you will not be needed anymore. You have been doing great work, you have been taking all kinds of troubles for me -- thank you for all that -- but now\nyou will not be needed because I have found the real home, so your work is finished. Goodbye!\"\nSvaraj means the kingdom of the self.\nWe are all beggars because we have chosen to look outside our own self and we are searching there for the kingdom that somehow we remember. We have a vague remembrance that it was once ours, but we cannot figure out whether it was a dream or a reality. But each child in his mother's womb has experienced the inner kingdom; hence that nostalgia persists. Out of that nostalgia is born the whole art of meditation.\nWithout that nostalgia there would have been no meditation at all.\nWe have tasted something but a gap has arisen; we have forgotten the way to it and we are searching for it again and again, in every direction. The more we search, the more frustrated we become, because it is not found anywhere outside; it can be found only within yourself.\nMeditation again creates the same space as was in the womb of the mother.\nSigmund Freud had many beautiful insights. One of his insight, was that the search for god is the search for the womb. Of course he was using his insight as a condemnation of religion, but his insight was right --\nhis condemnation was wrong. There is nothing wrong in searching for the womb. If it was beautiful -- and it was beautiful; if it was peaceful -- and It was peaceful if it was blissful -- and it was blissful, then what is wrong in searching for it again?\nOf course now one cannot enter into the womb. Perhaps lovers are trying to enter deeply into each other for the same reason, but that too is futile, it is not possible in the nature of things. The only way one can again create the space is to enter into oneself; one has to enter into one's own womb -- and that's what meditation is. And suddenly you know that the kingdom was always waiting there for you. The goal is not outside, it is within; god is not outside, it is within.\nVeet Paribasha. Veet means going beyond. Paribasha means definition.\nTruth cannot be defined, love cannot be defined, bliss cannot be defined. All that\nis significant, all that is meaningful, is intrinsically indefinable. It can be experienced but it cannot be expressed. It is ineffable, it is a mystery; you cannot solve it. You can dissolve into it, you can become it, but there is no way to demystify it -- and that's what a definition does, it demystifies something.\nScience lives in definitions. Everything is defined, everything is clear-cut, everything is arithmetically put, calculated, experimented with a thousand and one times so no mistake can happen. Science is a way of defining things. If you ask the scientist 'What is water?', he has the definition, H2o, and in a telegraphic way his definition contains the whole secret of water -- according to science. But this is not the way of religion.\nIn religion just the opposite process happens: all that is defined starts becoming indefinable. Even things that you used to think you know you start feeling you don't know; your knowledge starts becoming more and more vague, less and less clear-cut. Mathematics becomes more like music, logic becomes more like love, prose starts turning into poetry. And when you enter this mysterious world you are for the first time moving on sacred ground. This is the true pilgrimage.\nScience is superficial, just on the circumference; it is about and about. Religion is not about and about, it is the very experience of the centre. But the experience is so vast that there is no way to calculate, no way to measure, no way to weigh, no way to indicate it.\nSo those who have known have also known that it is something unknowable; they have stumbled upon something unknowable -- not only unknown but unknowable... because the unknown will become known some day, but the unknowable will remain unknowable forever. But that's the beauty, that it cannot be demystified. When the whole existence becomes mysterious again you are again a child.\nThe child looks at the world with wonder and awe; meditation makes you a child again, again there is an explosion of wonder and awe. Then your heart is beating in a new rhythm, then your eyes see in a new way, your ears hear in a new way. Everything is new and every moment there is a surprise waiting for you.\nTo live in this wonder and awe is to live in god. Premraj means kingdom of love.\nThere are two types of conquerors in the world and one has to choose to be one or the other, one cannot 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nremain without choosing. One kind of conqueror is represented by Alexander, Napoleon, Nadir Shah, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin. The other kind of conqueror is represented by Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lao Tzu, Zarathustra, Krishna. These are two diametrically opposite dimensions.\nThe first category tries to conquer others, and to conquer others is to be violent, is to be aggressive, is to be destructive. So all these so-called conquerors of the first category which the whole of history is full of, have been the most destructive people on the earth. They have not only destroyed people, they have destroyed the very possibility of love, bliss, silence, peace, god. They are the murderers of god.\nOne has to learn another kind of conquest and that has nothing to do with the other; it is an inner journey. If the other is conquering through violence, then one conquers oneself through love. And the most strange thing is that when you are trying to conquer the other you have to destroy the other, but the destroyer is also destroyed in that destruction. He tries to conquer the other -- that never happens, and meanwhile he is losing the time and energy with which to conquer himself. So he tries to make others slaves but he himself becomes a slave to others. And just the opposite happens with the inner journey: one conquers oneself, becomes full of love, creative, poetic, and that gives one immense power, but that power is not of destruction, it is of creation. And because of that power he is also capable of conquering others without conquering them.\nPeople have loved Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra, they have totally surrendered themselves to them, and that surrender is basically different from the surrender when you are forced to do it by a sword. It is unwilling. Deep down you are against it, it can never be total. It is not surrender done by you, it is forced, and sooner or later you will take revenge with a vengeance. That always happens.\nJoseph Stalin was condemned once he was not in power. Even his body was\nremoved -- because his body was lying by the side of Lenin and it had to be removed to a remote place where nobody would ever come to visit. Now the same is happening to Tao Tse Tung in China, every day his posters, his pictures, his statues are being removed. This always happens. The people who try to conquer others simply waste their life.\nTo be a sannyasin means to become concerned with the inner conquest. It releases infinite energy of love. You are a master of yourself and you can help many others to become masters of themselves.\nWhosoever falls in love with a master will become a master sooner or later.\nThe kingdom of love is the only goal worth achieving. And then you can share it with millions of people, and the beauty is that the more you give, the more you have.\nVeetena means transcendence.\nOne has to transcend three things to find oneself or to find god. The first is the body. We are in the body but we are not the body, so one has to watch and slowly slowly become aware that the body is just a house\n-- a beautiful house and we have to love it and keep it fit and keep it beautiful -- but we are not it. We are in it but not it.\nAnd the key is to watch your acts. Walking, eating, talking, listening -- just go on watching and slowly slowly the watcher becomes separate from the watched. Then the second step is to become a watcher of your mind -- that is the second thing to be transcended. Watch the thoughts, memories, fantasies, and the same happens again you become disidentified with the mind. Then the third transcendence is of feeling, emotions, moods.\nThe physical is gross, the mind is a little subtle, but feeling, the heart, is the subtlest. And the day you have transcended the heart also you enter into the fourth, turiya. And that entry brings you to the ultimate goal. Then there is nowhere to got you have found your truth, which is also the truth of the whole existence.\nAnd truth liberates -- liberates you from all misery, from all darkness, from all death. It gives you the whole kingdom of eternity, the kingdom of god.\nDeva Vigyan. Deva means divine. Vigyan means science.\nMeditation is a divine science. Just as mathematics is a mundane science, meditation is a sacred science.\nMathematics is concerned with the measurable and meditation is concerned with the immeasurable.\nOrdinary science is objective, it is about things, and the divine science is about you, about your very consciousness, your being. Initiation into sannyas means initiation into the divine science, so the whole energy has to be put into growing meditativeness.\nAnd my approach to meditation is such that it does not divert you from your ordinary life, it is not escapist. You can go on meditating in all your activities walking you can meditate, driving you can 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmeditate, working you can meditate, because to me meditation simply means awareness.\nIf you start chanting a mantra while driving there is danger. If you start changing a mantra while working in the office you will not be able to do your work. But just being aware is not a diversion, not a distraction. On the contrary it helps you to do your work more efficiently, more skilfully; and if you are more alert and aware naturally, your work will have some quality which it can only have if the person doing it is doing it consciously, not mechanically.\nSo meditation is synonymous with awareness, and meditation is the whole science of entering into god.\nAnd god is not somewhere else, it is your awareness itself. So one need not pray to some god there above, in the clouds. One has just to become aware and one finds god at the very core of one's being. And to have found it is to have found all that is worth finding.\n(To a middle-aged woman:)\nAnand Rajyo. Anand means bliss. Rajyo means kingdom -- kingdom of bliss.\nMan is born to be a king. That is our very destiny, but very few people ever try to fulfil it. They take life for granted, they don't take it as an opportunity. They think that just to be born is enough, that just to be born is to be alive.\nIt is not so. Birth is only a beginning, the beginning of an opportunity. You can use the opportunity, you may not use the opportunity. And many people live in vain; they live superficially, without ever knowing who they are, without ever understanding the meaning of life, without ever even thinking about why they are here, from where they come, to where they are going.\nI have heard about a man who became retired at the age of sixty. On the first day of his retirement his wife said 'Should I prepare your breakfast? -- boiled eggs, etcetera?' He said 'I hate boiled eggs!' But his wife said 'What are you saying? For forty years continuously you have been eating boiled eggs for your breakfast and suddenly you hate them?' And the man said 'I have always hated them!' The wife said 'Well, why didn't you say so before?' He said 'I had no time! I was always in such a rush. I had to catch the train and go to the office. There was no time. Now I have time.'\nAfter forty years... But I think even that is too early. As far as people's lives are concerned, even by the time they are dying they have not asked the only significant questions of 'Why was I here? Who am I? And what was the purpose of it all?' A person has lived his life -- seventy, eighty, ninety years -- and he is dying, he is like a letter which has remained unopened. Nobody has read it, not even he himself has read it. Even the envelope has not been opened. Nobody knows what the message was, why god created the person.\nEverybody is living a life without any consciousness, that's why although we are destined to be kings we remain beggars. Our whole life is just a begging bowl we are continuously asking for more and more, and nothing ever satisfies us, nothing ever fills the bowl. The bowl remains empty.\nAnd we are not meant to be beggars...\nMy whole effort here is to help you to become kings and queens. My sannyasins are not beggars. They have to be emperors; less than that won't do. But to be an\nemperor an empire is not needed at all. All that is needed is an inner understanding, an inner awareness. Just a small candle of awareness burning inside is enough and all darkness disappears.\nAnd the moment you know yourself life becomes a bliss, a benediction, a gift of god, and one feels immensely thankful. Such gratitude arises towards existence that one cannot express it. One can only bow down to existence; not to a particular god -- Christian, Hindu or Mohammedan -- but to existence as such, to the trees, to the mountain, to the stars. We are part of an immensely beautiful universe, but if we don't know ourselves, how can we know the whole? At least we should become acquainted with who we are.\nAnd the miracle of miracles is that even a small dewdrop contains the whole secret of all the oceans. So if we can know our own small dewdrop of consciousness we have opened the whole secret of existence.\nOld age has a beauty of its own. Children are bound to be ignorant. Their innocence is nothing but ignorance. Young people are bound to be foolish because they have to learn and the only way to learn is through trial and error, they have to fool around -- that's the only way to become ripe and mature.\nBy the time one starts getting old one is neither ignorant nor inexperienced; one has a certain maturity, a certain ripeness -- and that is the right moment to enter the inner. The outer one has experienced and known and seen whatsoever it is. Now there is no more excitement; that game is finished. Now the whole energy can turn in -- and that's my work here, to turn you in. Once you start moving inwards then everything else follows of its own accord, then the kingdom of bliss is not far away.\nThe first step is the most difficult step and sannyas can help you in taking the first step. Then the second 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfollows easily. And the whole journey is completed in two steps the first is turning in and the second is to settle in, to sit in. That's why in Japan they call\nmeditation zazen; zazen means just sitting, doing nothing.\nSitting within oneself, resting within oneself, and that's enough! It opens the door of all the mysteries.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

people, to all that is. It is intrinsic to misery that it makes you
shrink inside yourself; it makes you hide, it disconnects you.</p><p>The nature of bliss is just the opposite: it opens you up like a
flower. It makes you available to existence</p><p>-- to the sun, to the wind, to the rain -- and when you are available
to existence, existence is available to you. Whatsoever you do to
existence always bounces back upon you. If you are closed, existence is
closed; if you are open existence is</p><p>open. Existence simply reflects you. And when you are closed and
existence is closed life becomes hell.</p><p>One of the famous plays of Jean Paul Sartre is NO EXIT. Three persons
find themselves in a room which has no exit. Everything is available,
whatsoever they need is there, but they cannot get out. Naturally they
become bored, bored with each other, bored to death, but there is no way
out; they have to be there.</p><p>And one can conceive how torturous it could become. That's Sartre's
idea of hell.</p><p>No need to throw people into a fire -- that is a very primitive idea,
just put them in a place from where they cannot escape. And there is no
need to torture them, give them all the luxury and comfort and
convenience, but just destroy their freedom -- that's enough. It is more
than throwing them into hellfire. At least there would be some
excitement in hell-fire, but in a closed room, with no opening, nowhere
to go...</p><p>This is the situation of every miserable persons no exit -- no
windows, no doors. Windowless, he is living in a cocoon.</p><p>Meditation opens windows. Windows are there, it is just that you have
forgotten about them. Even if they are locked there are keys which can
open them. And it is up to you to open them or not to open them --</p><p>it is your freedom, it is your choice.</p><p>The moment you start opening up... That's what I call meditation,
opening up like a flower. And then suddenly life is paradise; instantly,
immediately, you are transported into an other dimension.</p><p>The whole art of bliss is the art of opening your petals. Take the
risk -- of course there is a risk in opening up, there is danger, but
the only way to live is to live dangerously, there is no other way.
Nothing can be done about it.</p><p>If one does not want to live then there is no danger. Then the best
place is the grave, one simply goes inside the grave, all is closed, a
beautiful marble stone is put over you and then rest forever in
peace.</p><p>Nothing will ever happen, no accident, no trouble, no anxiety, no
problem, but then you are dead.</p><p>Life means challenges, problems. One has to learn how to enjoy those
challenges, how to ride over those challenges how to conquer all the
dangers that life gives to you. It is a gift. And as you start learning
the ways of conquering more and more you become more and more blissful
and ecstatic. Then each moment is a joy.</p><p>This is your name: Swami Dhyan Peter. Dhyan means meditation. Peter
means a rock.</p><p>Mind is like shifting sands. Mind is always in a flux, changing. Not
even for two consecutive moments is it the same, so you cannot make your
house there. And everybody is trying to do that.</p><p>To make your house in the mind is to make your house on shifting
sands. It is like writing on water: you have not even written and it is
gone. Or it is like making a house of playing cards: a little breeze,
maybe just your own breath, and the house collapses. One card slips and
the whole house is gone.</p><p>Meditation is just the opposite of mind. It is rocklike. Mind is
time, meditation is eternity -- that is what is represented by the rock.
The rock is a symbol, a symbol of eternity. One has to get out of the
mind and enter into a state of no-mind, no- thought, no-desire,
no-memory; just pure silence, pure being. Then whatsoever you make
remains, then whatsoever you create is forever.</p><p>It is only there that one can find shelter, that one can find a home.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The moment Gautam the Buddha became enlightened the first thing that
he said was, "I have found my home. This is the place I have been
searching for for thousands of lives." And he said to his own mind,</p><p>"Now you will not be needed anymore. You have been doing great work,
you have been taking all kinds of troubles for me -- thank you for all
that -- but now</p><p>you will not be needed because I have found the real home, so your
work is finished. Goodbye!"</p><p>Svaraj means the kingdom of the self.</p><p>We are all beggars because we have chosen to look outside our own
self and we are searching there for the kingdom that somehow we
remember. We have a vague remembrance that it was once ours, but we
cannot figure out whether it was a dream or a reality. But each child in
his mother's womb has experienced the inner kingdom; hence that
nostalgia persists. Out of that nostalgia is born the whole art of
meditation.</p><p>Without that nostalgia there would have been no meditation at
all.</p><p>We have tasted something but a gap has arisen; we have forgotten the
way to it and we are searching for it again and again, in every
direction. The more we search, the more frustrated we become, because it
is not found anywhere outside; it can be found only within yourself.</p><p>Meditation again creates the same space as was in the womb of the
mother.</p><p>Sigmund Freud had many beautiful insights. One of his insight, was
that the search for god is the search for the womb. Of course he was
using his insight as a condemnation of religion, but his insight was
right --</p><p>his condemnation was wrong. There is nothing wrong in searching for
the womb. If it was beautiful -- and it was beautiful; if it was
peaceful -- and It was peaceful if it was blissful -- and it was
blissful, then what is wrong in searching for it again?</p><p>Of course now one cannot enter into the womb. Perhaps lovers are
trying to enter deeply into each other for the same reason, but that too
is futile, it is not possible in the nature of things. The only way one
can again create the space is to enter into oneself; one has to enter
into one's own womb -- and that's what meditation is. And suddenly you
know that the kingdom was always waiting there for you. The goal is not
outside, it is within; god is not outside, it is within.</p><p>Veet Paribasha. Veet means going beyond. Paribasha means
definition.</p><p>Truth cannot be defined, love cannot be defined, bliss cannot be
defined. All that</p><p>is significant, all that is meaningful, is intrinsically indefinable.
It can be experienced but it cannot be expressed. It is ineffable, it is
a mystery; you cannot solve it. You can dissolve into it, you can become
it, but there is no way to demystify it -- and that's what a definition
does, it demystifies something.</p><p>Science lives in definitions. Everything is defined, everything is
clear-cut, everything is arithmetically put, calculated, experimented
with a thousand and one times so no mistake can happen. Science is a way
of defining things. If you ask the scientist 'What is water?', he has
the definition, H2o, and in a telegraphic way his definition contains
the whole secret of water -- according to science. But this is not the
way of religion.</p><p>In religion just the opposite process happens: all that is defined
starts becoming indefinable. Even things that you used to think you know
you start feeling you don't know; your knowledge starts becoming more
and more vague, less and less clear-cut. Mathematics becomes more like
music, logic becomes more like love, prose starts turning into poetry.
And when you enter this mysterious world you are for the first time
moving on sacred ground. This is the true pilgrimage.</p><p>Science is superficial, just on the circumference; it is about and
about. Religion is not about and about, it is the very experience of the
centre. But the experience is so vast that there is no way to calculate,
no way to measure, no way to weigh, no way to indicate it.</p><p>So those who have known have also known that it is something
unknowable; they have stumbled upon something unknowable -- not only
unknown but unknowable... because the unknown will become known some
day, but the unknowable will remain unknowable forever. But that's the
beauty, that it cannot be demystified. When the whole existence becomes
mysterious again you are again a child.</p><p>The child looks at the world with wonder and awe; meditation makes
you a child again, again there is an explosion of wonder and awe. Then
your heart is beating in a new rhythm, then your eyes see in a new way,
your ears hear in a new way. Everything is new and every moment there is
a surprise waiting for you.</p><p>To live in this wonder and awe is to live in god. Premraj means
kingdom of love.</p><p>There are two types of conquerors in the world and one has to choose
to be one or the other, one cannot 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

Alexander, Napoleon, Nadir Shah, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin. The other
kind of conqueror is represented by Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lao
Tzu, Zarathustra, Krishna. These are two diametrically opposite
dimensions.</p><p>The first category tries to conquer others, and to conquer others is
to be violent, is to be aggressive, is to be destructive. So all these
so-called conquerors of the first category which the whole of history is
full of, have been the most destructive people on the earth. They have
not only destroyed people, they have destroyed the very possibility of
love, bliss, silence, peace, god. They are the murderers of god.</p><p>One has to learn another kind of conquest and that has nothing to do
with the other; it is an inner journey. If the other is conquering
through violence, then one conquers oneself through love. And the most
strange thing is that when you are trying to conquer the other you have
to destroy the other, but the destroyer is also destroyed in that
destruction. He tries to conquer the other -- that never happens, and
meanwhile he is losing the time and energy with which to conquer
himself. So he tries to make others slaves but he himself becomes a
slave to others. And just the opposite happens with the inner journey:
one conquers oneself, becomes full of love, creative, poetic, and that
gives one immense power, but that power is not of destruction, it is of
creation. And because of that power he is also capable of conquering
others <em>without</em> conquering them.</p><p>People have loved Jesus, Buddha, Zarathustra, they have totally
surrendered themselves to them, and that surrender is basically
different from the surrender when you are forced to do it by a sword. It
is unwilling. Deep down you are against it, it can never be total. It is
not surrender done by you, it is forced, and sooner or later you will
take revenge with a vengeance. That always happens.</p><p>Joseph Stalin was condemned once he was not in power. Even his body
was</p><p>removed -- because his body was lying by the side of Lenin and it had
to be removed to a remote place where nobody would ever come to visit.
Now the same is happening to Tao Tse Tung in China, every day his
posters, his pictures, his statues are being removed. This always
happens. The people who try to conquer others simply waste their
life.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means to become concerned with the inner conquest.
It releases infinite energy of love. You are a master of yourself and
you can help many others to become masters of themselves.</p><p>Whosoever falls in love with a master will become a master sooner or
later.</p><p>The kingdom of love is the only goal worth achieving. And then you
can share it with millions of people, and the beauty is that the more
you give, the more you have.</p><p>Veetena means transcendence.</p><p>One has to transcend three things to find oneself or to find god. The
first is the body. We are in the body but we are not the body, so one
has to watch and slowly slowly become aware that the body is just a
house</p><p>-- a beautiful house and we have to love it and keep it fit and keep
it beautiful -- but we are not it. We are in it but not it.</p><p>And the key is to watch your acts. Walking, eating, talking,
listening -- just go on watching and slowly slowly the watcher becomes
separate from the watched. Then the second step is to become a watcher
of your mind -- that is the second thing to be transcended. Watch the
thoughts, memories, fantasies, and the same happens again you become
disidentified with the mind. Then the third transcendence is of feeling,
emotions, moods.</p><p>The physical is gross, the mind is a little subtle, but feeling, the
heart, is the subtlest. And the day you have transcended the heart also
you enter into the fourth, turiya. And that entry brings you to the
ultimate goal. Then there is nowhere to got you have found your truth,
which is also the truth of the whole existence.</p><p>And truth liberates -- liberates you from all misery, from all
darkness, from all death. It gives you the whole kingdom of eternity,
the kingdom of god.</p><p>Deva Vigyan. Deva means divine. Vigyan means science.</p><p>Meditation is a divine science. Just as mathematics is a mundane
science, meditation is a sacred science.</p><p>Mathematics is concerned with the measurable and meditation is
concerned with the immeasurable.</p><p>Ordinary science is objective, it is about things, and the divine
science is about you, about your very consciousness, your being.
Initiation into sannyas means initiation into the divine science, so the
whole energy has to be put into growing meditativeness.</p><p>And my approach to meditation is such that it does not divert you
from your ordinary life, it is not escapist. You can go on meditating in
all your activities walking you can meditate, driving you can

means awareness.</p><p>If you start chanting a mantra while driving there is danger. If you
start changing a mantra while working in the office you will not be able
to do your work. But just being aware is not a diversion, not a
distraction. On the contrary it helps you to do your work more
efficiently, more skilfully; and if you are more alert and aware
naturally, your work will have some quality which it can only have if
the person doing it is doing it consciously, not mechanically.</p><p>So meditation is synonymous with awareness, and meditation is the
whole science of entering into god.</p><p>And god is not somewhere else, it is your awareness itself. So one
need not pray to some god there above, in the clouds. One has just to
become aware and one finds god at the very core of one's being. And to
have found it is to have found all that is worth finding.</p><p>(To a middle-aged woman:)</p><p>Anand Rajyo. Anand means bliss. Rajyo means kingdom -- kingdom of
bliss.</p><p>Man is born to be a king. That is our very destiny, but very few
people ever try to fulfil it. They take life for granted, they don't
take it as an opportunity. They think that just to be born is enough,
that just to be born is to be alive.</p><p>It is not so. Birth is only a beginning, the beginning of an
opportunity. You can use the opportunity, you may not use the
opportunity. And many people live in vain; they live superficially,
without ever knowing who they are, without ever understanding the
meaning of life, without ever even thinking about why they are here,
from where they come, to where they are going.</p><p>I have heard about a man who became retired at the age of sixty. On
the first day of his retirement his wife said 'Should I prepare your
breakfast? -- boiled eggs, etcetera?' He said 'I <em>hate</em> boiled
eggs!' But his wife said 'What are you saying? For forty years
continuously you have been eating boiled eggs for your breakfast and
suddenly you hate them?' And the man said 'I have <em>always</em> hated
them!' The wife said 'Well, why didn't you say so before?' He said 'I
had no time! I was always in such a rush. I had to catch the train and
go to the office. There was no time. Now I have time.'</p><p>After forty years... But I think even that is too early. As far as
people's lives are concerned, even by the time they are dying they have
not asked the only significant questions of 'Why was I here? Who am I?
And what was the purpose of it all?' A person has lived his life --
seventy, eighty, ninety years -- and he is dying, he is like a letter
which has remained unopened. Nobody has read it, not even he himself has
read it. Even the envelope has not been opened. Nobody knows what the
message was, why god created the person.</p><p>Everybody is living a life without any consciousness, that's why
although we are destined to be kings we remain beggars. Our whole life
is just a begging bowl we are continuously asking for more and more, and
nothing ever satisfies us, nothing ever fills the bowl. The bowl remains
empty.</p><p>And we are not meant to be beggars...</p><p>My whole effort here is to help you to become kings and queens. My
sannyasins are not beggars. They have to be emperors; less than that
won't do. But to be an</p><p>emperor an empire is not needed at all. All that is needed is an
inner understanding, an inner awareness. Just a small candle of
awareness burning inside is enough and all darkness disappears.</p><p>And the moment you know yourself life becomes a bliss, a benediction,
a gift of god, and one feels immensely thankful. Such gratitude arises
towards existence that one cannot express it. One can only bow down to
existence; not to a particular god -- Christian, Hindu or Mohammedan --
but to existence as such, to the trees, to the mountain, to the stars.
We are part of an immensely beautiful universe, but if we don't know
ourselves, how can we know the whole? At least we should become
acquainted with who we are.</p><p>And the miracle of miracles is that even a small dewdrop contains the
whole secret of all the oceans. So if we can know our own small dewdrop
of consciousness we have opened the whole secret of existence.</p><p>Old age has a beauty of its own. Children are bound to be ignorant.
Their innocence is nothing but ignorance. Young people are bound to be
foolish because they have to learn and the only way to learn is through
trial and error, they have to fool around -- that's the only way to
become ripe and mature.</p><p>By the time one starts getting old one is neither ignorant nor
inexperienced; one has a certain maturity, a certain ripeness -- and
that is the right moment to enter the inner. The outer one has
experienced and known and seen whatsoever it is. Now there is no more
excitement; that game is finished. Now the whole energy can turn in --
and that's my work here, to turn you in. Once you start moving inwards
then everything else follows of its own accord, then the kingdom of
bliss is not far away.</p><p>The first step is the most difficult step and sannyas can help you in
taking the first step. Then the second 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

first is turning in and the second is to settle in, to sit in. That's
why in Japan they call</p><p>meditation zazen; zazen means just sitting, doing nothing.</p><p>Sitting within oneself, resting within oneself, and that's enough! It
opens the door of all the mysteries.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #21</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

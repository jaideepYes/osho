It has a certain aristocracy of the inner.\nIt does not depend on birth nor on money nor on power nor on respectability; it depends on your inner unfolding. When what is potential starts becoming actual you are no more the same. On the surface you are the same, but because the inner centre starts becoming aflame it is radiated by your surface too; one becomes luminous. And everything is sharpened: your intelligence, your love, your creativity, sensitivity, compassion. Everything suddenly flares up, becomes aflame.\nThat's what sannyas is all about: creating the aristocracy of the inner, of the spiritual.\nDhyan Francesco. Dhyan means meditation. Francesco means freedom.\nThere are many kinds of freedom -- the social, the political, the economic -- but they are only superficial. The true freedom has a totally different dimension to it. It is not concerned with the outside world at all; it arises in your interiority. It is freedom from conditioning, from all kinds of conditioning, religious ideologies, political philosophies. All that has been imposed by others on you fetters you, chains you, imprisons you, makes you spiritually a slave.\nMeditation is nothing but the destroying of all these fetters, conditionings, the destroying of the whole prison so that you can again be under the sky, under the stars, in the open, available to existence.\nThe moment you are available to existence, existence is available to you. And the meeting of those two availabilities is the ultimate peak of bliss. But it can happen only in freedom. Freedom is the highest value; there is nothing higher than that.\nVeet Neal. Veet means go beyond, transcend. Neal means father, daddy, etcetera.\nThe idea of the father is arbitrary, artificial. The mother is natural but the father is a social invention; it is an institution. One has to go beyond all institutions and this is the root of all other institutions. It is not accidental that god is called the father and the pope is called the father; the word 'pope' also means Neal --\n'po-pa' or 'papa'. Translated exactly into contemporary language it will be 'daddy'.\nWhy is man seeking a father-figure? Why does he need to depend on the priest, on the pope, on god the father? -- because we make every child psychologically retarded. We don't allow him to grow, we don't allow him to become independent, so for the whole of his life he is searching for a father-figure. He always wants somebody authoritative to dominate him, to dictate to him, to show him the way, to tell him what to do and what not to do and at the same time he resists it. That creates a dichotomy. He does not want to be dependent, he wants to be independent, but his growth has been retarded, prevented, and he does not know how to get rid of that retardation, so he has to be dependent. So on one\nhand he seeks some dependence and on the other he fights.\nEither he worships god or he tries to kill god, but in both ways he is behaving childishly. The atheist and the theist are not very different; both are in some way concerned with the father-figure, the ultimate father-figure.\nJust be a human being; there is no need to be a father, because you can be a father only if you retard the growth of your child.\nYou can enjoy that, people are enjoying that ego trip -- crippling and paralysing children and enjoying their children being dependent on them. This is ugly, this is sickening. The children should be helped to be independent as quickly as possible. But the father is an institution and all institutions are prisons.\nAn institution means something that is not natural, something that has been invented by man. So I take the word 'father' as symbolic of all invented institutions. And there is no other kind.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOne has to go beyond being a husband, being a father, being a wife, one has to go beyond all these stupid ideas. One has just to be human, loving -- and then a miracle happens in life then you can love somebody else's child as deeply as your own. Once the idea of father is dropped your love is free, then there is no limitation to it. And we will need a totally different kind of humanity.\nAll people should not be fathers, should not be mothers; only very few people should be allowed to reproduce, only very few women should be allowed to be pregnant -- and it is not necessary that they be pregnant by their own husbands -- only then will we be able to improve the human race.\nWe have done it as far as the animal species are concerned but we are not so scientific with man; with man we remain superstitious. That's why there is so much misery, so much psychological mediocrity, so much illness. All these\nthings can disappear from the earth but then we have to choose who is going to be the parent. And the father of your child need not be the same person with whom you are in love. But for that we will need a far bigger consciousness, a very non-possessive consciousness.\nThe family as it has existed up to now has to disappear. Just a few days ago the Pope has said that 'we are against birth control, against abortion, against interfering in human life, because if these things are allowed then the family will be destroyed, and the church depends on the family' -- his own words. And what he is saying is right; the church depends on the family. All religions depend on the family, all nations depend on the family, hence I am basically against the family because unless the family is uprooted all these foolishnesses will continue. The nation, the race, the church, the state -- they will continue if the family remains. The family is the basic unit. And I am hammering on the basic unit because unless you cut the roots you cannot change the tree; it will remain. You can go on pruning the leaves, it won't help; it will simply make the foliage thicker.\nUp to now no revolution has succeeded for the simple reason that no revolution has happened to the basic foundation of the society and that is the family. Even in communist Russia, in the beginning they tried, just for five years, to disperse the family, but soon they recognised that if the family was destroyed then the state would not exist. Immediately they stopped that whole programme, they dropped the very idea, and now in Soviet Russia the family is more strict than it is anywhere else in the West, it is very orthodox, because they immediately saw the relationship between the state and the family: if you destroy the family you are cutting your own roots.\nSo go beyond the idea of the family, of the father, of the husband, of all institutionalised ideas, and only then can you understand my message.\nDhyan Babbo. Dhyan means meditation and Babbo creates again the same trouble, it means the father, the daddy. So many daddies today! (laughter)\nSo you have to meditate over it because that is the only way to get rid of it. Meditation is a miracle. If you want to get rid of anything simply meditate over it and you will get rid of it. If you cannot get rid of it by meditation that simply means it is natural and there is no need to get rid of it. So meditation is very decisive; it decides what is nature and what is not nature, what is nurture. Once\nyou start meditating on anything... For example, if you meditate on love, love starts growing, it starts spreading, it starts having wings. You cannot destroy love by meditation; it deepens, it becomes vaster. But possessiveness will disappear, jealousy will disappear, anger will disappear, hatred will disappear.\nSo when something disappears by meditation that simply means that it was just human, an arbitrary arrangement. When something deepens, becomes bigger, that means it is a gift of god. And except for meditation there is no criterion for knowing what is nurture and what is nature; they have both got so mixed up. But meditation simply gives you absolute discrimination, it cuts the essential and the non-essential apart.\nAnd I call it a miracle because the non-essential simply starts evaporating and the energy that was involved in the non-essential starts getting into the roots of the essential so the essential starts becoming bigger and stronger.\nSo this is your meditations start meditating on your fatherhood. And once it disappears you will be a totally new man because your whole vision and perspective will be new.\nAnd it is only a question of succeeding in one thing through meditation, then you know the key, then you can go on opening all the locks because it is a master key.\nKalyana means welfare of the others.\nThe moment one becomes blissful he becomes a blessing to others. That is Kalyana. It is not a question 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nof serving others. You cannot serve unless you have something to share. If you are miserable and you start serving others you will simply complicate their lives because your misery will infect them.\nThat's why all the so-called public servants have proved very dangerous to\nhuman society. The missionaries, the public servants, the social reformers, they are all mischievous people. If they all disappear the world will be in a better shape. And the reason why they go on creating trouble is that they are full of trouble themselves. Their service to humanity is only an escape from their own personal problems.\nMy approach is totally different. It is individualistic. First you have to become blissful. Once you are blissful then the bliss starts flowing over you -- and that overflowing bliss is the only true service. But then it is absolutely unselfconscious; you go on doing things because you love to do them. There is no motivation in it, no desire to attain to some pleasures in heaven, some rewards from god. There is no end in your service, it is sheer joy; it is not future- oriented at all -- and then it has a beauty of its own.\nSandhano means enquiry.\nThe truth has not to be believed, it has to be enquired into.\nMy sannyas does not begin in belief, it begins in enquiry. For thousands of years humanity has been told that believing is seeing; I say to you seeing is believing. So the question is not of believing, the question is of seeing. Even a blind man can believe in light, in fact only a blind man believes in light; the man who has eyes need not believe at all -- he knows Belief is a poor substitute for knowing and knowing never happens through belief. The very first step has gone wrong.\nSo start within any belief or disbelief -- because disbelief is to believe upside- down. Start with an open mind, with no a priori conclusion. Start from a state of not-knowing and then you are on the right track.\nThen truth is not very far away, it is just around the corner. For the enquirer it is just around the corner, for the believer it doesn't exist at all.\nNandita means the blissful one.\nMy effort here is not religious in the ordinary sense. I don't teach a doctrine, a dogma, a creed. This is not a cult because I don't have any ideology. I only teach blissfulness, how to enjoy the small things of life, because my experience is that if you start enjoying the small things of life you start feeling the extraordinary in the ordinary. Then even drinking a cup of tea becomes a meditation, or taking a shower becomes a prayer. Wherever bliss is there is meditation, there is prayer.\nOne has to change one's whole lifestyle. We have been brought up in such a way that misery has become our life-style. We become happy once in a while, when there is really something to be happy about, but that too remains only for a moment.\nYou have won the lottery and for a moment you are happy, and then the happiness disappears because it goes against your habit. So the lottery breaks the ice but only for a moment; again the old habit suffocates your happiness. You start worrying about what to do with this money, what not to do, and a thousand and one things start happening. Now you cannot sleep in the night because fantasies go on and on, and the next morning you are more tired than ever.\nJust the opposite should be the case: one should be naturally happy unless there is really some cause to be unhappy. That would be a normal, natural phenomenon. Happiness should be like breathing: unless something goes wrong so that your breathing is disturbed it should continue smoothly. And if one is happy twenty-four hours a day, then even when there is a cause to be miserable it will not go very deep. It will remain superficial because it will be going against your nature -- just as right now even when there is a cause to be happy you can be only for a moment or for a time being, because it goes against your habit. And remember, a habit is not so deep as nature.\nOnce you are naturally blissful then even when there is a cause to be unhappy you will not feel unhappy; you will be able to pass through it, calm and cool and quiet. That's what sannyas is a transformation of your total life-style from misery to bliss.\nAnd that's the meaning of your name, Nandita.\nFrom this very moment start feeling happy for no reason at all. Feel unhappy only when there is really some reason to be. And you will be surprised: it is very difficult to find a reason to be unhappy. For twenty-five years I have been trying and I have not found one! (laughter) So I don't think you will be able to find it.\nWhenever you feel something entering your being creating unhappiness, immediately try to find out what there is to be miserable about. Go deep into it and you will not find anything. And whenever there is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbliss no need to bother about why it is there, just enjoy it. People do just the opposite.\nA psychiatrist sent one of his patients to the mountains for a holiday and the next day he received a telegram. The patient wrote: 'I am feeling very happy -- why?'\nPeople ask why they are happy. Every day I receive questions saying 'Osho, I am feeling very happy --\nwhy? There seems to be no reason.'\nThere is no need for any reason; happiness is our nature. Nobody asks 'I am breathing -- why? I am alive\n-- why?' In the same way one is blissful; there is no need to be searching for a cause. But certainly when you are not feeling good find out the cause. And the deeper you go into it, the more you will find it doesn't exist at all, it was imagination. You had imagined it in the first place, so it evaporates.\nAnubhavo means experience.\nTruth is not a concept, it is an experience. God is not a person, it is an experience. Love is not an idea, it is an experience. All that is really significant is experience. And people go on living in ideas. Love is just an idea, a beautiful idea. God is just a name, an abstraction. Beauty, freedom, truth -- all are just words, and if these words are repeated again and again, one becomes hypnotised by them. One starts believing in these words and forgets that these are mere words, they are not the reality.\nThe word 'god' is not god, the word 'love' is not love. Insist on experience because only experience liberates and only experience makes your potential actual. It is only through experiencing the multi-dimensional life that one grows, that one comes one day to the ultimate peak where one becomes crowned a Christ, where one is awakened from all unconsciousness and becomes a Buddha.\nSo remember: don't get lost in the jungle of words; it is easy to get lost in words.\nAlways insist on experience, because except for experience all is just dreamstuff, a sheer wastage of life, time and energy.\nBeing here with me means getting ready to experience things, risking everything for experience.\nNityama means the eternal.\nWe are not confined between birth and death, we have been before birth and we will be after death.\nBirth and death are simply episodes in the eternal stream of life, but you are not to believe in what I am saying; What I am saying has only to be taken as a hypothesis, so that you can enquire whether it is right or wrong. I am the last person to ask anybody to believe in me, because what I am saying is so true that just a little effort on your part and it can become your experience, and when it is your experience, only then has it any value.\nYou can love me -- that love will help you to go into the enquiry -- but you need not believe in my words -- that will hinder you. So there is a great distinction to be always remembered: love me but don't believe in the words, Mm? words are words, whether they are mine or Jesus, or Buddha's makes no difference. Your love for me should not become your love for my words; your love for me should only be a nourishment, an encouragement, to go into the enquiry.\nTrusting me does not mean that whatsoever I say you have to believe in; trusting me only means that you are ready to enquiry. Trust is needed to enquire, not to believe, because enquiry means going into the unknown. Unless you trust me it will be impossible for you to risk the known for the unknown. But you need not believe in the other shore unless you have found it. And I know that because it is there, it can be found.\nIf I can find it, you can find it. We are all born equal, with the same potential, with the same possibilities.\nVedanto means going beyond words, scriptures, philosophies.\nTruth is beyond words, inexpressible; there is no way to say it. The master only shows it, he does not say it. The master is a finger pointing towards the moon, he shows it. But the world is so full of fools that they start worshipping the finger,\nthey don't look at the moon at all; hence there are Christians Christians means\nthe people who are worshipping the finger of Christ and the Buddhists mean the people who are worshipping the finger of Buddha. And the irony is that both fingers were pointing to the same moon and now these fools are quarrelling for centuries, arguing that I'am right. 'Your finger is small and my finger is big, and look how beautiful my finger is and your finger is not so beautiful, and my finger is white and yours is black.' Thousands of books have been written about these fingers, possible and impossible things have been said about the fingers, and the argument has become so vast that nobody bothers about the moon\n-- nobody has time! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFirst one has to decide which one is the real finger, which one is the finger authorised by god. And that is not possible to decide at all, there is no criterion to decide it -- the argument will continue, theologians will go on writing treatises. And the miracle is that nobody reads those treatises, only other theologians read them and they refute them.\nFor five thousand years the followers of Krishna, Patanjali, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Jesus, Mohammed, Nanak, Kabir, they have all been arguing -- I have looked into their argument: all their arguments are about the finger. Nobody is talking about the moon.\nMy function here is to help you to see the moon. So don't get concerned with the finger. All scriptures are fingers, all words are fingers, all theories are fingers. Use them but don't get obsessed by them, use them and forget all about them. When you have found the moon then you have to look at the moon; then don't let the finger come in between you and the moon.\nThat's the meaning of your name. Let it also become the meaning of your life.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I think always... no end to it.\n-- That's good! See you on the moon! (much laughter)\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>Dhyan Alberto. Dhyan means meditation. Alberto means noble,
brilliant.</p><p>Meditation brings both a kind of nobility and a grace, a beauty. It
has a certain aristocracy of the inner.</p><p>It does not depend on birth nor on money nor on power nor on
respectability; it depends on your inner unfolding. When what is
potential starts becoming actual you are no more the same. On the
surface you are the same, but because the inner centre starts becoming
aflame it is radiated by your surface too; one becomes luminous. And
everything is sharpened: your intelligence, your love, your creativity,
sensitivity, compassion. Everything suddenly flares up, becomes
aflame.</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about: creating the aristocracy of the
inner, of the spiritual.</p><p>Dhyan Francesco. Dhyan means meditation. Francesco means freedom.</p><p>There are many kinds of freedom -- the social, the political, the
economic -- but they are only superficial. The true freedom has a
totally different dimension to it. It is not concerned with the outside
world at all; it arises in your interiority. It is freedom from
conditioning, from all kinds of conditioning, religious ideologies,
political philosophies. All that has been imposed by others on you
fetters you, chains you, imprisons you, makes you spiritually a
slave.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but the destroying of all these fetters,
conditionings, the destroying of the whole prison so that you can again
be under the sky, under the stars, in the open, available to
existence.</p><p>The moment you are available to existence, existence is available to
you. And the meeting of those two availabilities is the ultimate peak of
bliss. But it can happen only in freedom. Freedom is the highest value;
there is nothing higher than that.</p><p>Veet Neal. Veet means go beyond, transcend. Neal means father, daddy,
etcetera.</p><p>The idea of the father is arbitrary, artificial. The mother is
natural but the father is a social invention; it is an institution. One
has to go beyond all institutions and this is the root of all other
institutions. It is not accidental that god is called the father and the
pope is called the father; the word 'pope' also means Neal --</p><p>'po-pa' or 'papa'. Translated exactly into contemporary language it
will be 'daddy'.</p><p>Why is man seeking a father-figure? Why does he need to depend on the
priest, on the pope, on god the father? -- because we make every child
psychologically retarded. We don't allow him to grow, we don't allow him
to become independent, so for the whole of his life he is searching for
a father-figure. He always wants somebody authoritative to dominate him,
to dictate to him, to show him the way, to tell him what to do and what
not to do and at the same time he resists it. That creates a dichotomy.
He does not want to be dependent, he wants to be independent, but his
growth has been retarded, prevented, and he does not know how to get rid
of that retardation, so he has to be dependent. So on one</p><p>hand he seeks some dependence and on the other he fights.</p><p>Either he worships god or he tries to kill god, but in both ways he
is behaving childishly. The atheist and the theist are not very
different; both are in some way concerned with the father-figure, the
ultimate father-figure.</p><p>Just be a human being; there is no need to be a father, because you
can be a father only if you retard the growth of your child.</p><p>You can enjoy that, people are enjoying that ego trip -- crippling
and paralysing children and enjoying their children being dependent on
them. This is ugly, this is sickening. The children should be helped to
be independent as quickly as possible. But the father is an institution
and all institutions are prisons.</p><p>An institution means something that is not natural, something that
has been invented by man. So I take the word 'father' as symbolic of all
invented institutions. And there is no other kind.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>One has to go beyond being a husband, being a father, being a wife,
one has to go beyond all these stupid ideas. One has just to be human,
loving -- and then a miracle happens in life then you can love somebody
else's child as deeply as your own. Once the idea of father is dropped
your love is free, then there is no limitation to it. And we will need a
totally different kind of humanity.</p><p>All people should not be fathers, should not be mothers; only very
few people should be allowed to reproduce, only very few women should be
allowed to be pregnant -- and it is not necessary that they be pregnant
by their own husbands -- only then will we be able to improve the human
race.</p><p>We have done it as far as the animal species are concerned but we are
not so scientific with man; with man we remain superstitious. That's why
there is so much misery, so much psychological mediocrity, so much
illness. All these</p><p>things can disappear from the earth but then we have to choose who is
going to be the parent. And the father of your child need not be the
same person with whom you are in love. But for that we will need a far
bigger consciousness, a very non-possessive consciousness.</p><p>The family as it has existed up to now has to disappear. Just a few
days ago the Pope has said that 'we are against birth control, against
abortion, against interfering in human life, because if these things are
allowed then the family will be destroyed, and the church depends on the
family' -- his own words. And what he is saying is right; the church
depends on the family. All religions depend on the family, all nations
depend on the family, hence I am basically against the family because
unless the family is uprooted all these foolishnesses will continue. The
nation, the race, the church, the state -- they will continue if the
family remains. The family is the basic unit. And I am hammering on the
basic unit because unless you cut the roots you cannot change the tree;
it will remain. You can go on pruning the leaves, it won't help; it will
simply make the foliage thicker.</p><p>Up to now no revolution has succeeded for the simple reason that no
revolution has happened to the basic foundation of the society and that
is the family. Even in communist Russia, in the beginning they tried,
just for five years, to disperse the family, but soon they recognised
that if the family was destroyed then the state would not exist.
Immediately they stopped that whole programme, they dropped the very
idea, and now in Soviet Russia the family is more strict than it is
anywhere else in the West, it is very orthodox, because they immediately
saw the relationship between the state and the family: if you destroy
the family you are cutting your own roots.</p><p>So go beyond the idea of the family, of the father, of the husband,
of all institutionalised ideas, and only then can you understand my
message.</p><p>Dhyan Babbo. Dhyan means meditation and Babbo creates again the same
trouble, it means the father, the daddy. So many daddies today!
(laughter)</p><p>So you have to meditate over it because that is the only way to get
rid of it. Meditation is a miracle. If you want to get rid of anything
simply meditate over it and you will get rid of it. If you cannot get
rid of it by meditation that simply means it is natural and there is no
need to get rid of it. So meditation is very decisive; it decides what
is nature and what is not nature, what is nurture. Once</p><p>you start meditating on anything... For example, if you meditate on
love, love starts growing, it starts spreading, it starts having wings.
You cannot destroy love by meditation; it deepens, it becomes vaster.
But possessiveness will disappear, jealousy will disappear, anger will
disappear, hatred will disappear.</p><p>So when something disappears by meditation that simply means that it
was just human, an arbitrary arrangement. When something deepens,
becomes bigger, that means it is a gift of god. And except for
meditation there is no criterion for knowing what is nurture and what is
nature; they have both got so mixed up. But meditation simply gives you
absolute discrimination, it cuts the essential and the non-essential
apart.</p><p>And I call it a miracle because the non-essential simply starts
evaporating and the energy that was involved in the non-essential starts
getting into the roots of the essential so the essential starts becoming
bigger and stronger.</p><p>So this is your meditations start meditating on your fatherhood. And
once it disappears you will be a totally new man because your whole
vision and perspective will be new.</p><p>And it is only a question of succeeding in one thing through
meditation, then you know the key, then you can go on opening all the
locks because it is a master key.</p><p>Kalyana means welfare of the others.</p><p>The moment one becomes blissful he becomes a blessing to others. That
is Kalyana. It is not a question 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

share. If you are miserable and you start serving others you will simply
complicate their lives because your misery will infect them.</p><p>That's why all the so-called public servants have proved very
dangerous to</p><p>human society. The missionaries, the public servants, the social
reformers, they are all mischievous people. If they all disappear the
world will be in a better shape. And the reason why they go on creating
trouble is that they are full of trouble themselves. Their service to
humanity is only an escape from their own personal problems.</p><p>My approach is totally different. It is individualistic. First you
have to become blissful. Once you are blissful then the bliss starts
flowing over you -- and that overflowing bliss is the only true service.
But then it is absolutely unselfconscious; you go on doing things
because you love to do them. There is no motivation in it, no desire to
attain to some pleasures in heaven, some rewards from god. There is no
end in your service, it is sheer joy; it is not future- oriented at all
-- and then it has a beauty of its own.</p><p>Sandhano means enquiry.</p><p>The truth has not to be believed, it has to be enquired into.</p><p>My sannyas does not begin in belief, it begins in enquiry. For
thousands of years humanity has been told that believing is seeing; I
say to you seeing is believing. So the question is not of believing, the
question is of seeing. Even a blind man can believe in light, in fact
only a blind man believes in light; the man who has eyes need not
believe at all -- he knows Belief is a poor substitute for knowing and
knowing never happens through belief. The very first step has gone
wrong.</p><p>So start within any belief or disbelief -- because disbelief is to
believe upside- down. Start with an open mind, with no a priori
conclusion. Start from a state of not-knowing and then you are on the
right track.</p><p>Then truth is not very far away, it is just around the corner. For
the enquirer it is just around the corner, for the believer it doesn't
exist at all.</p><p>Nandita means the blissful one.</p><p>My effort here is not religious in the ordinary sense. I don't teach
a doctrine, a dogma, a creed. This is not a cult because I don't have
any ideology. I only teach blissfulness, how to enjoy the small things
of life, because my experience is that if you start enjoying the small
things of life you start feeling the extraordinary in the ordinary. Then
even drinking a cup of tea becomes a meditation, or taking a shower
becomes a prayer. Wherever bliss is there is meditation, there is
prayer.</p><p>One has to change one's whole lifestyle. We have been brought up in
such a way that misery has become our life-style. We become happy once
in a while, when there is really something to be happy about, but that
too remains only for a moment.</p><p>You have won the lottery and for a moment you are happy, and then the
happiness disappears because it goes against your habit. So the lottery
breaks the ice but only for a moment; again the old habit suffocates
your happiness. You start worrying about what to do with this money,
what not to do, and a thousand and one things start happening. Now you
cannot sleep in the night because fantasies go on and on, and the next
morning you are more tired than ever.</p><p>Just the opposite should be the case: one should be naturally happy
unless there is <em>really</em> some cause to be unhappy. That would be
a normal, natural phenomenon. Happiness should be like breathing: unless
something goes wrong so that your breathing is disturbed it should
continue smoothly. And if one is happy twenty-four hours a day, then
even when there is a cause to be miserable it will not go very deep. It
will remain superficial because it will be going against your nature --
just as right now even when there is a cause to be happy you can be only
for a moment or for a time being, because it goes against your habit.
And remember, a habit is not so deep as nature.</p><p>Once you are naturally blissful then even when there is a cause to be
unhappy you will not feel unhappy; you will be able to pass through it,
calm and cool and quiet. That's what sannyas is a transformation of your
total life-style from misery to bliss.</p><p>And that's the meaning of your name, Nandita.</p><p>From this very moment start feeling happy for no reason at all. Feel
unhappy only when there is really some reason to be. And you will be
surprised: it is very difficult to find a reason to be unhappy. For
twenty-five years I have been trying and I have not found one!
(laughter) So I don't think you will be able to find it.</p><p>Whenever you feel something entering your being creating unhappiness,
immediately try to find out what there is to be miserable about. Go deep
into it and you will not find anything. And whenever there is

do just the opposite.</p><p>A psychiatrist sent one of his patients to the mountains for a
holiday and the next day he received a telegram. The patient wrote: 'I
am feeling very happy -- why?'</p><p>People ask why they are happy. Every day I receive questions saying
'Osho, I am feeling very happy --</p><p>why? There seems to be no reason.'</p><p>There is no need for any reason; happiness is our nature. Nobody asks
'I am breathing -- why? I am alive</p><p>-- why?' In the same way one is blissful; there is no need to be
searching for a cause. But certainly when you are not feeling good find
out the cause. And the deeper you go into it, the more you will find it
doesn't exist at all, it was imagination. You had imagined it in the
first place, so it evaporates.</p><p>Anubhavo means experience.</p><p>Truth is not a concept, it is an experience. God is not a person, it
is an experience. Love is not an idea, it is an experience. All that is
really significant is experience. And people go on living in ideas. Love
is just an idea, a beautiful idea. God is just a name, an abstraction.
Beauty, freedom, truth -- all are just words, and if these words are
repeated again and again, one becomes hypnotised by them. One starts
believing in these words and forgets that these are mere words, they are
not the reality.</p><p>The word 'god' is not god, the word 'love' is not love. Insist on
experience because only experience liberates and only experience makes
your potential actual. It is only through experiencing the
multi-dimensional life that one grows, that one comes one day to the
ultimate peak where one becomes crowned a Christ, where one is awakened
from all unconsciousness and becomes a Buddha.</p><p>So remember: don't get lost in the jungle of words; it is easy to get
lost in words.</p><p>Always insist on experience, because except for experience all is
just dreamstuff, a sheer wastage of life, time and energy.</p><p>Being here with me means getting ready to experience things, risking
everything for experience.</p><p>Nityama means the eternal.</p><p>We are not confined between birth and death, we have been before
birth and we will be after death.</p><p>Birth and death are simply episodes in the eternal stream of life,
but you are not to believe in what I am saying; What I am saying has
only to be taken as a hypothesis, so that you can enquire whether it is
right or wrong. I am the last person to ask anybody to believe in me,
because what I am saying is so true that just a little effort on your
part and it can become your experience, and when it is your experience,
only then has it any value.</p><p>You can love me -- that love will help you to go into the enquiry --
but you need not believe in my words -- that will hinder you. So there
is a great distinction to be always remembered: love me but don't
believe in the words, Mm? words are words, whether they are mine or
Jesus, or Buddha's makes no difference. Your love for me should not
become your love for my words; your love for me should only be a
nourishment, an encouragement, to go into the enquiry.</p><p>Trusting me does not mean that whatsoever I say you have to believe
in; trusting me only means that you are ready to enquiry. Trust is
needed to enquire, not to believe, because enquiry means going into the
unknown. Unless you trust me it will be impossible for you to risk the
known for the unknown. But you need not believe in the other shore
unless you have found it. And I know that because it is there, it can be
found.</p><p>If I can find it, <em>you</em> can find it. We are all born equal,
with the same potential, with the same possibilities.</p><p>Vedanto means going beyond words, scriptures, philosophies.</p><p>Truth is beyond words, inexpressible; there is no way to say it. The
master only shows it, he does not say it. The master is a finger
pointing towards the moon, he shows it. But the world is so full of
fools that they start worshipping the finger,</p><p>they don't look at the moon at all; hence there are Christians
Christians means</p><p>the people who are worshipping the finger of Christ and the Buddhists
mean the people who are worshipping the finger of Buddha. And the irony
is that both fingers were pointing to the same moon and now these fools
are quarrelling for centuries, arguing that I'am right. 'Your finger is
small and my finger is big, and look how beautiful my finger is and your
finger is not so beautiful, and my finger is white and yours is black.'
Thousands of books have been written about these fingers, possible and
impossible things have been said about the fingers, and the argument has
become so vast that nobody bothers about the moon</p><p>-- nobody has time! 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>First one has to decide which one is the real finger, which one is
the finger authorised by god. And that is not possible to decide at all,
there is no criterion to decide it -- the argument will continue,
theologians will go on writing treatises. And the miracle is that nobody
reads those treatises, only other theologians read them and they refute
them.</p><p>For five thousand years the followers of Krishna, Patanjali, Buddha,
Lao Tzu, Jesus, Mohammed, Nanak, Kabir, they have all been arguing -- I
have looked into their argument: all their arguments are about the
finger. Nobody is talking about the moon.</p><p>My function here is to help you to see the moon. So don't get
concerned with the finger. All scriptures are fingers, all words are
fingers, all theories are fingers. Use them but don't get obsessed by
them, use them and forget all about them. When you have found the moon
then you have to look at the moon; then don't let the finger come in
between you and the moon.</p><p>That's the meaning of your name. Let it also become the meaning of
your life.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I think always... no end to it.</p><p>-- That's good! See you on the moon!

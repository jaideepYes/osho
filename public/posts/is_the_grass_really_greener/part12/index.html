It is for reference purposes only.]\nDhyan Gail. Dhyan means meditation. Gail means source of joy.\nPleasure is possible without meditation, but it is soon bound to be momentary and physical. The physical part of ourself is the most superficial; without meditation at the most one can have certain glimpses of happiness which are deeper than pleasure.\nHappiness is psychological but that too will remain momentary. It will have a little more depth than the pleasure derived from food and sex, it will have more aesthetic sensitivity to it, but that too will pass away and will leave you in deeper despair than before. Each time you experience happiness it is followed by despair. One falls from the peak into the valley -- it hurts.\nJoy is possible only through meditation. Meditation is a method to go beyond body and mind, it is to enter into the deepest core of your being. The moment you transcend body and mind, you also transcend time; hence joy is eternal, it is forever. That is the only thing worth achieving in life, everything else is only a toy to play with.\nI am not against pleasure, not against happiness, but one should not think that\nthat is all there is to life; there is far more.\nThe word 'gail' is very beautiful; it comes from two words. One is 'abi' abi means the source; and 'gil'\nmeans to dance.\nThe moment you are so joyful that your whole energy starts a dance of its own accord, when you cannot 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncontain it, when it starts overflowing you like the perfume of a flower, not only do you become blissful, the whole existence feels blessed by your bliss.\nAnand Manuel. Anand means bliss Manuel means god is with us.\nOriginally the name was reserved only for Christ, because he declared 'I and my father are one.'\nThe moment you know that you and existence are not separate -- that's the ultimate peak of understanding, of being, there is nothing higher than that -- that's the moment when one becomes a Christ.\nChrist simply means the crowned one; one is crowned by glory, crowned by the meeting and merger with the divine.\nIt is possible only for a very blissful person.\nThe people who go to the churches and the synagogues and the temples and the mosques are almost always a miserable lot. They go there not to celebrate life but to ask something from god. They go there as beggars; and god is not for beggars, god does not exist for beggars. The beggar is full of desires and desires are the hindrances. God exists only for the emperors, and by 'emperor' I mean a person who has seen the futility of all desiring.\nWhen you see that desiring is futile bliss explodes. It is desire that creates misery. If it is not fulfilled you are miserable, if it is fulfilled then too you are miserable, because when it is fulfilled you see that nothing is fulfilled, you are the same person. You wanted a big house and now it is yours. You wasted years and years for it and dreamt about it and spent so much energy; now the house is yours but you don't see the bliss that you were dreaming, fantasising, about.\nNothing fails like success, so if a desire is fulfilled you are miserable, if it is not fulfilled, you are miserable. Either way it brings misery. Seeing this the man of understanding drops desiring and in that very dropping is the explosion of bliss. And when you are dancing and rejoicing in each moment of life you will find god is with you, within you, god is you.\nThat's the goal of sannyas, to experience oneself as divine. Nothing less is going to fulfil, nothing less is going to help. And it is not a far-away goal; it is within everybody's reach, we just have not tried in the right direction.\nBlissfulness is the right direction, the way that leads to god. Misery is the way that leads you farther and farther away.\nDhyan means meditation. Nadia means hope.\nThe only hope is meditation. And remember, I say the only hope -- all else is just hopeless. One can have money, power, prestige, but ultimately one finds everything has betrayed one. Even a man like Alexander the Great dies in deep frustration and hopelessness. But the man of meditation lives with tremendous ecstasy and dies too with the same ecstasy, with the same dance.\nJust before Buddha died his disciples naturally started crying and weeping; they could not contain their tears. He said, \"Stop! You should rejoice because I have fulfilled my mission in life. There is nothing more for me to do here. I have known whatsoever was worth knowing, I have realized whatsoever was my potential. My death is not the end of life but the ultimate crescendo, the climax. Weeping and crying you can do later on; right now while I am still here, rejoice!\"\nMeditation is the only hope. One should put one's whole energy into meditation. It means the exploration of your own interiority. It is a journey from the circumference to the center. The moment you reach the center you have come home. Then suddenly spring is there and the birds start singing and the flowers\nsuddenly appear from nowhere and the whole of life is fragrant.\nIt is better to move into meditation as quickly as possible. Every moment that is not meditative is lost.\nWe save only that time which goes into meditation -- that is the only real life. And once you know how to live at your center you need not renounce life; you live in life, amidst life, but still you are centered, rooted in your self.\nThe meditative person is not an escapist; he is creative. That is the criterion of real meditation: if it helps you to be creative only then is it true meditation; otherwise you are carrying something pseudo in the name of meditation. If it creates the longing to escape from life -- to the monastery, to the caves to the mountains\n-- that is not true meditation.\nOne has to be blissful wherever one is.\nPrem Michael. Prem means love. Michael means godly. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are a few experiences which can only be called godly, there is no other way to define them. Love is one of those few rare experiences. Meditation, bliss, love -- these can be only indicated by the word\n'godly', because whenever you are in love or in bliss or in meditation suddenly you become aware of a translucent presence, surrounding the whole existence. You see it within, you see it without. It has always been there, it is just that you were blind. You are breathing it every moment, you are living in it. Just lives in the ocean we are living in god. All that is needed is a certain clarity, a certain ability to see.\nAnd love helps immensely to cleanse your eyes, because fundamentally love is the dropping of the ego, and the moment ego is dropped a curtain that was on your eyes disappears. The clouds that were surrounding you are no more there, the sky is clear and you can see the farthest stars.\nGod is not a person but a presence, hence you will not meet a person the way Christians have been talking about god, the father -- a very ancient, old man. His beard must have reached the floor by now, it just be sweeping the floor, because I have never heard that there are barbers in paradise; nobody has ever thought about barbers and hair-cutting salons. He must be completely covered with hair! There are all kinds of gods invented by religious people, but they are all inventions, imagination, fiction -- you can call them spiritual fiction. Just as there is science fiction, so there is spiritual fiction. But the truth is that god is not a person at all, you cannot make any image.\nGod is beauty, not beautiful. God is love, not loving. God is bliss, not somebody who is blissful.\nAnd when you start seeing god as beauty, as truth, as love, as bliss, as ecstasy, your whole vision goes through a radical change. And love can become one of the most significant steps. One can enter god through love very easily.\nUse it as a device, as a bridge.\nDhyan Beate. Dhyan means meditation. Beate means the blessed.\nWe don't know how blessed we are because we are not aware of our own inexhaustible treasures. We are not even thinking about the inner -- experiencing is a far-away thing. We are continuously thinking about everything except our own being.\nSannyas means the change of the whole gestalt. It means turning in, looking at one's own self, because unless one knows who one is, all other knowledge is futile.\nAlbert Einstein is one of the most intelligent persons who has ever walked on earth but he died in deep misery. Just two days before his death he said 'If I am born again, I would not like to be a scientist.' Now a man of the calibre of Albert Einstein saying that means much. What is the point of knowing about stars and electrons and neutrons and protons when you don't know anything about\nyourself? And whatsoever you do without knowing about yourself is going to be wrong.\nThe most important thing in life is to become acquainted with oneself. And the moment you have a little acquaintance you suddenly see your blessedness.\nBeate is a beautiful name. It exactly means bhagwan. The word 'bhagwan' also means the blessed one.\nBeate may have certain far-away connections with the root of bhagwan. It may have come from the same Sanskrit root. In Sanskrit bhagwan does not mean god\n-- that is a secondary meaning; it simply means the blessed one, one who has known his blessedness.\nBuddha never believed in any god, still we called him bhagwan because he was one of the most blessed people who has ever walked on the earth. Mahavira never believed in any god, still we call him bhagwan, for the simple reason that we have never seen any person as blessed as him.\nBeate is significant, but the discovery has to be made. It is there, somewhere within you, you just have to dig within so many layers of thoughts, desires, conditionings. Just a little bit of searching inside and you will see, because it is just like a Kohinoor: it is so brilliant, your innermost self, so luminous, that nothing can hide it. Just a little search and the miracle happens.\nNadma means the ultimate sound which is heard when all other noise in the head stops.\nIt is always there but the head is so full of noise you cannot hear it. It is a very subtle sound, so subtle that the mystics have called it a soundless sound. It is not like somebody hammering on your door, it is not even a whisper; it is just like a breeze passing through the trees. Unless you are very alert, silent, you hear it.\nOnce you have heard it then you will be able to hear it even in the marketplace; then no noise can distract you from it because it has such a magnetic beauty, it is so alluring, it is so hypnotising. Once it is found it is never lost.\nSo all that we have to do is to put the mind in a calmer and quieter space. And it happens easily if you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwatch; if you watch the mind processes they start withering away. One day suddenly you are left alone, just a watchfulness with nothing to watch.\nIn that pregnant moment the soundless sound is heard, the sound of one hand clapping -- and your life is transported into a totally different existence. You are no more part of earth, you become part of the sky, of the beyond.\nAnahata is one of the most significant words. Literally it simply means unstruck sound.\nThe mystics have found -- and it is one of the ancientmost discoveries, at least ten thousand years old --\nthat life, that the whole of existence, is made of sound, of subtle vibrations of sound.\nModern physics discovered it too from a very different route; because of their different routes their definitions are a little bit different. But anybody who has some perception, who can think in both ways --\nscientifically and mystically -- can see the unity, can see that they are talking about the same thing in different languages, different jargon.\nModern physics says that the world, existence, consists of electricity. The whole existence is nothing but electrical vibration. And if you ask them what sound is, they will say it is nothing but a certain kind of vibration in the electric energy. If you ask the mystics what electricity is, they say it is a certain form of sound vibrations -- and then things become very clear.\nThe mystics discovered sound first, hence they define electricity by sound. In the East there has been a certain melody called 'deepak rag' light melody. It is said that there have been singers... And it seems to be almost an historical fact, not just a mythology, because there are so many records about it and very recent records -- five hundred years old.\nIn the great emperor Akbar's court there was a musician, Tansen, who was expert in that melody. It is a certain music can help the unlit lamp to become lit. The musician simply plays on his sitar, surrounded by unlit lamps and by and by they start becoming suddenly aflame. It is possible because a sound can hit the air in a certain way that it can create heat -- that's a known phenomenon. Sound can create heat. If it can create heat it can create fire; if it can create fire it can create electricity and vice versa is also true.\nThe mystics and the physicists have travelled towards the same destination from different angles.\nAnahata means the sound of which we are made, so it is unstruck. When you play on a guitar or then it is a struck sound; but there is a melody inside which is continuously there. In fact the mystics say that when that melody disappears we die, when that melody becomes disturbed we become ill. When we feel well- being it is really because of that melody; it is going as it should, there is no hindrance in it.\nThe mystics have also experienced -- and I can vouch for them, I can be a witness for them that they are saying something really significant -- that there is a way in which you can resonate with the whole existence in the same tune. That's meditation: resonating with the whole universe without any disturbance, falling in step with the melody of the whole. Then your ego disappears, then you are no more there. Then there is only music -- that music is Anahat, and to experience it is to know what bliss is.\nAgeya means the unknowable.\nThese three words have to be remembered: the known, the knowable and the unknowable.\nThe known was unknown yesterday. The knowable is unknown today but tomorrow it may become knowable, known. Science believes in only two categories, the known and the unknown. But the unknown means the knowable; up to now we have not been able to know it but sooner or later we will know it. Hence science believes a moment will come in history, some time in the future, where there will be nothing left to know, when the whole unknown will have become known. But religion has a third category also, the unknowable, which always remains unknowable. It was unknowable yesterday, it is unknowable\ntoday, it will remain unknowable tomorrow.\nScience thinks that existence can be demystified, religion knows it cannot be demystified because that unknowable will always remain a mystery. And that unknowable is called god, truth, nirvana -- so many names have been given to it\n-- tao, dhamma, logos, but one quality is definitely there in all these words: it is unknowable, it is an absolute mystery. You can enter into it, you can become part of it but you cannot know it.\nYou can live it but you cannot know it, you can taste it but you cannot say anything about it, You can feel it in your belly but you will be absolutely dumb. And that is the most precious experience. It is experienceable but not expressible. That's why it cannot become part of the known.\nMany people have experienced it -- Buddha experienced it, Lao Tzu experienced it, Patanjali 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nexperienced it, Kabir experienced it, but nobody has ever been able to say anything about it. All that they say is how to find it, but they never say anything about that which you are going to find.\nLao Tzu begins his book, TAO TE CHING: 'Truth is that which cannot be expressed. Remember this,'\nhe says 'and then you can read my book. Don't forget it -- because truth you will not find in the words.\nPerhaps one can find it in the gaps between the words or between the lines but not in the words, not in the lines themselves.'\nThat is our search -- the unknowable. And the only way to seek it is to dissolve into the whole just like a dewdrop dissolves into the ocean and becomes it.\nVideha means the bodyless.\nWe are in the body but we are not the body; the body is the host, we are the guest. So be thankful to the body, but don't get identified with it. Take care of the body -- it is a temple -- love it, respect it, but don't become addicted with it, obsessed with it, because it is only an overnight's stay; in the morning we have to go.\nWe have been in many bodies and we will be in many bodies, we have changed forms many times. One has to go on changing forms unless one comes to experience the formless. That's why buddhas are never born again. Once you have experienced the formless you have gone beyond birth and death, then there is no need to come back.\nAs a first step start creating a little distance between you and your body. And that same distance will automatically happen with the mind because the mind and body are not two, but two aspects of one reality.\nThe body is the outer part of the mind, the mind is the inner part of the body, so if you create distance from the body, the same distance is created with the mind too. A little distance is needed, and the simplest way to create the distance is to watch your body in it's acts and your mind in it's functionings. The watcher slowly slowly becomes separate; attains a coolness, remains undisturbed. Events happen in the body-mind; to the observer, to the consciousness, nothing ever happens -- it is always the same, unchangingly the same.\nThere is no past for it, no future for it. There is only the present. It is always now, here.\nSo this is going to be your work upon yourself: disidentification with the body- mind structure. Once that is done, everything else becomes very easy. You have taken the most significant step towards self-realization.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

flower, not only do you become blissful, the whole existence feels
blessed by your bliss.</p><p>Anand Manuel. Anand means bliss Manuel means god is with us.</p><p>Originally the name was reserved only for Christ, because he declared
'I and my father are one.'</p><p>The moment you know that you and existence are not separate -- that's
the ultimate peak of understanding, of being, there is nothing higher
than that -- that's the moment when one becomes a Christ.</p><p>Christ simply means the crowned one; one is crowned by glory, crowned
by the meeting and merger with the divine.</p><p>It is possible only for a very blissful person.</p><p>The people who go to the churches and the synagogues and the temples
and the mosques are almost always a miserable lot. They go there not to
celebrate life but to ask something from god. They go there as beggars;
and god is not for beggars, god does not exist for beggars. The beggar
is full of desires and desires are the hindrances. God exists only for
the emperors, and by 'emperor' I mean a person who has seen the futility
of all desiring.</p><p>When you see that desiring is futile bliss explodes. It is desire
that creates misery. If it is not fulfilled you are miserable, if it is
fulfilled then too you are miserable, because when it is fulfilled you
see that nothing is fulfilled, you are the same person. You wanted a big
house and now it is yours. You wasted years and years for it and dreamt
about it and spent so much energy; now the house is yours but you don't
see the bliss that you were dreaming, fantasising, about.</p><p>Nothing fails like success, so if a desire is fulfilled you are
miserable, if it is not fulfilled, you are miserable. Either way it
brings misery. Seeing this the man of understanding drops desiring and
in that very dropping is the explosion of bliss. And when you are
dancing and rejoicing in each moment of life you will find god is with
you, within you, god <em>is</em> you.</p><p>That's the goal of sannyas, to experience oneself as divine. Nothing
less is going to fulfil, nothing less is going to help. And it is not a
far-away goal; it is within everybody's reach, we just have not tried in
the right direction.</p><p>Blissfulness is the right direction, the way that leads to god.
Misery is the way that leads you farther and farther away.</p><p>Dhyan means meditation. Nadia means hope.</p><p>The only hope is meditation. And remember, I say the <em>only</em>
hope -- all else is just hopeless. One can have money, power, prestige,
but ultimately one finds everything has betrayed one. Even a man like
Alexander the Great dies in deep frustration and hopelessness. But the
man of meditation lives with tremendous ecstasy and dies too with the
same ecstasy, with the same dance.</p><p>Just before Buddha died his disciples naturally started crying and
weeping; they could not contain their tears. He said, "Stop! You should
rejoice because I have fulfilled my mission in life. There is nothing
more for me to do here. I have known whatsoever was worth knowing, I
have realized whatsoever was my potential. My death is not the end of
life but the ultimate crescendo, the climax. Weeping and crying you can
do later on; right now while I am still here, rejoice!"</p><p>Meditation is the only hope. One should put one's whole energy into
meditation. It means the exploration of your own interiority. It is a
journey from the circumference to the center. The moment you reach the
center you have come home. Then suddenly spring is there and the birds
start singing and the flowers</p><p>suddenly appear from nowhere and the whole of life is fragrant.</p><p>It is better to move into meditation as quickly as possible. Every
moment that is not meditative is lost.</p><p>We save only that time which goes into meditation -- that is the only
real life. And once you know how to live at your center you need not
renounce life; you live in life, amidst life, but still you are
centered, rooted in your self.</p><p>The meditative person is not an escapist; he is creative. That is the
criterion of real meditation: if it helps you to be creative only then
is it true meditation; otherwise you are carrying something pseudo in
the name of meditation. If it creates the longing to escape from life --
to the monastery, to the caves to the mountains</p><p>-- that is not true meditation.</p><p>One has to be blissful wherever one is.</p><p>Prem Michael. Prem means love. Michael means godly. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>There are a few experiences which can only be called godly, there is
no other way to define them. Love is one of those few rare experiences.
Meditation, bliss, love -- these can be only indicated by the word</p><p>'godly', because whenever you are in love or in bliss or in
meditation suddenly you become aware of a translucent presence,
surrounding the whole existence. You see it within, you see it without.
It has always been there, it is just that you were blind. You are
breathing it every moment, you are living in it. Just lives in the ocean
we are living in god. All that is needed is a certain clarity, a certain
ability to see.</p><p>And love helps immensely to cleanse your eyes, because fundamentally
love is the dropping of the ego, and the moment ego is dropped a curtain
that was on your eyes disappears. The clouds that were surrounding you
are no more there, the sky is clear and you can see the farthest
stars.</p><p>God is not a person but a presence, hence you will not meet a person
the way Christians have been talking about god, the father -- a very
ancient, old man. His beard must have reached the floor by now, it just
be sweeping the floor, because I have never heard that there are barbers
in paradise; nobody has ever thought about barbers and hair-cutting
salons. He must be completely covered with hair! There are all kinds of
gods invented by religious people, but they are all inventions,
imagination, fiction -- you can call them spiritual fiction. Just as
there is science fiction, so there is spiritual fiction. But the truth
is that god is not a person at all, you cannot make any image.</p><p>God is beauty, not beautiful. God is love, not loving. God is bliss,
not somebody who is blissful.</p><p>And when you start seeing god as beauty, as truth, as love, as bliss,
as ecstasy, your whole vision goes through a radical change. And love
can become one of the most significant steps. One can enter god through
love very easily.</p><p>Use it as a device, as a bridge.</p><p>Dhyan Beate. Dhyan means meditation. Beate means the blessed.</p><p>We don't know how blessed we are because we are not aware of our own
inexhaustible treasures. We are not even thinking about the inner --
experiencing is a far-away thing. We are continuously thinking about
everything except our own being.</p><p>Sannyas means the change of the whole gestalt. It means turning in,
looking at one's own self, because unless one knows who one is, all
other knowledge is futile.</p><p>Albert Einstein is one of the most intelligent persons who has ever
walked on earth but he died in deep misery. Just two days before his
death he said 'If I am born again, I would not like to be a scientist.'
Now a man of the calibre of Albert Einstein saying that means much. What
is the point of knowing about stars and electrons and neutrons and
protons when you don't know anything about</p><p>yourself? And whatsoever you do without knowing about yourself is
going to be wrong.</p><p>The most important thing in life is to become acquainted with
oneself. And the moment you have a little acquaintance you suddenly see
your blessedness.</p><p>Beate is a beautiful name. It exactly means bhagwan. The word
'bhagwan' also means the blessed one.</p><p>Beate may have certain far-away connections with the root of bhagwan.
It may have come from the same Sanskrit root. In Sanskrit bhagwan does
not mean god</p><p>-- that is a secondary meaning; it simply means the blessed one, one
who has known his blessedness.</p><p>Buddha never believed in any god, still we called him bhagwan because
he was one of the most blessed people who has ever walked on the earth.
Mahavira never believed in any god, still we call him bhagwan, for the
simple reason that we have never seen any person as blessed as him.</p><p>Beate is significant, but the discovery has to be made. It is there,
somewhere within you, you just have to dig within so many layers of
thoughts, desires, conditionings. Just a little bit of searching inside
and you will see, because it is just like a Kohinoor: it is so
brilliant, your innermost self, so luminous, that nothing can hide it.
Just a little search and the miracle happens.</p><p>Nadma means the ultimate sound which is heard when all other noise in
the head stops.</p><p>It is always there but the head is so full of noise you cannot hear
it. It is a very subtle sound, so subtle that the mystics have called it
a soundless sound. It is not like somebody hammering on your door, it is
not even a whisper; it is just like a breeze passing through the trees.
Unless you are very alert, silent, you hear it.</p><p>Once you have heard it then you will be able to hear it even in the
marketplace; then no noise can distract you from it because it has such
a magnetic beauty, it is so alluring, it is so hypnotising. Once it is
found it is never lost.</p><p>So all that we have to do is to put the mind in a calmer and quieter
space. And it happens easily if you 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>watch; if you watch the mind processes they start withering away. One
day suddenly you are left alone, just a watchfulness with nothing to
watch.</p><p>In that pregnant moment the soundless sound is heard, the sound of
one hand clapping -- and your life is transported into a totally
different existence. You are no more part of earth, you become part of
the sky, of the beyond.</p><p>Anahata is one of the most significant words. Literally it simply
means unstruck sound.</p><p>The mystics have found -- and it is one of the ancientmost
discoveries, at least ten thousand years old --</p><p>that life, that the whole of existence, is made of sound, of subtle
vibrations of sound.</p><p>Modern physics discovered it too from a very different route; because
of their different routes their definitions are a little bit different.
But anybody who has some perception, who can think in both ways --</p><p>scientifically and mystically -- can see the unity, can see that they
are talking about the same thing in different languages, different
jargon.</p><p>Modern physics says that the world, existence, consists of
electricity. The whole existence is nothing but electrical vibration.
And if you ask them what sound is, they will say it is nothing but a
certain kind of vibration in the electric energy. If you ask the mystics
what electricity is, they say it is a certain form of sound vibrations
-- and then things become very clear.</p><p>The mystics discovered sound first, hence they define electricity by
sound. In the East there has been a certain melody called 'deepak rag'
light melody. It is said that there have been singers... And it seems to
be almost an historical fact, not just a mythology, because there are so
many records about it and very recent records -- five hundred years
old.</p><p>In the great emperor Akbar's court there was a musician, Tansen, who
was expert in that melody. It is a certain music can help the unlit lamp
to become lit. The musician simply plays on his sitar, surrounded by
unlit lamps and by and by they start becoming suddenly aflame. It is
possible because a sound can hit the air in a certain way that it can
create heat -- that's a known phenomenon. Sound can create heat. If it
can create heat it can create fire; if it can create fire it can create
electricity and vice versa is also true.</p><p>The mystics and the physicists have travelled towards the same
destination from different angles.</p><p>Anahata means the sound of which we are made, so it is unstruck. When
you play on a guitar or then it is a struck sound; but there is a melody
inside which is continuously there. In fact the mystics say that when
that melody disappears we die, when that melody becomes disturbed we
become ill. When we feel well- being it is really because of that
melody; it is going as it should, there is no hindrance in it.</p><p>The mystics have also experienced -- and I can vouch for them, I can
be a witness for them that they are saying something really significant
-- that there is a way in which you can resonate with the whole
existence in the same tune. That's meditation: resonating with the whole
universe without any disturbance, falling in step with the melody of the
whole. Then your ego disappears, then you are no more there. Then there
is only music -- that music is Anahat, and to experience it is to know
what bliss is.</p><p>Ageya means the unknowable.</p><p>These three words have to be remembered: the known, the knowable and
the unknowable.</p><p>The known was unknown yesterday. The knowable is unknown today but
tomorrow it may become knowable, known. Science believes in only two
categories, the known and the unknown. But the unknown means the
knowable; up to now we have not been able to know it but sooner or later
we will know it. Hence science believes a moment will come in history,
some time in the future, where there will be nothing left to know, when
the whole unknown will have become known. But religion has a third
category also, the unknowable, which always remains unknowable. It was
unknowable yesterday, it is unknowable</p><p>today, it will remain unknowable tomorrow.</p><p>Science thinks that existence can be demystified, religion knows it
cannot be demystified because that unknowable will always remain a
mystery. And that unknowable is called god, truth, nirvana -- so many
names have been given to it</p><p>-- tao, dhamma, logos, but one quality is definitely there in all
these words: it is unknowable, it is an absolute mystery. You can enter
into it, you can become part of it but you cannot know it.</p><p>You can live it but you cannot know it, you can taste it but you
cannot say anything about it, You can feel it in your belly but you will
be absolutely dumb. And that is the most precious experience. It is
experienceable but not expressible. That's why it cannot become part of
the known.</p><p>Many people have experienced it -- Buddha experienced it, Lao Tzu
experienced it, Patanjali 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

to say anything about it. All that they say is how to find it, but they
never say anything about that which you are going to find.</p><p>Lao Tzu begins his book, TAO TE CHING: 'Truth is that which cannot be
expressed. Remember this,'</p><p>he says 'and then you can read my book. Don't forget it -- because
truth you will not find in the words.</p><p>Perhaps one can find it in the gaps between the words or between the
lines but not in the words, not in the lines themselves.'</p><p>That is our search -- the unknowable. And the only way to seek it is
to dissolve into the whole just like a dewdrop dissolves into the ocean
and becomes it.</p><p>Videha means the bodyless.</p><p>We <em>are</em> in the body but we are not the body; the body is the
host, we are the guest. So be thankful to the body, but don't get
identified with it. Take care of the body -- it is a temple -- love it,
respect it, but don't become addicted with it, obsessed with it, because
it is only an overnight's stay; in the morning we have to go.</p><p>We have been in many bodies and we will be in many bodies, we have
changed forms many times. One has to go on changing forms unless one
comes to experience the formless. That's why buddhas are never born
again. Once you have experienced the formless you have gone beyond birth
and death, then there is no need to come back.</p><p>As a first step start creating a little distance between you and your
body. And that same distance will automatically happen with the mind
because the mind and body are not two, but two aspects of one
reality.</p><p>The body is the outer part of the mind, the mind is the inner part of
the body, so if you create distance from the body, the same distance is
created with the mind too. A little distance is needed, and the simplest
way to create the distance is to watch your body in it's acts and your
mind in it's functionings. The watcher slowly slowly becomes separate;
attains a coolness, remains undisturbed. Events happen in the body-mind;
to the observer, to the consciousness, nothing ever happens -- it is
always the same, unchangingly the same.</p><p>There is no past for it, no future for it. There is only the present.
It is always now, here.</p><p>So this is going to be your work upon yourself: disidentification
with the body- mind structure. Once that is done, everything else
becomes very easy. You have taken the most significant step towards
self-realization.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #14</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

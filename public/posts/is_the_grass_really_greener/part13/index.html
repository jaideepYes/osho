It is for reference purposes only.]\nVeet Madison. Veet means go beyond. Madison means might in battle.\nMan needs now peace, not war. Man needs love, no violence. We have been tortured enough by the idea of becoming heroes in war, of destruction, of violence. It is time that it be completely, totally stopped.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn the past it was possible to afford it but now it is impossible, because science has given us so much destructive power that if we go on living according to the old values and ideals then humanity is finished.\nThe warrior, the soldier, the general, should become criminals in the future. The future belongs to the sannyasins, not to the soldiers, it belongs to the lovers.\nOnly love can give us the balance.\nBut humanity has lived against love up to now and that's why there is so much misery; it is bound to be so: we have lived destructively, in an insane way.\nNow there are only two alternatives: either we have to change totally from the very roots, root and all, or we have to be ready for a global suicide.\nSo go beyond the idea of being a mighty warrior -- enough of it. It is a mad idea. So Madison will remind you that it is a mad idea!\nLove insanity, war is madness. And when we can live according to a now vision of life there is no need to go on carrying the old values just because they are old. Their time is over, they are outdated. We have to put a full stop to the past, we have to break the continuity with the past -- and my whole work consists of that, to make humanity discontinuous with its own past so we can start afresh.\nSo my people are really Adams and Eves and we have to start from the very beginning. It is a tremendous challenge, it is worth accepting it. It is the greatest adventure, and it is possible now. It was not possible before.\nMan can live in ecstasy on the earth, there is no need for a paradise after death. It can be before death too.\nVeet Holm. Veet means to go beyond. Holm means an island.\nMan is not an island but we live with the false notion of being an island. We are part of the whole, we are not apart. We belong to the continent, and the continent is infinite, there is no demarcation line.\nThe ego is an island but your being is not an island. To follow the dictates of the ego is to make a mess of your life, because it is basically taking you away from the organic unity of existence. It is trying to create a separate entity, which is impossible. The whole project is doomed from the very beginning, it cannot happen because it is not according to the law of existence. How can the tree be separate from the earth? It is impossible. How can the leaf be separate from the tree? The moment it is separate it is dead. Life is being with the tree, being part of it.\nEgo is a dead thing, a dead weight. The bigger the ego, the more dead is the man\nbecause it suffocates his being. The moment you drop the ego you are free again, free from all imprisonment, free from all chains. Then this whole universe belongs to you. Then all the stars and the mountains and the rivers are part of you, just as you are part of them.\nTo feel that unity, that synchronicity, that affinity, is sannyas. To feel that music, that resonance, is sannyas.\nVidyasagar Bharti. Vidyasagar is a beautiful name. It has tremendous significance.\nThe Upanishads define science as 'avidya', ignorance, and the science of the self as 'vidya', as wisdom.\nThe objective science is defined as ignorance and the subjective science is defined as knowing, wisdom. It is a very strange definition. Nowhere else has science been defined as avidya, ignorance, but the Upanishads are right. The word 'ignorance' simply means that you have been ignoring the essential; it comes from ignoring. The person who is too much concerned with the objective world is ignoring himself. So it is perfectly right to define science as ignorance: it is becoming concerned with the non-essential. While life was an opportunity to discover the essential we wasted it in the non-essential. While we could have found the immeasurable treasure of our being we wasted our time collecting seashells and coloured stones on the sea beach. We rushed hither and thither and there was so much hurry and so much worry to no purpose at all; it was much ado about nothing.\nIt is right, perfectly right, that the Upanishads call it ignorance.\nThe true knowledge can only be of your consciousness. That is the morning of Vidya.\nAnd Sagar means ocean. The moment you know yourself you become oceanic. Then all boundaries disappear; you lose all limitations of body, of mind, of caste, creed, cult, nation. All boundaries simply disappear because consciousness is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian, neither Indian nor German nor English, neither black nor white; consciousness is just consciousness with no adjective attached to it. Because it has no adjective it has immense freedom, it is not tethered to anything.\nThe moment one enters into oneself one is entering into infinity. To know oneself is to know that one is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nvast, as vast as the universe itself. And there cannot be two vastnesses, remember. If there are two vastnesses they cannot be vast; they will define each other, there will be a demarcation, a boundary line.\nThere can be only one vastness, only one infinity. So the moment you know that you are infinite, you also know that you are not, only the whole is.\nSo self-knowing is a very paradoxical phenomenon: first you become very much intrigued by the existence of the self, but as you go deeper the self starts evaporating. Ultimately what is found is pure consciousness -- no self at all. That's why Buddha called it anatta, no-self, just to give you the feel that you have become the whole.\nThe word 'vidyasagar' contains both the definition of knowing and the experience of knowing. And it all happens through a very simple process of meditation. One just has to learn to be silent, related, calm and quiet, so all turmoil settles. Slowly slowly a moment comes when there is no movement within you, all movement has disappeared. In that very moment the miracle of knowing happens and one is transformed, one is born anew. That is the beginning of a divine existence.\nDhyan Wolf. Dhyan means meditation. Meditation means awareness, watchfulness, a silent witnessing of all the processes of the mind. And the magic of watching is that as your watchfulness deepens, the mind starts evaporating. When the watchfulness is absolute mind becomes nil, a zero. And the disappearance of the mind gives you clarity, absolute clarity, transparency; you can see through and through, you become a mirror. And then life is reflected as it is -- not according to any doctrine, not according to the Bible or the Koran or the Gita but as it is. And to know life as it is, is to know god.\nIn Germany mythology wolf is a symbol for two things: cunningness and\ncourage. Meditation will help you to get rid of cunningness and it will nourish your courage. The cunning part cannot survive meditation.\nMeditation is like fire. When you put gold into fire all that is not gold is burned and then gold comes out of it absolutely purified. The same happens through meditation: put anything into it and that which is wrong will be burned and that which is right will come up in its total fragrance.\nCourage is an essential quality, cunningness is a learned trick. Cunningness is not inborn. One learns it from society because one has to live with cunning people -- just to survive you have to be cunning. But courage is an inborn quality, intrinsic. Every child is courageous. In fact it is the parents who make him a coward. They talk about ghosts, they talk about thieves and murderers and they make him afraid of darkness. They go on making him afraid of a thousand and one things. Slowly slowly he loses heart, he becomes nervous. If there are so many fears surrounding one, one has to be very cunning just to survive.\nAnd by and by he finds that the parents are right because society consists of all kinds of deceptive people.\nSo his courage by and by becomes covered with layers of cunningness. And cunningness cannot give you anything because it is something imposed from the outside. It has to be burned, removed, then courage bursts forth!\nMy definition of right and wrong, of good and bad, of essential and non- essential, is always derived from meditation. When you go through meditativeness whatsoever survives is right, is good, is moral, is beautiful, is natural, is divine. Whatsoever is burned through meditation was wrong, was not natural.\nSo in a way the word 'wolf' is good; is symbolizes two things: the essential part of you, courage, and the non-essential part, cunningness.\nSannyasins have to be courageous but not cunning. In fact to be cunning is cowardly, it is not really courageous; cunningness goes against courage.\nFor example the really courageous animals are not cunning; the lion is not cunning, the elephant is not cunning. The wolf is cunning, the fox is very cunning, but they are not very courageous people. They are cunning just to supplement what they are lacking: they are lacking courage. They need\nsomething else to be added to them -- that is cunningness. But the tiger or the lion or the elephant need not have any cunningness; the elephant is the most simple and the most courageous animal -- very simple and very innocent, just childlike.\nGo through meditation and you will see that much is just weeds within you -- those weeds will be burned and only roses will be saved. And when one's life is full of roses one has arrived, one has found the source of joy.\nDhyan Hendrik. Dhyan means meditation. Hendrik means home.\nA man without meditation is a man without a home, he is homeless. He lives accidentally; he has nothing running through his life as a connecting link. He has no idea of what he is doing, or why he is doing 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nit. He has no vision of who he is or why he is. He has not even thought about from where he comes, to where he is bound. He is just like driftwood, at the mercy of the wind and the waves -- wherever the winds are going or the waves are going. He lives in this way but this kind of life cannot have any significance, it cannot have meaning and poetry. It will be like a monkey sitting on a typewriter, knowing nothing about the typewriter, but he has watched people typing so he can imitate them. But do you think that some poetry will come out of it?\nThere are scientists who say that in infinite time there is a possibility that if the monkey goes on typing and typing for millions and trillions of years, maybe one day he will turn out a beautiful poem. But that is a very far, far-away, very remote possibility -- so remote that one can take it for granted that it will not happen, it cannot happen. But that's how people are living: monkeys sitting on typewriters, just sitting here and there and hoping that they will become Shakespeares and Miltons and Shelleys and Byrons -- and what comes out is just rubbish.\nThat's how people's lives are -- monkeyish, imitative. They do hard work but\nbecause there is no clear-cut perception, nothing ever comes out of it, all their efforts are wasted.\nMeditation gives you a home, it gives you a shelter. It gives you a certain inner security, a balance, an understanding, a vision to live by and to live for, or if the need arises, even to die for. Then not only does life become significant but even death becomes significant.\nAnd the man who can transform his life and death into significant poetry has succeeded, has not been a failure. Very few people have succeeded in the past. The irony is that everybody has the potential to succeed but we never look at our own potential.\nMeditation is nothing but looking at your own potential, searching for it; exploring your inner territory to find out what you have brought into the world, what seeds are there, what kind of soil you need, what kind of climate will be helpful for your inner growth.\nI don't give you any idea about what you have to become; I only give you a key so you can explore within yourself what script you have brought with you, what seeds you already have within you. Somebody will become a rose and somebody may become a lotus, so no idea has to be imposed from the outside.\nI don't give you any discipline but I certainly give you a key which can help you to unlock the doors of your own home, of your own being. And that's the most precious thing that can happen to a man; there is nothing more precious than finding the key.\nMeditation is the key. Agneya means aflame, afire.\nWe are carrying fire within our souls. Of course it is covered with much dust, so much so that we have completely forgotten about it. But that fire is our very source of life; even though it is covered, it is through it that we are alive.\nThe moment it is really gone we are dead. That's why warmth is symbolic of life and coldness symbolic of death. But people live only at the minimum because their fire is covered, so only a little bit of it reaches them, a very small fragment.\nScientists have discovered that people use only five per cent of their potential in their whole life, ninety-five per cent of their potential remains unused. Even the greatest geniuses like Albert Einstein don't use more than fifteen per cent. Only Buddhas have used one hundred per cent of their potential -- and then of course, their life has a dance incomparable, a joy overflowing, inexhaustible. They are not only blissful, they are a blessing to others.\nThis fire has to be discovered.\nI have chosen orange as the colour for my sannyasins to remind them of fire. So all shades of red...\nbecause fire has all the shades of red.\nThere is the religion of Zarathustra. He was very much in love with fire. But his followers have misunderstood him as everybody's followers have always done -- that is the routine way. Zarathustra's followers started worshipping fire; rather than finding the fire within they started making temples of fire.\nNow those followers exist only in India. Zarathustra was born in Iran; the whole of Iran once was under his impact but Mohammedans forcibly converted those simple people to Islam. Only a few could escape, only a few thousand could escape from Iran. They landed in Bombay, so now Bombay is the only place where the followers of Zarathustra are living -- just one hundred thousand, not more than that.\nBut what they are doing is strange: they have carried the original fire from Iran and they are still maintaining it -- that fire has remained continuous. Their temples are called 'agyaris', fire temples, and their 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhole effort is that the old ancient fire should not be in any way lost -- it is their god.\nSo for twenty-four hours a day for three thousand years -- because Zarathustra's\nreligion is three thousand years old -- they have gone on adding fuel. For three thousand years they have carried the fire on and they have kept it burning. The whole thing is useless.\nThe real thing is to discover the fire within. And it has been there from eternity, so why bother about the fire outside? But that's always happening: the master talks about the inner and the followers translate it into the outer. In that translation everything gets lost.\nMy work here is to help you to discover your inner temple of fire. I love Zarathustra, he has given a very significant message, and his followers have been really simple, innocent people, very straight, not cunning at all, very life- affirmative, very loving, intelligent, but even then they have missed the point.\nSo remember it: the temple is not on the outside, you are the temple and your life source is your fire.\nAnd once you have found it you have found eternity. Then there is no misery, no darkness, no death.\nSvarupanand means bliss is your self-nature.\nIt is not something that happens to you; it is already the case. It is that you are not there, present, you are somewhere else, dreaming of other places, dreaming of the future, dreaming of the past and never in the present, never herenow.\nWithdraw yourself from the past and the future, withdraw all your energies from everywhere and let them rest herenow, in this moment, within yourself, just like a child in the womb of the mother. So become a mother and let your whole energy rest in your womb and you will be surprised; for the first time you will understand the meaning of what Jesus says, 'The kingdom of god is within you.'\nThere is so much bliss that one cannot believe it. For the first time one misses a few heartbeats -- it is such a shock that it has always been within you and you have always been running somewhere else to find it. And the whole ridiculousness of it: how can you find it anywhere else if it is within you. There is no way to find it anywhere else.\nSo first there is a shock, one is stunned, one misses a few heartbeats, then one sees the ridiculousness of one's life, effort, investment and then laughter arises;\none laughs at oneself. That is the beginning of Buddhahood, when one starts laughing at oneself.\nIt is easy to laugh at others, the ego enjoys it, but laughing at oneself becomes the death of the ego.\nIt is said that after his enlightenment Bodhidharma laughed for seven days continuously; he could not even sleep. His disciples and friends would put him to bed and he would pop up again (laughter)... and start laughing. They said 'Have you gone mad or what is the matter with you?' And he said 'For the first time I have gone sane -- up to now I have been mad -- that's why I am laughing. I cannot believe how it was possible to miss for so long something that was so close by!'\nJust a little understanding -- it is not a question of much effort but only of a little understanding, a little alertness, watchfulness, turning in and seeing -- and a totally new dimension opens its doors.\nVidehanand means the experience that you are not the body, is the experience of bliss. The identity with the body, that 'I am the body' is the root cause of our misery. So it is very simple arithmetic: if one thinks oneself the body one will live in hell; if one becomes aware of the fact that 'How can I be the body? -- I can watch my body, I can watch my mind. Certainly I am separate from that which I can watch '\nThe observer is certainly different from the observed. The body is there, the mind is there and you can see both, their functionings, their activities. The body is ill but you are not ill. You can see that the body is ill -- there is a headache -- you can watch it, you can see it is there, and when it goes away you know it has gone; you are not it. You are separate from all that happens in the body and the mind.\nThis is the beginning of bliss. The moment you are totally aware of your separation from the body-mind complex your life is rooted in deep bliss. It becomes so blissful, every moment is so infinitely sweet, fragrant, that one cannot resist the idea of prayer; one has to thank existence. It is impossible not to thank it, one has to feel gratitude, because we have not earned it -- it is a gift. We don't deserve it; it has simply been given to us for no reason at all. As far as we are concerned we are not even worthy of it; hence the gratitude, hence the\nprayer.\nThere is no god as a person to listen to your prayers. Prayers do not say anything about the existence of god; prayers only say something about the gratitude of the man who has come to know bliss. It has some reference to you and to your experience but it has no reference to god at all; god does not come into it.\nThis is a simple process of non-identification. So from this moment watch: 'I am not the body; I am not 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe mind; I am just the awareness, the pure mirror, that reflects all. And slowly slowly it becomes so deep --\nrooted that it remains with you twenty-four hours a day. Even in deep sleep a certain awareness remains like a flame burning in you, fully alert, that the body is asleep, you are just the watcher.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

been tortured enough by the idea of becoming heroes in war, of
destruction, of violence. It is time that it be completely, totally
stopped.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

because science has given us so much destructive power that if we go on
living according to the old values and ideals then humanity is
finished.</p><p>The warrior, the soldier, the general, should become criminals in the
future. The future belongs to the sannyasins, not to the soldiers, it
belongs to the lovers.</p><p>Only love can give us the balance.</p><p>But humanity has lived against love up to now and that's why there is
so much misery; it is bound to be so: we have lived destructively, in an
insane way.</p><p>Now there are only two alternatives: either we have to change totally
from the very roots, root and all, or we have to be ready for a global
suicide.</p><p>So go beyond the idea of being a mighty warrior -- enough of it. It
is a mad idea. So Madison will remind you that it is a mad idea!</p><p>Love insanity, war is madness. And when we can live according to a
now vision of life there is no need to go on carrying the old values
just because they are old. Their time is over, they are outdated. We
have to put a full stop to the past, we have to break the continuity
with the past -- and my whole work consists of that, to make humanity
discontinuous with its own past so we can start afresh.</p><p>So my people are really Adams and Eves and we have to start from the
very beginning. It is a tremendous challenge, it is worth accepting it.
It is the greatest adventure, and it is possible now. It was not
possible before.</p><p>Man can live in ecstasy on the earth, there is no need for a paradise
after death. It can be before death too.</p><p>Veet Holm. Veet means to go beyond. Holm means an island.</p><p>Man is not an island but we live with the false notion of being an
island. We are part of the whole, we are not apart. We belong to the
continent, and the continent is infinite, there is no demarcation
line.</p><p>The ego is an island but your being is not an island. To follow the
dictates of the ego is to make a mess of your life, because it is
basically taking you away from the organic unity of existence. It is
trying to create a separate entity, which is impossible. The whole
project is doomed from the very beginning, it cannot happen because it
is not according to the law of existence. How can the tree be separate
from the earth? It is impossible. How can the leaf be separate from the
tree? The moment it is separate it is dead. Life is being with the tree,
being part of it.</p><p>Ego is a dead thing, a dead weight. The bigger the ego, the more dead
is the man</p><p>because it suffocates his being. The moment you drop the ego you are
free again, free from all imprisonment, free from all chains. Then this
whole universe belongs to you. Then all the stars and the mountains and
the rivers are part of you, just as you are part of them.</p><p>To feel that unity, that synchronicity, that affinity, is sannyas. To
feel that music, that resonance, is sannyas.</p><p>Vidyasagar Bharti. Vidyasagar is a beautiful name. It has tremendous
significance.</p><p>The Upanishads define science as 'avidya', ignorance, and the science
of the self as 'vidya', as wisdom.</p><p>The objective science is defined as ignorance and the subjective
science is defined as knowing, wisdom. It is a very strange definition.
Nowhere else has science been defined as avidya, ignorance, but the
Upanishads are right. The word 'ignorance' simply means that you have
been ignoring the essential; it comes from ignoring. The person who is
too much concerned with the objective world is ignoring himself. So it
is perfectly right to define science as ignorance: it is becoming
concerned with the non-essential. While life was an opportunity to
discover the essential we wasted it in the non-essential. While we could
have found the immeasurable treasure of our being we wasted our time
collecting seashells and coloured stones on the sea beach. We rushed
hither and thither and there was so much hurry and so much worry to no
purpose at all; it was much ado about nothing.</p><p>It is right, perfectly right, that the Upanishads call it
ignorance.</p><p>The true knowledge can only be of your consciousness. That is the
morning of Vidya.</p><p>And Sagar means ocean. The moment you know yourself you become
oceanic. Then all boundaries disappear; you lose all limitations of
body, of mind, of caste, creed, cult, nation. All boundaries simply
disappear because consciousness is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor
Christian, neither Indian nor German nor English, neither black nor
white; consciousness is just consciousness with no adjective attached to
it. Because it has no adjective it has immense freedom, it is not
tethered to anything.</p><p>The moment one enters into oneself one is entering into infinity. To
know oneself is to know that one is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

vastnesses, remember. If there are two vastnesses they cannot be vast;
they will define each other, there will be a demarcation, a boundary
line.</p><p>There can be only one vastness, only one infinity. So the moment you
know that you are infinite, you also know that you are not, only the
whole is.</p><p>So self-knowing is a very paradoxical phenomenon: first you become
very much intrigued by the existence of the self, but as you go deeper
the self starts evaporating. Ultimately what is found is pure
consciousness -- no self at all. That's why Buddha called it anatta,
no-self, just to give you the feel that you have become the whole.</p><p>The word 'vidyasagar' contains both the definition of knowing and the
experience of knowing. And it all happens through a very simple process
of meditation. One just has to learn to be silent, related, calm and
quiet, so all turmoil settles. Slowly slowly a moment comes when there
is no movement within you, all movement has disappeared. In that very
moment the miracle of knowing happens and one is transformed, one is
born anew. That is the beginning of a divine existence.</p><p>Dhyan Wolf. Dhyan means meditation. Meditation means awareness,
watchfulness, a silent witnessing of all the processes of the mind. And
the magic of watching is that as your watchfulness deepens, the mind
starts evaporating. When the watchfulness is absolute mind becomes nil,
a zero. And the disappearance of the mind gives you clarity, absolute
clarity, transparency; you can see through and through, you become a
mirror. And then life is reflected as it is -- not according to any
doctrine, not according to the Bible or the Koran or the Gita but as it
is. And to know life as it is, is to know god.</p><p>In Germany mythology wolf is a symbol for two things: cunningness
and</p><p>courage. Meditation will help you to get rid of cunningness and it
will nourish your courage. The cunning part cannot survive
meditation.</p><p>Meditation is like fire. When you put gold into fire all that is not
gold is burned and then gold comes out of it absolutely purified. The
same happens through meditation: put anything into it and that which is
wrong will be burned and that which is right will come up in its total
fragrance.</p><p>Courage is an essential quality, cunningness is a learned trick.
Cunningness is not inborn. One learns it from society because one has to
live with cunning people -- just to survive you have to be cunning. But
courage is an inborn quality, intrinsic. Every child is courageous. In
fact it is the parents who make him a coward. They talk about ghosts,
they talk about thieves and murderers and they make him afraid of
darkness. They go on making him afraid of a thousand and one things.
Slowly slowly he loses heart, he becomes nervous. If there are so many
fears surrounding one, one has to be very cunning just to survive.</p><p>And by and by he finds that the parents are right because society
consists of all kinds of deceptive people.</p><p>So his courage by and by becomes covered with layers of cunningness.
And cunningness cannot give you anything because it is something imposed
from the outside. It has to be burned, removed, then courage bursts
forth!</p><p>My definition of right and wrong, of good and bad, of essential and
non- essential, is always derived from meditation. When you go through
meditativeness whatsoever survives is right, is good, is moral, is
beautiful, is natural, is divine. Whatsoever is burned through
meditation was wrong, was not natural.</p><p>So in a way the word 'wolf' is good; is symbolizes two things: the
essential part of you, courage, and the non-essential part,
cunningness.</p><p>Sannyasins have to be courageous but not cunning. In fact to be
cunning is cowardly, it is not really courageous; cunningness goes
against courage.</p><p>For example the really courageous animals are not cunning; the lion
is not cunning, the elephant is not cunning. The wolf is cunning, the
fox is very cunning, but they are not very courageous people. They are
cunning just to supplement what they are lacking: they are lacking
courage. They need</p><p>something else to be added to them -- that is cunningness. But the
tiger or the lion or the elephant need not have any cunningness; the
elephant is the most simple and the most courageous animal -- very
simple and very innocent, just childlike.</p><p>Go through meditation and you will see that much is just weeds within
you -- those weeds will be burned and only roses will be saved. And when
one's life is full of roses one has arrived, one has found the source of
joy.</p><p>Dhyan Hendrik. Dhyan means meditation. Hendrik means home.</p><p>A man without meditation is a man without a home, he is homeless. He
lives accidentally; he has nothing running through his life as a
connecting link. He has no idea of what he is doing, or why he is doing

thought about from where he comes, to where he is bound. He is just like
driftwood, at the mercy of the wind and the waves -- wherever the winds
are going or the waves are going. He lives in this way but this kind of
life cannot have any significance, it cannot have meaning and poetry. It
will be like a monkey sitting on a typewriter, knowing nothing about the
typewriter, but he has watched people typing so he can imitate them. But
do you think that some poetry will come out of it?</p><p>There are scientists who say that in infinite time there is a
possibility that if the monkey goes on typing and typing for millions
and trillions of years, maybe one day he will turn out a beautiful poem.
But that is a very far, far-away, very remote possibility -- so remote
that one can take it for granted that it will not happen, it cannot
happen. But that's how people are living: monkeys sitting on
typewriters, just sitting here and there and hoping that they will
become Shakespeares and Miltons and Shelleys and Byrons -- and what
comes out is just rubbish.</p><p>That's how people's lives are -- monkeyish, imitative. They do hard
work but</p><p>because there is no clear-cut perception, nothing ever comes out of
it, all their efforts are wasted.</p><p>Meditation gives you a home, it gives you a shelter. It gives you a
certain inner security, a balance, an understanding, a vision to live by
and to live for, or if the need arises, even to die for. Then not only
does life become significant but even death becomes significant.</p><p>And the man who can transform his life and death into significant
poetry has succeeded, has not been a failure. Very few people have
succeeded in the past. The irony is that everybody has the potential to
succeed but we never look at our own potential.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but looking at your own potential, searching
for it; exploring your inner territory to find out what you have brought
into the world, what seeds are there, what kind of soil you need, what
kind of climate will be helpful for your inner growth.</p><p>I don't give you any idea about what you have to become; I only give
you a key so you can explore within yourself what script you have
brought with you, what seeds you already have within you. Somebody will
become a rose and somebody may become a lotus, so no idea has to be
imposed from the outside.</p><p>I don't give you any discipline but I certainly give you a key which
can help you to unlock the doors of your own home, of your own being.
And that's the most precious thing that can happen to a man; there is
nothing more precious than finding the key.</p><p>Meditation is the key. Agneya means aflame, afire.</p><p>We are carrying fire within our souls. Of course it is covered with
much dust, so much so that we have completely forgotten about it. But
that fire is our very source of life; even though it is covered, it is
through it that we are alive.</p><p>The moment it is really gone we are dead. That's why warmth is
symbolic of life and coldness symbolic of death. But people live only at
the minimum because their fire is covered, so only a little bit of it
reaches them, a very small fragment.</p><p>Scientists have discovered that people use only five per cent of
their potential in their whole life, ninety-five per cent of their
potential remains unused. Even the greatest geniuses like Albert
Einstein don't use more than fifteen per cent. Only Buddhas have used
one hundred per cent of their potential -- and then of course, their
life has a dance incomparable, a joy overflowing, inexhaustible. They
are not only blissful, they are a blessing to others.</p><p>This fire has to be discovered.</p><p>I have chosen orange as the colour for my sannyasins to remind them
of fire. So all shades of red...</p><p>because fire has all the shades of red.</p><p>There is the religion of Zarathustra. He was very much in love with
fire. But his followers have misunderstood him as everybody's followers
have always done -- that is the routine way. Zarathustra's followers
started worshipping fire; rather than finding the fire within they
started making temples of fire.</p><p>Now those followers exist only in India. Zarathustra was born in
Iran; the whole of Iran once was under his impact but Mohammedans
forcibly converted those simple people to Islam. Only a few could
escape, only a few thousand could escape from Iran. They landed in
Bombay, so now Bombay is the only place where the followers of
Zarathustra are living -- just one hundred thousand, not more than
that.</p><p>But what they are doing is strange: they have carried the original
fire from Iran and they are still maintaining it -- that fire has
remained continuous. Their temples are called 'agyaris', fire temples,
and their 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>whole effort is that the old ancient fire should not be in any way
lost -- it is their god.</p><p>So for twenty-four hours a day for three thousand years -- because
Zarathustra's</p><p>religion is three thousand years old -- they have gone on adding
fuel. For three thousand years they have carried the fire on and they
have kept it burning. The whole thing is useless.</p><p>The real thing is to discover the fire within. And it has been there
from eternity, so why bother about the fire outside? But that's always
happening: the master talks about the inner and the followers translate
it into the outer. In that translation everything gets lost.</p><p>My work here is to help you to discover your inner temple of fire. I
love Zarathustra, he has given a very significant message, and his
followers have been really simple, innocent people, very straight, not
cunning at all, very life- affirmative, very loving, intelligent, but
even then they have missed the point.</p><p>So remember it: the temple is not on the outside, <em>you</em> are
the temple and your life source is your fire.</p><p>And once you have found it you have found eternity. Then there is no
misery, no darkness, no death.</p><p>Svarupanand means bliss is your self-nature.</p><p>It is not something that happens to you; it is already the case. It
is that you are not there, present, you are somewhere else, dreaming of
other places, dreaming of the future, dreaming of the past and never in
the present, never herenow.</p><p>Withdraw yourself from the past and the future, withdraw all your
energies from everywhere and let them rest herenow, in this moment,
within yourself, just like a child in the womb of the mother. So become
a mother and let your whole energy rest in your womb and you will be
surprised; for the first time you will understand the meaning of what
Jesus says, 'The kingdom of god is within you.'</p><p>There is so much bliss that one cannot believe it. For the first time
one misses a few heartbeats -- it is such a shock that it has always
been within you and you have always been running somewhere else to find
it. And the whole ridiculousness of it: how can you find it anywhere
else if it is within you. There is no way to find it anywhere else.</p><p>So first there is a shock, one is stunned, one misses a few
heartbeats, then one sees the ridiculousness of one's life, effort,
investment and then laughter arises;</p><p>one laughs at oneself. That is the beginning of Buddhahood, when one
starts laughing at oneself.</p><p>It is easy to laugh at others, the ego enjoys it, but laughing at
oneself becomes the death of the ego.</p><p>It is said that after his enlightenment Bodhidharma laughed for seven
days continuously; he could not even sleep. His disciples and friends
would put him to bed and he would pop up again (laughter)... and start
laughing. They said 'Have you gone mad or what is the matter with you?'
And he said 'For the first time I have gone sane -- up to now I have
been mad -- that's why I am laughing. I cannot believe how it was
possible to miss for so long something that was so close by!'</p><p>Just a little understanding -- it is not a question of much effort
but only of a little understanding, a little alertness, watchfulness,
turning in and seeing -- and a totally new dimension opens its
doors.</p><p>Videhanand means the experience that you are not the body, is the
experience of bliss. The identity with the body, that 'I am the body' is
the root cause of our misery. So it is very simple arithmetic: if one
thinks oneself the body one will live in hell; if one becomes aware of
the fact that 'How can I be the body? -- I can watch my body, I can
watch my mind. Certainly I am separate from that which I can watch '</p><p>The observer is certainly different from the observed. The body is
there, the mind is there and you can see both, their functionings, their
activities. The body is ill but you are not ill. You can see that the
body is ill -- there is a headache -- you can watch it, you can see it
is there, and when it goes away you know it has gone; you are not it.
You are separate from all that happens in the body and the mind.</p><p>This is the beginning of bliss. The moment you are totally aware of
your separation from the body-mind complex your life is rooted in deep
bliss. It becomes so blissful, every moment is so infinitely sweet,
fragrant, that one cannot resist the idea of prayer; one has to thank
existence. It is impossible not to thank it, one has to feel gratitude,
because we have not earned it -- it is a gift. We don't deserve it; it
has simply been given to us for no reason at all. As far as we are
concerned we are not even worthy of it; hence the gratitude, hence
the</p><p>prayer.</p><p>There is no god as a person to listen to your prayers. Prayers do not
say anything about the existence of god; prayers only say something
about the gratitude of the man who has come to know bliss. It has some
reference to you and to your experience but it has no reference to god
at all; god does not come into it.</p><p>This is a simple process of non-identification. So from this moment
watch: 'I am not the body; I am not 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

all. And slowly slowly it becomes so deep --</p><p>rooted that it remains with you twenty-four hours a day. Even in deep
sleep a certain awareness remains like a flame burning in you, fully
alert, that the body is asleep, you are just the watcher.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #15</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

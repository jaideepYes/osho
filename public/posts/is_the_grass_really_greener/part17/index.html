It is a difficult task, but not impossible. And if one is alert from the very beginning one can save oneself from all that is imposed by others.\nOne should be courageous enough to live as individually as possible. It is better to commit mistakes rather than follow. somebody and not commit mistakes, because one learns through mistakes; one never learns by imitating anybody.\nNever be an imitator because imitators finally prove only to be carbon copies, and all carbon copies are dead and ugly. One has to be one's original self.\nBecoming a sannyasi at this age is significant. If you can protect yourself, if you can remain a little alert, courageous, then nobody can disfigure your original face. And that's the whole meaning of sannyas. The individual is the most\nprecious phenomenon, the individual cannot be sacrificed for the society, the individual is the goal, not the society.\nDeva Josef. Deva means divine. Josef means increasing faithfulness.\nThere are very few things which can be called divine; trust is one of them. Love, bliss, awareness, freedom, trust -- only these few things can be called divine. And trust is certainly the most fundamental of all, because it is needed in love, it is needed in awareness, it is needed in freedom, it is needed in bliss It is an essential ingredient of all that is divine.\nBut one thing has to be remembered: faithfulness does not mean belief, it means trust -- and these are totally different things. What the dictionaries say is wrong. The existential experience is the only decisive factor. Belief is of the head, borrowed; faith is of the heart, your own.\nThrough belief one becomes a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Jew; through faith one becomes simply religious. And to be religious is divine. To be Christian is worthless, to be Hindu is meaningless, to be Mohammed an is to degrade yourself, because all these are cults imposed by others on you. Maybe those others are your parents, your well-wishers -- that does not make any difference. Whenever you allow others to impose anything upon you they destroy you, even though their intentions are good. The results prove that even good intentions do not necessarily bring good results. And the ultimate criterion is the result, not the intention.\nFaith is a totally different phenomenon. It is trust, trust in existence, not in god. Belief is in god -- then there are many gods, each religion has its own image. Trust is in existence because we are born out of existence, we are part of it. Every moment we are breathing it in and out. We are not separate even for a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsingle second. Trusting this universe out of which we have arisen and into which one day we will disappear again is really trusting yourself, because you are an\nintrinsic part of existence; existence is your innermost core, your very being. Trusting in existence is trusting in yourself. And the person who trusts in himself and in existence starts growing, but his growth is individual. It is not according to others, not according to their expectations. He may frustrate others, in fact it is almost inevitable that he will.\nGautam the Buddha frustrated the Hindus; he was born a Hindu but he rejected the imposed religion. He started growing individually, he became a dropout from the society.\nJesus was born a Jew but he started having his own lifestyle. That's what angered people, annoyed them: they were not only frustrated, they were annoyed. The individual always irritates the crowd. The mind of the crowd says 'How can you dare to be an individual when we are not? When we are all just behaving like sheep, how can you behave like a lion. And of course, they are the majority, they have great numbers with them -- the tradition, the state, the church -- they can destroy the individual. But it is better to die as an individual rather than to live as a non-entity, rather than to live as a cog in the wheel -- that is not to live at all.\nSo trust yourself, trust totally and risk everything for it. This is what I call sannyas. It is not trusting in god, in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Gita, it is trusting in your own existence. And out of that grows all that is beautiful and graceful. Life becomes fragrant, it becomes a constant revolution. One goos on moving from one peak to another, and there is no end to this growth -- it is infinite!\nPrem Elisabeth. Prem means love. Elisabeth means consecrated to god, surrendered to god.\nGod is a code word. It does not mean anything because it is not an ordinary word, it is just a code word.\nHe should not write simply god, we should write g-o-d, then it will be right, because it consists of three symbols. It is an ancient symbol from the mystery schools.\nThere is a possibility that it came from a civilisation which has completely disappeared from the earth, the civilisation of Atlantis. The whole continent disappeared into the ocean; the Atlantic ocean is still hiding a whole continent within it It was one of the greatest catastrophes. Perhaps all the stories in all the\nreligions about the great flood have something to do with that catastrophe that happened to Atlantis: the whole continent simply went into the sea.\nBut a few things were saved. They were kept in one of the greatest libraries of the world in Alexandria, but Mohammedans destroyed it. Calipha Omar, who burned the library went with a torch in one hand and the Koran in the other, and he said to the librarian 'I have two questions to ask to you. The first is: You have millions of books in this library, very ancient books -- do they contain only that which is contained in the Koran?'\nAnd before the librarian could answer he himself said 'If they contain the same as the Koran then they are not needed. The second question: Do they contain something which is not contained in the Koran?'\nAgain he didn't wait for the answer but answered his question himself, saying 'If they contain something else than the Koran then they cannot be allowed to exist, because all that is true is in the Koran, neither less nor more -- Koran is all.'\nAnd he put the torch to the library, he started the fire. The library was so big, it is said in the records that it took six months for the fire to destroy the whole library. That library contained many scriptures from Atlantis; a few pieces may have even been taken away while the library was being burned. 'God' seems to be one of the code words that has travelled from Atlantis to us.\nG means that, o means which, d means is: -- that which is. That's the meaning of god. It does not mean an old man who created the world. Nobody ever created the world; the world has always been here. The universe is eternal, it is not a creation and god is not a creator. God simply means existence -- that which is\n-- and to be surrendered to existence is the ultimate peak of love.\nWhen the whole existence becomes your beloved -- the stars and the Milky Way and the sun and the moon and the clouds and the mountains, rivers, this whole, vast, multi-dimensional existence -- when you shower it with your love you start becoming bigger and bigger with it.\nRemember, the secret of expansion is to love something bigger than you. If you love something smaller than you, you will have to shrink; if you love something bigger than you, you expand. And when you love the whole universe you become unlimited, you become as vast as the universe itself. And that's what a\nreligious person should be: vast, containing all, excluding nothing, including everything that is.\nVeet Thomas. Veet means transcending, Thomas means a seeker of truth. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe very idea of seeking the truth has to be transcended; the very idea is basically wrong.\nLao Tzu says if you seek the truth you will not find it because truth is already in you. It has not to be sought; it is in the seeker himself. The idea of seeking means it is somewhere else: you are the seeker and the truth is out there, somewhere. And truth is really the very existence of the seeker himself. So when all seeking disappears and one simply sits, doing nothing, searching for nothing; when one simply relaxes into oneself, one simply rests into oneself, one finds it.\nSeek and you are sure to miss, don't seek and you are sure to find it. It is a very paradoxical law, but unless one understands it, one cannot be a meditator. The seekers of truth become philosophers and the people who drop all seeking and searching become mystics -- and only they are the people who come to know, only they are the people who experience.\nScience is a search, religion is not.\nAnand Nancy. Anand means bliss, Nancy means prayer.\nThe only true prayer -- and I emphasise the only true prayer -- is blissfulness. Nothing has to be said, no words are needed. The ready-made prayers of Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans are just rubbish, but one can become addicted to words, to just repeating again and again the same words, morning and evening. If you don't repeat them you miss them, you feel something is wrong because the mind has become programmed. And if you repeat them you don't gain anything; there is no ecstasy in it. How can the same words repeated\nagain and again -- your own words -- give you ecstasy? They can only give you boredom.\nThe so-called religious people are very boring people. The churches are full of the vibe of boredom, because so many bored people gathered together...\nIn a church the priest announced after the sermon, 'After fifteen minutes' break there will be a meeting of the board.' He was very much surprised because one man, a stranger, was there in the meeting, just sitting by his side. He told him 'This is a meeting of the board...' The man said 'That I know -- I have never been so bored in my whole life! That's why I am here. I heard your announcement, so I thought that if I have suffered so much, let me suffer a little more.'\nReligious people are boring because they themselves are bored. What they call prayer is not prayer, it is a monologue, they are talking to themselves. It is meaningless. It is not a dialogue, because there is no god as a person with whom you can have a dialogue. God is an experience, not a person.\nSo blissfulness has to be the only prayer. Be blissful, cheerful, dancing, celebrating. Life is such a great opportunity, we should not miss a single moment. And then you will by and by become aware, through your blissfulness, of a totally new presence that surrounds the whole existence. That presence is the ultimate bliss. And you can become aware of it only when you are blissful because only the same can know the same. When you start vibrating in the same rhythm you become aware of the ultimate bliss You can call it god but it is better to call it the ultimate bliss.\nIn your own small way be blissful so that you can resonate in the same beat as the whole universe is already resonating. The universe is a dance and we have to fall in step with it -- that's what prayer is.\nDhyan Barry. Dhyan means meditation. Barry is a Celtic mythological symbol. Literally it means a spear, but in Celtic mythology the spear represents the life- giving force. So your name will means meditation, the life-giving force.\nWe are alive but we don't know from where our life springs. We are breathing, we are conscious, we are living, but we are unaware of our own roots. Meditation is a search for the roots, for the very source of our being and existence.\nUnless we know that source we cannot know the goal, because the source is the goal too. We have to go back to where we started the journey, then only is the circle complete -- and the completion of the circle is the fulfillment of life. Hence the source has to be searched for. Without knowing the source nobody can know about the goal. Whatsoever goals we project without knowing the source are going to be only temporary. By the time you reach them you will have to invent new goals again.\nUnless you know the source you cannot know the ultimate goal. And the whole energy that we put into temporary goals is a sheer wastage. That's why life remains a misery, a hell; in knowing the source life becomes clear. Then you know where you have to go, then you know what has to be done, what path has to be taken, then you know what has to be avoided. Then you have a certain criterion to discriminate between the essential and the non-essential; then you don't get lost in the non-essential and you can go on following the essential. It is just a ray of light, but it is enough. In following it one comes back home.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe moment you enter your source again you have come home. And the feeling of coming home can only be described as rejoicing. That's why the people like Zarathustra, Buddha, Krishna, are so full of joys they have arrived, now there is nowhere to go. The journey is complete, the pilgrimage fulfilled. They have blossomed!\nMeditation is the only way to find the source because meditation is an inward Journey; it is digging for your own roots.\nBy becoming a sannyasin one is only expected to learn a simple discipline of meditativeness. So I don't give you many commandments but a single commandment; I call it the eleventh commandment! But that single one fulfils all ten -- the eleventh existed before all ten!\nPremsindhu means ocean of love.\nA sannyasin has not to put any limit to his love. To limit love is to kill it, to destroy it. Love can exist only in its unlimitedness. The moment you draw a boundary you have already started poisoning it. It may look like love but it will only be a corpse; it will not be alive any more.\nIt is like you see a bird on the wing, it is so beautiful in the clouds, or singing in the trees, so colourful, so musical, and then you catch hold of the bird and you put it in a golden cage. The cage is very precious and the bird looks the same, but it is not the same bird. The bird on the wing, in the clouds, had freedom; this bird is a prisoner. It is qualitatively different. Out of old habit it may still sing but its heart won't be in the song. It will be mechanical, like a gramophone record. It looks like the same bird but it only looks it --\nand don't be deceived by the appearance.\nThis is what we are continuously doing with loves we always make it a possessiveness, a jealousy, an ego trip, and immediately the freedom is lost, the song is lost, the heartbeat disappears. We can go on carrying the corpse but then it does not fulfil anything.\nLove can give you all that is needed to become absolutely contented, but then one has to be alert not to destroy it, not to limit it. That's the meaning of your name; let it become the meaning of your life too. Let your love be oceanic, unbounded, and you will find god through it.\nPremmadhu means love is as sweet as honey. But very few people ever come to know its sweetness; the majority comes to know only its bitterness.\nYes, in poetry it is always sweet, but in actual experience it is very bitter. And it is not only now that it is so, it has always been so. Thousands of monks and nuns have escaped from the world. They are not really escaping from the world -- 'world' is a very deceptive word -- they are escaping from love. They use the word 'world' to hide something else. They are escaping from love because all their love relationships have proven frustrating, failures; they have all turned into nightmares. Again and again they have experienced agony,\nThey expected ecstasy but sooner or later they become aware that they are expecting something which is not possible; then they escape from the world. They are really escaping from all the situations where love can arise; and they can be caught again, because in their dreams they still dream of its sweetness.\nBut my observation is that they are wrong. Rather than changing their idea of love, they escape from the opportunity of love.\nOne has to change the idea of love, then it is really sweet, it is pure nectar. If it is not then something is wrong with us, not with love. But this is one of the tricks of the ego, that it never wants to accept any responsibility; it always throws the responsibility on others, it always finds excuses and shrinks from taking responsibility.\nMy sannyasins have to learn to accept the responsibility. If love is bitter that means we have not learned the art of love. If I give you a sitar and you only make noise out of it that does not mean that the sitar is noisy; it only means you don't know how to play it. You have to learn.\nHumanity lives under a very strange illusion that everybody knows love. Nobody really knows love unless you learn. It is one of the greatest arts. Playing the sitar is nothing compared to playing on the mystery of love.\nMy sannyasins have to learn what love is and what love is not. And then they have to drop all that is not love, and this can be done only through medita-tion. Meditation can make you aware, can make you capable of discriminating, of dividing that which is valuable from all that is not valuable. Meditation can be said to be the science of purifying love. And by the time you have come to the purity of love it is just fragrance --\nfragrance of the beyond -- and it gives you a taste of eternity, of god, of truth, of life in its immense 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- splendour.\nPremvan means the jungle of love.\nLove is not a garden. A garden is man-made; it is artificial, arbitrary. Love is wild. It is because of so much civilisation that we have lost the knack of love; we\nhave become too civilised, too cultured, too cultivated, so our life is like an English garden, Victorian style (laughter). Everything is symmetrical and everything is pruned, cut, given shape and form. But the more you give it shape and form, the more you are destroying the reality.\nIn Japan they have the art of bonzai. It is not an art, it is pure murder. They have four-hundred -- year old trees just six inches tall. They think it is an art. They go on cutting the roots. They place the tree into a pot with no bottom and they go on pruning the roots. Because the roots cannot grow the tree goes on becoming old but it cannot grow; it ages but it cannot become big. So you can see from its texture that it is an ancient tree but a pygmy tree. It may have risen to one hundred feet, it is only six inches high -- and they call it an art! It is like cutting a child so he becomes old but is only six inches tall (laughter) ... with a white beard (more laughter)... And you call it art -- it is pure murder!\nBut bonzai is being practised on every child. All over the world, all the cultures have been doing something like bonzai. That's why love has disappeared, love can exist only in its wild state.\nMy sannyasins have to remain at least ninety-nine per cent wild. One per cent is enough for day-to-day work, your offices in the market (laughter). By the time you come home you should again become wild, a jungle, no more a garden -- certain not an English garden. If you want to become a garden then look around my garden, be something like my garden -- it is a jungle!\nMan has to learn something so that he can become a little uncivilised. It is good when you are in a Rotary club to be civilised -- I am not against it. In a Rotary club it is perfectly good to be false, pseudo, phony, otherwise you cannot be a member of the Rotary club. But by the time you are out of these clubs and the offices and the factories, be wild! Be a child again. Be a primitive again and you will be surprised how many wonders are there repressed within you and how many mysteries start opening up.\nMy whole effort here is to give you roots, to stop this whole art of practising bonzai on you. And everybody has practised on you, they have all cut you. Whenever I see a person I see he has been cut and pruned from everywhere; nothing of the real is left. Somehow he goes on living but his life is no more a joy, it cannot be. To be a joy it needs to be natural, spontaneous. And then you will see love growing in you to such dimensions that it is unbelievable. And the\nultimate peak of love is the realisation of god. God and love are synonymous to me.\nPremshanti means love and peace.\nIt is very difficult! It is like putting a cat and a dog in a room (laughter)... but I enjoy it! (much laughter) I create as many difficulties as possible because only through difficulties does one grow. So if the dog and the cat are in a room the encounter is going to happen, primal therapy is going to happen; all kinds of bizarre things are going to happen. But there is a possibility that they may fall in love, they may become friendly, they may start enjoying and sharing, they may start having a communion. And if it happens then something really beautiful has started.\nLove is easy if you don't ask for peace, because love is a kind of war -- the so- called love, I mean. The real love is certainly peaceful. But if peace suddenly comes, these who have not known real love will think love has died, because then the peace will look very cold to them; they have become accustomed to the heat of fighting, nagging, continuously quarrelling. That gives excitement, it feels as if one is alive. But without peace love is feverish, it is sick; and peace without love is also easy but then it is dead, it has no ecstasy in it. It is the peace of the cemetery, the grave -- white-washed. You can even plant roses on the grave, but a grave is a grave.\nPeace alone is a grave, love alone is insanity; both together and a magic happens: the grave becomes alive and the insanity disappears and the energy that was involved in being insane starts becoming ecstasy.\nIt starts having a new flavour, a new meaning, a new significance, a new dance, a new song.\nThis is my understanding, that both together make a man go to the ultimate heights. They are like two wings, with one wing you cannot go to the ultimate heights; you need both wing, functioning. When both wings are functioning you can reach the stars. But both wings are in a way opposite to each other.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>(To a twelve-year-old Indian child:) Puneet is a beautiful name; it
means pure, clean, clear, innocent.</p><p>That's how every child is born, but sooner or later the society
disturbs all purity, all cleanliness, all innocence; it corrupts
everybody.</p><p>The only significant thing is not to be corrupted, not to allow
anybody to corrupt you. It is a difficult task, but not impossible. And
if one is alert from the very beginning one can save oneself from all
that is imposed by others.</p><p>One should be courageous enough to live as individually as possible.
It is better to commit mistakes rather than follow. somebody and not
commit mistakes, because one learns through mistakes; one never learns
by imitating anybody.</p><p>Never be an imitator because imitators finally prove only to be
carbon copies, and all carbon copies are dead and ugly. One has to be
one's original self.</p><p>Becoming a sannyasi at this age is significant. If you can protect
yourself, if you can remain a little alert, courageous, then nobody can
disfigure your original face. And that's the whole meaning of sannyas.
The individual is the most</p><p>precious phenomenon, the individual cannot be sacrificed for the
society, the individual is the goal, not the society.</p><p>Deva Josef. Deva means divine. Josef means increasing
faithfulness.</p><p>There are very few things which can be called divine; trust is one of
them. Love, bliss, awareness, freedom, trust -- only these few things
can be called divine. And trust is certainly the most fundamental of
all, because it is needed in love, it is needed in awareness, it is
needed in freedom, it is needed in bliss It is an essential ingredient
of all that is divine.</p><p>But one thing has to be remembered: faithfulness does not mean
belief, it means trust -- and these are totally different things. What
the dictionaries say is wrong. The existential experience is the only
decisive factor. Belief is of the head, borrowed; faith is of the heart,
your own.</p><p>Through belief one becomes a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Jew;
through faith one becomes simply religious. And to be religious is
divine. To be Christian is worthless, to be Hindu is meaningless, to be
Mohammed an is to degrade yourself, because all these are cults imposed
by others on you. Maybe those others are your parents, your well-wishers
-- that does not make any difference. Whenever you allow others to
impose anything upon you they destroy you, even though their intentions
are good. The results prove that even good intentions do not necessarily
bring good results. And the ultimate criterion is the result, not the
intention.</p><p>Faith is a totally different phenomenon. It is trust, trust in
existence, not in god. Belief is in god -- then there are many gods,
each religion has its own image. Trust is in existence because we are
born out of existence, we are part of it. Every moment we are breathing
it in and out. We are not separate even for a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

into which one day we will disappear again is really trusting yourself,
because you are an</p><p>intrinsic part of existence; existence is your innermost core, your
very being. Trusting in existence is trusting in yourself. And the
person who trusts in himself and in existence starts growing, but his
growth is individual. It is not according to others, not according to
their expectations. He may frustrate others, in fact it is almost
inevitable that he will.</p><p>Gautam the Buddha frustrated the Hindus; he was born a Hindu but he
rejected the imposed religion. He started growing individually, he
became a dropout from the society.</p><p>Jesus was born a Jew but he started having his own lifestyle. That's
what angered people, annoyed them: they were not only frustrated, they
were annoyed. The individual always irritates the crowd. The mind of the
crowd says 'How can you dare to be an individual when we are not? When
we are all just behaving like sheep, how can you behave like a lion. And
of course, they <em>are</em> the majority, they have great numbers with
them -- the tradition, the state, the church -- they can destroy the
individual. But it is better to die as an individual rather than to live
as a non-entity, rather than to live as a cog in the wheel -- that is
not to live at all.</p><p>So trust yourself, trust totally and risk everything for it. This is
what I call sannyas. It is not trusting in god, in the Bible, in the
Koran, in the Gita, it is trusting in your own existence. And out of
that grows all that is beautiful and graceful. Life becomes fragrant, it
becomes a constant revolution. One goos on moving from one peak to
another, and there is no end to this growth -- it is infinite!</p><p>Prem Elisabeth. Prem means love. Elisabeth means consecrated to god,
surrendered to god.</p><p>God is a code word. It does not mean anything because it is not an
ordinary word, it is just a code word.</p><p>He should not write simply god, we should write g-o-d, then it will
be right, because it consists of three symbols. It is an ancient symbol
from the mystery schools.</p><p>There is a possibility that it came from a civilisation which has
completely disappeared from the earth, the civilisation of Atlantis. The
whole continent disappeared into the ocean; the Atlantic ocean is still
hiding a whole continent within it It was one of the greatest
catastrophes. Perhaps all the stories in all the</p><p>religions about the great flood have something to do with that
catastrophe that happened to Atlantis: the whole continent simply went
into the sea.</p><p>But a few things were saved. They were kept in one of the greatest
libraries of the world in Alexandria, but Mohammedans destroyed it.
Calipha Omar, who burned the library went with a torch in one hand and
the Koran in the other, and he said to the librarian 'I have two
questions to ask to you. The first is: You have millions of books in
this library, very ancient books -- do they contain only that which is
contained in the Koran?'</p><p>And before the librarian could answer he himself said 'If they
contain the same as the Koran then they are not needed. The second
question: Do they contain something which is not contained in the
Koran?'</p><p>Again he didn't wait for the answer but answered his question
himself, saying 'If they contain something else than the Koran then they
cannot be allowed to exist, because all that is true is in the Koran,
neither less nor more -- Koran is all.'</p><p>And he put the torch to the library, he started the fire. The library
was so big, it is said in the records that it took six months for the
fire to destroy the whole library. That library contained many
scriptures from Atlantis; a few pieces may have even been taken away
while the library was being burned. 'God' seems to be one of the code
words that has travelled from Atlantis to us.</p><p>G means that, o means which, d means is: -- that which is. That's the
meaning of god. It does not mean an old man who created the world.
Nobody ever created the world; the world has always been here. The
universe is eternal, it is not a creation and god is not a creator. God
simply means existence -- that which is</p><p>-- and to be surrendered to existence is the ultimate peak of
love.</p><p>When the whole existence becomes your beloved -- the stars and the
Milky Way and the sun and the moon and the clouds and the mountains,
rivers, this whole, vast, multi-dimensional existence -- when you shower
it with your love you start becoming bigger and bigger with it.</p><p>Remember, the secret of expansion is to love something bigger than
you. If you love something smaller than you, you will have to shrink; if
you love something bigger than you, you expand. And when you love the
whole universe you become unlimited, you become as vast as the universe
itself. And that's what a</p><p>religious person should be: vast, containing all, excluding nothing,
including everything that is.</p><p>Veet Thomas. Veet means transcending, Thomas means a seeker of truth.
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The very idea of seeking the truth has to be transcended; the
<em>very</em> idea is basically wrong.</p><p>Lao Tzu says if you seek the truth you will not find it because truth
is already in you. It has not to be sought; it is in the seeker himself.
The idea of seeking means it is somewhere else: you are the seeker and
the truth is out there, somewhere. And truth is really the very
existence of the seeker himself. So when all seeking disappears and one
simply sits, doing nothing, searching for nothing; when one simply
relaxes into oneself, one simply rests into oneself, one finds it.</p><p>Seek and you are sure to miss, don't seek and you are sure to find
it. It is a very paradoxical law, but unless one understands it, one
cannot be a meditator. The seekers of truth become philosophers and the
people who drop all seeking and searching become mystics -- and only
they are the people who come to know, only they are the people who
experience.</p><p>Science is a search, religion is not.</p><p>Anand Nancy. Anand means bliss, Nancy means prayer.</p><p>The only true prayer -- and I emphasise the <em>only</em> true prayer
-- is blissfulness. Nothing has to be said, no words are needed. The
ready-made prayers of Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans are just
rubbish, but one can become addicted to words, to just repeating again
and again the same words, morning and evening. If you don't repeat them
you miss them, you feel something is wrong because the mind has become
programmed. And if you repeat them you don't gain anything; there is no
ecstasy in it. How can the same words repeated</p><p>again and again -- your own words -- give you ecstasy? They can only
give you boredom.</p><p>The so-called religious people are very boring people. The churches
are full of the vibe of boredom, because so many bored people gathered
together...</p><p>In a church the priest announced after the sermon, 'After fifteen
minutes' break there will be a meeting of the board.' He was very much
surprised because one man, a stranger, was there in the meeting, just
sitting by his side. He told him 'This is a meeting of the board...' The
man said 'That I know -- I have never been so bored in my whole life!
That's why I am here. I heard your announcement, so I thought that if I
have suffered so much, let me suffer a little more.'</p><p>Religious people are boring because they themselves are bored. What
they call prayer is not prayer, it is a monologue, they are talking to
themselves. It is meaningless. It is not a dialogue, because there is no
god as a person with whom you can have a dialogue. God is an experience,
not a person.</p><p>So blissfulness has to be the only prayer. Be blissful, cheerful,
dancing, celebrating. Life is such a great opportunity, we should not
miss a single moment. And then you will by and by become aware, through
your blissfulness, of a totally new presence that surrounds the whole
existence. That presence is the ultimate bliss. And you can become aware
of it only when you are blissful because only the same can know the
same. When you start vibrating in the same rhythm you become aware of
the ultimate bliss You can call it god but it is better to call it the
ultimate bliss.</p><p>In your own small way be blissful so that you can resonate in the
same beat as the whole universe is already resonating. The universe is a
dance and we have to fall in step with it -- that's what prayer is.</p><p>Dhyan Barry. Dhyan means meditation. Barry is a Celtic mythological
symbol. Literally it means a spear, but in Celtic mythology the spear
represents the life- giving force. So your name will means meditation,
the life-giving force.</p><p>We are alive but we don't know from where our life springs. We are
breathing, we are conscious, we are living, but we are unaware of our
own roots. Meditation is a search for the roots, for the very source of
our being and existence.</p><p>Unless we know that source we cannot know the goal, because the
source is the goal too. We have to go back to where we started the
journey, then only is the circle complete -- and the completion of the
circle is the fulfillment of life. Hence the source has to be searched
for. Without knowing the source nobody can know about the goal.
Whatsoever goals we project without knowing the source are going to be
only temporary. By the time you reach them you will have to invent new
goals again.</p><p>Unless you know the source you cannot know the ultimate goal. And the
whole energy that we put into temporary goals is a sheer wastage. That's
why life remains a misery, a hell; in knowing the source life becomes
clear. Then you know where you have to go, then you know what has to be
done, what path has to be taken, then you know what has to be avoided.
Then you have a certain criterion to discriminate between the essential
and the non-essential; then you don't get lost in the non-essential and
you can go on following the essential. It is just a ray of light, but it
is enough. In following it one comes back home.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The moment you enter your source again you have come home. And the
feeling of coming home can only be described as rejoicing. That's why
the people like Zarathustra, Buddha, Krishna, are so full of joys they
have arrived, now there is nowhere to go. The journey is complete, the
pilgrimage fulfilled. They have blossomed!</p><p>Meditation is the only way to find the source because meditation is
an inward Journey; it is digging for your own roots.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin one is only expected to learn a simple
discipline of meditativeness. So I don't give you many commandments but
a single commandment; I call it the eleventh commandment! But that
single one fulfils all ten -- the eleventh existed before all ten!</p><p>Premsindhu means ocean of love.</p><p>A sannyasin has not to put any limit to his love. To limit love is to
kill it, to destroy it. Love can exist only in its unlimitedness. The
moment you draw a boundary you have already started poisoning it. It may
look like love but it will only be a corpse; it will not be alive any
more.</p><p>It is like you see a bird on the wing, it is so beautiful in the
clouds, or singing in the trees, so colourful, so musical, and then you
catch hold of the bird and you put it in a golden cage. The cage is very
precious and the bird looks the same, but it is not the same bird. The
bird on the wing, in the clouds, had freedom; this bird is a prisoner.
It is qualitatively different. Out of old habit it may still sing but
its heart won't be in the song. It will be mechanical, like a gramophone
record. It looks like the same bird but it only looks it --</p><p>and don't be deceived by the appearance.</p><p>This is what we are continuously doing with loves we always make it a
possessiveness, a jealousy, an ego trip, and immediately the freedom is
lost, the song is lost, the heartbeat disappears. We can go on carrying
the corpse but then it does not fulfil anything.</p><p>Love can give you all that is needed to become absolutely contented,
but then one has to be alert not to destroy it, not to limit it. That's
the meaning of your name; let it become the meaning of your life too.
Let your love be oceanic, unbounded, and you will find god through
it.</p><p>Premmadhu means love is as sweet as honey. But very few people ever
come to know its sweetness; the majority comes to know only its
bitterness.</p><p>Yes, in poetry it is always sweet, but in actual experience it is
very bitter. And it is not only now that it is so, it has always been
so. Thousands of monks and nuns have escaped from the world. They are
not really escaping from the world -- 'world' is a very deceptive word
-- they are escaping from love. They use the word 'world' to hide
something else. They are escaping from love because all their love
relationships have proven frustrating, failures; they have all turned
into nightmares. Again and again they have experienced agony,</p><p>They expected ecstasy but sooner or later they become aware that they
are expecting something which is not possible; then they escape from the
world. They are really escaping from all the situations where love can
arise; and they can be caught again, because in their dreams they still
dream of its sweetness.</p><p>But my observation is that they are wrong. Rather than changing their
idea of love, they escape from the opportunity of love.</p><p>One has to change the idea of love, then it is really sweet, it is
pure nectar. If it is not then something is wrong with us, not with
love. But this is one of the tricks of the ego, that it never wants to
accept any responsibility; it always throws the responsibility on
others, it always finds excuses and shrinks from taking
responsibility.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn to accept the responsibility. If love is
bitter that means we have not learned the art of love. If I give you a
sitar and you only make noise out of it that does not mean that the
sitar is noisy; it only means you don't know how to play it. You have to
learn.</p><p>Humanity lives under a very strange illusion that everybody knows
love. Nobody really knows love unless you learn. It is one of the
greatest arts. Playing the sitar is nothing compared to playing on the
mystery of love.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn what love is and what love is not. And
then they have to drop all that is not love, and this can be done only
through medita-tion. Meditation can make you aware, can make you capable
of discriminating, of dividing that which is valuable from all that is
not valuable. Meditation can be said to be the science of purifying
love. And by the time you have come to the purity of love it is just
fragrance --</p><p>fragrance of the beyond -- and it gives you a taste of eternity, of
god, of truth, of life in its immense 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

arbitrary. Love is wild. It is because of so much civilisation that we
have lost the knack of love; we</p><p>have become too civilised, too cultured, too cultivated, so our life
is like an English garden, Victorian style (laughter). Everything is
symmetrical and everything is pruned, cut, given shape and form. But the
more you give it shape and form, the more you are destroying the
reality.</p><p>In Japan they have the art of bonzai. It is not an art, it is pure
murder. They have four-hundred -- year old trees just six inches tall.
They think it is an art. They go on cutting the roots. They place the
tree into a pot with no bottom and they go on pruning the roots. Because
the roots cannot grow the tree goes on becoming old but it cannot grow;
it ages but it cannot become big. So you can see from its texture that
it is an ancient tree but a pygmy tree. It may have risen to one hundred
feet, it is only six inches high -- and they call it an art! It is like
cutting a child so he becomes old but is only six inches tall (laughter)
... with a white beard (more laughter)... And you call it art -- it is
pure murder!</p><p>But bonzai is being practised on every child. All over the world, all
the cultures have been doing something like bonzai. That's why love has
disappeared, love can exist only in its wild state.</p><p>My sannyasins have to remain at least ninety-nine per cent wild. One
per cent is enough for day-to-day work, your offices in the market
(laughter). By the time you come home you should again become wild, a
jungle, no more a garden -- certain not an English garden. If you want
to become a garden then look around my garden, be something like my
garden -- it is a jungle!</p><p>Man has to learn something so that he can become a little
uncivilised. It is good when you are in a Rotary club to be civilised --
I am not against it. In a Rotary club it is perfectly good to be false,
pseudo, phony, otherwise you cannot be a member of the Rotary club. But
by the time you are out of these clubs and the offices and the
factories, be wild! Be a child again. Be a primitive again and you will
be surprised how many wonders are there repressed within you and how
many mysteries start opening up.</p><p>My whole effort here is to give you roots, to stop this whole art of
practising bonzai on you. And everybody has practised on you, they have
all cut you. Whenever I see a person I see he has been cut and pruned
from everywhere; nothing of the real is left. Somehow he goes on living
but his life is no more a joy, it cannot be. To be a joy it needs to be
natural, spontaneous. And then you will see love growing in you to such
dimensions that it is unbelievable. And the</p><p>ultimate peak of love is the realisation of god. God and love are
synonymous to me.</p><p>Premshanti means love and peace.</p><p>It is very difficult! It is like putting a cat and a dog in a room
(laughter)... but I enjoy it! (much laughter) I create as many
difficulties as possible because only through difficulties does one
grow. So if the dog and the cat are in a room the encounter is going to
happen, primal therapy is going to happen; all kinds of bizarre things
are going to happen. But there is a possibility that they may fall in
love, they may become friendly, they may start enjoying and sharing,
they may start having a communion. And if it happens then something
really beautiful has started.</p><p>Love is easy if you don't ask for peace, because love is a kind of
war -- the so- called love, I mean. The real love is certainly peaceful.
But if peace suddenly comes, these who have not known real love will
think love has died, because then the peace will look very cold to them;
they have become accustomed to the heat of fighting, nagging,
continuously quarrelling. That gives excitement, it feels as if one is
alive. But without peace love is feverish, it is sick; and peace without
love is also easy but then it is dead, it has no ecstasy in it. It is
the peace of the cemetery, the grave -- white-washed. You can even plant
roses on the grave, but a grave is a grave.</p><p>Peace alone is a grave, love alone is insanity; both together and a
magic happens: the grave becomes alive and the insanity disappears and
the energy that was involved in being insane starts becoming
ecstasy.</p><p>It starts having a new flavour, a new meaning, a new significance, a
new dance, a new song.</p><p>This is my understanding, that both together make a man go to the
ultimate heights. They are like two wings, with one wing you cannot go
to the ultimate heights; you need both wing, functioning. When both
wings are functioning you can reach the stars. But both wings are in a
way opposite to each other. One goes towards the left, the other goes
towards the right -- they are contradictory in a way but complementary
too.</p><p>Peace and love are contradictory and complementary.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

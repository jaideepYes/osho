It is for reference purposes only.]\nShunyo Angelika. Shunyo means emptiness, nothingness, spaciousness, just a deep zero.\nThe ordinary connotation of emptiness is of negativity. People know only the negative kind of emptiness, but shunyo is a positive kind of negativeness. It is not that there is nothing; on the contrary,\n'nothing' has to be split into two words, then it is right. There is no thing, but there is space because there is no thing, no content. But the space is not negative, it is very pregnant. It is like a womb: warm, ready to give birth, available, spacious.\nAnd Angelika means a bringer of truth. Nothingness, in its positive sense, is the bringer of truth. In its negative sense it brings sadness, loneliness, fear, darkness, an urge to commit suicide. In its positive sense it brings light, truth, love, freedom and an immense ecstasy, an overwhelming ecstasy. Then it is not loneliness, it is pure aloneness. Then it is not solitariness, it is solitude. Then you are not in a sad state, depressed, you are overflowing with silence and joy. You are for the first time an individual -- and the birth of the individual is the beginning of truth. When the individual has grown up, is settled, truth has\nblossomed. And the blossoming of truth is the goal of life.\nMy sannyas is synonymous with life, it is not life-negative, it is life-affirmative. Satyam Gert. Satyam means the ultimate truth.\nThe ultimate truth is one, but there are relative truths and relative truths are many. A relative truth simply means a mixture of a lie and a truth.\nEven the most approximate truth contains something of a lie in it. Then truths can be many. You can mix your own lie into it and you can concoct your own truth. That's why there are so many religions in the world: these are all concoctions, fabrications. They all contain lies; something of truth certainly is there, but something of a lie is also there. And time passes by, as the religion becomes more and more established, as it goes farther and farther away from the original master, it contains less and less truth and more and more lies. Beyond a certain time limit it is one hundred percent lies, and truth simply disappears.\nGautam the Buddha said to his disciples that his truth would live only five hundred years. And he proved absolutely right, his prediction came true. Only up to five hundred years did a chain of enlightened people continue. The Buddha left many disciples enlightened, then those disciples left a few disciples enlightened. Of course, fewer and fewer people were enlightened, but even if there is a single individual enlightened it is enough to keep the truth alive. But the last enlightened person in the chain died after five hundred years; then the religion was in the hands of the priests. They are the sellers of lies and they are very skillful people, the most cunning in the world. Basically theirs is the most ancient profession in the world.\nPeople think that prostitution is the most ancient profession -- it is not, because without the priests, how can you create prostitutes? First the priest is needed to condemn sex, to force morality on people. When the morality is forced on them from outside they start finding ways in from the backdoor -- that's how prostitution comes in. Prostitution is preceded by the priests. Theirs is the ancient most profession, hence they are very skillful.\nOnce the enlightened master is no more there or the chain has disappeared, then the priest, who knows nothing of the truth, but who is capable of fabricating beautiful lies, is there.\nThere are three hundred religions on the earth and there is only one truth. These three hundred religions are different combinations of truths and lies. And all the religions are very old. Hinduism has existed for at least ten thousand years, Buddhism for twenty-five centuries, Christianity for twenty centuries, Judaism for 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthirty centuries, Jainism for fifty centuries -- so there are almost only lies left.\nSatyam means the ultimate truth, which you cannot find in the scriptures, you cannot find in the holy places, you cannot find through scholarship, knowledge; it can only be discovered within yourself.\nThe discovery needs two qualities in the seeker -- and these are the meanings of Gert. The first meaning is courage, the second meaning is a loyal heart.\nTo discover the truth one has to be courageous enough to drop all the lies that have been handed over to you by others. That needs courage because those lies give us comfort, consolation, they create a coziness around us; otherwise the world is vast and the space seems to be cold. Those lies are like blankets, warm blankets, and one feels good. Those lies are our wish-fulfillments. We desire how the world should be. They are our dreams. Those blankets are woven out of our dreams and wishes and desires and fantasies. So they feel cosy, they feel comfortable; they give consolation in difficult times, they give you rationalizations.\nOtherwise life becomes just a big question mark without any answers.\nCourage is needed to accept life as a question mark and to drop all the answers that have been given by others to you -- because they are not your answers. The question is yours, the answer has also to be yours. If the question is yours and the answers are of others, there is going to be no enlightenment in your life, because those questions and answers will never fit. Howsoever beautiful they are, they are not your discoveries. And truth has to be discovered through one's own efforts. It is already there inside you but courage is needed, courage to come\nout of the cosy lies.\nSecondly, you can come out, you can have this courage, only if you trust life, if you have a loyal heart.\nLies are in the mind and trust is of the heart. If you get out of the mind, then you get into the heart. Then for the first time your heart opens up and starts functioning. It has not functioned for centuries.\nPeople who have lived according to beliefs given by others, their hearts are non- functioning. They are full of beliefs but there is no trust in them. Trust is not a quality of the mind at all; it belongs to a different center in your being, it belongs to the heart. Trust is nothing but purified love. When one trusts life, existence, only then can one have enough courage to go into the dark, to seek the light, to go into the unknown, to seek the further shore.\nSo these two qualities -- a certain courage and a certain trust -- are the whole of religion. And then truth can be found, because it is not far away, it is just around the corner.\nPrem Zena. Prem means love. Zena means meditation.\nLove and meditation are like two wings. A bird cannot fly with one wing -- and for thousands of years man has tried to do exactly that. Either they have chosen love and ignored meditation or they have chosen meditation and rejected love.\nI can understand why it happened so, because the two wings of the bird are opposed to each other. One is on the right, the other is on the lefts one is a rightist, the other is a leftist -- they spread in diametrically opposite directions. The logical mind tries to be consistent, and this seems to be inconsistent. For the logical mind love and meditation seem to be opposites, contradictory. So the logical mind tries to choose one against the other. To choose both together is illogical -- and sannyas is illogical, because existence is paradoxical and unless you have the guts to be illogical you cannot experience existence.\nExistence consists of polar opposites -- day and night, summer and winter, life and death. Existence consists of polar opposites. They appear opposites to the logical mind; as far as existence is concerned they are complementaries, not opposites. Without day there would be no night and without life there would be no death and without death there would be no life. They are together.\nTo see it is the beginning of sannyas. Then you start having polar opposites without any trouble. One need not be consistent; if one tries to be consistent one will have only one wing and then there is no possibility of flying towards the ultimate peak -- it is impossible.\nSo I teach my people both together: be loving and be meditative. Of course in the beginning it is troublesome because love disturbs meditation and meditation requires that you forget all about others, that you forget all about love. So one has to become a little liquid, not so solid as people are; they are just solid blocks of concrete. One has to be more like water, easily flowing from one polarity to the other, finding no difficulty.\nSo when you are feeling to be alone, that is the moment to meditate. And everybody feels those moments when one wants to be alone -- those are the natural moments which are to be devoted to meditation. And then one feels to be together, to love, to share -- those are the moments to be devoted to love. There is no need to create any conflict.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOnce this harmony settles your life has tremendous beauty while loving you are totally loving, while being silent, you are totally silent. And both enhance each other, both help each other. They are not enemies, they are friends, because when you love you are becoming hungry for aloneness, because love is an excitement, an ecstasy -- it tires. One may not accept it but it is tiring, and moreso because we don't know how to relax, we don't know how to meditate.\nLovers start quarrelling for the simple reason that they are tired, irritated, exhausted, and they don't know what to do with this whole situation. And they certainly love each other, but there is nobody else so they start throwing anger, irritation, at each other; they start trying to make the other responsible.\nIf you meditate just the opposite happens after a time you are so full of energy, so refreshed, so overflowing, that there is a tremendous need to share. You are\njust like a cloud so full of rainwater that it wants to shower somewhere, it wants to unburden itself. Or like a flower which is ready for any breeze to come and take its fragrance away -- it is too full of it, it wants to share.\nMeditation creates energy and out of that energy sharing arises. One feels a tremendous need to share --\nand love is the only way to share. But when you are sharing soon you exhaust your sources, the energy starts becoming lower and lower and soon it touches the minimum point. After that point if you don't move into meditation you will move into fight.\nBut lovers don't give space to each other. Even to say to your lover that you want to be alone seems as if you are hurting him. He feels insulted, rejected. There seems to be no understanding at all in people. It is nothing to do with him, it is something inner to you, to your own inner process.\nSo people encroach on each other's space, they don't allow each other to be alone, they don't give time for each other to get refreshed. They are continuously at each other's neck -- and they think it is love! It is only up to a point, then it is really dangerous, poisonous.\nAnd to meditate beyond a point when you are overflowing becomes repressive; if you don't share you will have to repress your energy. So all your monks and nuns are repressive and all your worldly people are exhausted.\nJust now I was talking to Vivek about Champa, one of my mediums. Since she has been in love she has looked to me very tired, exhausted. She was never like that. She must really be in love! That's a clear-cut sign.\nLove exhausts and unless you balance the energy with meditation it is suicidal. And the same is true about meditation it fills you too much; if you don't share you will burst.\nSo they both have to be continuously balanced. Find energy in meditation and share it in love. Love will give you an appetite for meditation and meditation will give you a deep longing for love. And if one can move between these two easily one has learned the art of life.\nSatyo Sundram. Satyo means the truth. Sundram means the beautiful.\nTruth and beauty are two aspects of the same coin. Truth cannot be ugly, it is impossible; and the beautiful cannot be untrue -- that too is impossible. Hence one can find reality in two ways; either one seeks the truth or one seeks the beautiful.\nThe poet seeks the beautiful, the artist seeks the beautiful, the musician, the dancer -- they all seek the beautiful. They are really seeking truth but their vision of truth is that of beauty. The philosopher seeks the truth, the mystic seeks the truth, the scientist seeks the truth. They are also seeking the beautiful but their vision of beauty is that of truth.\nBut my effort here is to help you to become multi-dimensional, because the person who seeks the truth and finds it will remain a little dry because he will be following the path which goes through a desert. He will become dry, he will not be green, he will not blossom, he will be old and full of dust. He will arrive but something will be missed. And the person who has been following the path of beauty will be passing through beautiful gardens, he will be carrying some fragrance of the flowers with him, he himself will become a flower; he will be a dancer, a singer, a poet. But he will not be able to figure out what it is all about; he will remain vague, in a kind of mist. His vision will not be clear because he has not learned the art which the man who seeks truth knows.\nMy sannyasins have to be seekers of truth and at the same time seekers of beauty. They have to be scientific and poetic both; they have to be absolutely clear-cut and yet available to the mysterious. And I have found there is a way which goes just between the desert and the garden. So on one side you go on enjoying the garden, on the other side you go on enjoying the desert -- because the desert has its own beauty, its own silence, spaciousness, vastness. It has not to be missed. We have to find a way which passes 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\njust on the boundary, line of the desert and the garden. Where the desert and the garden meet, that is the place for my sannyasins to go to truth, to the ultimate.\nHence I am teaching meditation so that you can keep contact with the desert, and\nI am teaching love so that you can keep contact with the garden. And both together bring out your whole being to its total flowering. And when we can have both, why have one?\nI am always for richness. Jesus says blessed are the poor in spirit. I say blessed are the rich in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of god -- and this is the only way to be rich.\nShantibhadra means peace and nobleness. Shanti means peace, bhadra means nobleness.\nA peaceful person has a nobility which has nothing to do with birth. It is not the aristocracy of the outside, it is the aristocracy of the inner. And those who have found the source of grace and nobility within their own being are the real aristocrats. Once you have found it it starts surfacing in your acts, in your thoughts, in your feelings. It is natural; it remains hidden because we have ignored it. Ignoring your own inner treasures is what ignorance is.\nThe word 'ignorance' is beautiful; it simply means you are ignoring something, something which is very precious is being ignored; and the most precious thing that we can ignore is our own life juices.\nLife is just like a tree, it continuously needs juices to flow from the earth to the farthest branch, to all the leaves, to the flowers, to its whole being. The roots are deep in the earth and the branches are high in the heaven, but there is a connection, a bridge, between the two. The tree is really living in two dimensions, it is part of heaven and part of earth.\nWe are also trees in a sense. Our roots are invisible, that is true, but they are there. And meditation is nothing but the search for the roots. From where are we getting our life juices, our life energies, from where are we breathing, from where is our consciousness coming? There must be a centre in our being. And there is a centre. Once you have found that centre life becomes absolutely peaceful, a profound silence surrounds you. A peaceful golden aura is always present around you; not even for a single moment is the golden aura absent. And that is nobility, that is aristocracy of the inner.\nI teach my sannyasins to be emperors, less than that won't do. But to be an emperor no outside empire is needed; all that you need is a discovery of the kingdom of god that is already there within you. You have carried it all along but\nyou have been ignoring it; you have been looking outside and it is inside you. You are keeping it at your back.\nJust a turn, just a one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn and immediately life is transformed. Instantly you are transported into a new world, a new experience, of eternity, of infinity, of bliss, of benediction.\nPrem Arya. Prem means love. Arya means the noblest, the best, the highest.\nLove brings whatsoever is precious in you into manifestation, otherwise it remains dormant. Love makes it active, dynamic, otherwise it remains asleep. Love is a kind of awakening, and even in ordinary love affairs you can see it happening, when a woman falls in love suddenly she becomes more beautiful for no reason at all, for no visible reason at all. When a man falls in love his gestures start having a grace, his words start having a beauty, he walks in a different way. His lifestyle starts changing; he looks cleaner, fresher. Suddenly his life has become meaningful. That meaning gives him all these qualities -- and this is very ordinary love: unconscious, biological, mechanical.\nThe love I am talking about is the purest, without any lust, without any desire, not asking for anything. It is not addressed to the individual; it is unaddressed or addressed to the whole -- which means the same thing. It is addressed to the stars and to the trees and to the clouds and to people and to animals and to rocks\n-- it is addressed to the whole universe. It is simply an overflowing of joy which you would like to share with all, because it is so much it can be shared only with all; one person cannot contain it. It is a flood; it can drown the whole universe.\nEach person has so much possibility of love that he can drown the whole universe in it. And when that flood starts arising all your imprisoned splendour is released. It makes you an Arya -- the noblest, the best.\nAdolf Hitler chose the word 'aryan' -- it is a Sanskrit word -- for the Nordic German race, because he believed that it was the best, the highest race, which god had made specially to dominate the world.\nAll others were slaves, only the aryans -- and by aryans he meant the Nordic Germans -- were the people to rule. Hindus have called themselves aryans for centuries; he borrowed it from the Hindus -- they have called themselves the best.\nIn fact that is the disease of all the people of the world. Jews think they are the chosen people -- they 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nalso mean the same thing -- but no race is aryan. Yes, once in a while an individual has been an arya, but no race is aryan. It has nothing to do with race; it is an individual growth. It can happen anywhere. Anybody who comes to release his love totally, unconditionally, becomes an aryan becomes the noblest, the highest, the chosen! And certainly he is the chosen because then the whole universe showers all its joys on him.\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

sense, is the bringer of truth. In its negative sense it brings sadness,
loneliness, fear, darkness, an urge to commit suicide. In its positive
sense it brings light, truth, love, freedom and an immense ecstasy, an
overwhelming ecstasy. Then it is not loneliness, it is pure aloneness.
Then it is not solitariness, it is solitude. Then you are not in a sad
state, depressed, you are overflowing with silence and joy. You are for
the first time an individual -- and the birth of the individual is the
beginning of truth. When the individual has grown up, is settled, truth
has</p><p>blossomed. And the blossoming of truth is the goal of life.</p><p>My sannyas is synonymous with life, it is not life-negative, it is
life-affirmative. Satyam Gert. Satyam means the ultimate truth.</p><p>The ultimate truth is one, but there are relative truths and relative
truths are many. A relative truth simply means a mixture of a lie and a
truth.</p><p>Even the most approximate truth contains something of a lie in it.
Then truths can be many. You can mix your own lie into it and you can
concoct your own truth. That's why there are so many religions in the
world: these are all concoctions, fabrications. They all contain lies;
something of truth certainly is there, but something of a lie is also
there. And time passes by, as the religion becomes more and more
established, as it goes farther and farther away from the original
master, it contains less and less truth and more and more lies. Beyond a
certain time limit it is one hundred percent lies, and truth simply
disappears.</p><p>Gautam the Buddha said to his disciples that his truth would live
only five hundred years. And he proved absolutely right, his prediction
came true. Only up to five hundred years did a chain of enlightened
people continue. The Buddha left many disciples enlightened, then those
disciples left a few disciples enlightened. Of course, fewer and fewer
people were enlightened, but even if there is a single individual
enlightened it is enough to keep the truth alive. But the last
enlightened person in the chain died after five hundred years; then the
religion was in the hands of the priests. They are the sellers of lies
and they are very skillful people, the most cunning in the world.
Basically theirs is the most ancient profession in the world.</p><p>People think that prostitution is the most ancient profession -- it
is not, because without the priests, how can you create prostitutes?
First the priest is needed to condemn sex, to force morality on people.
When the morality is forced on them from outside they start finding ways
in from the backdoor -- that's how prostitution comes in. Prostitution
is preceded by the priests. Theirs is the ancient most profession, hence
they are very skillful.</p><p>Once the enlightened master is no more there or the chain has
disappeared, then the priest, who knows nothing of the truth, but who is
capable of fabricating beautiful lies, is there.</p><p>There are three hundred religions on the earth and there is only one
truth. These three hundred religions are different combinations of
truths and lies. And all the religions are very old. Hinduism has
existed for at least ten thousand years, Buddhism for twenty-five
centuries, Christianity for twenty centuries, Judaism for 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>thirty centuries, Jainism for fifty centuries -- so there are almost
only lies left.</p><p>Satyam means the ultimate truth, which you cannot find in the
scriptures, you cannot find in the holy places, you cannot find through
scholarship, knowledge; it can only be discovered within yourself.</p><p>The discovery needs two qualities in the seeker -- and these are the
meanings of Gert. The first meaning is courage, the second meaning is a
loyal heart.</p><p>To discover the truth one has to be courageous enough to drop all the
lies that have been handed over to you by others. That needs courage
because those lies give us comfort, consolation, they create a coziness
around us; otherwise the world is vast and the space seems to be cold.
Those lies are like blankets, warm blankets, and one feels good. Those
lies are our wish-fulfillments. <em>We</em> desire how the world should
be. They are our dreams. Those blankets are woven out of our dreams and
wishes and desires and fantasies. So they feel cosy, they feel
comfortable; they give consolation in difficult times, they give you
rationalizations.</p><p>Otherwise life becomes just a big question mark without any
answers.</p><p>Courage is needed to accept life as a question mark and to drop all
the answers that have been given by others to you -- because they are
not your answers. The question is yours, the answer has also to be
yours. If the question is yours and the answers are of others, there is
going to be no enlightenment in your life, because those questions and
answers will never fit. Howsoever beautiful they are, they are not your
discoveries. And truth has to be discovered through one's own efforts.
It is already there inside you but courage is needed, courage to
come</p><p>out of the cosy lies.</p><p>Secondly, you can come out, you can have this courage, only if you
trust life, if you have a loyal heart.</p><p>Lies are in the mind and trust is of the heart. If you get out of the
mind, then you get into the heart. Then for the first time your heart
opens up and starts functioning. It has not functioned for
centuries.</p><p>People who have lived according to beliefs given by others, their
hearts are non- functioning. They are full of beliefs but there is no
trust in them. Trust is not a quality of the mind at all; it belongs to
a different center in your being, it belongs to the heart. Trust is
nothing but purified love. When one trusts life, existence, only then
can one have enough courage to go into the dark, to seek the light, to
go into the unknown, to seek the further shore.</p><p>So these two qualities -- a certain courage and a certain trust --
are the whole of religion. And then truth <em>can</em> be found, because
it is not far away, it is just around the corner.</p><p>Prem Zena. Prem means love. Zena means meditation.</p><p>Love and meditation are like two wings. A bird cannot fly with one
wing -- and for thousands of years man has tried to do exactly that.
Either they have chosen love and ignored meditation or they have chosen
meditation and rejected love.</p><p>I can understand why it happened so, because the two wings of the
bird are opposed to each other. One is on the right, the other is on the
lefts one is a rightist, the other is a leftist -- they spread in
diametrically opposite directions. The logical mind tries to be
consistent, and this seems to be inconsistent. For the logical mind love
and meditation seem to be opposites, contradictory. So the logical mind
tries to choose one against the other. To choose both together is
illogical -- and sannyas <em>is</em> illogical, because existence is
paradoxical and unless you have the guts to be illogical you cannot
experience existence.</p><p>Existence consists of polar opposites -- day and night, summer and
winter, life and death. Existence consists of polar opposites. They
appear opposites to the logical mind; as far as existence is concerned
they are complementaries, not opposites. Without day there would be no
night and without life there would be no death and without death there
would be no life. They are together.</p><p>To see it is the beginning of sannyas. Then you start having polar
opposites without any trouble. One need not be consistent; if one tries
to be consistent one will have only one wing and then there is no
possibility of flying towards the ultimate peak -- it is impossible.</p><p>So I teach my people both together: be loving and be meditative. Of
course in the beginning it is troublesome because love disturbs
meditation and meditation requires that you forget all about others,
that you forget all about love. So one has to become a little liquid,
not so solid as people are; they are just solid blocks of concrete. One
has to be more like water, easily flowing from one polarity to the
other, finding no difficulty.</p><p>So when you are feeling to be alone, that is the moment to meditate.
And everybody feels those moments when one wants to be alone -- those
are the natural moments which are to be devoted to meditation. And then
one feels to be together, to love, to share -- those are the moments to
be devoted to love. There is no need to create any conflict.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Once this harmony settles your life has tremendous beauty while
loving you are totally loving, while being silent, you are totally
silent. And both enhance each other, both help each other. They are not
enemies, they are friends, because when you love you are becoming hungry
for aloneness, because love is an excitement, an ecstasy -- it tires.
One may not accept it but it is tiring, and moreso because we don't know
how to relax, we don't know how to meditate.</p><p>Lovers start quarrelling for the simple reason that they are tired,
irritated, exhausted, and they don't know what to do with this whole
situation. And they certainly love each other, but there is nobody else
so they start throwing anger, irritation, at each other; they start
trying to make the other responsible.</p><p>If you meditate just the opposite happens after a time you are so
full of energy, so refreshed, so overflowing, that there is a tremendous
need to share. You are</p><p>just like a cloud so full of rainwater that it wants to shower
somewhere, it wants to unburden itself. Or like a flower which is ready
for any breeze to come and take its fragrance away -- it is too full of
it, it wants to share.</p><p>Meditation creates energy and out of that energy sharing arises. One
feels a tremendous need to share --</p><p>and love is the only way to share. But when you are sharing soon you
exhaust your sources, the energy starts becoming lower and lower and
soon it touches the minimum point. After that point if you don't move
into meditation you will move into fight.</p><p>But lovers don't give space to each other. Even to say to your lover
that you want to be alone seems as if you are hurting him. He feels
insulted, rejected. There seems to be no understanding at all in people.
It is nothing to do with him, it is something inner to you, to your own
inner process.</p><p>So people encroach on each other's space, they don't allow each other
to be alone, they don't give time for each other to get refreshed. They
are continuously at each other's neck -- and they think it is love! It
is only up to a point, then it is really dangerous, poisonous.</p><p>And to meditate beyond a point when you are overflowing becomes
repressive; if you don't share you will have to repress your energy. So
all your monks and nuns are repressive and all your worldly people are
exhausted.</p><p>Just now I was talking to Vivek about Champa, one of my mediums.
Since she has been in love she has looked to me very tired, exhausted.
She was never like that. She must really be in love! That's a clear-cut
sign.</p><p>Love exhausts and unless you balance the energy with meditation it is
suicidal. And the same is true about meditation it fills you too much;
if you don't share you will burst.</p><p>So they both have to be continuously balanced. Find energy in
meditation and share it in love. Love will give you an appetite for
meditation and meditation will give you a deep longing for love. And if
one can move between these two easily one has learned the art of
life.</p><p>Satyo Sundram. Satyo means the truth. Sundram means the
beautiful.</p><p>Truth and beauty are two aspects of the same coin. Truth cannot be
ugly, it is impossible; and the beautiful cannot be untrue -- that too
is impossible. Hence one can find reality in two ways; either one seeks
the truth or one seeks the beautiful.</p><p>The poet seeks the beautiful, the artist seeks the beautiful, the
musician, the dancer -- they all seek the beautiful. They are really
seeking truth but their vision of truth is that of beauty. The
philosopher seeks the truth, the mystic seeks the truth, the scientist
seeks the truth. They are also seeking the beautiful but their vision of
beauty is that of truth.</p><p>But my effort here is to help you to become multi-dimensional,
because the person who seeks the truth and finds it will remain a little
dry because he will be following the path which goes through a desert.
He will become dry, he will not be green, he will not blossom, he will
be old and full of dust. He will arrive but something will be missed.
And the person who has been following the path of beauty will be passing
through beautiful gardens, he will be carrying some fragrance of the
flowers with him, he himself will become a flower; he will be a dancer,
a singer, a poet. But he will not be able to figure out what it is all
about; he will remain vague, in a kind of mist. His vision will not be
clear because he has not learned the art which the man who seeks truth
knows.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be seekers of truth and at the same time
seekers of beauty. They have to be scientific and poetic both; they have
to be absolutely clear-cut and yet available to the mysterious. And I
have found there is a way which goes just between the desert and the
garden. So on one side you go on enjoying the garden, on the other side
you go on enjoying the desert -- because the desert has its own beauty,
its own silence, spaciousness, vastness. It has not to be missed. We
have to find a way which passes 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

desert and the garden meet, that is the place for my sannyasins to go to
truth, to the ultimate.</p><p>Hence I am teaching meditation so that you can keep contact with the
desert, and</p><p>I am teaching love so that you can keep contact with the garden. And
both together bring out your whole being to its total flowering. And
when we can have both, why have one?</p><p>I am always for richness. Jesus says blessed are the poor in spirit.
I say blessed are the rich in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of god --
and this is the only way to be rich.</p><p>Shantibhadra means peace and nobleness. Shanti means peace, bhadra
means nobleness.</p><p>A peaceful person has a nobility which has nothing to do with birth.
It is not the aristocracy of the outside, it is the aristocracy of the
inner. And those who have found the source of grace and nobility within
their own being are the real aristocrats. Once you have found it it
starts surfacing in your acts, in your thoughts, in your feelings. It is
natural; it remains hidden because we have ignored it. Ignoring your own
inner treasures is what ignorance is.</p><p>The word 'ignorance' is beautiful; it simply means you are ignoring
something, something which is very precious is being ignored; and the
most precious thing that we can ignore is our own life juices.</p><p>Life is just like a tree, it continuously needs juices to flow from
the earth to the farthest branch, to all the leaves, to the flowers, to
its whole being. The roots are deep in the earth and the branches are
high in the heaven, but there is a connection, a bridge, between the
two. The tree is really living in two dimensions, it is part of heaven
and part of earth.</p><p>We are also trees in a sense. Our roots are invisible, that is true,
but they are there. And meditation is nothing but the search for the
roots. From where are we getting our life juices, our life energies,
from where are we breathing, from where is our consciousness coming?
There must be a centre in our being. And there <em>is</em> a centre.
Once you have found that centre life becomes absolutely peaceful, a
profound silence surrounds you. A peaceful golden aura is always present
around you; not even for a single moment is the golden aura absent. And
that is nobility, that is aristocracy of the inner.</p><p>I teach my sannyasins to be emperors, less than that won't do. But to
be an emperor no outside empire is needed; all that you need is a
discovery of the kingdom of god that is already there within you. You
have carried it all along but</p><p>you have been ignoring it; you have been looking outside and it is
inside you. You are keeping it at your back.</p><p>Just a turn, just a one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn and
immediately life is transformed. Instantly you are transported into a
new world, a new experience, of eternity, of infinity, of bliss, of
benediction.</p><p>Prem Arya. Prem means love. Arya means the noblest, the best, the
highest.</p><p>Love brings whatsoever is precious in you into manifestation,
otherwise it remains dormant. Love makes it active, dynamic, otherwise
it remains asleep. Love is a kind of awakening, and even in ordinary
love affairs you can see it happening, when a woman falls in love
suddenly she becomes more beautiful for no reason at all, for no visible
reason at all. When a man falls in love his gestures start having a
grace, his words start having a beauty, he walks in a different way. His
lifestyle starts changing; he looks cleaner, fresher. Suddenly his life
has become meaningful. That meaning gives him all these qualities -- and
this is very ordinary love: unconscious, biological, mechanical.</p><p>The love I am talking about is the purest, without any lust, without
any desire, not asking for anything. It is not addressed to the
individual; it is unaddressed or addressed to the whole -- which means
the same thing. It is addressed to the stars and to the trees and to the
clouds and to people and to animals and to rocks</p><p>-- it is addressed to the whole universe. It is simply an overflowing
of joy which you would like to share with all, because it is so much it
can be shared only with all; one person cannot contain it. It is a
flood; it can drown the whole universe.</p><p>Each person has so much possibility of love that he can drown the
whole universe in it. And when that flood starts arising all your
imprisoned splendour is released. It makes you an Arya -- the noblest,
the best.</p><p>Adolf Hitler chose the word 'aryan' -- it is a Sanskrit word -- for
the Nordic German race, because he believed that it was the best, the
highest race, which god had made specially to dominate the world.</p><p>All others were slaves, only the aryans -- and by aryans he meant the
Nordic Germans -- were the people to rule. Hindus have called themselves
aryans for centuries; he borrowed it from the Hindus -- they have called
themselves the best.</p><p>In fact that is the disease of all the people of the world. Jews
think they are the chosen people -- they 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

while an individual has been an arya, but no race is aryan. It has
nothing to do with race; it is an individual growth. It can happen
anywhere. Anybody who comes to release his love totally,
unconditionally, becomes an aryan becomes the noblest, the highest, the
chosen! And certainly he is the chosen because then the whole universe
showers all its joys on him.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #27</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

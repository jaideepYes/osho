It is for reference purposes only.]\nVeet Adam: Veet means transcending, surpassing, going beyond. Adam means earth because in the biblical story the first man was made of earth. It exactly means red earth because according to the story the earth of Israel out of which the first man was made, was red. Symbolically it represents the human being; man, a mortal, mortality.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has a beautiful statement; in defining man he says 'Man is the only animal that tries to surpass himself.' That's the most beautiful definition about man that has ever been uttered by anybody.\nThe dog is born a dog and remains a dog, the rose is born a rose and remains a rose. Except for man the whole existence is settled wherever it is, whatsoever it is. Only man is in a chaos, but that chaos is beautiful,:out of that chaos stars are born. It is only man who gives birth to a Christ, to a Buddha, to a Moses, to a Mohammed, to a Lao Tzu. It is out of this chaos that man tries to rise above, to go beyond.\nMan is not only the earth, he is far more, but ordinarily he is born as part of the earth although he 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncontains the whole sky within him. But that sky has to be found, discovered. And the only way to discover it is to go beyond the physical, the psychological -- because mind and body are not two separate things. We should not use 'and' between the two; we should not say 'mind and body'; instead 'mindbody' would be closer to the truth. The body is the outside of the mind, the mind is the inside of the body, but man is beyond both: man is consciousness.\nSo Adam only defines the actuality, but it does not define the potential, the possible -- and man contains infinities in himself. He can go on transcending himself; there is no limit to it. That's the whole dignity of man, the glory of man. That is his distinguishing mark: he is part of the earth but not just that; he is something plus. And that plus is his real reality, his authentic reality.\nSo your name means go beyond the mortal, the physical, the mental, seek and search for that which is beyond all this, that is eternal, immortal. The whole religious search is concerned with the eternal, the timeless, the deathless. And that's what initiation into sannyas is all about: looking beyond your actual. To remain confined to the actual is to remain a prisoner.\nUnless one reaches the ultimate peak of one's potential there is no contentment, no bliss, no god, no truth.\nDhyan Inge. Dhyan means meditation. Meditation is a method of slipping out of the mind in the same way as the snake slips out of its own skin.\nThe mind is nothing but old skin. The mind is always dead; it consists of the past, which is no more, The mind is a kind of cemetery -- graves and graves. And you can see rows of crosses on the graves; howsoever whitewashed, they only contain dead bodies, rotten bodies. Mind is a graveyard.\nAnd it is not coincidental that churches have graveyards behind them: they are part of the same game.\nThe churches are as dead as the graves, or maybe more. They don't represent\nlife.\nMind is always against life. It prevents you from living, it holds you back, it insists on the known, on the familiar. It always creates fear in you about the unknown, and the unknown is what life is; not only the unknown but the unknowable. And mind is a coward -- it clings to all that is known, well-known. That is why people are Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans and Jesus.\nJesus was not a Jew. Of course his mind must have been Jewish. He was not a (Christian either, he had not even heard about the word 'Christian'. He was not a Jew, he was not a Christian -- then who was he?\nThat state is meditation.\nBuddha was not a Hindu although his mind was Hindu. And he was not a Buddhist either. Hinduism was of the past, Buddhism was of the future, and Buddha lived in the present.\nTo live in the present, to be in the present, always alive, searching, enquiring, exploring, accepting the challenges of the unknown, is the whole of meditation.\nAnd Inge comes from Norse mythology. In Norse mythology Inge was the god of creativity, peace and prosperity. And all those things are just by-products of meditation.\nAn authentic meditator is bound to be creative because he will be constantly in touch with life. That touch with life gives him energy to create, a passion to create, because life is nothing but creativity. The alive person overflows with creativity.\nAll the so-called religious people are uncreative, for the simple reason that they don't live in the present, for the simple reason that they are afraid of being alive and they are trying in every possible way to avoid life, to by-pass it. It seems to be too risky to be alive; to be dead is very secure.\nCreativity needs a kind of gambler's mind, otherwise one goes on repeating the same pattern because one is more efficient in it. To be creative means to give birth to the new; of course one is not efficient with the new. How can one be efficient with the new? Only with the old can one be efficient. With the new you are always experimenting, exploring; one never knows what is going to come\nout of it. The new is unpredictable; there is no guarantee that you will succeed in creating something.\nMeditation releases all your energies of creativeness. Whatsoever one's dimension of work is, meditation brings great energy to it. It comes like a flood. It brings a kind of madness, a madness which is far superior to the so-called average sanity. All the great creators have been mad people -- poets, painters, sculptors, musicians, dancers -- they cannot be called average sane, otherwise they would be businessmen, they would be politicians, they would be priests. These things are secure, insured; there is no risk in them.\nThe sane person behaves in a businesslike way, calculatedly.\nWhen I say creators are mad I mean they behave like gamblers, like drunkards -- they can risk all for something which is not guaranteed. But they are the salt of the earth, these people; these few people are the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhole joy of the earth. They bring prosperity in every possible way, they raise the consciousness of humanity.\nThe whole evolution of man has depended on very few people; they can be counted on ones fingers. The masses have not contributed anything at all; they have been like a dead weight, they have hindered but they have not helped. The crowd mind is always against the new. They crucified Jesus simply because he was so new. The way he was talking nobody had ever talked, the war he was behaving nobody had ever behaved.\nThe mob could not tolerate the man -- such a beautiful man, such a lovely person\n-- and the masses decided to crucify him. But that has always been the case, they did the same with Socrates, with Mansoor.\nWhenever there is a man who brings the new into existence, who becomes a vehicle of the beyond, his life is in danger because the masses cannot forgive him. He is soaring so high that the masses feel offended, insulted; their egos are\nhurt. But the strange thing is that these few people who have been killed and murdered and tortured by the people are the cause of the whole prosperity of humanity; they are the foundation stones of this temple that is still incomplete. Many more sacrifices are needed, many more Jesus have to be crucified, many more Socrates have to be poisoned and killed.\nMeditation brings creativity and through creativity there is prosperity -- both material and spiritual. And a man who is creative becomes very peaceful, because he starts feeling that he is doing the work he is born for. He is fulfilling his nature, his longing, his hidden potential is becoming more and more manifest, actualised. When the whole potential is actualised a man is enlightened.\nThat is the goal of sannyas: to be creative, to be peaceful and to help the unwilling humanity to be prosperous in all possible ways, in all dimensions.\nAnand August: Anand means bliss.\nBliss is not pleasure; pleasure is physical, momentary. Bliss is not happiness either; happiness is psychological -- a little bit deeper than pleasure but only a little bit. Pleasure is just on the surface and happiness is skin deep, but just scratch the skin and it disappears. It has no real roots, it is just in the mind.\nBliss is neither of the body nor of the mind; hence it has infinite depth. It is your very soul, your self-nature, your being. Pleasure comes and goes, happiness happens and disappears. Bliss is forever! Even when we are not aware of it, it is there, present is an undercurrent; one just has to dig.\nAnd that's my whole work here, to help to dig a well within your being so that you can find the undercurrent of blissfulness.\nAugust means sacred, sublime, exalted. Bliss is sacred, sublime, exalted. It is divine, it is godly. To know bliss is to know god; in fact god is only a name for bliss.\nIn India we have defined god as satchidananda. Satchidananda consists of three basic words. 'Sat' -- sat means the truth; 'chid' -- chid means consciousness; and 'anand' -- anand means bliss. When you dig deep within yourself first you will find truth, then you will find consciousness and then you will find bliss. Bliss is the deepest -- and the deepest is also the highest.\nGod is only a name for bliss, god is not a person. The very idea of god as a person has misled humanity.\nIt is an experience, the experience which is beyond bodymind, the experience of that which is hidden in you and which has always been there. You need not create it; you need not search for it anywhere else, you just have to dive deep within yourself.\nSannyas means a turning in, it means exploring your interiority. I am not against the exterior -- the exterior is beautiful -- but if you don't know your interiority, if you don't know your inner world, your exterior cannot be very beautiful. It can have depth, beauty, joy, only if you are rooted within your of sources.\nIf a tree wants to reach high into the sky, wants to touch the stars and whisper with the clouds, then the first thing it has to do is to reach as deep into the earth with its roots, as deep as possible.\nThe deeper the roots, the higher the tree can rise. And the same is true about the internal and the external: the deeper the roots into the internal, the greater will be your approach into the external.\nIf your roots are really touching your source of bliss then your branches in the outside will have a flowering. In the past the religions have tried to create a split between the outside and the inside -- that was a reactionary attitude. Because they saw the people, the worldly people, too concerned with the outside, they turned to the opposite pole; they became too concerned, overly concerned, with the inner. But they created a split and that split has been one of the greatest calamities humanity has suffered so far, because that has created a schizophrenic humanity.\nThe outside and the inside look like enemies, the worldly person and the other- worldly person look like 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nenemies. The worldly is the sinner and the other -- worldly is the saint.\nMy sannyasin has to be both together: in the world and yet not of it, with roots in the inner and flowers in the outer. He hasn't to escape to the Himalayas, to the monasteries; he has to live in the marketplace and yet live silently, peacefully, lovingly, meditatively. That is the only way that we can create a whole man.\nAnd to me to be whole is to be holy. That is the meaning of your name: August: to be sacred.\nThe inner is not the only dimension of sacredness; the outer is also the same. But first certainly the roots have to grow, then the branches can follow. If the tree grows first it will fall down, it cannot stand.\nSo the sannyasin first has to become more and more meditative, more and more blissful, then naturally he starts growing new foliage on the outside, he becomes greener, he rises higher. And when the roots are nourished by the bliss inside, sooner or later the branches are bound t be burdened with flowers. That is the moment a person becomes a Buddha, a Christ, a Zarathustra.\nVimal means innocent, pure, literally without any dirt.\nThe only dirt that we are full of is thoughts. Our consciousness is like a mirror; thoughts are like just collecting on the mirror. And the work of a sannyasin is to continuously clean the mirror, because if tile mirror is clean it can reflect reality, if the mirror is clean it can show you the way. You need not depend on anybody else; you have your own inner vision, perspective, clarity.\nOnce we know the art of cleaning the mirror every moment, life becomes such a joy, such a benediction because then whatsoever you do then is beautiful, then whatsoever you touch becomes gold. One becomes a magician.\nMy sannyasins have to be magicians. And the greatest magic in life is to live in this world which is so full of misery, stupidity, mediocrity, in an intelligent way, blissfully, rejoicingly. The world may be living in hell but the intelligent person lives here, in paradise.\nThe people who invented a paradise somewhere above, in heaven, were stupid people. They were simply saying that it is impossible to live here in heaven so they projected a heaven somewhere beyond the clouds; it is just a consolation and nothing else.\nMy sannyasins have to live now and here in paradise. If others are living in hell, that is their decision, that is their responsibility. One cannot be forced to live in heaven,,one has to choose. And if people are choosing to live in hell, of course they are free to choose it, but my sannyasin have to live in heaven here and now, in this very world.\nUnless you can live here blissfully you cannot live anywhere else blissfully... because you will be the same person. Even if you are transported to heaven in a spaceship, what will you do there. You will do the same stupid things that you were doing here, maybe on a bigger scale. You will get into the same ego trips, into the same miseries, you will fall into the same kinds of love affairs and you will suffer in the same way.\nMy effort is to create a sannyasin who can live even in hell beautifully. The old definition was that when a saint dies he goes to heaven. My definition is: a person is a saint who lives in heaven whether dead or alive and even if you throw him into hell he will change the whole quality of hell.\nIf I have the choice then I will go to hell with all my sannyasins (laughter). It will be such a beautiful trip... and initiating all the devil, into sannyas and giving them beautiful names...!\nApantho means no path.\nThere is no path to truth because truth is not on the outside. Truth is within and no path is needed because you are already there; it is just that your eyes have wandered far away, that's all.\nIt is exactly like a dream. You are sleeping in your room but in your dream you are travelling to far-away planets. In the morning when you wake up you will not find yourself on the planet you have been dreaming about; you will find yourself in your bed, in your own room.\nWhen one becomes awakened to one's reality one finds that one was unnecessarily travelling, there was no need to go anywhere; and all those trips were mind trips, made of the same stuff dreams are made of.\nOne has never left one's home, one cannot leave in the very nature of things. So all that is needed is an awakening from your dreaming state -- and that's my purpose here: to give you shocks, to shake you, to fix many alarms around you.\nAll these meditation techniques and therapy groups are nothing but alarm methods to make so much trouble that you have to wake up and see what the matter is, what is going on. And once you wake up, the work is finished; then you cannot fall asleep and resume your old dreaming.\nThere is no path to truth because we are already there. We have not to reach there; we have just to wake up and see. Because it is so, it is simple, very simple. The moment you decide whole-heartedly to wake up, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnobody can prevent you. It can happen right now! Navyo means the eternally new.\nExistence is eternally new, it never gets old, but our minds get old. And because we go on clinging to our minds we lose contact with reality, we start lagging behind.\nWhen a child is born he is in tune with reality; he is not lagging behind, he is in the moment, herenow.\nBut we start teaching him and he has to learn whatsoever we teach because he is so helpless. He has to bargain with us, he has to sell his self for survival.\nNow psychologists have discovered that even a six-week-old baby starts being diplomatic. He smiles when he sees the mother coming. He knows that this woman is dangerous -- it is better to smile! This is a diplomatic smile; he does not mean it, he has nothing to smile for. But he knows that it pays to smile and it costs nothing, so he simply opens his mouth, Carter-style. It is just an exercise of the lips; there is no heart in it. He does not want to smile, there is no reason for it, but the mother feels good, and to make this woman feel good is safer.\nNow, he has started getting into the mind. Slowly slowly he will start lagging behind reality. By the time he is four, if he is a boy, or three if the child is a girl... Girls are more pragmatic and realistic, hence they got into the mind earlier, one\nyear earlier than boys. Boys are a little reluctant, resistant; they try hard to give a fight, to somehow escape. Girls, seeing the situation, settle quicker: 'It is better, no need to fight, it is unnecessary; sooner or later one has to settle, so why bother to postpone?'\nIt is because of this fact that when you try to remember your past you can remember only up to a certain age -- for example, three or four. Beyond that is blank because mind is perfectly settled at that time. From that time mind took over; it started managing you, it became the manager. Hence it has perfect records, files, everything, of after that time, so people can easily remember backwards to the age four or three. Then there is a blank because there is nothing to remember. They were in tune with reality, they were enjoying themselves, but there is nothing to remember.\nAfter one gets into the mind everything has to be remembered. Mind is just a biocomputer, a memory system. It goes on collecting information, and the more it collects, the older it is, and the older it is, the farther away you are from reality; hence the child is the closest and the old man is the farthest.\nA sannyasin has to learn the art of remaining a child for his whole life; not childish but childlike. Jesus says: Unless you are like small children you shall not enter into my kingdom of god. And I agree with him absolutely because the kingdom of god means the harmony with the universe -- and the universe is always new, and the mind is always old.\nGet out of the mind and be in tune with reality. Be more spontaneous, be more alive to the moment; live moment to moment. Go on dying to the past, go on getting rid of the past, so that you are always fresh -- as fresh as the dewdrops in the early morning sun, as fresh as the flowers just opening in the early morning sun.\nThat's the way of a sannyasin: to be always new, young. The body will get old -- that is not a problem at all -- but you should not get old. Even at the moment of death a sannyasin is a child, full of wonder and awe.\nThat quality of wonder and awe is the greatest religious quality in the world; it is through that that one comes to know what god is.\nNilamber means the blue sky.\nThe sky only looks blue, it has no colour. It looks blue because of its infinity; its infinite depth gives it an appearance of blueness. Hence blue has become the symbol of depth, of infinity, of eternity, of vastness.\nYou can see it happening in water too: if the river is shallow then the water is white, if the river is deep the same water becomes bluish; depth gives it the colour of blueness. So blue represents depth.\nAnd just as there is a sky outside you spreading to infinity there is also an inner sky. We are standing exactly in the middle of two skies, two infinities. And the inner is of course Is more beautiful because the inner is yours and the outer is not yours. Even if you try to have it, it cannot be yours. Alexander tried, all the conqueror tried, and they all failed.\nIn the outside you can only have a very temporary illusion that you are possessing it, but sooner or later death comes and takes all your possessions. But the inner cannot be stolen, the inner cannot be burned cannot be destroyed. Even death is impotent as far as the inner is concerned. The person who has conquered his inner sky dies as conqueror.\nAlexander the Great dies like a beggar; Gautam the Buddha dies like a conqueror, he is the real emperor.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAlthough on the outside Buddha was like a beggar with a begging bowl and Alexander the Great was the great conqueror of the then known world, those are appearances.\nDon't be deceived by appearances. Remember, the real victory is inner. And don't waste your time and energy in the non-essential. Put your energy as much as possible into the essential, and the essential means only one thing, it means the inner.\nSannyas means the beginning of an exploration of the inner sky. Nilam means sapphire, a blue diamond.\nIt represents the third eye. Two eyes are needed to look at the outside world, two, because the outside world consists of duality. It is always divided into two polarities -- day and night, hot and cold, summer and winter, birth and death. Everything is divided in two.\nThe outer world consists of two-ness. Everything is opposed by its polarity, hence there is constant conflict. And day is followed by night and pleasure is followed by pain and success is followed by failure and so on and so forth. One goes on moving in a wheel and nothing is stable.\nThe inner world needs only one eye -- that is called the third eye. It is not a physiological phenomenon, it is only symbolic. And when you experience that inner vision for the first time it is just like a sapphire, a blue diamond radiating its blueness, like a blue flame. In a literal sense too the first inner experience is of a blue flame. It gives light but light is so vast, so infinite that it appears blue.\nJesus has said when the two eyes become one then you have arrived home. The moment you turn in these two eyes become one, because the inner needs only one vision; just one eye is enough because there is no duality inside. In the inner world light and darkness are one, death and life are one. And because there is no duality there is no conflict; there is tremendous peace, silence, stillness, so profound that we cannot even imagine it from the outside.\nThat profound silence make you aware of the beauties, of the blessings, that existence has been showering on you but which you had not even seen before. These flowers were always falling like rain on you but you were engaged in other things. You were so full of other things you could not pay attention to them.\nWhen for the first time you are able to see the miracle of existence, great gratitude arises. That gratitude is prayer.\nMeditation makes you capable of seeing the grace of existence, the gifts, the infinite gifts, and that vision leads you towards prayer.

means earth because in the biblical story the first man was made of
earth. It exactly means red earth because according to the story the
earth of Israel out of which the first man was made, was red.
Symbolically it represents the human being; man, a mortal,
mortality.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has a beautiful statement; in defining man he
says 'Man is the only animal that tries to surpass himself.' That's the
most beautiful definition about man that has ever been uttered by
anybody.</p><p>The dog is born a dog and remains a dog, the rose is born a rose and
remains a rose. Except for man the whole existence is settled wherever
it is, whatsoever it is. Only man is in a chaos, but that chaos is
beautiful,:out of that chaos stars are born. It is only man who gives
birth to a Christ, to a Buddha, to a Moses, to a Mohammed, to a Lao Tzu.
It is out of this chaos that man tries to rise above, to go beyond.</p><p>Man is not only the earth, he is far more, but ordinarily he is born
as part of the earth although he 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

discovered. And the only way to discover it is to go beyond the
physical, the psychological -- because mind and body are not two
separate things. We should not use 'and' between the two; we should not
say 'mind and body'; instead 'mindbody' would be closer to the truth.
The body is the outside of the mind, the mind is the inside of the body,
but man is beyond both: man is consciousness.</p><p>So Adam only defines the actuality, but it does not define the
potential, the possible -- and man contains infinities in himself. He
can go on transcending himself; there is no limit to it. That's the
whole dignity of man, the glory of man. That is his distinguishing mark:
he is part of the earth but not just that; he is something plus. And
that plus is his real reality, his authentic reality.</p><p>So your name means go beyond the mortal, the physical, the mental,
seek and search for that which is beyond all this, that is eternal,
immortal. The whole religious search is concerned with the eternal, the
timeless, the deathless. And that's what initiation into sannyas is all
about: looking beyond your actual. To remain confined to the actual is
to remain a prisoner.</p><p>Unless one reaches the ultimate peak of one's potential there is no
contentment, no bliss, no god, no truth.</p><p>Dhyan Inge. Dhyan means meditation. Meditation is a method of
slipping out of the mind in the same way as the snake slips out of its
own skin.</p><p>The mind is nothing but old skin. The mind is always dead; it
consists of the past, which is no more, The mind is a kind of cemetery
-- graves and graves. And you can see rows of crosses on the graves;
howsoever whitewashed, they only contain dead bodies, rotten bodies.
Mind is a graveyard.</p><p>And it is not coincidental that churches have graveyards behind them:
they are part of the same game.</p><p>The churches are as dead as the graves, or maybe more. They don't
represent</p><p>life.</p><p>Mind is always against life. It prevents you from living, it holds
you back, it insists on the known, on the familiar. It always creates
fear in you about the unknown, and the unknown is what life is; not only
the unknown but the unknowable. And mind is a coward -- it clings to all
that is known, well-known. That is why people are Christians and Hindus
and Mohammedans and Jesus.</p><p>Jesus was not a Jew. Of course his mind must have been Jewish. He was
not a (Christian either, he had not even heard about the word
'Christian'. He was not a Jew, he was not a Christian -- then who was
he?</p><p>That state is meditation.</p><p>Buddha was not a Hindu although his mind was Hindu. And he was not a
Buddhist either. Hinduism was of the past, Buddhism was of the future,
and Buddha lived in the present.</p><p>To live in the present, to <em>be</em> in the present, always alive,
searching, enquiring, exploring, accepting the challenges of the
unknown, is the whole of meditation.</p><p>And Inge comes from Norse mythology. In Norse mythology Inge was the
god of creativity, peace and prosperity. And all those things are just
by-products of meditation.</p><p>An authentic meditator is bound to be creative because he will be
constantly in touch with life. That touch with life gives him energy to
create, a passion to create, because life is nothing but creativity. The
alive person overflows with creativity.</p><p>All the so-called religious people are uncreative, for the simple
reason that they don't live in the present, for the simple reason that
they are afraid of being alive and they are trying in every possible way
to avoid life, to by-pass it. It seems to be too risky to be alive; to
be dead is very secure.</p><p>Creativity needs a kind of gambler's mind, otherwise one goes on
repeating the same pattern because one is more efficient in it. To be
creative means to give birth to the new; of course one is not efficient
with the new. How can one be efficient with the new? Only with the old
can one be efficient. With the new you are always experimenting,
exploring; one never knows what is going to come</p><p>out of it. The new is unpredictable; there is no guarantee that you
will succeed in creating something.</p><p>Meditation releases all your energies of creativeness. Whatsoever
one's dimension of work is, meditation brings great energy to it. It
comes like a flood. It brings a kind of madness, a madness which is far
superior to the so-called average sanity. All the great creators have
been mad people -- poets, painters, sculptors, musicians, dancers --
they cannot be called average sane, otherwise they would be businessmen,
they would be politicians, they would be priests. These things are
secure, insured; there is no risk in them.</p><p>The sane person behaves in a businesslike way, calculatedly.</p><p>When I say creators are mad I mean they behave like gamblers, like
drunkards -- they can risk all for something which is not guaranteed.
But they are the salt of the earth, these people; these few people are

they raise the consciousness of humanity.</p><p>The whole evolution of man has depended on very few people; they can
be counted on ones fingers. The masses have not contributed anything at
all; they have been like a dead weight, they have hindered but they have
not helped. The crowd mind is always against the new. They crucified
Jesus simply because he was so new. The way he was talking nobody had
ever talked, the war he was behaving nobody had ever behaved.</p><p>The mob could not tolerate the man -- such a beautiful man, such a
lovely person</p><p>-- and the masses decided to crucify him. But that has always been
the case, they did the same with Socrates, with Mansoor.</p><p>Whenever there is a man who brings the new into existence, who
becomes a vehicle of the beyond, his life is in danger because the
masses cannot forgive him. He is soaring so high that the masses feel
offended, insulted; their egos are</p><p>hurt. But the strange thing is that these few people who have been
killed and murdered and tortured by the people are the cause of the
whole prosperity of humanity; they are the foundation stones of this
temple that is still incomplete. Many more sacrifices are needed, many
more Jesus have to be crucified, many more Socrates have to be poisoned
and killed.</p><p>Meditation brings creativity and through creativity there is
prosperity -- both material and spiritual. And a man who is creative
becomes very peaceful, because he starts feeling that he is doing the
work he is born for. He is fulfilling his nature, his longing, his
hidden potential is becoming more and more manifest, actualised. When
the whole potential is actualised a man is enlightened.</p><p>That is the goal of sannyas: to be creative, to be peaceful and to
help the unwilling humanity to be prosperous in all possible ways, in
all dimensions.</p><p>Anand August: Anand means bliss.</p><p>Bliss is not pleasure; pleasure is physical, momentary. Bliss is not
happiness either; happiness is psychological -- a little bit deeper than
pleasure but only a little bit. Pleasure is just on the surface and
happiness is skin deep, but just scratch the skin and it disappears. It
has no real roots, it is just in the mind.</p><p>Bliss is neither of the body nor of the mind; hence it has infinite
depth. It is your very soul, your self-nature, your being. Pleasure
comes and goes, happiness happens and disappears. Bliss is forever! Even
when we are not aware of it, it is there, present is an undercurrent;
one just has to dig.</p><p>And that's my whole work here, to help to dig a well within your
being so that you can find the undercurrent of blissfulness.</p><p>August means sacred, sublime, exalted. Bliss is sacred, sublime,
exalted. It is divine, it is godly. To know bliss is to know god; in
fact god is only a name for bliss.</p><p>In India we have defined god as satchidananda. Satchidananda consists
of three basic words. 'Sat' -- sat means the truth; 'chid' -- chid means
consciousness; and 'anand' -- anand means bliss. When you dig deep
within yourself first you will find truth, then you will find
consciousness and then you will find bliss. Bliss is the deepest -- and
the deepest is also the highest.</p><p>God is only a name for bliss, god is not a person. The very idea of
god as a person has misled humanity.</p><p>It is an experience, the experience which is beyond bodymind, the
experience of that which is hidden in you and which has always been
there. You need not create it; you need not search for it anywhere else,
you just have to dive deep within yourself.</p><p>Sannyas means a turning in, it means exploring your interiority. I am
not against the exterior -- the exterior is beautiful -- but if you
don't know your interiority, if you don't know your inner world, your
exterior cannot be very beautiful. It can have depth, beauty, joy, only
if you are rooted within your of sources.</p><p>If a tree wants to reach high into the sky, wants to touch the stars
and whisper with the clouds, then the first thing it has to do is to
reach as deep into the earth with its roots, as deep as possible.</p><p>The deeper the roots, the higher the tree can rise. And the same is
true about the internal and the external: the deeper the roots into the
internal, the greater will be your approach into the external.</p><p>If your roots are really touching your source of bliss then your
branches in the outside will have a flowering. In the past the religions
have tried to create a split between the outside and the inside -- that
was a reactionary attitude. Because they saw the people, the worldly
people, too concerned with the outside, they turned to the opposite
pole; they became too concerned, overly concerned, with the inner. But
they created a split and that split has been one of the greatest
calamities humanity has suffered so far, because that has created a
schizophrenic humanity.</p><p>The outside and the inside look like enemies, the worldly person and
the other- worldly person look like 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

saint.</p><p>My sannyasin has to be both together: in the world and yet not of it,
with roots in the inner and flowers in the outer. He hasn't to escape to
the Himalayas, to the monasteries; he has to live in the marketplace and
yet live silently, peacefully, lovingly, meditatively. That is the only
way that we can create a whole man.</p><p>And to me to be whole is to be holy. That is the meaning of your
name: August: to be sacred.</p><p>The inner is not the only dimension of sacredness; the outer is also
the same. But first certainly the roots have to grow, then the branches
can follow. If the tree grows first it will fall down, it cannot
stand.</p><p>So the sannyasin first has to become more and more meditative, more
and more blissful, then naturally he starts growing new foliage on the
outside, he becomes greener, he rises higher. And when the roots are
nourished by the bliss inside, sooner or later the branches are bound t
be burdened with flowers. That is the moment a person becomes a Buddha,
a Christ, a Zarathustra.</p><p>Vimal means innocent, pure, literally without any dirt.</p><p>The only dirt that we are full of is thoughts. Our consciousness is
like a mirror; thoughts are like just collecting on the mirror. And the
work of a sannyasin is to continuously clean the mirror, because if tile
mirror is clean it can reflect reality, if the mirror is clean it can
show you the way. You need not depend on anybody else; you have your own
inner vision, perspective, clarity.</p><p>Once we know the art of cleaning the mirror every moment, life
becomes such a joy, such a benediction because then whatsoever you do
then is beautiful, then whatsoever you touch becomes gold. One becomes a
magician.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be magicians. And the greatest magic in life is
to live in this world which is so full of misery, stupidity, mediocrity,
in an intelligent way, blissfully, rejoicingly. The world may be living
in hell but the intelligent person lives here, in paradise.</p><p>The people who invented a paradise somewhere above, in heaven, were
stupid people. They were simply saying that it is impossible to live
<em>here</em> in heaven so they projected a heaven somewhere beyond the
clouds; it is just a consolation and nothing else.</p><p>My sannyasins have to live now and here in paradise. If others are
living in hell, that is their decision, that is their responsibility.
One cannot be forced to live in heaven,,one has to choose. And if people
are choosing to live in hell, of course they are free to choose it, but
my sannyasin have to live in heaven here and now, in <em>this</em> very
world.</p><p>Unless you can live here blissfully you cannot live anywhere else
blissfully... because you will be the same person. Even if you are
transported to heaven in a spaceship, what will you do there. You will
do the same stupid things that you were doing here, maybe on a bigger
scale. You will get into the same ego trips, into the same miseries, you
will fall into the same kinds of love affairs and you will suffer in the
same way.</p><p>My effort is to create a sannyasin who can live even in hell
beautifully. The old definition was that when a saint dies he goes to
heaven. My definition is: a person is a saint who lives in heaven
whether dead or alive and even if you throw him into hell he will change
the whole quality of hell.</p><p>If I have the choice then I will go to hell with all my sannyasins
(laughter). It will be such a beautiful trip... and initiating all the
devil, into sannyas and giving them beautiful names...!</p><p>Apantho means no path.</p><p>There is no path to truth because truth is not on the outside. Truth
is within and no path is needed because you are already there; it is
just that your eyes have wandered far away, that's all.</p><p>It is exactly like a dream. You are sleeping in your room but in your
dream you are travelling to far-away planets. In the morning when you
wake up you will not find yourself on the planet you have been dreaming
about; you will find yourself in your bed, in your own room.</p><p>When one becomes awakened to one's reality one finds that one was
unnecessarily travelling, there was no need to go anywhere; and all
those trips were mind trips, made of the same stuff dreams are made
of.</p><p>One has never left one's home, one cannot leave in the very nature of
things. So all that is needed is an awakening from your dreaming state
-- and that's my purpose here: to give you shocks, to shake you, to fix
many alarms around you.</p><p>All these meditation techniques and therapy groups are nothing but
alarm methods to make so much trouble that you have to wake up and see
what the matter is, what is going on. And once you wake up, the work is
finished; then you cannot fall asleep and resume your old dreaming.</p><p>There is no path to truth because we are already there. We have not
to reach there; we have just to wake up and see. Because it is so, it is
simple, very simple. The moment you decide whole-heartedly to wake up,

eternally new.</p><p>Existence is eternally new, it never gets old, but our minds get old.
And because we go on clinging to our minds we lose contact with reality,
we start lagging behind.</p><p>When a child is born he is in tune with reality; he is not lagging
behind, he is in the moment, herenow.</p><p>But we start teaching him and he has to learn whatsoever we teach
because he is so helpless. He has to bargain with us, he has to sell his
self for survival.</p><p>Now psychologists have discovered that even a six-week-old baby
starts being diplomatic. He smiles when he sees the mother coming. He
knows that this woman is dangerous -- it is better to smile! This is a
diplomatic smile; he does not mean it, he has nothing to smile for. But
he knows that it pays to smile and it costs nothing, so he simply opens
his mouth, Carter-style. It is just an exercise of the lips; there is no
heart in it. He does not want to smile, there is no reason for it, but
the mother feels good, and to make this woman feel good is safer.</p><p>Now, he has started getting into the mind. Slowly slowly he will
start lagging behind reality. By the time he is four, if he is a boy, or
three if the child is a girl... Girls are more pragmatic and realistic,
hence they got into the mind earlier, one</p><p>year earlier than boys. Boys are a little reluctant, resistant; they
try hard to give a fight, to somehow escape. Girls, seeing the
situation, settle quicker: 'It is better, no need to fight, it is
unnecessary; sooner or later one has to settle, so why bother to
postpone?'</p><p>It is because of this fact that when you try to remember your past
you can remember only up to a certain age -- for example, three or four.
Beyond that is blank because mind is perfectly settled at that time.
From that time mind took over; it started managing you, it became the
manager. Hence it has perfect records, files, everything, of after that
time, so people can easily remember backwards to the age four or three.
Then there is a blank because there is nothing to remember. They were in
tune with reality, they were enjoying themselves, but there is nothing
to remember.</p><p>After one gets into the mind everything has to be remembered. Mind is
just a biocomputer, a memory system. It goes on collecting information,
and the more it collects, the older it is, and the older it is, the
farther away you are from reality; hence the child is the closest and
the old man is the farthest.</p><p>A sannyasin has to learn the art of remaining a child for his whole
life; not childish but childlike. Jesus says: Unless you are like small
children you shall not enter into my kingdom of god. And I agree with
him absolutely because the kingdom of god means the harmony with the
universe -- and the universe is always new, and the mind is always
old.</p><p>Get out of the mind and be in tune with reality. Be more spontaneous,
be more alive to the moment; live moment to moment. Go on dying to the
past, go on getting rid of the past, so that you are always fresh -- as
fresh as the dewdrops in the early morning sun, as fresh as the flowers
just opening in the early morning sun.</p><p>That's the way of a sannyasin: to be always new, young. The body will
get old -- that is not a problem at all -- but you should not get old.
Even at the moment of death a sannyasin is a child, full of wonder and
awe.</p><p>That quality of wonder and awe is the greatest religious quality in
the world; it is through that that one comes to know what god is.</p><p>Nilamber means the blue sky.</p><p>The sky only looks blue, it has no colour. It looks blue because of
its infinity; its infinite depth gives it an appearance of blueness.
Hence blue has become the symbol of depth, of infinity, of eternity, of
vastness.</p><p>You can see it happening in water too: if the river is shallow then
the water is white, if the river is deep the same water becomes bluish;
depth gives it the colour of blueness. So blue represents depth.</p><p>And just as there is a sky outside you spreading to infinity there is
also an inner sky. We are standing exactly in the middle of two skies,
two infinities. And the inner is of course Is more beautiful because the
inner is yours and the outer is not yours. Even if you try to have it,
it cannot be yours. Alexander tried, all the conqueror tried, and they
all failed.</p><p>In the outside you can only have a very temporary illusion that you
are possessing it, but sooner or later death comes and takes all your
possessions. But the inner cannot be stolen, the inner cannot be burned
cannot be destroyed. Even death is impotent as far as the inner is
concerned. The person who has conquered his inner sky dies as
conqueror.</p><p>Alexander the Great dies like a beggar; Gautam the Buddha dies like a
conqueror, he is the real emperor.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Although on the outside Buddha was like a beggar with a begging bowl
and Alexander the Great was the great conqueror of the then known world,
those are appearances.</p><p>Don't be deceived by appearances. Remember, the real victory is
inner. And don't waste your time and energy in the non-essential. Put
your energy as much as possible into the essential, and the essential
means only one thing, it means the inner.</p><p>Sannyas means the beginning of an exploration of the inner sky. Nilam
means sapphire, a blue diamond.</p><p>It represents the third eye. Two eyes are needed to look at the
outside world, two, because the outside world consists of duality. It is
always divided into two polarities -- day and night, hot and cold,
summer and winter, birth and death. Everything is divided in two.</p><p>The outer world consists of two-ness. Everything is opposed by its
polarity, hence there is constant conflict. And day is followed by night
and pleasure is followed by pain and success is followed by failure and
so on and so forth. One goes on moving in a wheel and nothing is
stable.</p><p>The inner world needs only one eye -- that is called the third eye.
It is not a physiological phenomenon, it is only symbolic. And when you
experience that inner vision for the first time it is just like a
sapphire, a blue diamond radiating its blueness, like a blue flame. In a
literal sense too the first inner experience is of a blue flame. It
gives light but light is so vast, so infinite that it appears blue.</p><p>Jesus has said when the two eyes become one then you have arrived
home. The moment you turn in these two eyes become one, because the
inner needs only one vision; just one eye is enough because there is no
duality inside. In the inner world light and darkness are one, death and
life are one. And because there is no duality there is no conflict;
there is tremendous peace, silence, stillness, so profound that we
cannot even imagine it from the outside.</p><p>That profound silence make you aware of the beauties, of the
blessings, that existence has been showering on you but which you had
not even seen before. These flowers were always falling like rain on you
but you were engaged in other things. You were so full of other things
you could not pay attention to them.</p><p>When for the first time you are able to see the miracle of existence,
great gratitude arises. That gratitude is prayer.</p><p>Meditation makes you capable of seeing the grace of existence, the
gifts, the infinite gifts, and that vision leads you towards prayer.
Meditation is the beginning, prayer is the end. Meditation is the flower
and prayer is the fragrance. Nobody can begin with prayer; you have to
begin with meditation. Prayer comes</p><p>of its own accord.</p><p>Sow the seeds, grow the flowers and one day spring comes and the
flowers blossom and the whole sky is full of fragrance.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=is-the-grass-really-greener...>Is the Grass Really Greener...?</h3><p>Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

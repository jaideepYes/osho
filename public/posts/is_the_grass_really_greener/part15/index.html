It is for reference purposes only.]\nDeva Heribert. Deva means divine. Heribert means glorious.\nMan is unaware of his glory, of his splendor. He lives in absolute ignorance of himself; that's why there is so much misery, anxiety, anguish. Not knowing oneself means whatsoever you do will be amiss. You may be doing something good, at least your intention may be good, but the result will not be good. Out of an unconscious being, there is no possibility of any good arising, no virtue is possible, no flowering is possible.\nThe first and the most important thing in life is to become aware of one's being. The moment you turn in you become aware -- it is a simple as that. We are focussed on the outside; we have to relax our focussing on the outside, we have to make our muscles a little flexible so we can look in. That's what sannyas is all about: a turning in.\nAnd once you have seen your own inner world you have seen all that is worth seeing, the most glorious, splendrous phenomenon. And after that whatsoever you do is right. Each act becomes virtuous and each act has a beauty, sensitivity, grace. Then life is a dance, a celebration.\nAnand Edgar. Anand means bliss. Edgar means rich.\nA man can possess the whole world and yet can remain poor, a beggar. And vice versa is also trues a man may not possess anything and yet be immensely rich. Richness has something to do with inner exploration; it is not an achievement in the outside world. It is neither money nor power nor prestige nor respectability; it is bliss, and bliss rises out of your own being. There is no other way to find it, no other place to find it.\nOne has to learn to dive within one's own depths. It is there where the source of bliss is and all that is needed is a courageous heart -- that is the other meaning of Edgar, a courageous heart.\nThe mind is a coward because it is always calculating, The mind is always thinking in terms of getting more, risking less, of putting in less and taking out more. It is always bargaining, it is businesslike. The heart is a gambler -- and the inner world opens only to the gamblers.\nOne has to be courageous enough to risk all for it. If you cannot risk, you cannot take the jump into the unknown, you will remain tethered to the known, you will go on clinging to the known. Although you know it is misery and nothing else, at least there is one consolation, that you are familiar with it.\nCourage means dropping the familiar, if it is giving your misery, for the unknown. Of course you cannot decide what is going to happen through the unknown; that's the risk. You may fall into greater misery or you may achieve to bliss -- it is unpredictable, that's why I say it is only for the gambler.\nSannyas is a gamble, meditation is a gamble; religion is nothing but gambling. And all the religions are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nagainst gambling for the simple reason that religion itself is the ultimate gamble. Don't waste your gambling energy anywhere else -- that's why they are against it, so that you can gather your courage into one pool.\nAnd you will need it for the jump is big It is not only a jump with a calculated step; you are jumping into an abyss. But those who have jumped have always found bliss, without any exception.\nThat's the purpose of the master: to encourage you, to seduce you into the unknown. The master is a salesman for the unknown.\nSo get ready for the jump.\nSannyas is only a gesture from your side that you are willing -- and if you are willing, I am willing too!\nDhyan Michael. Dhyan means meditation. Michael means godly.\nThe only thing that can become a proof for god is meditation. No other argument can help, no other proof is possible.\nPhilosophers have been giving many proofs, but all those proofs are just stupid. If you look a little bit deeply into them you will find that their basic assumption is ungrounded. They themselves need proof, they are not self-evident. For example, the greatest proof that the philosophers have been giving all over the world is that everything needs a creator and if this immense universe exists then it must have a creator. It looks logical but only on the surface; just scratch the surface and a new problem will arises who created the creator?\nIf everything needs a creator then according to the same law the creator will have to be created by somebody. And the argument seems stupid, idiotic, because if this god needs another god, then this other god will need still another god; and you will fall into an infinite regress. Ultimately you will come to a point where you will have to say that this is not created by anybody. But then the whole argument is lost. That was the very first assumption, that everything needs a creator.\nThere is no self-evident proof for god, not through logic -- but yes there is a way to experience. It is not intellectual, it is existential. Meditation is an existential way to experience god and all that is godly. And meditation is a simple process of becoming silent, utterly silent. When the mind has lost all its nonsense and noise, when the mind traffic is nil, when the mind has stopped completely, has come to a standstill, suddenly in that silence you experience a presence that has always been there within and without, but of which you were not aware because\nthe mind was too noisy; it was impossible to hear the still, small voice.\nAnd once you have heard it your life is transformed. Then for the first time you know the taste of religion.\nAnd the taste of religion is the taste of neither Christianity nor Hinduism nor of Judaism nor of Mohammedanism; the taste of religion is simply the taste of religiousness. It has nothing to do with all those cults and sects and dogmas and churches, synagogues, temples, mosques -- it has nothing to do with these.\nThis is sheer politics played in the name of religion.\nWhen you have experienced just a dewdrop of true religiousness through silence, you don't belong to any religion, although for the first time you are religious.\nI teach a religionless religiousness -- and that is the need of today and of all the tomorrows that are going to follow. The old kind of religion is outdated; its time is finished, in fact it has been living a posthumous kind of existence for centuries. It is dead already, we are only carrying a corpse and it is stinking.\nMeditation is the only way to experience god, to experience religion. You cannot get it from the Bible, from the Gita, from the Koran, from the Talmud -- no words, no scriptures can give it to you. Only silence is able to receive god, is able to become pregnant with god. And that is the greatest ecstasy in life -- to be pregnant with god, to carry god in your very belly, in your very heartbeat, in your breathing, to feel him everywhere, in everybody!\nDhyan Ferdinand. Dhyan means meditation. Ferdinand means adventure.\nThere are adventures and adventures but no adventure can be compared with the adventure of meditation. It is the ultimate adventure, because you are not going to Everest or to the moon or to Mars, you are going to your innermost bring.\nIt is easy to go to Everest; it is not very difficult to go to the moon now -- soon man will be able to reach other stars. The most arduous journey is to reach your own centre, for the simple reason that you have to go through a great transformation before you can reach the centre. Going to the moon you don't need any transformation, you remain the same person. The people who went to the moon remained the same people, no transformation. Yes, they collected a few stones and rocks and came back. They were just the same, no 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nchange happened in them. It cannot happen that way. It was a technical phenomenon, something on the outside. But going in is a non-technical phenomenon. No scientific device can help you. You have to learn a new style of life.\nMind knows how to think; you will have to know how not to think. Mind knows how to go on creating, manufacturing more and more noise, words upon words, theories, philosophies, ideologies -- it is very skilful in that. It is a factory which goes on creating abstractions. You will have to learn how to stop this constant flow of words, thoughts, concepts, dreams, desires. Mind knows how to be ambitious; you will have to learn how not to be ambitious. Mind is always on some ego trip; you will have to learn how not to be on an ego trip.\nThis is a great transformation. So much is involved in it that you will be born anew, you will have a new life if you go through all this transformation; that's the ultimate adventure. Getting out of the mind is the only challenge worth accepting. Getting beyond mind is the most arduous but the most beautiful journey too, because it is through this journey that you come back home.\nEvery other journey takes you away from yourself, farther and farther away, this is the only journey that brings you home. And what we are really searching for is the home, the source -- because the source is also the goal and it is only in finding the home that one can relax and be at ease and enjoy and dance and sing and create.\nYour name also means journey, venture, adventurous life. It is a beautiful name -\n- it exactly defines meditation. Saroja means a lotus flower.\nThe lotus does two things: one, it arises out of mud, and two, it floats on the water but remains untouched by the water. And both these things are very significant for a sannyasin.\nUnless we know our consciousness we are nothing but mud. That is the meaning of the word 'adam'; adam means mud, earth -- because the first man was made by god, just as a potter makes a pot, out of mud.\nUnless we know our consciousness we are just mud. Once you know your consciousness the mud is transformed into a lotus, a miracle happens. One could never have thought that this dirty mud would create such a beautiful flower. The lotus is the king of all the flowers, incomparable, unique. And the second thing is that it remains in the water but is untouched by it.\nThat's the quality of a sannyasin, first he has to go beyond the body of mud and become a lotus of consciousness; second he has to live in the world but be untouched by it. He is not to escape from the world.\nI am against the escapist attitude, I am all for the world -- it is a beautiful world. And the people who have been teaching to escape are cowards. They have destroyed much, they have destroyed the whole possibility of humanity turning religious, because they created this idea that unless you go into the mountains, into the desert and you escape from all responsibilities -- your wife, your husband, your children -- you cannot be religious. So people thought, 'This is not for us, at least not now. Right now we have to be in the world and we have to be worldly. God willing, some day, in this life or in some other life, we will also have the possibility of becoming a sannyasin, of going to the desert or to the mountains or moving into a monastery, turning our backs towards the world...' It is because of this ideology of escapist that millions of people have been prevented from being religious.\nI am giving sannyas a totally new meaning, the real meaning that it should have. There is no need to go anywhere. Live here and now, live wherever you are, but live silently, peacefully, centred, grounded, alert, aware. Live like a lotus flower and your life will have all the blessings possible and all the benedictions possible.\nSucheta means awareness, alertness, watchfulness.\nPeople live robot-like, they live mechanically. They live like sleepwalkers, somnambulists; they are not aware of what they are doing, what they are saying, what they are being. A sannyasin has to learn the art of awareness -- that is the most precious treasure, the treasure of all treasures.\nSo three dimensions of awareness have to be learned. First: watch your bodily activities. In walking, be alert about your walking. In talking, be alert about your talking. In listening, be alert about your listening.\nBring your awareness again and again to your bodily acts, whatsoever you are doing -- cleaning the floor or cooking the food or taking a shower. Just watch, as if you are separate; in fact you are separate. In the beginning it is 'as if', soon you will realize it is not 'as if' -- it is the truth: you can watch, you can watch as if you are watching somebody else.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nOnce this watchfulness has settled, then enter into the second dimension: watch your thoughts -- this dimension is more subtle -- your desires, your dreams, and you will be able too because you are separate.\nThe dreams are just passing in front of you the way you watch pictures moving on the TV screen. Mind is just a TV screen, and a very crazy TV screen at that.\nMany channels are working simultaneously -- many stories going simultaneously in all directions. To watch it is the second step. As you become skilful in watching it then try the third dimension, the most subtle: watch your emotions, your moods. That is the subtlest.\nFirst is the body, second the mind, third is the heart -- and when you have become aware of all these three the fourth -- turiya, the fourth -- happens of its own accord. Suddenly, one day, you become aware of awareness itself. And that is the moment when one experiences truth, bliss, peace, god, nirvana -- these are all names for the same experience.\nSangit means music.\nMan can live either in mathematics or in music. Mathematics is mind, music is being. Your being is nothing but a tremendous harmony. It is a multi-\ndimensional harmony: it is harmonious within itself, it is harmonious with the universe; and the universe means many dimensions. It is harmonious with the sun, with the moon, with the stars, with the trees, with the wind, with the rain -- with all that is. There is a bridge of rhythm, but we are too hung up in the head, in the world of mathematics. We are continuously calculating, counting, trying to possess more and more.\nThe mind is never satisfied, it goes on asking for more; and it always remains empty. Whatsoever you give to it simply disappears and is again there asking for more. It is a beggar. It makes a beggar of you because in keeping company with a beggar you become a beggar.\nThe moment you start moving from mathematics to music, from prose to poetry, from mind to being, you start becoming an emperor. Without any empire you start becoming an emperor, because the richness of the inner harmony is such, the light of the inner being is such, the beauty, the sweetness... it is nectar. That's what alchemists have been searching and searching for, for centuries.\nThey were not really searching for what it says they were in the books. That was a facade, a trick, because Christianity was so repressive that it did not allow anybody to function outside the church. The church tried to monopolise everything, no individual search was allowed. And in fact a search can only be individual, it cannot be organised. An organised religion is no more religion, it becomes politics. And it is not strange that the pope became both the religious head and the temporal head. Still... of course, his empire is not very big -- just a small place, the Vatican, only a few square miles -- but he is also a political head.\nThe empire has shrunken very much but still, it is just the tail-end. The elephant is gone but the Polack pope is hanging onto the tail. Only the tail is left, there is nothing much of the elephant anywhere; but still he is a temporal head, he is the head of the state, the state of the Vatican, and he is the head of the church.\nChristianity tried to monopolise everything so deeply that the individual seekers had to hide and work in such a way that nobody came to know what they were doing, so they created this facade of alchemy. It was just a strategy to hide behind. It was just for the masses, to show them that they were doing something with chemicals, that they were trying to transform baser metals into gold. But behind this whole trick they were really searching for the innermost harmony, for\nthe soul. That's what they used to call gold.\nThe ordinary man is a baser metal, when he becomes a Buddha or a Jesus or a Moses or a Mohammed, then he becomes gold. These were just symbols, code words. But this is the real search, the search for the inner nectar, because once you have drunk out of it you become an immortal. Then there is no death; the body dies but not you. And then there is no birth, because once you have known your timelessness, your eternity, you have learned the lesson. There is no need to come back to the school of life again. Then you disappear into the universal bliss.\nThat's what god is all about: the universal bliss, the universal harmony, the celestial music.\n(The last for sannyas is Feroze, a Pakistani, to whom Osho gives the name Anand Bodhisattva.) Anand means bliss. Bodhisattva means a Buddha in the seed.\nEverybody is a Buddha in the seed. The only difference between the Buddha and the one who is not a Buddha is that of manifestation.\nOrdinary human beings are just closed flowers, buds or seeds. They have the potential, the same potential, but they have not tried to make it actual. Once it is actualised your life is bliss. If it is not actualized you are a prison. A seed means thousands of flowers are imprisoned. They want to get out of it, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthey want to sway in the wind, they want to release their fragrance, they want to whisper with the clouds, they want to have a communion with the stars and the sun -- and they are imprisoned in the seed. Hence a seed means misery.\nWhen the seed becomes a tree there is joy and when the tree comes to flowering and fulfilment the tree becomes a Buddha -- that is the meaning of the Buddha. Buddha is not the name of any person; it is a state.\nMohammed is a Buddha and Jesus is a Buddha and Jalaluddin is a Buddha, and Krishna is a Buddha.\nAnybody who has realised his potential, one who has manifested his total being, whose lotus has opened up, is a Buddha. And the difference between us and the Buddhas is not of any quality; essentially we are the same, it is just that we Are asleep. But the person who is asleep can be awakened; in fact only the person who can be awakened can be asleep. They are two poles of the same phenomenon.\nSo one should rejoice that one has the potential to become the ultimate peak of consciousness, of bliss and of truth -- and then one should start working for it. And the work consists of a simple process of meditation, of becoming silent, of resting in one's own being, of withdrawing from unnecessary turmoil, of dropping out of all that is non-essential.\nIf one can discriminate between the non-essential and the essential, then it is not very far away that the lotus, the one-thousand petalled lotus, will open up.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I will be here for about a week.\n-- Good. Much has to be done there in your country -- continue.\n-- Yes. There are very few people there. (Presumably Bodhisattva is referring to sannyasins.)\n-- But still nothing to be worried about. Just a few seeds and the whole country can become a garden. Just go on working. Good!\nIs the Grass Really Greener...?

may be doing something good, at least your intention may be good, but
the result will not be good. Out of an unconscious being, there is no
possibility of any good arising, no virtue is possible, no flowering is
possible.</p><p>The first and the most important thing in life is to become aware of
one's being. The moment you turn in you become aware -- it is a simple
as that. We are focussed on the outside; we have to relax our focussing
on the outside, we have to make our muscles a little flexible so we can
look in. That's what sannyas is all about: a turning in.</p><p>And once you have seen your own inner world you have seen all that is
worth seeing, the most glorious, splendrous phenomenon. And after that
whatsoever you do is right. Each act becomes virtuous and each act has a
beauty, sensitivity, grace. Then life is a dance, a celebration.</p><p>Anand Edgar. Anand means bliss. Edgar means rich.</p><p>A man can possess the whole world and yet can remain poor, a beggar.
And vice versa is also trues a man may not possess anything and yet be
immensely rich. Richness has something to do with inner exploration; it
is not an achievement in the outside world. It is neither money nor
power nor prestige nor respectability; it is bliss, and bliss rises out
of your own being. There is no other way to find it, no other place to
find it.</p><p>One has to learn to dive within one's own depths. It is there where
the source of bliss is and all that is needed is a courageous heart --
that is the other meaning of Edgar, a courageous heart.</p><p>The mind is a coward because it is always calculating, The mind is
always thinking in terms of getting more, risking less, of putting in
less and taking out more. It is always bargaining, it is businesslike.
The heart is a gambler -- and the inner world opens only to the
gamblers.</p><p>One has to be courageous enough to risk all for it. If you cannot
risk, you cannot take the jump into the unknown, you will remain
tethered to the known, you will go on clinging to the known. Although
you know it is misery and nothing else, at least there is one
consolation, that you are familiar with it.</p><p>Courage means dropping the familiar, if it is giving your misery, for
the unknown. Of course you cannot decide what is going to happen through
the unknown; that's the risk. You may fall into greater misery or you
may achieve to bliss -- it is unpredictable, that's why I say it is only
for the gambler.</p><p>Sannyas is a gamble, meditation is a gamble; religion is nothing but
gambling. And all the religions are 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

if you are willing, I am willing too!</p><p>Dhyan Michael. Dhyan means meditation. Michael means godly.</p><p>The only thing that can become a proof for god is meditation. No
other argument can help, no other proof is possible.</p><p>Philosophers have been giving many proofs, but all those proofs are
just stupid. If you look a little bit deeply into them you will find
that their basic assumption is ungrounded. They themselves need proof,
they are not self-evident. For example, the greatest proof that the
philosophers have been giving all over the world is that everything
needs a creator and if this immense universe exists then it must have a
creator. It looks logical but only on the surface; just scratch the
surface and a new problem will arises who created the creator?</p><p>If everything needs a creator then according to the same law the
creator will have to be created by somebody. And the argument seems
stupid, idiotic, because if this god needs another god, then this other
god will need still another god; and you will fall into an infinite
regress. Ultimately you will come to a point where you will have to say
that this is not created by anybody. But then the whole argument is
lost. That was the very first assumption, that everything needs a
creator.</p><p>There is no self-evident proof for god, not through logic -- but yes
there is a way to experience. It is not intellectual, it is existential.
Meditation is an existential way to experience god and all that is
godly. And meditation is a simple process of becoming silent, utterly
silent. When the mind has lost all its nonsense and noise, when the mind
traffic is nil, when the mind has stopped completely, has come to a
standstill, suddenly in that silence you experience a presence that has
always been there within and without, but of which you were not aware
because</p><p>the mind was too noisy; it was impossible to hear the still, small
voice.</p><p>And once you have heard it your life is transformed. Then for the
first time you know the taste of religion.</p><p>And the taste of religion is the taste of neither Christianity nor
Hinduism nor of Judaism nor of Mohammedanism; the taste of religion is
simply the taste of religiousness. It has nothing to do with all those
cults and sects and dogmas and churches, synagogues, temples, mosques --
it has nothing to do with these.</p><p>This is sheer politics played in the name of religion.</p><p>When you have experienced just a dewdrop of true religiousness
through silence, you don't belong to any religion, although for the
first time you are religious.</p><p>I teach a religionless religiousness -- and that is the need of today
and of all the tomorrows that are going to follow. The old kind of
religion is outdated; its time is finished, in fact it has been living a
posthumous kind of existence for centuries. It is dead already, we are
only carrying a corpse and it is stinking.</p><p>Meditation is the only way to experience god, to experience religion.
You cannot get it from the Bible, from the Gita, from the Koran, from
the Talmud -- no words, no scriptures can give it to you. Only silence
is able to receive god, is able to become pregnant with god. And that is
the greatest ecstasy in life -- to be pregnant with god, to carry god in
your very belly, in your very heartbeat, in your breathing, to feel him
everywhere, in everybody!</p><p>Dhyan Ferdinand. Dhyan means meditation. Ferdinand means
adventure.</p><p>There are adventures and adventures but no adventure can be compared
with the adventure of meditation. It is the ultimate adventure, because
you are not going to Everest or to the moon or to Mars, you are going to
your innermost bring.</p><p>It is easy to go to Everest; it is not very difficult to go to the
moon now -- soon man will be able to reach other stars. The most arduous
journey is to reach your own centre, for the simple reason that you have
to go through a great transformation before you can reach the centre.
Going to the moon you don't need any transformation, you remain the same
person. The people who went to the moon remained the same people, no
transformation. Yes, they collected a few stones and rocks and came
back. They were just the same, no 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

technical phenomenon, something on the outside. But going in is a
non-technical phenomenon. No scientific device can help you. You have to
learn a new style of life.</p><p>Mind knows how to think; you will have to know how not to think. Mind
knows how to go on creating, manufacturing more and more noise, words
upon words, theories, philosophies, ideologies -- it is very skilful in
that. It is a factory which goes on creating abstractions. You will have
to learn how to stop this constant flow of words, thoughts, concepts,
dreams, desires. Mind knows how to be ambitious; you will have to learn
how not to be ambitious. Mind is always on some ego trip; you will have
to learn how not to be on an ego trip.</p><p>This is a great transformation. So much is involved in it that you
will be born anew, you will have a new life if you go through all this
transformation; that's the ultimate adventure. Getting out of the mind
is the only challenge worth accepting. Getting beyond mind is the most
arduous but the most beautiful journey too, because it is through this
journey that you come back home.</p><p>Every other journey takes you away from yourself, farther and farther
away, this is the only journey that brings you home. And what we are
really searching for is the home, the source -- because the source is
also the goal and it is only in finding the home that one can relax and
be at ease and enjoy and dance and sing and create.</p><p>Your name also means journey, venture, adventurous life. It is a
beautiful name -</p><p>- it exactly defines meditation. Saroja means a lotus flower.</p><p>The lotus does two things: one, it arises out of mud, and two, it
floats on the water but remains untouched by the water. And both these
things are very significant for a sannyasin.</p><p>Unless we know our consciousness we are nothing but mud. That is the
meaning of the word 'adam'; adam means mud, earth -- because the first
man was made by god, just as a potter makes a pot, out of mud.</p><p>Unless we know our consciousness we are just mud. Once you know your
consciousness the mud is transformed into a lotus, a miracle happens.
One could never have thought that this dirty mud would create such a
beautiful flower. The lotus is the king of all the flowers,
incomparable, unique. And the second thing is that it remains in the
water but is untouched by it.</p><p>That's the quality of a sannyasin, first he has to go beyond the body
of mud and become a lotus of consciousness; second he has to live in the
world but be untouched by it. He is not to escape from the world.</p><p>I am against the escapist attitude, I am all for the world -- it is a
beautiful world. And the people who have been teaching to escape are
cowards. They have destroyed much, they have destroyed the whole
possibility of humanity turning religious, because they created this
idea that unless you go into the mountains, into the desert and you
escape from all responsibilities -- your wife, your husband, your
children -- you cannot be religious. So people thought, 'This is not for
us, at least not now. Right now we have to be in the world and we have
to be worldly. God willing, some day, in this life or in some other
life, we will also have the possibility of becoming a sannyasin, of
going to the desert or to the mountains or moving into a monastery,
turning our backs towards the world...' It is because of this ideology
of escapist that millions of people have been prevented from being
religious.</p><p>I am giving sannyas a totally new meaning, the real meaning that it
should have. There is no need to go anywhere. Live here and now, live
wherever you are, but live silently, peacefully, centred, grounded,
alert, aware. Live like a lotus flower and your life will have all the
blessings possible and all the benedictions possible.</p><p>Sucheta means awareness, alertness, watchfulness.</p><p>People live robot-like, they live mechanically. They live like
sleepwalkers, somnambulists; they are not aware of what they are doing,
what they are saying, what they are being. A sannyasin has to learn the
art of awareness -- that is the most precious treasure, the treasure of
all treasures.</p><p>So three dimensions of awareness have to be learned. First: watch
your bodily activities. In walking, be alert about your walking. In
talking, be alert about your talking. In listening, be alert about your
listening.</p><p>Bring your awareness again and again to your bodily acts, whatsoever
you are doing -- cleaning the floor or cooking the food or taking a
shower. Just watch, as if you are separate; in fact you are separate. In
the beginning it is 'as if', soon you will realize it is not 'as if' --
it is the truth: you can watch, you can watch as if you are watching
somebody else.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

dimension: watch your thoughts -- this dimension is more subtle -- your
desires, your dreams, and you will be able too because you are
separate.</p><p>The dreams are just passing in front of you the way you watch
pictures moving on the TV screen. Mind is just a TV screen, and a very
crazy TV screen at that.</p><p>Many channels are working simultaneously -- many stories going
simultaneously in all directions. To watch it is the second step. As you
become skilful in watching it then try the third dimension, the most
subtle: watch your emotions, your moods. That is the subtlest.</p><p>First is the body, second the mind, third is the heart -- and when
you have become aware of all these three the fourth -- turiya, the
fourth -- happens of its own accord. Suddenly, one day, you become aware
of awareness itself. And that is the moment when one experiences truth,
bliss, peace, god, nirvana -- these are all names for the same
experience.</p><p>Sangit means music.</p><p>Man can live either in mathematics or in music. Mathematics is mind,
music is being. Your being is nothing but a tremendous harmony. It is a
multi-</p><p>dimensional harmony: it is harmonious within itself, it is harmonious
with the universe; and the universe means many dimensions. It is
harmonious with the sun, with the moon, with the stars, with the trees,
with the wind, with the rain -- with all that is. There is a bridge of
rhythm, but we are too hung up in the head, in the world of mathematics.
We are continuously calculating, counting, trying to possess more and
more.</p><p>The mind is never satisfied, it goes on asking for more; and it
always remains empty. Whatsoever you give to it simply disappears and is
again there asking for more. It is a beggar. It makes a beggar of you
because in keeping company with a beggar you become a beggar.</p><p>The moment you start moving from mathematics to music, from prose to
poetry, from mind to being, you start becoming an emperor. Without any
empire you start becoming an emperor, because the richness of the inner
harmony is such, the light of the inner being is such, the beauty, the
sweetness... it is nectar. That's what alchemists have been searching
and searching for, for centuries.</p><p>They were not really searching for what it says they were in the
books. That was a facade, a trick, because Christianity was so
repressive that it did not allow anybody to function outside the church.
The church tried to monopolise everything, no individual search was
allowed. And in fact a search can only be individual, it cannot be
organised. An organised religion is no more religion, it becomes
politics. And it is not strange that the pope became both the religious
head and the temporal head. Still... of course, his empire is not very
big -- just a small place, the Vatican, only a few square miles -- but
he is also a political head.</p><p>The empire has shrunken very much but still, it is just the tail-end.
The elephant is gone but the Polack pope is hanging onto the tail. Only
the tail is left, there is nothing much of the elephant anywhere; but
still he is a temporal head, he is the head of the state, the state of
the Vatican, and he is the head of the church.</p><p>Christianity tried to monopolise everything so deeply that the
individual seekers had to hide and work in such a way that nobody came
to know what they were doing, so they created this facade of alchemy. It
was just a strategy to hide behind. It was just for the masses, to show
them that they were doing something with chemicals, that they were
trying to transform baser metals into gold. But behind this whole trick
they were really searching for the innermost harmony, for</p><p>the soul. That's what they used to call gold.</p><p>The ordinary man is a baser metal, when he becomes a Buddha or a
Jesus or a Moses or a Mohammed, then he becomes gold. These were just
symbols, code words. But this is the real search, the search for the
inner nectar, because once you have drunk out of it you become an
immortal. Then there is no death; the body dies but not you. And then
there is no birth, because once you have known your timelessness, your
eternity, you have learned the lesson. There is no need to come back to
the school of life again. Then you disappear into the universal
bliss.</p><p>That's what god is all about: the universal bliss, the universal
harmony, the celestial music.</p><p>(The last for sannyas is Feroze, a Pakistani, to whom Osho gives the
name Anand Bodhisattva.) Anand means bliss. Bodhisattva means a Buddha
in the seed.</p><p>Everybody is a Buddha in the seed. The only difference between the
Buddha and the one who is not a Buddha is that of manifestation.</p><p>Ordinary human beings are just closed flowers, buds or seeds. They
have the potential, the same potential, but they have not tried to make
it actual. Once it is actualised your life is bliss. If it is not
actualized you are a prison. A seed means thousands of flowers are
imprisoned. They want to get out of it, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

they want to whisper with the clouds, they want to have a communion with
the stars and the sun -- and they are imprisoned in the seed. Hence a
seed means misery.</p><p>When the seed becomes a tree there is joy and when the tree comes to
flowering and fulfilment the tree becomes a Buddha -- that is the
meaning of the Buddha. Buddha is not the name of any person; it is a
state.</p><p>Mohammed is a Buddha and Jesus is a Buddha and Jalaluddin is a
Buddha, and Krishna is a Buddha.</p><p>Anybody who has realised his potential, one who has manifested his
total being, whose lotus has opened up, is a Buddha. And the difference
between us and the Buddhas is not of any quality; essentially we are the
same, it is just that we Are asleep. But the person who is asleep can be
awakened; in fact only the person who can be awakened can be asleep.
They are two poles of the same phenomenon.</p><p>So one should rejoice that one has the potential to become the
ultimate peak of consciousness, of bliss and of truth -- and then one
should start working for it. And the work consists of a simple process
of meditation, of becoming silent, of resting in one's own being, of
withdrawing from unnecessary turmoil, of dropping out of all that is
non-essential.</p><p>If one can discriminate between the non-essential and the essential,
then it is not very far away that the lotus, the one-thousand petalled
lotus, will open up.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I will be here for about a week.</p><p>-- Good. Much has to be done there in your country -- continue.</p><p>-- Yes. There are very few people there. (Presumably Bodhisattva is
referring to sannyasins.)</p><p>-- But still nothing to be worried about. Just a few seeds and the
whole country can become a garden. Just go on working.
